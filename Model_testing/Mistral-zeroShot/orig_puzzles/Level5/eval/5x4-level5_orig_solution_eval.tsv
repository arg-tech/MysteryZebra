Lv5-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 different symbols (let's use A, B, C, D).

2. We know the favorite beverages, food, jobs, nationalities, and sports, so we can assign each category to a row and fill in the corresponding symbols. For example, let's assign the first row to beverages, the second row to food, the third row to jobs, the fourth row to nationalities, and the fifth row to sports.

3. From point 13, we know that the pakistani is on the right of the electrician. This means the electrician must be either A or B (since the far right is D). Let's assume the electrician is A. This means the pakistani is C or D.

4. From point 11, we know that the german is on the right of the turkish. Since the turkish is on the far left (D), the german must be C or B. But from point 15, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the far right, so the german cannot be B. Therefore, the german is C.

5. Now we know the electrician is A, the pakistani is C, and the german is C. From point 10, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the russian. Since the russian is D, the surfing person must be A, B, or C. But from point 3, we know that the musician is on the right of the electrician (A), so the surfing person cannot be A. Therefore, the surfing person is either B or C.

6. From point 14, we know that the turkish is on the far left (D). From point 11, we know that the german is on the right of the turkish, so the german is C. Since the electrician is A and the german is C, the surfing person must be B.

7. Now we know the electrician is A, the pakistani is C, the german is C, and the surfing person is B. From point 12, we know that the musician is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the german (C) is drinking hot-chocolate (from point 9), the musician cannot be C or D (since the far left is D). Therefore, the musician must be A or B. But from point 3, we know that the musician is on the right of the electrician (A), so the musician is B.

8. From point 8, we know that the project-manager is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the german (C) is the dressmaker (from point 4), the project-manager is either A or B. But from point 15, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the far right, so the project-manager cannot be A. Therefore, the project-manager is B.

9. Now we know the electrician is A, the pakistani is C, the german is C, the surfing person is B, and the project-manager is B. From point 4, we know that the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the surfing person (B) is not the person playing ice-hockey (since B is surfing), the person drinking juice must be A, C, or D. But from point 3, we know that the musician (B) is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the german (C) is drinking hot-chocolate (from point 9), the person drinking juice cannot be C (since C is on the left of B). Therefore, the person drinking juice is A or D. But from point 2, we know that the person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the surfing person (B) is not the person playing ice-hockey, the person eating pepper must be A, C, or D. But from point 6, we know that the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating pepper. Since the german (C) is eating nectarine (from point 9), the person eating pepper cannot be C. Therefore, the person eating pepper is A or D. But from point 7, we know that the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating cauliflower. Since the german (C) is eating nectarine, the person eating cauliflower must be A, B, or D. But from point 6, we know that the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pepper is A (from the previous step), the person eating cauliflower must be B or D. But from point 5, we know that the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the surfing person (B) is not the person playing sailing, the person eating pepper must be on the left of the person playing sailing. Therefore, the person playing sailing is D.

10. Now we know the electrician is A, the pakistani is C, the german is C, the surfing person is B, the project-manager is B, the person drinking juice is A, the person eating pepper is A, the person eating cauliflower is B, and the person playing sailing is D. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different favorite beverages: almond-milk, hot-chocolate, juice, soy-milk. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person eating nectarine (from point 9), the person drinking almond-milk must be D, since D is the only one left. Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is A.

11. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different types of food: broccoli, cauliflower, nectarine, pepper. Since the person eating nectarine is B and the person eating pepper is A, the person eating broccoli must be C, since C is the only one left. Therefore, the person eating cauliflower is D.

12. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different jobs: dressmaker, electrician, musician, project-manager. Since the electrician is A, the musician is B, the project-manager is B, and the dressmaker is C, the person with the remaining job (dressmaker) is D.

13. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different nationalities: german, pakistani, russian, turkish. Since the german is C, the pakistani is C, the russian is not the person playing sailing (D), and the turkish is D, the person with the remaining nationality (russian) is A.

14. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different sports: ice-hockey, sailing, snowboarding, surfing. Since the person playing ice-hockey is not the surfing person (B), the person playing ice-hockey is A, since A is the only one left. Therefore, the person playing snowboarding is C, and the person playing surfing is D.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D, from left to right.

2. Let's start with the sports. Since the librarian (L) does volleyball (V), L must be in the fourth position (D).

3. Now, let's place the snowboarder (S) and the climber (C). From rule 2, S is not in the first position, so S can be B or D. From rule 4, S is not next to the designer (D), so S cannot be D. Therefore, S is B. C can be A or C. From rule 8, C is not next to the person who does video-games (VG), so C cannot be A. Therefore, C is D.

4. Now, let's place the rower (R). From rule 11, the person eating radish (Rd) is to the right of C, so Rd cannot be A or B. Therefore, Rd is D.

5. Now, let's place the accountant (A). From rule 5, A is to the left of the person drinking 7up (7U). Since 7U cannot be D (as A is to its right), 7U can only be A or B. From rule 13, the person drinking soy-milk (SM) is to the left of VG. Since VG cannot be A (as A is to its right), VG can only be B or D. If VG is B, then 7U must be A. If VG is D, then 7U must be B. In both cases, A is to the left of 7U. From rule 12, A is between magic-tricks (MT) and C (climber). If A is B, then MT must be A and C must be D. If A is A, then MT must be D and C must be A.

6. Now, let's place the designer (D). From rule 14, A is to the left of D and D is eating an apple (Ap).

7. Now, let's place the architect (Ar). From rule 9, Ar is to the right of VG. Since VG is not A (as A is to the left of Ar), VG is B. Therefore, Ar is C.

8. Now, let's place the hobbies. From rule 6, the person doing card-games (CG) is on the far left or far right. Since CG is not A (as A is doing magic-tricks), CG must be D. From rule 7, the person doing photography (Ph) is to the right of CG. Therefore, Ph is B. From rule 10, the person doing video-games (VG) is to the right of the person eating carrot (Cr). Since Cr is not A (as A is eating an apple), Cr is B or D. If Cr is B, then VG is D. If Cr is D, then VG is B. In both cases, VG is to the right of Cr.

9. Now, let's place the food. Since Cr is not A (as A is eating an apple), Cr is B or D. If Cr is B, then the person eating carrot is B and the person eating radish (Rd) is D. If Cr is D, then the person eating carrot is D and the person eating radish is B. In both cases, Rd is to the right of Cr.

10. Now, let's place the beverages. Since 7U is not D (as D is drinking soy-milk), 7U is A or B. If Cr is B, then 7U is A and the person drinking soy-milk is B. If Cr is D, then 7U is B and the person drinking soy-milk is A. In both cases, the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of VG.

11. The only remaining beverage is water (W). Since W cannot be A (as A is drinking 7up), W cannot be B (as B is drinking soy-milk), and W cannot be D (as D is drinking radish), W must be C.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person watching animation movies (A) since we know they eat kale (K) and are a fan of country (C). So, we can place them in the first row, first column (1,1).

2. Since A is watching animation movies, they are also A. Now we know that K = A and C = A.

3. Since A is on the left of the fan of funk (F), F cannot be in the first column. So, F must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

4. Since A is a fan of country (C), and we know that F is not in the first column, F cannot be in the second column because the fan of blues (B) is on the left of F. So, F must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

5. Since A is in the first row, and the person watching drama movies (D) is on the left of B, D must be in the second row.

6. Since D is in the second row, the person who's hobby is puzzles (P) must be in the second row and between D and the person who's hobby is dancing (Dn). So, P is in the second row, second or third column.

7. Since P is in the second row, Dn must be in the fourth or fifth row.

8. Since D is in the second row and Dn is not in the second row, Dn must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row.

9. Since Dn is not in the second column (because P is there), Dn must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row and third or fourth column.

10. Since F is not in the first column, and the person eating lemon (L) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (Lc), L cannot be in the second column. So, L must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

11. Since L is not in the second column, and the person eating kiwi (Ki) is on the right of the person eating spinach (S), Ki cannot be in the first column. So, Ki must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

12. Since Ki is not in the first column, and the person who's hobby is card-games (Cg) is either to the left or right of Ki, Cg cannot be in the first column. So, Cg must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

13. Since F is not in the first column, and F is on the right of the person eating spinach (S), S cannot be in the first column. So, S must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

14. Since S is not in the first column, and L is somewhere to the right of Lc, L cannot be in the second column. So, L must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

15. Since L is not in the first column, and Ki is on the right of S, Ki cannot be in the second column. So, Ki must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

16. Since Cg is not in the first column, and Ki is either to the left or right of Cg, Cg cannot be in the third column because it would be between Ki and S, but we know S is not in the third column. So, Cg must be in the second, fourth, or fifth column.

17. Since Cg is not in the first column, and F is on the right of S, F cannot be in the second column. So, F must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

18. Since F is not in the first column, and D is in the second row, D cannot be in the third column because it would be between F and P, but we know F is not in the second column. So, D must be in the first or fourth column.

19. Since D is not in the second column, and P is in the second row, P cannot be in the third column because it would be between D and Dn, but we know D is not in the third column. So, P must be in the first or fourth column.

20. Since P is not in the second column, and Dn is not in the second row, Dn cannot be in the third row because it would be between P and S, but we know P is not in the third column. So, Dn must be in the fourth or fifth row.

21. Since Dn is not in the second row, and L is somewhere to the right of Lc, L cannot be in the fourth row. So, L must be in the third or fifth row.

22. Since L is not in the fourth row, and Ki is on the right of S, Ki cannot be in the fourth column. So, Ki must be in the second, third, or fifth column.

23. Since Ki is not in the second column, and Cg is not in the third column, Cg must be in the fifth column.

24. Since Cg is in the fifth column, Ki must be in the second column.

25. Since Ki is in the second column, S must be in the fourth column.

26. Since S is in the fourth column, L cannot be in the third row because it would be between S and Lc, but we know S is not in the third column. So, L must be in the fifth row.

27. Since L is in the fifth row, Lc must be in the third row.

28. Since Lc is in the third row, Dn must be in the fourth row.

29. Since Dn is in the fourth row, D must be in the first row.

30. Since D is in the first row, P must be in the fourth column.

Lv5-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 jobs, 4 movie-genres, 4 music-genres, 4 nationalities, and 4 sports, we can assign one of each to each row.

2. From point 11, the person who's sport is baseball must be in an even position. Since there are 5 people to the left and 3 people to the right, the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 6th position. Let's assign baseball to row 3.

3. From point 10, the Spanish is the person watching horror movies. Since there are 3 people to the left and 3 people to the right, the Spanish must be in the 4th position. Let's assign horror to row 4.

4. From point 14, the person who's sport is basketball is the fan of folk. Since there are 3 people to the left and 3 people to the right, the person who's sport is basketball must be in the 2nd position. Let's assign basketball to row 2.

5. From point 9, the photographer is the person who's sport is baseball. So, the photographer is in the 3rd position. Let's assign photography to row 3.

6. From point 8, the photographer is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the photographer is in the 3rd position, the person watching documentary movies must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's assign documentary to row 1.

7. From point 7, the person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person who's sport is basketball is in the 2nd position, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in the 4th position. Let's assign biathlon to row 4.

8. From point 6, the freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person who's sport is biathlon is in the 4th position, the freelancer must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. Let's assign freelancer to row 1.

9. From point 13, the fan of country is between the freelancer and the fan of reggae. Since the freelancer is in the 1st position and the fan of reggae must be in the 5th position (as there are 4 people to the left and 3 people to the right), the fan of country must be in the 2nd position. Let's assign country to row 2.

10. From point 12, the person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic must be in the 5th position (as there are 4 people to the left and 3 people to the right), the person watching documentary movies must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. However, we already assigned documentary to row 1, so the person watching documentary movies must be in row 2. Let's assign the mechanic to row 5.

11. From point 5, the videographer is somewhere to the right of the British. Since the British must be in the 2nd position (as there are 3 people to the left and 3 people to the right), the videographer must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. However, we already assigned videography to row 3, so the British must be in the 1st position. Let's assign the British to row 1.

12. From point 3, the videographer is on the left of the Japanese. Since the British is in the 1st position and the Japanese must be in the 4th or 5th position, the Japanese must be in the 4th position. Let's assign Japan to row 4.

13. From point 1, the person watching comedy movies is between the person who's sport is swimming and the freelancer. Since the freelancer is in the 1st position and the person who's sport is swimming must be in the 5th position, the person watching comedy movies must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. However, we already assigned comedy to row 1, so the person watching comedy movies must be in row 2. Let's assign comedy to row 2.

14. From point 4, the person watching scientific movies is on the far left or far right. Since we already assigned documentary, comedy, horror, baseball, and biathlon, the only remaining options for scientific movies are row 1 (far left) or row 5 (far right). However, from point 12, the person watching documentary movies is in the 2nd position, so the person watching scientific movies must be in the 5th position. Let's assign scientific to row 5.

15. From point 13, the fan of reggae is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in the 2nd position, the fan of reggae must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. However, we already assigned reggae to row 3, so the person watching comedy movies must be in the 4th position. Let's assign reggae to row 4.

16. From point 11, the person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position. Since we already assigned swimming to row 5, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the 1st position. Let's assign swimming to row 1.

Lv5-5x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so each row represents a person.

2. From point 11, the Spanish is watching romance movies, so we can fill the Nationality column for the 4th row with ""Spanish"" and the Movie-Genre column for the 4th row with ""Romance"".

3. From point 3, the Italian is in an even position, so they must be in the 2nd or 4th row. Since the Spanish is already in the 4th row, the Italian must be in the 2nd row. We can fill the Nationality column for the 2nd row with ""Italian"".

4. From point 6, the owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the Spanish (cat owner) is in the 4th row, the hamster owner must be in one of the first three rows. Let's assume the hamster owner is in the 1st row for now. We can fill the Pet column for the 1st row with ""Hamster"".

5. From point 5, the person driving the bike is on the left of the American. Since the American is in the 5th (far right) row, the bike driver must be in one of the first four rows. Let's assume the bike driver is in the 3rd row for now. We can fill the Transport column for the 3rd row with ""Bike"".

6. From point 10, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far right. Since the American is in the 5th row, the jet-ski driver must be in the 5th row. We can fill the Transport column for the 5th row with ""Jet-ski"".

7. From point 9, the owner of the rat is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike driver is in the 3rd row, the rat owner must be in the 4th or 5th row. Since the Spanish (rat owner) is in the 4th row, the jet-ski driver (rat owner) cannot be in the 5th row. So, the rat owner must be in the 4th row. We can fill the Pet column for the 4th row with ""Rat"".

8. From point 8, the person driving the bike is between the person driving the subway and the fan of dubstep. Since the bike driver is in the 3rd row and the subway driver is not yet determined, the fan of dubstep must be in the 4th or 5th row. Since the rat owner (fan of dubstep) is in the 4th row, the subway driver must be in the 3rd row. We can fill the Transport column for the 3rd row with ""Subway"".

9. From point 4, the owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is not yet determined, the dog owner could be in any of the last three rows. Let's assume the dog owner is in the 5th row for now. We can fill the Pet column for the 5th row with ""Dog"".

10. From point 7, the person driving the subway is between the person watching disaster movies and the person watching epic movies. Since the subway driver is in the 3rd row and the disaster movie watcher is not yet determined, the epic movie watcher must be in the 4th or 5th row. Since the dog owner (epic movie watcher) is in the 5th row, the disaster movie watcher must be in the 3rd or 4th row.

11. From point 12, the fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie is not yet determined, the fan of blues could be in any of the last two rows. Let's assume the fan of blues is in the 4th row for now. We can fill the Music-Genre column for the 4th row with ""Blues"".

12. From point 13, the person watching epic movies is between the fan of punk and the person watching disaster movies. Since the epic movie watcher is in the 5th row and the fan of punk is not yet determined, the fan of punk must be in the 3rd row. The disaster movie watcher must be in the 2nd row. We can fill the Movie-Genre column for the 2nd row with ""Disaster"" and the Music-Genre column for the 3rd row with ""Punk"".

13. Now we have filled all the columns for all the rows. The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the numbers 1 to 4 in the first row.

2. We know the favorite beverages, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and nationalities. We can fill in these categories with the given options.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 5, we know the Turkish is to the left of the Colombian. So, the Turkish must be in position 1 or 2. If the Turkish was in position 1, the Colombian would have to be in position 4, but that would mean the Turkish is watching thriller movies, which contradicts rule 9. So, the Turkish must be in position 2, and the Colombian must be in position 4.

4. From rule 1, the Turkish is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. So, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 3 or 4. But if the soy-milk drinker was in position 3, the Turkish would be watching thriller movies, which contradicts rule 9. So, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 4.

5. From rule 6, the person watching martial-arts movies is the fan of trance. So, the martial-arts watcher must be in position 3, and the trance fan is in position 2 (since the Turkish is in position 2).

6. From rule 11, the Colombian is the person watching western movies. So, the Colombian must be in position 4.

7. From rule 10, the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the Polish. Since the Turkish (who is watching thriller movies) is in position 2, the Polish must be in position 1.

8. From rule 8, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the Colombian. So, the lemonade drinker must be in position 3 or 4. But if the lemonade drinker was in position 3, the Colombian would be in position 1, which contradicts rule 7. So, the lemonade drinker must be in position 3.

9. From rule 14, the fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the gardener is in position 4 (the Colombian), the blues fan must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But if the blues fan was in position 1, the gardener would be in position 2, which contradicts rule 15. So, the blues fan must be in position 2.

10. From rule 13, the fan of electronic is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the traveler is not yet determined, we can't place the electronic fan yet.

11. From rule 15, the gardener is somewhere to the right of the trance fan (who is in position 2). So, the gardener must be in position 3 or 4. But if the gardener was in position 3, the blues fan would be in position 1, which contradicts rule 9. So, the gardener must be in position 4.

12. From rule 16, the trance fan is the person who's hobby is hiking. So, the hiker is in position 2.

13. Now we know the positions of the Turkish, Colombian, hiker (trance fan), and gardener (gardener). The only hobby left is filmmaking. Since filmmaking is neither to the left nor right of the hot-chocolate drinker (from rule 3), the filmmaker must be the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, the filmmaker is in position 1.

14. From rule 12, the trance fan is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the trance fan is in position 2 and the Turkish (who is watching thriller movies) is in position 2, the trance fan must be to the left of the Turkish. But the trance fan is the hiker, so the hiker must be to the left of the Turkish. This means the Turkish is in position 3 and the hiker is in position 2.

15. Now we know the positions of the Turkish, hiker, Colombian, gardener, and filmmaker. The only hobby left is traveling. Since the traveler is on the right of the electronic fan (from rule 13), the electronic fan must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But if the electronic fan was in position 1, the traveler would be in position 4, which contradicts rule 10. So, the electronic fan must be in position 2 or 3. But if the electronic fan was in position 3, the traveler would be in position 4, which contradicts rule 10. So, the electronic fan must be in position 2.

16. Now we know the positions of the Turkish, hiker, Colombian, gardener, filmmaker, and electronic fan. The only hobby left is traveling. Since the traveler is on the right of the electronic fan (who is in position 2), the traveler must be in position 3 or 4. But if the traveler was in position 3, the lemonade drinker would be in position 1, which contradicts rule 8. So, the traveler must be in position 4.

17. Now we know the positions of all people. The final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |

   | Nationality   | colombian   | turkish    |             | polish      |

   We can fill in the missing movie-genre for the Polish since the Polish is to the left of the person watching thriller movies (who is the Turkish). So, the Polish must be watching western movies.

   So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |
   | Beverage      | filmmaker   | hiker      | lemonade    | traveler   |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking  | hiking     | gardening   | traveling   |

   | Music-Genre   | electronic  | trance     | blues       |             |
   | Nationality   | colombian   | turkish    |             | polish      |

   We can fill in the missing movie-genre for the Polish since the Polish is to the left of the person watching thriller movies (who is the Turkish). So, the Polish must be watching western movies.

   So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |
   | Beverage      | filmmaker   | hiker      | lemonade    | traveler   |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking  | hiking     | gardening   | traveling   |
   | Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| thriller   | western     | western     |
   | Music-Genre   | electronic  | trance     | blues       |             |
   | Nationality   | colombian   | turkish    |             | polish      |

   We have our final solution. The table is surrounded by '#############' for clarity:

   |############| filmmaker | hiker     | lemonade  | traveler   |
   |############| filmmaking| hiking    | gardening  | traveling   |
   |############| martial-arts| thriller  | western    | western     |

55. From point 7, the person driving the van is somewhere to"	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From point 10, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left, so Hobby[1] = skydiving.

3. From point 11, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since skydiving is on the far left, baking can't be on the far left, so Hobby[3] = baking. Let's assume Hobby[2] = video-games (since it's between skydiving and the german according to point 7). This leaves Hobby[4] = woodworking or something else.

4. From point 7, the person who's hobby is video-games is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the german. So, Hobby[2] = video-games, Hobby[1] = skydiving, and Hobby[3] = baking, which leaves Hobby[4] = woodworking.

5. From point 12, the person watching epic movies is the American. Since we know the hobbies, this means Nationality[2] = American.

6. From point 6, the British is the architect. Since we know the nationalities, this means Job[3] = architect and Nationality[1] = British.

7. From point 2, the person watching thriller movies is on the far right. Since we know the nationalities and jobs, this means Movie-Genre[4] = thriller and Nationality[4] = something else (not American or British).

8. From point 4, the analyst is in an odd position. Since we know the nationalities and jobs, this means Job[1] = analyst and Job[3] is filled (architect). This leaves Job[2] and Job[4]. Since the analyst is in an odd position, Job[1] = analyst, Job[3] = architect, and Job[2] or Job[4] must be even.

9. From point 9, the musician is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since we know the nationalities, jobs, and movie genres, this means Movie-Genre[1] = action and Job[4] = musician (since the only remaining job is even).

10. From point 3, the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the British. Since we know the nationalities, this means Transport[3] = helicopter and Nationality[3] = something else (not British).

11. From point 4, the person driving the car is the American. Since we know the nationalities, this means Transport[2] = car and Nationality[2] = American.

12. From point 13, the german is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we know the nationalities and transports, this means Transport[4] = motorbike and Nationality[4] = German.

13. From point 8, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since we know the nationalities, jobs, movie genres, and transports, this means Movie-Genre[3] = epic and Transport[1] = bike or Transport[4] = motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the German, Transport[4] = motorbike and Transport[1] = bike.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From rule 16, the designer (Pakistani) is person D.

3. From rule 15, the person watching satire movies is either A or B, but not D (since the designer is to the right of the satire watcher). Let's assume the satire watcher is A.

4. From rule 17, the person eating cabbage is either B or C, but not D (since the satire watcher is to the left or right of the cabbage eater). Let's assume the cabbage eater is B.

5. From rule 3, the radish eater is to the left of the cabbage eater (B), so the radish eater is A.

6. From rule 8, the owner of the turtle is either C or D, but not A (since the radish eater is to the left of the turtle owner). Let's assume the turtle owner is C.

7. From rule 14, the owner of the fish is D.

8. From rule 13, the electrician is either A or B, but not C or D (since the electrician is to the left or right of the hamster owner, and we know the positions of A, B, C, and D). Let's assume the electrician is A.

9. From rule 11, the pakistani (designer) is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the designer is D and the guinea-pig owner is B (from rule 3), the guinea-pig owner cannot be the pilot (since the pakistani is to the left of the pilot from rule 11). So, the pilot must be A or C.

10. From rule 10, the coach is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig owner is B, the coach cannot be A or D. So, the coach is C (since the coach is Mexican from rule 7).

11. Now we know the pilot is A or C, but not D (since the pakistani is to the left of the pilot). From rule 12, the pakistani is to the left of the person eating spinach. Since the spinach eater cannot be D (since the designer is D), the spinach eater must be A or C. But A is the satire watcher and the designer, so the spinach eater must be C.

12. Now we know the pilot is A and the spinach eater is C. From rule 11, the pakistani is to the left of C. So, the pakistani is B.

13. From rule 9, the zombie movie watcher is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (B). Since the pilot is A and the designer is D, the zombie movie watcher cannot be A or D. So, the zombie movie watcher is C or B. But B is the guinea-pig owner, so the zombie movie watcher is C.

14. From rule 6, the pilot is on the left or right of the zombie movie watcher (C). Since the pilot is A and the designer is D, the pilot cannot be D. So, the pilot is to the right of the zombie movie watcher (C).

15. From rule 4, the comedy movie watcher is to the left of the designer (D). Since the satire watcher is A and the zombie movie watcher is C, the comedy movie watcher cannot be A or C. So, the comedy movie watcher is B.

16. From rule 5, the hamster owner is somewhere to the right of the radish eater (A). Since the turtle owner is C and the fish owner is D, the hamster owner cannot be D. So, the hamster owner is B.

17. From rule 2, the designer (D) is to the left of the American. Since the American cannot be D (since the designer is Pakistani), the American must be A, B, or C. But A is the satire watcher, B is the guinea-pig owner, and C is the zombie movie watcher. So, the American must be B.

18. From rule 1, the food is either cabbage, pomegranate, radish, or spinach. Since we know the positions of the people, we can now assign the food based on the clues given. For example, we know the radish eater is A, the cabbage eater is B, and the spinach eater is C. So, the remaining food (pomegranate) must be for the American (B).

Since the hamster is to the left of the owner of classical, and the horse is to the right of the owner of classical, we can place the hamster and horse in the first and last positions respectively. The goat and mouse can't be in the first or last positions because of the pet placement and the far left/right clues, so they must be in positions 2 and 4.

3. Now let's place the sports. Since the tennis player is the person drinking soy-milk, the tennis player must be in position 3. The biathlon player can't be in the first or last position because of the sport placement and the far left/right clues, so it must be in position 2. The handball player can't be in the first position because of the pet placement, so it must be in position 4. The sport for position 5 is sailing, but we don't have enough information to place it yet.

4. Let's place the movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in an odd position, it must be in position 1. The person watching fantasy movies can't be in the first position because of the movie placement and the far left/right clues, so it must be in position 5. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the owner of the goat, so it must be in position 2. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies, so it must be in position 4. The person watching the remaining genre, which is either animation or zombie (since we have 4 genres), must be in position 3.

5. Now let's place the music. Since the fan of metal is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person who's sport is handball, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1, the handball player in position 4, and the metal fan in position 2 or 3. Since the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee, the tea drinker must be in position 1, and the coffee drinker in position 2 or 3. Since the fan of gospel is not next to the fan of metal, the gospel fan must be in position 3 or 4. Since the fan of r&b is not next to the fan of metal, the r&b fan must be in position 2 or 5.

6. Now we can place the beverages. Since the tea drinker is in position 1, the tea must be in the first row. Since the coffee drinker is to the right of the tea drinker, the coffee must be in the second row. Since the almond-milk drinker is in the first position, the almond-milk must be in the first column. Since the soy-milk drinker is the tennis player, the soy-milk must be in the third column. Since the milk drinker is not next to the almond-milk drinker, the milk must be in the fourth column.

Here is the final solution table:

We still have some unknowns, but we have placed all the given information into the table. To solve the remaining unknowns, we would need more information."	{'goat': ['hamster', 'horse', 'mouse'], '?': ['?', '?', '?']}	False	0	False
