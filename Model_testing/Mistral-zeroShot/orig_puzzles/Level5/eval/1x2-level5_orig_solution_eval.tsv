Lv5-1x2-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given information:

1. There are two nationalities: British and Dutch.
2. The Dutch is somewhere to the right of the British.

Since the Dutch cannot be on the left side of the table (as per the given information), the nationality on the left must be British. Therefore, the table should look like this:

|               |     British | Dutch   |
| Nationality   |             |         |

Now, since the Dutch is somewhere to the right of the British, the final table should look like this:

#############
|               |     British | Dutch   |
| Nationality   |             |         |
#############

This table represents the solution to the puzzle. The Dutch is to the right of the British, and the nationalities are correctly ordered from left to right."	{'nationality': ['', '']}	True	0	False
Lv5-1x2-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the positions of the two people based on the condition that they use two different means of transport (train and van) and are positioned from left to right.

1. Since there are only two people and two means of transport, we can assign the train to the leftmost position and the van to the rightmost position.

Final solution table:

```
#############
|             |   1   |  2  |
| Transport   | Train | Van |
#############
```

As for the condition ""the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van,"" this is already satisfied since the train is assigned to the leftmost position and the van to the rightmost position."	{'transport': ['train', 'van']}	True	2	True
Lv5-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we can use the given information to deduce the order of the movie genres for the two people.

1. Since the people prefer 2 different movie-genres, we know that one person must be watching an adventure movie, and the other person must be watching a time-travel movie.

2. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies. This means that the time-travel movie must be in the first column (position 1), and the adventure movie must be in the second column (position 2).

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Time-travel | Adventure |
#############
```

So, the table should be filled with 'Time-travel' in the first column and 'Adventure' in the second column."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-1x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given information:

1. There are two nationalities: British and Malaysian.
2. The British is somewhere to the right of the Malaysian.

Since there are only two options in the table, the only possible arrangement that satisfies the condition is:

|               |     2     |    1    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | British |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     2     |    1    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | British |
#############"	{'nationality': ['malaysian', 'british']}	True	2	True
Lv5-1x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the hobbies of the two people.

1. Since the people have 2 different hobbies, we can write down the hobbies in the table:

   |         |      1      |    2    |
   | Hobby   | puzzles   | video-games |

2. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. This means that the hobby ""puzzles"" should be in the second column (column 2), and ""video-games"" should be in the first column (column 1).

   |         |      1      |    2    |
   | Hobby   | video-games | puzzles |

3. To ensure that the hobbies are different, we can rearrange the table if needed, but the order of the hobbies in the final solution will be:

   |         |      1      |    2    |
   | Hobby   | video-games | puzzles |

   However, since the table is already in the correct order, we don't need to rearrange it. So the final solution is:

   |         |      1      |    2    |
   | Hobby   | video-games | puzzles |

   To make it clear that the table is the final solution, we can put '#############' around it:

   |         |      1      |    2    |
   | Hobby   | video-games | puzzles |
   |#############|############|########|"	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-1x2-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the positions of the jobs.

1. We know that there are two jobs: firefighter and writer.
2. The writer is somewhere to the right of the firefighter.

Now let's create the table with the possible positions for the jobs:

|       |      1      |   2    |
| Job   | Firefighter | Writer |

Since the writer is to the right of the firefighter, the only possible arrangement is:

|       |      1      |   2    |
| Job   | Firefighter | Writer |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|       |      1      |   2    |
| Job   | Firefighter | Writer |

Lv5-1x2-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. The people have 2 different hobbies: gardening and magic-tricks.
2. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.

Let's assign the hobbies to the columns based on the given information:

- Since the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is to the right of the person with the hobby of gardening, we can assign the hobby of gardening to column 1 and the hobby of magic-tricks to column 2.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|         |     1     |      2       |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Magic-tricks |

Lv5-1x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food: pepper and raspberry.
2. The person eating pepper is to the right of the person eating raspberry. This means that the column order must be Raspberry in column 1 and Pepper in column 2.

Final solution table:

```
#############
|   Raspberry| Pepper|

Lv5-1x2-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information and deduce the hobbies of the two people.

1. Since the people have 2 different hobbies, we can write them as Hobby 1 and Hobby 2.
2. Let's assume Hobby 1 is filmmaking and Hobby 2 is hiking.
3. According to the puzzle, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. In our assumption, filmmaking is in the first column, so hiking should be in the second column.
4. However, this arrangement doesn't follow the rule that the person with filmmaking is to the left of the person with hiking.
5. To make the arrangement follow the rule, we need to swap the hobbies. So, Hobby 1 should be hiking, and Hobby 2 should be filmmaking.
6. Now, the table looks like this:

   |         |     2      |   1    |
   | Hobby   |            |        |

7. To make it clearer, let's label the hobbies:

   |         |      Hiking | Filmmaking |
   | Hobby   |            |            |

8. Now, the arrangement follows the rule that the person with filmmaking is to the left of the person with hiking.

The final solution table is:

#############
|         |      Hiking | Filmmaking |
| Hobby   |            |            |

1. We know that there are two jobs: accountant and fisherman.
2. The accountant is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.

Since the accountant is to the right of the fisherman, the possible arrangements are:
