Lv5-5x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions (1-6) and then fill in the table based on the given clues.

1. The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the American (#5). Since there are only 6 positions, the American must be in position 1. So, corn can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since corn is in an odd position (#21), it must be in position 3, 5, or 6.

2. The fan of house is on the left or right of the Indonesian (#3). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian cannot be in position 2 (as it would violate #1). So, the Indonesian can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5. If the Indonesian is in position 3, the house fan must be in position 1 or 2. But that would violate #24 (corn is to the right of the superhero fan, and the superhero fan is on the left of the American, so corn cannot be in position 1). So, the Indonesian must be in position 4 or 5. If the Indonesian is in position 4, the house fan must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But that would violate #24 (corn is to the right of the superhero fan, and the superhero fan is on the left of the American, so corn cannot be in position 1). So, the Indonesian must be in position 5, and the house fan must be in position 2.

3. The Dutch is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical (#5). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, and the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4. If the classical fan is in position 1, the Dutch must be in position 6, which would violate #21 (corn is in an odd position). So, the classical fan must be in position 3 or 4. If the classical fan is in position 3, the Dutch must be in position 6, which would violate #21 (corn is in an odd position). So, the classical fan must be in position 4, and the Dutch must be in position 6.

4. The fan of techno is the person eating plum (#4). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, and the classical fan is in position 4, the only remaining food for plum is position 3.

5. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person driving the van (#5). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, and the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), the only remaining positions for superhero movies are positions 1, 2, or 6. But that would violate #24 (corn is to the right of the superhero fan, and the superhero fan is on the left of the American, so corn cannot be in position 1). So, the superhero fan must be in position 6.

6. The person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the car (#5). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), and the superhero fan is in position 6, the only remaining positions for the car driver are positions 2, 4, or 6. But that would violate #24 (corn is to the right of the superhero fan, and the superhero fan is in position 6). So, the car driver must be in position 2.

7. The spanish is on the left or right of the person eating plum (#3). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), and the superhero fan is in position 6, the only remaining positions for the Spanish are positions 1, 4, or 5. But that would violate #6 (the person driving the van is on the right of the person driving the car, and the car driver is in position 2). So, the Spanish must be in position 4.

8. The person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski (#5). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), the superhero fan is in position 6, and the Spanish is in position 4, the only remaining positions for satire movies are positions 1, 2, or 6. But that would violate #9 (the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, and the jet-ski driver is not yet determined). So, let's first determine the jet-ski driver.

9. The jet-ski driver cannot be the American (#16), Indonesian (#8), or the Spanish (#6). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), the superhero fan is in position 6, and the Spanish is in position 4, the only remaining nationalities for the jet-ski driver are Dutch, Argentine, French, and the remaining food items are broccoli, corn, nectarine, and watermelon.

10. The argentine is on the left or right of the fan of classical (#3). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), the superhero fan is in position 6, the Spanish is in position 4, and the jet-ski driver is not yet determined, the only remaining positions for the Argentine are positions 1, 2, 5, and 6. But that would violate #23 (the Argentine is on the left or right of the person driving the van, and the van driver is in position 2). So, the jet-ski driver must be the Argentine.

11. The person driving the jet-ski is the Argentine (#8). Since the American is in position 1, the Indonesian is in position 5, the house fan is in position 2, the classical fan is in position 4, the techno fan is eating plum (position 3), the superhero fan is in position 6, the Spanish is in position 4, and the jet-ski driver is the Argentine, the only remaining positions for satire movies are positions 1, 2, and 6.

Lv5-5x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The videographer is in position 4, which is an odd position. So, the positions are [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

2. The firefighter is on the far left, so he's in position 1.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the Italian. Since the Italian can't be in position 1 (the firefighter is there), the Italian must be in position 2. The lacrosse player is in position 6, as there are no other positions left.

4. The British is on the left of the German, so the German must be in position 3.

5. The person eating carrot is on the left of the fan of electronic. Since the firefighter (who can't be the carrot eater) and the Italian (who can't be the carrot eater either) are already placed, the carrot eater must be in position 5. The fan of electronic is in position 2, as there are no other positions left for him.

6. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the fan of electronic. This is already satisfied as the carrot eater is in position 5 and the fan of electronic is in position 2.

Lv5-5x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, so we can number them from 1 to 6 horizontally.

2. From rule 11, the Italian is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the Italian is on the far left (position 1).

3. From rule 16, the musician is on the left or right of the Italian. Since the Italian is on the far left, the musician must be on the far right (position 6).

4. From rule 19, the Italian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the airplane. So, the airplane driver is not the Italian (1) or the musician (6). Let's assume the airplane driver is 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the airplane driver is 2, then the Italian and the musician must be 1 and 6, which is a solution. If the airplane driver is 3, then the Italian must be 1 and the musician 6, but this would violate rule 24 (the person driving the boat must be to the right of the person driving the airplane). If the airplane driver is 4, then the Italian must be 1 and the musician 6, which is a solution. If the airplane driver is 5, then the Italian must be 1, but this would violate rule 25 (the person who's hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the Mexican, and the Italian is not the woodworker). So, the airplane driver is 4.

5. From rule 18, the engineer is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the airplane driver is 4, the boat driver cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 5. The boat driver must be 6. So, the engineer is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the engineer is 1, then the boat driver (6) must be the Mexican (rule 26), which is a solution. If the engineer is 2, then the boat driver (6) must be the Mexican, but this would violate rule 25 (the person who's hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the Mexican, and the engineer is not the woodworker). If the engineer is 3, then the boat driver (6) must be the Mexican, but this would violate rule 24 (the person driving the boat must be to the right of the person driving the airplane). If the engineer is 4, then the boat driver (6) must be the Mexican, which is a solution. If the engineer is 5, then the boat driver (6) must be the Mexican, but this would violate rule 25 (the person who's hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the Mexican, and the engineer is not the woodworker). So, the engineer is 4.

6. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person driving the boat (6) and the Chinese. The only available position for the woodworker is 3.

7. From rule 22, the project-manager is the person who's hobby is woodworking. So, the project-manager is 3.

8. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is reading is between the project-manager (3) and the fan of country. The only available position for the reader is 2.

9. From rule 23, the photographer is on the right of the fan of country. The only available position for the photographer is 5.

10. From rule 20, the photographer is the person who's hobby is fishing. So, the person who's hobby is fishing is 5.

11. From rule 13, the Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus (6). The only available position for the Colombian is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the Colombian is 1, then the Mexican must be 2, but this would violate rule 25 (the person who's hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the Mexican, and the Colombian is not the woodworker). If the Colombian is 2, then the Mexican must be 3, but this would violate rule 24 (the person driving the boat must be to the right of the person driving the airplane). If the Colombian is 3, then the Mexican must be 4, but this would violate rule 25 (the person who's hobby is woodworking must be to the right of the Mexican, and the Colombian is not the woodworker). If the Colombian is 4, then the Mexican must be 5, which is a solution. If the Colombian is 5, then the Mexican must be 6, but this would violate rule 24 (the person driving the boat must be to the right of the person driving the airplane). So, the Colombian is 4.

12. From rule 12, the fan of indie is on the right of the fan of country. The only available position for the fan of indie is 5 or 6. If the fan of indie is 5, then the fan of country must be 2, but this would violate rule 23 (the photographer is on the right of the fan of country). If the fan of indie is 6, then the fan of country must be 1, but this would violate rule 2 (the fan of country is on the right of the person driving the airplane). So, the fan of indie is 1.

13. From rule 17, the person driving the bus is between the fan of indie (1) and the fan of d&b. The only available position for the bus driver is 2.

14. From rule 15, the manager is in an odd position. Since the Italian (1), the musician (6), the engineer (4), the project-manager (3), the reader (2), the photographer (5), the Colombian (4), the fan of indie (1), and the bus driver (2) are all in even positions, the manager must be 5.

15. From rule 7, the fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the Mexican. The only available position for the fan of classical is 6.

16. From rule 8, the fan of classical is in an odd position. Since the Italian (1), the musician (6), the engineer (4), the project-manager (3), the reader (2), the photographer (5), the Colombian (4), the fan of indie (1), and the bus driver (2) are all in even positions, the fan of classical must be 5.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv5-5x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the sports. From rule 4, the person who's sport is skiing drinks hot-chocolate. From rule 14, the person who's sport is weightlifting is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. So, we can place skiing at position 1 (hot-chocolate) and weightlifting at position 6 (since it's the last sport).

2. From rule 5, the person who's sport is weightlifting is to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. So, surfing must be at position 5.

3. From rule 6, the person who's sport is handball is to the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since we've placed badminton at position 2 (from rule 14), handball can be at position 3 or 4. Let's place it at position 3 for now.

4. From rule 19, the owner of the lizard is to the right of the person who's sport is handball. So, lizard must be at position 4, 5, or 6. Since we've placed handball at position 3, lizard can't be at position 3 or 4. So, lizard must be at position 6.

5. From rule 20, the person who's sport is skateboarding is the owner of the goldfish. Since we've placed skateboarding at position 1, goldfish must be at position 6.

6. From rule 21, the owner of the fish is to the right of the fan of d&b. Since we've placed fish at position 6, d&b must be at position 1, 2, or 5. Let's place it at position 1 for now.

7. From rule 22, the fan of filmmaking is to the left of the fan of d&b. Since we've placed d&b at position 1, filmmaking can't be at position 1. So, filmmaking must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place it at position 2 for now.

8. From rule 30, the fan of filmmaking is the fan of reggae. So, reggae must be at position 2.

13. From rule 13, the person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since we've placed mirinda at position 3, almond-milk can't be at position 1, 2, or 3. So, almond-milk must be at position 4, 5, or 6. Let's place it at position 4 for now.

14. From rule 25, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we've placed almond-milk at position 4, puzzles must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let's place it at position 1 for now.

15. From rule 15, the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the fan of soul. Since we've placed almond-milk at position 4, soul must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we've already placed soul at position 5. So, our placement of almond-milk at position 4 is incorrect. Let's place almond-milk at position 5 instead.

16. From rule 16, the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person who's sport is weightlifting. This is redundant.

17. From rule 17, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an even position. Since we've placed filmmaking at position 2, this is correct.

18. From rule 28, the person who's sport is skiing is to the left of the fan of funk. Since we've placed skiing at position 1, funk must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place it at position 2 for now.

22. From rule 24, the person who's sport is skiing is to the left of the person drinking tea. Since we've placed skiing at position 1, tea must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we've already placed tea at position 2 (from rule 2). So, our placement of tea at position 2 is incorrect. Let's place tea at position 3 instead.

23. From rule 2, the person who's sport is skiing is on the far left or far right. Since we've placed skiing at position 1, this is correct.

24. From rule 1, the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse. Since we've placed mirinda at position 3, the owner of the mouse must be at position 4, 5, or 6. But we've already placed the owner of the mouse at position 6 (from rule 20). So, our placement of mirinda at position 3 is incorrect. Let's place mirinda at position 2 instead.

25. From rule 25, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we've placed almond-milk (which is the drink of the magic-tricks person) at position 5, puzzles must be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we've already placed puzzles at position 1. So, our placement of almond-milk at position 5 is incorrect. Let's place almond-milk at position 4 instead.

26. From rule 11, the person drinking water is to the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since we've placed water at position 2, the owner of the rabbit must be at position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But we've already placed the owner of the rabbit at position 1 (from rule 12). So, our placement of water at position 2 is incorrect. Let's place water at position 6 instead.

27. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since we've placed puzzles at position 1, the owner of the goldfish must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Lv5-5x6-9	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. From rule 17, we know that the person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the person drinking water is on the far left (position 1). This means the person eating eggplant is also on the far left (position 6) due to rule 6.

2. From rule 18, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the russian (position 4). Since the person drinking water is on the far left, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 3.

3. From rule 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right. Since the person eating eggplant is on the far left, the person eating radish must be on the far right (position 6).

4. From rule 16, the person eating radish is on the far right. This means the person eating lime must be in position 5.

5. From rule 10, the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime (position 5). So, the person drinking 7up is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person drinking water is on the far left, the person drinking 7up cannot be in position 1 or 6. Therefore, the person drinking 7up is in position 4.

6. From rule 11, the person drinking lemonade is in an even position. Since the person drinking water is in position 1 and the person drinking 7up is in position 4, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2 or 6. However, since the person drinking water is on the far left, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the person drinking lemonade is in position 2.

7. From rule 13, the owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking water is on the far left, the person drinking tea must be in position 5 or 6. However, since the person drinking lemonade is in position 2, the person drinking tea cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the person drinking tea is in position 6.

8. From rule 14, the person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (position 3). So, the person eating mango is in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person eating eggplant is on the far left (position 6), the person eating mango cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the person eating mango is in position 1 or 2.

9. From rule 24, the owner of the dog is the russian (position 4). This means the person eating mango cannot be in position 1 (since the owner of the dog is to the left of the person eating mango). Therefore, the person eating mango is in position 2.

10. From rule 19, the owner of the lizard is in an even position. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade is in position 2, and the person drinking tea is in position 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4 (since the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 2 or 6).

11. From rule 23, the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's sport is golf. Since the person drinking water is the person eating eggplant, the person eating eggplant is the person playing golf.

12. From rule 25, the russian is on the right of the malaysian. Since the owner of the dog (russian) is in position 4, the malaysian must be in position 3.

13. From rule 26, the chinese is in an even position. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade is in position 2, the person drinking tea is in position 6, and the malaysian is in position 3, the chinese must be in position 5.

14. From rule 21, the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating mango is in position 2 and the person eating eggplant is in position 6, the person eating raspberry must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the person eating mango is to the left of the person eating raspberry, the person eating raspberry cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person eating raspberry is in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking tea is in position 6, the person playing baseball cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the person playing baseball is in position 3 or 4. However, since the person eating mango is to the left of the person eating raspberry, the person playing baseball must be in position 4. This means the person eating raspberry is in position 3.

15. From rule 15, the nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf (position 6). Since the person eating mango is in position 2, the nigerian must be in position 1.

16. From rule 27, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (position 2). Since the person playing baseball is in position 4, the person playing water-polo cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the person playing water-polo is in position 1 or 3. However, since the person eating mango is to the left of the person eating raspberry, the person playing water-polo must be in position 1. This means the person playing lacrosse is in position 3.

17. From rule 29, the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the left of the person eating lime (position 5). Since the person playing lacrosse is in position 3, the person playing water-polo cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person playing water-polo is in position 2.
