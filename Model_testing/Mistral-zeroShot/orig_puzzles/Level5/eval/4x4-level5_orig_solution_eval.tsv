Lv5-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 rows (Food, Music-Genre, Pet, Transport) and 4 columns (1, 2, 3, 4). We know there are 4 different items for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know the items for each category. So, we can fill in the categories with their respective items.

3. Now let's assign the music-genres to the people:
   - The person driving the bike is a fan of electronic, so let's place electronic in row 2, column 3 (since the bike is driven in row 4).
   - The fan of house eats cucumber, so let's place house in row 2, column 1 (since cucumber is in column 3 and we need to place house to the left of electronic).
   - The fan of blues owns a cat, so let's place blues in row 3, column 4 (since the cat is owned by the person on the right of the fan of blues, and the fan of blues is not yet placed).
   - The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of house and the fan of blues, so let's place r&b in row 1, column 4 (since r&b is not yet placed and it should be to the left of house and blues).

4. Now let's assign the pets to their owners:
   - The owner of the bird is on the right of the person driving the ship, so the bird's owner should be in column 4 or 5. Since the fan of blues is already in column 4, the bird's owner should be in column 5.
   - The owner of the cat is on the right of the fan of blues, so the cat's owner should be in column 6 (since the fan of blues is in column 4).
   - The owner of the goat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle, so the goat's owner should be in column 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the goat in column 1 (since the turtle's owner is not yet placed).
   - The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat, so the turtle's owner should be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the turtle in column 2 (since the turtle's owner should be to the right of the goat's owner, who is in column 1).

5. Now let's assign the food to the people:
   - The person eating banana is on the right of the fan of electronic, so the banana eater should be in column 5 or 6. Since the fan of electronic is in column 3, the banana eater should be in column 6.
   - The person eating cucumber is the fan of house, so we already know this.
   - The person eating papaya is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship, so the papaya eater should be in column 5 or 6. Since the person driving the ship is not yet placed, we can't determine the papaya eater's position yet.

6. Now let's assign the transport to the people:
   - The person driving the bike is a fan of electronic, so we already know this.
   - The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the ship, so the bus driver should be in column 5 or 6. Since the person driving the ship is not yet placed, we can't determine the bus driver's position yet.
   - The person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the fan of electronic, so the airplane driver should be in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the airplane driver in column 2 (since the fan of electronic is in column 3).
   - The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person eating papaya, so the ship driver should be in column 5 or 6. Since the papaya eater is not yet placed, we can't determine the ship driver's position yet.

At this point, we have filled in most of the table, but we still can't determine the positions of the banana eater, the bus driver, the papaya eater, and the ship driver. However, we can't fill in these positions without knowing the positions of the others, as the rules depend on the positions of other people.

Without more information, it's impossible to fill in the entire table.

Final solution table:

Lv5-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 items in each category, so we can label the positions from 1 to 4.

2. From point 1, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right (position 4).

3. The owner of the frog is in an odd position, so it can be either position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's position 1 for now.

4. The owner of the goldfish is the person drinking almond-milk, so the goldfish owner must be somewhere to the left of the almond-milk drinker. Since the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 4 (as it's the martial-arts movie watcher), the goldfish owner can only be in position 3. This means the frog owner must be in position 1 (as positions 2 and 4 are taken).

5. The person watching mystery movies is the owner of the dog (point 9), so it must be in position 4.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (point 3), so the iced-tea drinker can be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, since the skateboard driver can't be in position 4 (point 6), the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 4 either. So, the iced-tea drinker can only be in position 1 or 2.

7. The person driving the skateboard can't be in position 4 (point 6), so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since the skateboard driver can't be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (point 11), the skateboard driver must be in position 3. This means the iced-tea drinker is in position 1.

8. The person drinking cola can't be in position 4 (as it's the martial-arts movie watcher), and it can't be in position 1 (as the iced-tea drinker is there). So, the cola drinker can only be in position 2 or 3. However, since the cola drinker can't be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (point 5), the cola drinker can't be in position 2 either. So, the cola drinker is in position 3.

9. The person watching crime movies is between the person watching mystery movies (the dog owner, position 4) and the person drinking cola (position 3). So, the crime movie watcher is in position 2.

10. The owner of the goldfish is in position 3, and it's to the right of the person drinking cola (point 3), so the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

11. The person driving the car is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (point 11), so the car driver is in position 1.

12. The person driving the roller can't be in position 4 (as it's the dog owner), and it can't be in position 1 (as the car driver is there). So, the roller driver is in position 2.

13. The person watching drama movies is the only one left, so it must be in position 2 (as it can't be the crime movie watcher, the roller driver, the iced-tea drinker, the skateboard driver, or the martial-arts movie watcher).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 positions for each category (Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet). Let's label them from left to right as A, B, C, D.

2. From point 11, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies (MA) is the owner of the dog (D). So, MA is in position D.

3. From point 1, we know that the person watching adventure movies (AM) is on the left of MA. So, AM is in position A or B.

4. From point 2, we know that the owner of the turtle (T) is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies (SM). Since MA is in position D, and we don't know the position of SM yet, we can't determine the position of T yet. But we know T is not in position A, B, or D because of points 1, 2, and 10. So, T is in position C.

5. From point 5, we know that the person eating plum (P) is on the left of the person eating apricot (A). So, P is in position A or B, and A is in position C or D.

6. From point 6, we know that T is between the fan of techno (Tech) and the fan of rock (R). Since T is in position C, Tech and R cannot be in positions A, B, or D. So, Tech and R are in positions A and B, respectively.

7. From point 7, we know that the fan of blues (B) is on the right of the owner of the dog (D). So, B is in position C or D. But we know B is not in position D because of point 3. So, B is in position C.

8. From point 8, we know that the owner of the dog (D) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the lizard (L). Since D is in position D, L is in position A, B, or C. But we know L is not in position A because of point 6, and L is not in position C because of point 7. So, L is in position B.

9. From point 9, we know that D is in an even position. Since D is in position D, and positions are labeled from left to right, all other positions are odd. So, Tech is in position A, R is in position B, P is in position C, and L is in position B.

10. From point 10, we know that T is on the left of the person eating apricot (A). Since T is in position C, A cannot be in position C. So, A is in position D.

11. From point 12, we know that AM is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin (Pump). Since AM is in position A or B, and Pump is in position D, AM cannot be in position D. So, AM is in position A.

Now we have the final solution table:

Lv5-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the musician is on the far left, we can place him in the first column. Let's say he prefers country music.

2. The fan of reggae is to the left of the writer, so the writer must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Let's place the writer in the second column, so he prefers pop music.

3. The fan of reggae is to the left of the firefighter, so the firefighter must be in the third or fourth column.

4. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the police-officer. Since the musician and writer are already placed, the police-officer must be in the third column, so he prefers baseball.

5. The person who's sport is handball is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the police-officer is in the third column, the handball player must be in the fourth column.

6. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the police-officer is in the third column, the baseball player must be in the second column. So, the cola drinker is in the first column.

7. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the reggae fan is in the second column, the metal fan can be in either the first or third column. Let's place him in the first column.

8. The person drinking mirinda is between the fan of metal and the person drinking sprite. So, the mirinda drinker is in the second column, and the sprite drinker is in the third column.

9. The fan of pop is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player must be to the right of the pop fan, the tennis player is in the fourth column.

10. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the mirinda drinker is in the second column, the fan of pop must be in the first column.

11. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the cola drinker is in the first column, the sprite drinker is in the second or third column. However, since the mirinda drinker is already in the second column, the sprite drinker must be in the third column.

12. The fan of metal is somewhere to the left of the firefighter. Since the metal fan is in the first column and the firefighter must be in the third or fourth column, the firefighter must be in the fourth column, and he prefers lacrosse.

13. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the mirinda drinker is in the second column and the almond-milk drinker must be in the first, second, or third column, the almond-milk drinker must be in the first column.

Lv5-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies are unique and in a certain order from left to right. Let's assign them temporary names A, B, C, and D.

2. From point 1, we know that A is camping, B is somewhere to the left of photography (A < B < 5), C is fishing (A < C < 5), and D is something else (C < D).

3. Similarly, for movie-genres, let's assign them E, F, G, and H. From point 2, we know that E is action, F is somewhere to the left of disaster (E < F < 2), G is disaster, and H is something else (G < H).

4. For music-genres, let's assign them I, J, K, and L. From point 3, we know that I is ambient, J is somewhere to the left of fishing (I < J < 3), K is fishing, and L is something else (K < L).

5. For transport, let's assign them M, N, O, and P. From point 4, we know that M is helicopter, N is somewhere to the left of roller (M < N < 5), O is roller (M < O < 5), and P is skateboard (O < P). Since the skateboard is in an odd position (P is 3rd or 5th), P must be in the 3rd position.

6. From point 5, we know that N is the 2nd position (even) and M is the 1st position (odd). So, M is helicopter, N is roller, and P is skateboard.

7. From point 6, we know that O must be the 4th position (odd). So, O is taxi.

8. From point 7, we know that H is zombie movies and G is martial-arts (since G is to the right of techno, which is L).

9. From point 8, we know that F is action movies (since it's to the left of fishing, which is K).

10. From point 9, we know that E is something else (since it's to the left of action, which is F).

11. From point 10, we know that D is magic-tricks (since it's to the right of dubstep, which is L).

12. From point 11, we know that C is photography (since it's to the left of magic-tricks, which is D).

13. From point 12, we know that B is fishing (since it's to the left of camping, which is A).

14. Now we have all the assignments: A = camping, B = fishing, C = photography, D = magic-tricks, E = action, F = disaster, G = martial-arts, H = zombie, I = ambient, J = d&b, K = dubstep, L = techno, M = helicopter, N = roller, O = taxi, P = skateboard.

Lv5-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the journalist is between the person drinking coffee and the person eating plum. Let's place the journalist in position 2. Since the person eating plum is drinking water (from clue 5), the person drinking coffee must be in position 1. So, the beverage in position 1 is coffee.

2. Now, we know the journalist is a journalist, so the job in position 2 is journalist.

3. The indonesian is to the left of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes must be in an even position (because the journalist is in position 2, which is an odd position), the indonesian must be in position 1. So, the nationality in position 1 is indonesian.

4. The software-developer is to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is to the right of the person eating plum (clue 6), and the person eating plum is in position 4 (clue 5), the software-developer must be in position 3. So, the job in position 3 is software-developer.

5. The person eating peach is to the left or right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in position 3, the person eating peach can be in position 2 or 4. However, since the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the indonesian (clue 11), and the indonesian is in position 1, the person eating peach cannot be in position 4 (because the person eating peach would then be on the left of the indonesian, and the person eating papaya would have to be in position 3). So, the person eating peach is in position 2. So, the food in position 2 is peach.

6. The chef is to the right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach is in position 2, the chef must be in position 3 or 4. However, since the nigerian is on the left or right of the fisherman (clue 8), and the fisherman must be in an even position (because the journalist is in position 2, which is an odd position), the chef cannot be in position 4 (because the fisherman would then be in position 3, and the chef would have to be in position 4). So, the chef is in position 3. So, the job in position 3 is chef.

7. The person eating papaya is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating peach is in position 2, the person eating papaya must be in position 1 or 4. However, since the person eating plum is the person drinking water (clue 5), and the person drinking water is in position 4, the person eating papaya must be in position 1. So, the food in position 1 is papaya.

8. The nigerian is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the chef is in position 3, the fisherman must be in position 4. So, the nationality in position 4 is nigerian.

9. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating plum. Since the person eating plum is in position 4, the person drinking tea must be in position 5. So, the beverage in position 5 is tea.

10. The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking coffee is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the person eating plum is the person drinking water (clue 5), the person drinking water must be in position 4. So, the beverage in position 5 cannot be tea (because the person drinking tea is in position 5). Therefore, the beverage in position 5 must be cola or cola. But since the software-developer is to the left of the person drinking tea (clue 4), and the person drinking tea is in position 5, the beverage in position 5 cannot be cola (because the software-developer is in position 3). So, the beverage in position 5 must be coffee.

11. The only remaining beverage is cola. So, the beverage in position 1 must be cola.

Lv5-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the reading person is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation, and there are only 4 positions, the reading person must be in position 1.

2. The woodworking person is between the bird owner and the sudoku person. Since the reading person is in position 1, the bird owner must be in position 2. So, the woodworking person is in position 3, and the sudoku person is in position 4.

3. The sports movies person is on the far right, so they must be in position 4.

4. Since the sports movies person is on the left or right of the Thai, the Thai can only be in position 2 or 3. However, the Thai cannot be in position 2 because the bird owner is there, and the bird owner cannot be the Thai (as the Thai cannot be the bird owner due to the nationality constraint). So, the Thai is in position 3.

5. The horse owner is on the left or right of the photography person. Since the Thai is in position 3, the horse owner cannot be in position 4 (as the sports movies person is there). So, the horse owner must be in position 1, and the photography person must be in position 2.

6. The reading person is on the left or right of the bird owner. Since the reading person is in position 1 and the bird owner is in position 2, the reading person cannot be in position 2. So, the reading person is in position 4.

7. The German is on the far left, so they must be in position 1.

8. The crime movies person is somewhere to the right of the epic movies person. Since the woodworking person (who is also the epic movies person) is in position 3, the crime movies person must be in position 4.

9. The polish is on the left or right of the cat owner. Since the German is in position 1, the cat owner cannot be in position 1. So, the cat owner must be in position 2 or 4. However, the cat owner cannot be in position 4 because the crime movies person is there. So, the cat owner is in position 2.

10. The owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the cat owner is in position 2, the hedgehog owner must be in position 3.

11. The woodworking person is somewhere to the right of the sudoku person. Since the woodworking person is in position 3, the sudoku person must be in position 2.

12. The sudoku person is on the left or right of the epic movies person. Since the woodworking person (who is also the epic movies person) is in position 3, the sudoku person cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, the sudoku person is in position 2.

13. The epic movies person is the woodworking person. This is already known from the previous steps.

So, the final solution table is:

2. The fan of trance is the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, we can fill in the beverage for the person doing magic-tricks:

   |               |       1       |      2       |     3      |     4      |

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. So, we can move hot-chocolate to position 2:

   |               |       1       |      2       |     3      |     4      |

6. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the fan of pop. Since we don't have pop yet, let's place pop in position 3:

   |               |       1       |      2       |     3      |     4      |

7. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 3, let's place d&b in position 2:

8. The fan of d&b is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we don't have lacrosse yet, let's place lacrosse in position 4:

   |               |       1       |      2       |     3      |     4      |

Lv5-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label the people A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From rule 12, the person eating cabbage (C) is in an even position, so C must be either 2 or 4.

3. Since C is eating cabbage (9), let's place C in position 2. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|------------|
   |       |         |   Cabbage |          |            |
   |       |         |          |          |            |
   |       |         |          |          |            |
   |       |         |          |          |            |

4. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike (M) is on the right of the person eating lime (L). Since L is not in position 2 (C is eating cabbage there), L must be in position 1 or 3. If L is in position 1, M would be in position 4, which contradicts rule 4 (M is to the left of the person driving the jet-ski, J). So, L must be in position 3. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|------------|

   |       |         |          |          |            |

5. From rule 3, the person driving the jet-ski (J) is between the person watching musical movies (MM) and the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since C is in position 2, Cu must be in position 1 or 4. If Cu is in position 1, J would be in position 3, which contradicts rule 1 (M is on the right of L). So, Cu must be in position 4. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |

   |       |         |          |          |            |

6. From rule 4, M is to the left of J. Since M is eating lime (L) and J is driving the jet-ski (J), M must be in position 3. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |

   |       |         |          |          |            |

7. From rule 5, the person watching thriller movies (Th) is to the left of the fan of dubstep (D). Since D is eating cabbage (9), D must be in position 2. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |

   |       |         |          |          |            |

8. From rule 6, the fan of salsa (Sa) is the fan of salsa. Since there are only 4 music genres, Sa must be in position 3 or 4. If Sa is in position 3, it would contradict rule 8 (D is to the right of Sa). So, Sa must be in position 4. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|------------|

   |       |         |          |          |            |

9. From rule 7, the fan of d&b (Db) is to the right of the fan of salsa (Sa). Since Sa is in position 4, Db must be in position 5. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |

10. From rule 10, the fan of hip-hop (HH) is to the left of the fan of d&b (Db). Since Db is in position 5, HH must be in position 3. Now we have:

12. From rule 2, the person watching zombie movies (Z) is on the left or right of the person eating lime (L). Since L is in position 1 (Action), Z can be in position 2 or 4. If Z is in position 2, it would contradict rule 9 (HH is to the left of Db). So, Z must be in position 4. Now we have:

13. From rule 3, the person driving the jet-ski (J) is between the person watching musical movies (MM) and the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since Cu is in position 4, MM must be in position 2 or 5. If MM is in position 2, it would contradict rule 2 (Z is on the left or right of L). So, MM must be in position 5. Now we have:

16. From rule 6, the person driving the scooter (Sc) is not the fan of d&b (Db). Since Db is in position 3, Sc cannot be in position 3. Sc must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If Sc is in position 1, it would contradict rule 1 (M is on the right of L). If Sc is in position 2, it would contradict rule 12 (C is eating cabbage). If Sc is in position 4, it would contradict rule 13 (Db is to the right of Sa). So, Sc must be in position 5. Now we have:

18. From rule 5, the person watching thriller movies (Th) is to the left of the fan of dubstep (D). Since D is in position 2, Th must be in position 3. Now we have:

19. From rule 10, the fan of hip-hop (HH) is to the left of the fan of d&b (Db). Since Db is in position 2, HH must be in position 1. Now we have:

20. From rule 8, the fan of d&b (Db) is to the right of the fan of salsa (Sa). Since Sa is not in the table yet, let's place Sa in position 4. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   | Thriller|         |          |          |   Salsa    |           |

21. From rule 7, the fan of d&b (Db) is to the right of the fan of salsa (Sa). This is already satisfied, so no change is needed.

22. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike (M) is on the right of the person eating lime (L). Since L is in position 1 and M is in position 4, this is already satisfied.

23. From rule 2, the person watching zombie movies (Z) is on the left or right of the person eating lime (L). Since L is in position 1 and Z is in position 4, this is already satisfied.

24. From rule 3, the person driving the jet-ski (J) is between the person watching musical movies (MM) and the person eating cucumber (Cu). Since MM is in position 5 and Cu is in position 4, J must be in position 3. Now we have:

   | Food  |    1    |     2     |    3     |     4      |     5     |

   |       |         |          | Jet-Ski  |            |           |

25. From rule 4, the person driving the motorbike (M) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski (J). Since M is in position 4 and J is in position 3, this is already satisfied.

26. From rule 5, the person watching thriller movies (Th) is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep (D). Since D is in position 2 and Th is in position 3, this is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

   |       |         |          | Jet-Ski  |            |           |

This table satisfies all the given rules."	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 different symbols (let's use A, B, C, D).

2. We know the favorite beverages, hobbies, jobs, and music-genres, so we can assign each person a beverage, hobby, job, and music-genre. Let's start with the beverages:

   |----------|---|--|--|--|
   | 7up      |   |   |   |   |
   | Cola     |   |   |   |   |
   | Iced-Tea |   |   |   |   |
   | Water    |   |   |   |   |

3. Since the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking 7up, we can place Cola in the rightmost column and 7up in the leftmost column.

   | Beverage | A | B | C | D |
   |----------|---|--|--|--|
   | 7up      | A |   |   |   |
   | Cola     |   |   | C | D |
   | Iced-Tea |   |   |   |   |
   | Water    |   |   |   |   |

4. Since the entrepreneur is the fan of r&b, we can place r&b in the row of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, we can place the entrepreneur in the rightmost column.

   | Beverage | A | B | C | D |
   |----------|---|--|--|--|
   | 7up      | A |   |   |   |
   | Cola     |   |   | C | D |

   | Job      |   |   | Entrepreneur |   |
   | Music-Genre |   |   | r&b |   |

5. Since the fan of gospel is between the person drinking iced-tea and the paramedic, we can place the fan of gospel in the column between Iced-Tea and Paramedic. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the fan of r&b, we can place the fan of gospel in the leftmost column.
