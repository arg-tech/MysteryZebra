Lv5-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (peas and plum), two pets (goldfish and pony), and two types of transport (bike and motorbike).

2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the pony. This means the arrangement of pet owners can be either:
   - Goldfish owner - Pony owner
   - Pony owner - Goldfish owner

3. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas. This means the arrangement of food and motorbike can be:
   - Peas - Motorbike
   - Motorbike - Peas

4. Now, let's combine these two possibilities:

   - Goldfish owner - Pony owner - Peas - Motorbike
   - Goldfish owner - Pony owner - Motorbike - Peas

5. Since there are only two types of pets, the first row must be either ""Goldfish"" and ""Pony"" or ""Pony"" and ""Goldfish"". Let's try both:

   - If the first row is ""Goldfish"" and ""Pony"", the second row must be ""Peas"" and ""Motorbike"" because the motorbike is to the right of the person eating peas.
   - If the first row is ""Pony"" and ""Goldfish"", the second row must be ""Motorbike"" and ""Peas"" because the motorbike is to the right of the person eating peas.

6. So, the correct arrangement is:

   - Goldfish owner - Pony owner - Peas - Motorbike or
   - Pony owner - Goldfish owner - Motorbike - Peas

7. However, since the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the pony, the correct arrangement is:

   - Pony owner - Goldfish owner - Motorbike - Peas

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   Food    | Peas |
|   Pet     | Pony |
| Transport | Motorbike |
#############

This means the person eating plum is the owner of the goldfish, the person owning the pony is to their left, and the person driving the motorbike is to the right of the person eating peas."	{'food': ['peas'], 'pet': ['pony'], 'transport': ['motorbike']}	True	2	False
Lv5-3x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different types of food (plum, raspberry), 2 different movie-genres (family, martial-arts), and 2 different nationalities (Indonesian, Japanese).

2. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating plum. This means that either the family movie is in column 1 and the plum is in row 1, or the family movie is in column 2 and the plum is in row 2. Let's assume the former for now.

3. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the Japanese. This means that the Indonesian cannot be in column 1 because the nationality is in column 3. So, the Japanese must be in row 1 and the Indonesian in row 2.

4. Now, we know that the family movie is in column 1 and the plum is in row 1. The only remaining food is raspberry, so it must be in row 2. The only remaining movie-genre is martial-arts, so it must be in column 2.

5. Finally, we need to determine the order of the nationality and the movie-genre in column 3. Since the Indonesian is to the right of the Japanese, the order must be Japanese, Martial-Arts, Indonesian.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Plum    | Family | Indonesian |
| Martial-Arts| Raspberry | Japanese   |
#############
```

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."	{'plum': ['family', 'indonesian'], 'martial-arts': ['raspberry', 'japanese']}	False	0	False
Lv5-3x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people with two different jobs, two different movie preferences, and two different sports preferences. So, we can write down the unique options for each category:

   |               |    1     |         2          |
   | Job           | Software-Developer, Nurse |  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family, Thriller |  |
   | Sport         | Cricket, Skateboarding |  |

2. From the second point, we know that the software-developer is the person watching family movies. So, we can fill in the first row, first column:

   |               |    1     |         2          |

   | Movie-Genre   | Family, Thriller |  |
   | Sport         | Cricket, Skateboarding |  |

3. From the third point, we know that the person who prefers skateboarding is to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since there's only one person left to be placed in the second row (Nurse), and the only remaining spot to the right of Thriller is the second column, the nurse must prefer skateboarding:

   |               |    1     |         2          |

   | Movie-Genre   | Family, Thriller |  Thriller |
   | Sport         | Cricket, Skateboarding | Skateboarding |

4. Now, we know that the jobs and sports are paired, so the software-developer must prefer cricket, and the nurse must prefer skateboarding. However, we don't have any information to determine the order of the jobs or sports within each row:

Lv5-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, cola and water. Let's label the columns with these beverages for now:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      |      |       |
   | Hobby         |      |       |
   | Music-Genre   |      |       |

2. We know there are two different hobbies, baking and rock-climbing. Since the person who bakes is on the left of the person drinking water, we can place baking in the left column of the water row:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      |      | Baking|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|      |
   | Music-Genre   |      |       |

3. The person who bakes is somewhere to the left of the fan of electronic music. Since we already placed baking in the left column of the water row, the person with electronic music must be in the cola row. Let's label the music-genre column with electronic:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Electronic| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|      |

4. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since we already placed the water and the electronic music on the left, the cola must be on the right. Let's label the cola row with cola:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Electronic| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing|      |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical|       |

5. Now we know that the people have 2 different hobbies, and we've placed rock-climbing in the water row. So, the remaining hobby, baking, must be in the cola row:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Electronic| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Classical| Rock-climbing|
   | Music-Genre   | Classical|       |

6. Since there are only two music-genres, classical and electronic, and we've placed electronic in the water row, classical must be in the cola row:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Classical| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Electronic| Rock-climbing|
   | Music-Genre   | Classical|       |

7. Now we have a contradiction because the hobby and the music-genre are the same in the cola row. However, since we know the hobby and the beverage, we can deduce the music-genre for the cola row. Since the person drinking cola is a fan of classical music and bakes, the only possible music-genre for the water row is electronic.

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Classical| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Electronic| Rock-climbing|
   | Music-Genre   | Classical| Electronic|

8. To avoid the contradiction, we can swap the hobby and the music-genre for the cola row:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Classical| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing| Electronic|
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Classical|

9. Now we have a valid solution:

   |               | Cola | Water |
   | Beverage      | Classical| Baking|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing| Electronic|
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Classical|

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Cola | Water |
| Beverage      | Classical| Baking|
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing| Electronic|

Lv5-3x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food, two hobbies, and two movie genres, we can arrange them in a 2x3 grid. Let's fill the first row with the food, the second row with the hobbies, and the third row with the movie genres.

   |               |     1      |    2     |
   | Food          | Broccoli  | Grapefruit |
   | Hobby         | Reading  | Singing  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Drama   | Epic    |

2. From the first condition, the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies. This means that either the first column (1) is grapefruit and the second column (2) is epic, or the second column (2) is grapefruit and the first column (1) is epic. But since the first condition doesn't specify that the person eating grapefruit is in the first column, we can't conclude anything yet.

3. From the second condition, the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is singing. This means that either the first row (1) is grapefruit and the second row (2) is singing, or the second row (2) is grapefruit and the first row (1) is singing. But since the second condition doesn't specify that the person eating grapefruit is in the first row, we can't conclude anything yet.

4. Now, let's combine both conditions. If the first column (1) is grapefruit and the first row (1) is singing, then we have a contradiction because the person eating grapefruit would be both to the left of the person watching epic movies and the person with the hobby of singing. So, the first column (1) can't be grapefruit and the first row (1) can't be singing.

5. If the second column (2) is grapefruit and the first row (1) is singing, then the first row (1) can't be epic because that would mean the person eating grapefruit is both to the left of the person watching epic movies and the person with the hobby of singing, which is a contradiction. So, the first row (1) can't be epic.

6. If the second column (2) is grapefruit and the second row (2) is singing, then the first row (1) must be broccoli and the first column (1) must be either singing or drama. If the first column (1) is singing, then the first row (1) can't be epic because that would mean the person eating grapefruit is both to the left of the person watching epic movies and the person with the hobby of singing, which is a contradiction. So, the first column (1) must be drama.

7. Now, if the first column (1) is broccoli, then the second column (2) must be epic because the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies. But this would mean that the second row (2) can't be singing because that would mean the person eating grapefruit is both to the left of the person watching epic movies and the person with the hobby of singing, which is a contradiction. So, the first column (1) can't be broccoli.

8. Therefore, the final solution is:

   |               |     1      |    2     |

Lv5-3x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (cooking and reading), we can fill the first row as follows:
   | Hobby | Cooking | Reading |

2. Similarly, since there are two different pets (guinea-pig and mouse), we can fill the second row:
   | Pet   | Guinea-pig | Mouse  |

3. Now, let's consider the positioning of the pet owners. The owner of the mouse is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. This means the order of the pet owners must be either ""Mouse, Guinea-pig"" or ""Guinea-pig, Mouse"".

   If the order is ""Mouse, Guinea-pig"", the corresponding hobby order would be ""Reading, Cooking"" because the hobby owner positions are determined by the pet owner positions (as the person with the hobby of reading is to the right of the person with the hobby of cooking).

   If the order is ""Guinea-pig, Mouse"", the corresponding hobby order would be ""Cooking, Reading"". However, this contradicts the given information that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the scooter (which we haven't assigned yet). So, the order must be ""Mouse, Guinea-pig"".

4. Now, let's consider the transport. Since there are two different means of transport (scooter and train), we can fill the third row:
   | Transport | Scooter | Train |

5. The person driving the scooter cannot be the person with the hobby of cooking (as the person with the hobby of cooking is to the right of the person driving the scooter). So, the person driving the scooter must be the person with the hobby of reading.

6. Now, we know the person with the hobby of cooking is to the right of the person driving the scooter. The only available position for the person with the hobby of cooking is the rightmost position.

7. Therefore, the final solution table is:

   | Hobby | Cooking | Reading |
   |-------|--------|---------|
   | Pet   | Guinea-pig | Mouse  |
   | Transport | Scooter | Train |

   #####

   | Hobby         | Baking  | Puzzles |

2. Similarly, since there are two different movie-genres (comedy and western), we can write them in the second column:

   | Hobby         | Baking  | Puzzles |

3. Now, let's consider the nationalities. Since there are two different nationalities (Egyptian and Polish), we can write them in the third column:

   | Hobby         | Baking  | Puzzles |

4. Now, let's apply the given conditions:

   a) The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. This means the person watching comedy movies must be in the first row (column 1). So, the nationality of the person watching comedy movies is Egyptian, and the nationality of the person doing puzzles is Polish.

   b) The Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the Polish. Since we already placed the Egyptian in the first column, the Polish must be in the second column.

   So, the final table is:

2. The person who sings owns a hedgehog. Let's place the singing hobby in the first row and the hedgehog in the first column. So, the first cell is 'Singing' and the second cell in the first row is 'Hedgehog'.

3. Now, the person who cooks is to the left of the person who rows. Since the first row is already occupied, the cooking hobby must go in the second row.

4. The remaining hobby (singing) must go in the second row as well, because all hobbies are different. Let's place it below the cooking hobby.

5. The pets are different, so the pony cannot be in the first column (it's already occupied by the hedgehog). It must be in the second column.

6. The sports are different, so the rowing sport cannot be in the first row (it's already occupied by the person who sings). It must be in the second row. The remaining sport, water-polo, must be in the first row.

Lv5-3x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs, two nationalities, and two sports. So, each category will have one unique element.

2. Let's assign the unique elements to the categories. We'll start with jobs: Freelancer (F) and Scientist (S).

3. Now, let's assign the unique nationalities: Pakistani (P) and Spanish (Spa).

4. Lastly, let's assign the unique sports: Rugby (R) and Surfing (Surf).

5. From the first rule, we know that the person who prefers Surfing is to the left of the Scientist. So, Surfing can't be in the second row because the Scientist is in the second row. Therefore, Surfing must be in the first row.

6. Now, let's consider the second rule: the Spanish is to the left of the Pakistani. Since we've already placed the nationalities, this rule is satisfied.

7. To finalize the table, we just need to place the sports and jobs in the remaining columns. Since Surfing is in the first row, the job and nationality in the first row must be Freelancer and Pakistani, respectively. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Job           | Freelancer | Scientist |
   | Nationality   | Pakistani  | Spanish   |

   - The people have 2 different jobs: Freelancer and Scientist, which is correct.
   - There are 2 different nationalities: Pakistani and Spanish, which is correct.
   - The people prefer 2 different types of sport: Surfing and Rugby, which is correct.

1. We know there are 2 different favorite beverages: almond-milk and lemonade. Let's label them as A and L respectively.

2. Similarly, there are 2 different movie-genres: disaster and fantasy. Let's label them as D and F respectively.

3. There are 2 different pets: frog and snake. Let's label them as Frog and Snake respectively.

4. The person watching disaster movies is the owner of the frog. This means that the row for Disaster Movie-Genre and the column for Frog Pet must be filled with the same person. Let's label this person as P1.

5. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means that the column for Snake Pet must be to the right of the row for Almond-Milk Beverage.

6. Since there are only 2 people (P1 and another person, let's call them P2), and the Snake Pet is to the right of Almond-Milk Beverage, P2 must be the one drinking Almond-Milk and owning the Snake.

7. Now, we know that P1 is watching Disaster Movies and owns a Frog. P2 is drinking Almond-Milk and owns a Snake. So, we need to find out what P1 is doing for the other two categories.

8. Since P1 is not drinking Almond-Milk, they must be drinking Lemonade. Also, since they are not owning a Snake, they must be owning a Frog.

9. The only remaining option for P1 is to watch Fantasy Movies, as Disaster Movies are already taken by P1.

10. Now, we can fill the table:

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | Almond-Milk | Lemonade |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Disaster |
| Pet           | Frog        | Snake    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | Almond-Milk | Lemonade |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Disaster |
| Pet           | Frog        | Snake    |
#############"	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'lemonade'], 'movie-genre': ['fantasy', 'disaster'], 'pet': ['frog', 'snake']}	True	4	False
