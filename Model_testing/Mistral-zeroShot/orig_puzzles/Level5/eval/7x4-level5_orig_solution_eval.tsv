Lv5-7x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 people and the Chinese is in an odd position, they can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the Chinese is in position 1 (we'll see if this assumption leads to a contradiction later).

2. The chef is in an even position, so they can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the chef is in position 2.

3. The software-developer is driving the jet-ski, so they must be in position 3 (since the Chinese is in position 1 and the jet-ski driver can't be the Chinese).

4. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (position 2). So, the iced-tea drinker can be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the iced-tea drinker is in position 4.

5. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski (position 3). So, the milk drinker can be in positions 1, 2, or 5. Let's assume the milk drinker is in position 1.

6. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since the software-developer (cyclist) is in position 3 and the bus driver can't be in position 1 (because the milk drinker is there), the bus driver must be in position 5.

7. The person who's sport is swimming is on the far right. Since the iced-tea drinker is in position 4 and the bus driver is in position 5, the swimmer must be in position 6.

8. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (position 2). Since the lawyer is in position 2 and the bus driver is in position 5, the cyclist must be in position 6.

9. The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea (position 4). Since the iced-tea drinker is in position 4, the cucumber eater can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the cucumber eater is in position 3.

10. The person eating peas is the person eating peas. So, the peas eater must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 6. Since the milk drinker is in position 1, the cucumber eater is in position 3, and the cyclist is in position 6, the peas eater must be in position 2.

11. The colombian is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the scooter. Since the milk drinker is in position 1 and the software-developer (jet-ski driver) is in position 3, the colombian can be in positions 2 or 4. However, since the peas eater is in position 2, the colombian can't be in position 2. So, the colombian must be in position 4.

12. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the milk drinker is in position 1 and the colombian is in position 4, the trike driver must be in position 5.

13. The person eating peas is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the peas eater is in position 2 and the iced-tea drinker is in position 4, the martial-arts watcher must be in position 3.

14. The person watching sports movies is on the far left. Since the colombian is in position 4 and the martial-arts watcher is in position 3, the sports movie watcher must be in position 1.

15. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since the trike driver is in position 5 and the sports movie watcher is in position 1, the parkour person must be in position 2.

16. The chef is the person driving the trike. However, we already assigned the trike driver to the software-developer (position 3). This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption that the Chinese is in position 1 was incorrect. Let's try the Chinese in position 3 instead.

17. The argentine is on the left of the person eating orange. Since the sports movie watcher is in position 1, the argentine can be in positions 2 or 4. However, since the martial-arts watcher is in position 3, the argentine can't be in position 3. So, the argentine must be in position 2.

18. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Since the cucumber eater is in position 3 and the sports movie watcher is in position 1, the rower can be in positions 2 or 4. However, since the martial-arts watcher is in position 3, the rower can't be in position 3. So, the rower must be in position 2.

19. The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion. Since the cucumber eater is in position 3 and the rower is in position 2, the onion eater must be in position 1.

20. The chinese is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the sports movie watcher is in position 1 and the rower is in position 2, the Chinese must be in position 4.

21. The musician is the japanese. Since the colombian is in position 4, the japanese must be in position 2 (since they can't be the Chinese or the rower).

22. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since the sports movie watcher is in position 1, the epic movie watcher must be in position 5. Since the software-developer (jet-ski driver) is in position 3, they must be on the right of the epic movie watcher. So, the epic movie watcher must be in position 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv5-7x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the boat driver is either to the left or right of the engineer. Let's assume the engineer is in position 3 (since the sport of golf is in an odd position, and the sport of water-polo is on the right of the person drinking water, so the water-polo player can't be in position 1 or 3). So, the boat driver is in position 1 or 5.

2. From rule 2, the person drinking milk owns a rat, so the rat owner can't be in position 3 (since the engineer is there). So, the rat owner is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But the person eating tomato is to the left of the person drinking water (rule 5), so the water-polo player can't be in position 5. So, the rat owner is in position 1, 2, or 4.

3. From rule 3, the golf player is in an odd position. Since the water-polo player is not in position 1 or 3, the golf player must be in position 2 or 4. But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 4. So, the golf player is in position 2.

4. From rule 4, the boat driver is on the left or right of the snowmobile driver. Since the boat driver is in position 1, the snowmobile driver must be in position 3.

5. From rule 5, the person eating tomato is to the left of the person drinking water. Since the water-polo player is to the right of the person eating tomato (rule 13), the water-polo player can't be in position 1. So, the water-polo player is in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the journalist is to the right of the analyst. Since the water-polo player is in position 5, the analyst can't be in position 5. So, the analyst is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the analyst is in position 2 or 4.

7. From rule 7, the person drinking water is to the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the surfing player is in position 2, the water-drinker is in position 3 or 4. But the person eating pomegranate is on the far right (rule 8), so the water-drinker can't be in position 4. So, the water-drinker is in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the person eating pomegranate is on the far right. Since the water-drinker is in position 3, the pomegranate eater is in position 4.

9. From rule 9, the analyst is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the analyst is in position 2, the journalist is in position 1 or 3. But the person eating tomato is to the left of the person drinking water (rule 5), so the water-polo player can't be in position 1. So, the journalist is in position 3.

10. From rule 10, the water-polo player is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the water-polo player is in position 5 and the journalist is in position 3, the skydiving hobbyist is in position 1 or 4. But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 1. So, the skydiving hobbyist is in position 4.

11. From rule 11, the person drinking milk is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the rat owner is in position 1 and the journalist is in position 3, the chess player can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the chess player is in position 2 or 4. But the person eating pomegranate is on the far right (rule 8), so the chess player can't be in position 4. So, the chess player is in position 2.

12. From rule 12, the sailing player is on the left or right of the rat owner. Since the rat owner is in position 1 and the water-polo player is in position 5, the sailing player can't be in position 5. So, the sailing player is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the sailing player is in position 2 or 4. But the person drinking milk is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 11), so the sailing player can't be in position 2. So, the sailing player is in position 4.

13. From rule 13, the person eating artichoke is the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the water-polo player is in position 5, the artichoke eater is in position 5.

14. From rule 14, the owner of the bird is to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the milk drinker is in position 2, the bird owner is in position 1.

15. From rule 15, the engineer is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the skydiving hobbyist is in position 4, the engineer is in position 5.

16. From rule 16, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the golf player is in position 2 and the engineer is in position 5, the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 5. So, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But the person eating pomegranate is on the far right (rule 8), so the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 4. Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 11), the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 2. So, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1.

17. From rule 17, the owner of the pony is between the owner of the bird and the person driving the snowmobile. Since the bird owner is in position 1 and the snowmobile driver is in position 3, the pony owner is in position 2.

18. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver is in position 1, the collector is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the person eating pomegranate is on the far right (rule 8), so the collector can't be in position 5. Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 11), the collector can't be in position 2. So, the collector is in position 3 or 4. But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 4. So, the collector is in position 3.

19. From rule 19, the person driving the trike is in an even position. Since the collector is in position 3, the trike driver is in position 2, 4, or 6 (but there are only 4 positions, so the trike driver must be in position 2 or 4). But the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing (rule 20), so the surfing player can't be in position 4. So, the trike driver is in position 2.

Lv5-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 different symbols (let's use A, B, C, D).

2. From the given information, we can start by placing the nationalities:
   - The French is on the far left or far right, so we can place them at position 1 or 4. Let's place them at position 1 (F).
   - The Dutch is to the right of the person drinking Sprite, and the French is on the left of the person drinking Sprite, so the Sprite drinker must be at position 2 or 3 (S).
   - The Italian is on the left or right of the person eating pepper, and the French is not the pepper eater, so the pepper eater must be at position 3 or 4 (P). Since the Italian is also on the far left or far right, the pepper eater cannot be at position 4, so it must be at position 3 (P). The Italian is then at position 2 (I).
   - The Indian and the Dutch are left, so they can only be at positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the Dutch is already at position 2 (S), the Indian must be at position 1 (Ind).

3. Now let's place the sports:
   - The person playing cricket is to the left of the fan of ambient, and the French is not the cricket player, so the cricket player must be at position 1 or 2 (C).
   - The person playing skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient, so it must be at position 3 or 4 (Sk).
   - The person playing volleyball is to the right of the person with a guinea-pig, and the Italian is not the volleyball player, so the volleyball player must be at position 2 or 4 (V).
   - The person playing skiing is somewhere in the middle, so it must be at position 3 (Ski).
   - The person playing cricket is to the left of the fan of ambient, so it must be at position 1 (C).

4. Now let's place the pets:
   - The owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the analyst, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 3 (Ch).
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the person playing volleyball, so it must be at position 2, 3, or 4 (G).
   - The owner of the lizard is to the left of the analyst and the writer, so it must be at position 1, 2, or 3 (L).
   - Since the writer is the owner of the lizard (L), the chinchilla cannot be at position 1 (Ch), so it must be at position 2 or 3. The guinea-pig cannot be at position 1 or 3 (G), so it must be at position 2. The lizard is then at position 1 (L).

5. Now let's place the jobs:
   - The writer is the owner of the lizard (L), so the writer is at position 1 (W).
   - The analyst is to the right of the person with the chinchilla (Ch), so the analyst is at position 2 or 4 (A).
   - The accountant is somewhere in the middle, so it must be at position 3 (A).

6. Now let's place the beverages:
   - The person drinking Sprite is to the right of the Dutch (S), so it cannot be at position 1.
   - The person drinking Mirinda is on the right of the Italian (M), so it cannot be at position 1 or 2.
   - The person drinking Sprite is to the right of the French (S), so it cannot be at position 1 or 3.
   - The person drinking Mirinda is on the right of the Italian (M), so it must be at position 4.
   - The person drinking Sprite is to the right of the French (S), so it must be at position 2.
   - The person drinking 7up is somewhere in the middle, so it must be at position 3 (7).

7. Now let's place the foods:
   - The person eating lime is the person drinking juice (12), so the juice drinker is eating lime (J).
   - The person eating corn is in an even position (Corn is at position 2 or 4). Since the person eating lime is at position 3 (J), the person eating corn must be at position 4 (C).
   - The person eating pepper is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda (P). Since the Mirinda drinker is at position 4 (M), the pepper eater must be at position 3 (P).
   - The person eating radish is the remaining person, so it must be at position 1 (R).

8. Finally, let's place the music-genres:
   - The fan of indie is on the far right (Indie).
   - The fan of metal is the Italian (M).
   - The remaining genres must be ambient and dubstep. Since the fan of ambient is to the left of the engineer (Ambient), the engineer must be at position 3 (E). The remaining genre, dubstep, must be at position 2 (D).

The final solution table is:

Lv5-7x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill the first row with the 4 different nationalities. Let's place the Italian in the middle (position 3) for now.

   | Transport     |            |             |            |         |

2. From point 19, we know the person drinking water is on the left or right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in position 3, the person drinking water can only be in position 1 or 4. Let's place the person drinking water in position 1 (leaving position 4 for the person drinking almond-milk).

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

   | Transport     |            |             |            |         |

3. From point 3, the person drinking almond-milk is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 or 3. If it were in position 2, the person drinking fanta would have to be in position 4, but that would mean the person watching scientific movies (since the scientist is in an odd position) would have to be in position 3, which contradicts point 19. So, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

4. From point 17, the person eating kale is the person drinking water. So, the person eating kale is in position 1.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

5. From point 5, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person eating kale. So, the person drinking 7up is in position 2.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

6. From point 8, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person watching musical movies can only be in position 2, 3, or 4. If it were in position 2, it would mean the person watching scientific movies (since the scientist is in an odd position) would have to be in position 1, which contradicts point 17. If it were in position 4, it would mean the person driving the helicopter (since it's to the right of the person eating blueberry) would have to be in position 3, which contradicts point 13 (since the scientist is in an odd position). So, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3.

7. From point 6, the person eating blueberry is in position 2.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

8. From point 11, the person driving the van is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, the person sailing must be in position 4.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |

9. From point 14, the person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is in position 2, the person driving the helicopter can only be in position 3 or 4. If it were in position 4, it would mean the person driving the van would have to be in position 3, which contradicts point 11. So, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 4.

11. From point 15, the person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, the person driving the van can only be in position 4. This is already filled, so it's a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

1. We know that there are 4 hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, sports, and types of transport. Since we have 7 clues that specify the position of certain elements (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 11, 14), we can use these clues to fill in some positions.

2. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is watching western movies. Let's place them in the first row, since we don't have any other information about their position yet. So, the first row is:
   - Hobby: magic-tricks
   - Movie-Genre: western

3. From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right. Since we already have one element on the far right (the western movie fan), the rock-climber must be in the last column.

4. From clue 6, we know that the fan of dubstep is on the far right. Since we already placed the rock-climber in the last column, the dubstep fan must be in the first row. So, the first row is now:
   - Hobby: magic-tricks
   - Movie-Genre: western
   - Music-Genre: dubstep

5. From clue 11, we know that the magic-tricks person is between the skateboarder and the software-developer. Since the skateboarder must be on the far left (as the rock-climber is on the far right), the magic-tricks person must be in the second position, and the software-developer must be in the fourth position. So, the first row is now:
   - Hobby: magic-tricks
   - Movie-Genre: western
   - Music-Genre: dubstep
   - Job: software-developer

6. From clue 14, we know that the indie fan is on the left of the skateboarder. Since the skateboarder is in the first position, the indie fan must be in the second position. So, the second row is:

   - Music-Genre: indie
   - Job: (unknown)

7. From clue 10, we know that the indie fan is also watching western movies. Since we already placed the indie fan in the second row, the western movie fan must be in the fourth row. So, the fourth row is:

13. From clue 12, we know that the romance movie fan is on the left or right of the car driver. Since the car driver must be in an odd position (as the cricket player and tennis player are), the romance movie fan must be in the first or third position.

14. From clue 17, we know that the car driver is on the left or right of the scooter driver. Since the scooter driver must be in an odd position (as the cricket player and tennis player are), the car driver must be in the second position. So, the third row is:

   - Movie-Genre: romance
   - Music-Genre: (unknown)
   - Job: (unknown)

15. From clue 9, we know that the quad-bike driver is somewhere to the right of the crime movie fan. Since the crime movie fan must be in the first or third position (as the romance movie fan is in the third position), the quad-bike driver must be in the fourth position. So, the fourth row is:

   - Movie-Genre: crime
   - Music-Genre: (unknown)
   - Job: (unknown)

16. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is not the western movie fan (as the western movie fan is the magic-tricks person). Since the magic-tricks person is in the first row, the traveling person must be in the second, third, or fourth row.

17. From clue 5, we know that the australian is in an odd position. Since the cricket player, tennis player, and quad-bike driver are in even positions, the australian must be in the first position. So, the first row is:
   - Hobby: magic-tricks
   - Movie-Genre: western
   - Music-Genre: dubstep
   - Job: software-developer
   - Nationality: australian

18. From clue 16, we know that the traveling person is not the australian. Since the australian is in the first position, the traveling person must be in the second, third, or fourth row.

   - Hobby: traveling
   - Movie-Genre: (unknown)
   - Music-Genre: r&b
   - Job: software-developer

21. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not the western movie fan (as the western movie fan is the magic-tricks person). Since the magic-tricks person is in the first row, the writing person must be in the second, third, or fourth row. Since the indie fan, romance movie fan, and crime movie fan are already placed, the writing person must be in the second row. So, the second row is:
   - Hobby: rock-climbing

   - Music-Genre: (unknown)
   - Job: (unknown)
   - Nationality: nigerian

Lv5-7x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items in each category, so we can label them from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From point 12, we know that the analyst (Mexican) is driving the bike, so we can place him in position 3 (odd position). Let's label him as A3.

3. From point 18, we know that the analyst is Mexican, so the Mexican cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. Since the Mexican is the analyst, he can only be in position 3.

4. From point 11, we know that the Indonesian is the fan of hip-hop, so he cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6 either. Since the Mexican is already in position 3, the Indonesian must be in position 5. Let's label him as I5.

5. From point 19, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person driving the airplane and to the left of the person eating papaya. Since the analyst (Mexican) is driving the bike, he cannot be the one drinking iced-tea. The only remaining options for the iced-tea drinker are positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the Indonesian is in position 5, the iced-tea drinker cannot be in position 5 either. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 2 or 6. However, from point 2, we know that the Russian is to the right of the person drinking fanta, and since the Indonesian is in position 5, the fanta drinker cannot be in position 4 or 6. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 2. Let's label him as F2.

6. From point 17, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the fan of hip-hop (Indonesian I5). So, the iced-tea drinker (F2) must be to the right of I5. Since I5 is in position 5, F2 must be in position 6.

7. From point 10, we know that the owner of the mouse is to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the analyst (Mexican) is driving the bike, he cannot be the one driving the airplane. The only remaining options for the airplane driver are positions 1, 4, or 6. However, from point 14, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the iced-tea drinker (F2) is in position 6, the airplane driver cannot be in position 6 either. So, the airplane driver must be in position 1 or 4. From point 7, we know that the social-worker is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the iced-tea drinker (F2) is in position 6, the social-worker cannot be in position 5. So, the social-worker must be in position 2 or 4. However, from point 13, we know that the chef is to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the iced-tea drinker (F2) is in position 6, the trike driver cannot be in position 6 either. So, the trike driver must be in position 1 or 4. Since the social-worker cannot be in position 5, the trike driver must be in position 4. So, the airplane driver is in position 1. Let's label the airplane driver as C1.

8. From point 8, we know that the owner of the rat is the person drinking cola. Since the iced-tea drinker (F2) is in position 6, the cola drinker cannot be in position 6 either. So, the cola drinker must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, from point 15, we know that the owner of the rat is to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the airplane driver (C1) is in position 1, the cola drinker cannot be in position 1 either. So, the cola drinker must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, from point 7, we know that the social-worker is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the airplane driver (C1) is in position 1, the social-worker cannot be in position 1 either. So, the social-worker must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, from point 13, we know that the chef is to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the airplane driver (C1) is in position 1 and the trike driver is in position 4, the chef cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, the chef must be in position 2, 3, 5, or 6. However, from point 9, we know that the chef is in an odd position. So, the chef must be in position 3 or 5. However, from point 16, we know that the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the fan of gospel. Since the airplane driver (C1) is in position 1, the fan of gospel cannot be in position 1 either. So, the fan of gospel must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, from point 11, we know that the Indonesian is the fan of hip-hop, not gospel. So, the fan of gospel must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, from point 1, we know that there are 4 different music-genres, and we have already placed the Indonesian (hip-hop) and the social-worker (unknown). So, the fan of gospel must be in position 4. Let's label the fan of gospel as G4.

9. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different nationalities, and we have already placed the Mexican (analyst) and the Indonesian (hip-hop fan). So, the British must be in position 1, and the Russian must be in position 3. Let's label the British as B1 and the Russian as R3.

10. From point 4, we know that the British is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the airplane driver (C1) is in position 1, the carrot eater cannot be in position 1 either. So, the carrot eater must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, from point 5, we know that the hip-hop fan (Indonesian I5) is the carrot eater. So, the Indonesian must be in position 5.

11. From point 6, we know that the fan of reggae is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (F2). Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5, the reggae fan must be in position 4. Let's label the reggae fan as R4.

12. From point 3, we know that the fan of reggae is on the left of the person eating spinach. Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the spinach eater cannot be in position 4 or 5. So, the spinach eater must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, from point 16, we know that the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the fan of gospel (G4). Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the spinach eater cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the spinach eater must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, from point 2, we know that the reggae fan is between the owner of the mouse and the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the mouse owner cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the mouse owner must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, from point 10, we know that the Indonesian (I5) is the carrot eater, so the mouse owner cannot be the carrot eater either. So, the mouse owner must be in position 1, 2, or 6. However, from point 7, we know that the social-worker is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the social-worker cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the social-worker must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, from point 9, we know that the chef is in an odd position. So, the social-worker must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, from point 1, we know that there are 4 different nationalities, and we have already placed the Mexican (analyst) and the Indonesian (hip-hop fan). So, the social-worker must be the British (B1).

13. From point 13, we know that the chef is to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the iced-tea drinker (F2) is in position 6 and the trike driver is in position 4, the chef cannot be in position 6 or 4. So, the chef must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, from point 9, we know that the chef is in an odd position. So, the chef must be in position 3 or 5. However, from point 16, we know that the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the fan of gospel (G4). Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the chef cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the chef must be in position 1 or 3.

14. From point 8, we know that the owner of the rat is the person drinking cola.

However, from point 15, we know that the owner of the rat is to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the cola drinker cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the cola drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, from point 7, we know that the social-worker is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the Indonesian (I5) is in position 5 and the reggae fan (R4) is in position 4, the cola drinker cannot be in position 4 or 5 either. So, the cola drinker must be in position 1.

15. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different pets, and we have already placed the rat (owner in position 1). So, the mouse must be in position 2, the rabbit in position 3, and the snake in position 6.

16. From point 14, we know that the cola drinker (owner of the rat) is in position 1. So, the mouse owner must be in position 2, the rabbit in position 3, and the snake in position 6.

17.

Lv5-7x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent the positions with numbers from 1 to 4.

2. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking water is the person who's hobby is board-games. So, let's assign water to position 4 and board-games to position 4 as well.

3. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is in an even position. Since we already placed board-games at position 4, this means that the person drinking almond-milk (hobby is baking) must be at position 2 (odd position). So, let's assign almond-milk to position 2.

4. From rule 5, we know that the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since we placed baking at position 2, magic-tricks must be at position 3 or 4. If magic-tricks were at position 4, eggplant would be at position 3, but then there would be no room for the person driving the bus (rule 3), so magic-tricks must be at position 3. Let's assign eggplant to position 1.

5. From rule 4, we know that the musician is on the left of the person eating eggplant. Since we placed eggplant at position 1, the musician must be at position 2. Let's assign music-genre indie to position 2 (since indie is odd and the musician is to the left of eggplant).

6. From rule 13, we know that the fan of indie is in an odd position. Since we already placed indie at position 2, this means that the person drinking fanta (rule 18) must be at position 1 or 3 (odd positions). However, if fanta were at position 1, it would conflict with rule 5 (eggplant is to the left of magic-tricks), so fanta must be at position 3. Let's assign fanta to position 3.

7. From rule 19, we know that the person drinking lemonade is the person watching satire movies. Since we placed fanta at position 3, satire movies must be at position 1 or 2. However, if satire movies were at position 1, it would conflict with rule 15 (satire movies are on the far left or far right), so satire movies must be at position 2. Let's assign lemonade to position 2.

8. From rule 14, we know that the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since we placed the musician at position 2 (bus driver would be to the right), family movies must be at position 1. Let's assign banana to position 1 (since banana is to the left of all other foods).

9. From rule 16, we know that the fan of indie is on the far left. Since we placed indie at position 2, this means that the person watching fantasy movies (rule 11) must be at position 4. Let's assign chess to position 4 (since chess is a hobby and we need to fill position 4).

10. From rule 12, we know that the firefighter is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno. Since we placed indie at position 2 (which is an odd position), techno must be at position 3 or 4 (even positions). However, if techno were at position 4, it would conflict with rule 10 (water is to the left of the teacher), so techno must be at position 3. Let's assign techno to position 3.

11. From rule 9, we know that the person driving the ship is on the far right. Since we placed the person watching thriller movies at position 4, the person driving the ship must be at position 1. Let's assign ship to position 1.

12. From rule 6, we know that the person watching thriller movies is on the far right. Since we placed the person driving the ship at position 1, this means that the person watching thriller movies is at position 4. Let's assign lime to position 4 (since lime is a food and we need to fill position 4).

13. From rule 8, we know that the teacher is between the person driving the trike and the person eating broccoli. Since we placed the person driving the ship at position 1 and the person watching thriller movies at position 4, the teacher must be at position 2 or 3. However, if the teacher were at position 2, it would conflict with rule 2 (almond-milk is the beverage of the person with hobby baking), so the teacher must be at position 3. Let's assign teacher to position 3.

14. From rule 20, we know that the person driving the bus is between the person driving the trike and the person eating broccoli. Since we placed the person driving the ship at position 1, the person driving the bus must be at position 2 or 3. However, if the person driving the bus were at position 3, it would conflict with rule 3 (the musician is on the left of the person eating eggplant), so the person driving the bus must be at position 2. Let's assign bus to position 2.

15. From rule 15, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right. Since we placed the person watching family movies at position 1 and the person watching thriller movies at position 4, the person watching satire movies must be at position 3. Let's assign satire to position 3.

16. From rule 19, we know that the person drinking lemonade is the person watching satire movies. Since we placed satire at position 3, this means that the person drinking lemonade is at position 3.

110. From rule 16, we know that the fan of indie is on the far left. Since we placed indie at position 2, this means that the person drinking almond-milk (rule 1) must be at position 1. Let's confirm that almond-milk is at position 1.

111. From rule 14, we know that the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since we placed the person driving the bus at position 2, the person watching family movies must be at position 1. Let's confirm that banana is at position 1.

112. From rule 15, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right. Since we placed the person watching family movies at position 1, the person watching satire movies must be at position 4. Let's confirm that satire is at position 4.

113. From rule 12, we know that the firefighter is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno"	{}	False	0	False
Lv5-7x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and each category:

1. Food: F1 (cranberry), F2 (eggplant), F3 (orange), F4 (watermelon)
2. Hobby: H1 (collecting), H2 (filmmaking), H3 (singing), H4 (writing)
3. Job: J1 (engineer), J2 (pilot), J3 (security-guard), J4 (writer)
4. Movie-Genre: M1 (epic), M2 (fantasy), M3 (martial-arts), M4 (time-travel)
5. Music-Genre: S1 (dubstep), S2 (indie), S3 (techno), S4 (trance)
6. Sport: S5 (badminton), S6 (ice-hockey), S7 (skiing), S8 (surfing)
7. Transport: T1 (ship), T2 (skateboard), T3 (taxi), T4 (tram)

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions:

1. F4 is somewhere to the left of S5 (1)
2. M3 is on the left or right of T3 (2)
3. T4 is on the right of M2 (3)
4. M2 = F4 (4)
5. F3 is on the left of M1 (5)
6. H4 is on the right of J3 (7)
7. H2 = S7 (8)
8. M1 is on the right of M3 (9)
9. M2 = J4 (10)
10. S2 is on the far left or far right (11)
11. S6 is on the left or right of F3 (12)
12. M3 = T1 (13)
13. M4 is on the far right (14)
14. S5 = J2 (15)
15. F3 is on the left of S1 (16)
16. S6 is on the left or right of H3 (17)
17. F2 is in an odd position (18)
18. S3 is on the left or right of H1 (19)
19. J3 = S4 (20)
20. M1 = S6 (20)

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Food          | S6 (ice-hockey) | F2 (eggplant) | F3 (orange) | F4 (watermelon) |
| Hobby         | H3 (singing) | H1 (collecting) | H4 (writing) | H2 (filmmaking) |
| Job           | J2 (pilot) | J3 (security-guard) | J1 (engineer) | J4 (writer) |
| Movie-Genre   | M1 (epic) | M3 (martial-arts) | M4 (time-travel) | M2 (fantasy) |
| Music-Genre   | S1 (dubstep) | S4 (trance) | S3 (techno) | S2 (indie) |
| Sport         | S5 (badminton) | S6 (ice-hockey) | S7 (skiing) | S8 (surfing) |
| Transport     | T1 (ship) | T2 (skateboard) | T3 (taxi) | T4 (tram) |

Now we have the final solution table:
