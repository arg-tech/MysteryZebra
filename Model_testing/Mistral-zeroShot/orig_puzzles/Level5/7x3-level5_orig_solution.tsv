Lv5-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating peach is on the right of the person watching action movies, we can place the peach eater in the last column and the action movie watcher in the second column. Let's place the action movie watcher in column 2 and the peach eater in column 3.

2. The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is on the far right (column 3), the freelancer must be in columns 1 or 2.

3. The person drinking juice is on the far left. So, the juice drinker is in column 1.

4. The person eating pepper is in an odd position. Since the peach eater is in the last position (column 3), the pepper eater must be in column 1 or 2. However, we already placed the juice drinker in column 1, so the pepper eater must be in column 2.

5. The freelancer is somewhere to the right of the chinese. Since the chinese (Russian) is in the middle (column 2), the freelancer must be in column 3.

6. The russian is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since the freelancer (who is the fan of rock) is in column 3, the jazz fan must be in column 1 or 2. Let's place the jazz fan in column 1 for now.

7. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the musical movie watcher is in column 3, the hamster owner must be in column 2 or 1. However, we already placed the jazz fan in column 1, so the hamster owner must be in column 2.

8. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the d&b fan is not yet placed, we can't place the zucchini eater yet.

9. The russian is in the middle. Since we already placed the Russian in column 2, the middle position is filled.

10. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the water drinker is in column 1 (juice drinker), the soy-milk drinker must be in column 3.

11. The person watching scientific movies is the person eating peach. Since we already placed the peach eater in column 3, the scientific movie watcher is also in column 3.

12. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the accountant. Since the accountant is not yet placed, the accountant must be in column 1 or 2. However, the hamster owner is in column 2, so the accountant must be in column 1.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- The d&b fan must be in column 1 (since the zucchini eater is on the right of the d&b fan and the zucchini eater is in column 3).
- The musical movie watcher is in column 2 (since the hamster owner is on the left of the musical movie watcher and the hamster owner is in column 2).

Final solution table:

Lv5-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items for each category, so we can fill in the first row with the categories.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 2           |         |        |          |           | italian |        | helicopter|
| 3           | tea      | mango  | traveling | jazz      | polish   | horse   | jet-ski   |

2. From point 1.5, we know that the fan of pop is on the left of the owner of the hamster. So, the first two columns of the second row must be pop and italian (since the italian is on the far right).

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 2           | pop      |        |          |           | italian | hamster | helicopter|
| 3           | tea      | mango  | traveling | jazz      | polish   | horse   | jet-ski   |

3. From point 2, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the fan of house. Since the fan of house is the first person (coffee), the hobby of the second person (pop) cannot be baking. So, the hobby of the third person must be baking.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 2           | pop      |        |          |           | italian | hamster | helicopter|
| 3           | tea      | mango  | baking   | jazz      | polish   | horse   | jet-ski   |

4. From point 3, the person drinking tea is between the person driving the boat and the polish. Since the polish is the third person, the tea drinker must be the second person.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 2           | tea      | mango  | baking   | jazz      | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 3           |         |        | traveling |           |         |        | jet-ski   |

5. From point 4, the person eating mango is on the left of the person drinking tea. So, the food of the first person must be mango.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | baking   | jazz      | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           |         |        | traveling |           |         |        | jet-ski   |

6. From point 6, the person eating cherry is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse owner is the third person, the cherry eater must be the first person.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | baking   | jazz      | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           |         |        | traveling |           |         |        | jet-ski   |

7. From point 7, the person traveling is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver is the second person, the traveler must be the first person.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | traveling |           | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           |         |        | baking   | jazz      |         |        | jet-ski   |

8. From point 8, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski driver is the third person and we already know the positions of the first two people, the hot-chocolate drinker must be the second person.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | traveling |           | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | hot-chocolate |        | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           |         |        | baking   | jazz      |         |        | jet-ski   |

9. From point 9, the person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is board-games. So, the beverage of the second person is coffee.

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | traveling |           | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           | hot-chocolate |        | baking   | jazz      |         |        | jet-ski   |

10. From point 10, the nationality of the third person is not italian. So, the nationality of the third person is not polish either (since polish is already taken). Therefore, the nationality of the third person must be egyptian. But we already know that the second person is egyptian. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore point 10 and assume that the nationality of the third person is not egyptian, we can continue to fill in the remaining information:

|               | Beverage  | Food   | Hobby   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet   | Transport |
|--------------|----------|--------|---------|------------|----------|--------|-----------|
| 1           | tea      | mango  | traveling |           | polish   | horse   | helicopter|
| 2           | coffee   | cherry | board-games | house | egyptian | hamster | boat     |
| 3           | hot-chocolate |        | baking   | jazz      | italian  |        | jet-ski   |

This is the solution table assuming there is an error in point 10. The final solution table should be filled with the correct nationality for the third person."

   | Transport |    | Jet-ski | Train |

8. Now we can place the person eating garlic and the owner of the pony. Since the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching drama movies, we can place garlic in the third column of the Food row.

Lv5-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fantasy movie watcher is to the left or right of the freelancer, and there are only three positions, the freelancer must be in the middle. Let's place the freelancer in position 2.

2. The person driving the bike is to the left of the rower. Since the freelancer (who is a job) is in the middle, the bike driver must be in position 1 or 3. However, the journalist is between the Thai and the bike driver (point 9), so the bike driver cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the bike driver is in position 3.

3. Now we know the journalist is to the left or right of the rower. Since the journalist is also between the Thai and the bike driver (point 9), the journalist must be in position 1.

4. The rower is somewhere to the right of the journalist (point 2), so the rower is in position 2.

5. The social-worker is to the left of the snowmobile driver (point 10). Since the social-worker is also on the left or right of the Russian (point 11), the social-worker can be in position 1 or 3. However, the social-worker cannot be in position 1 because the journalist is in that position (point 3). Therefore, the social-worker is in position 3.

6. The social-worker is to the left of the Russian (point 11), so the Russian must be in position 2.

7. The person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 1 (because the social-worker is there) or position 3 (because the freelancer is there), so the snowmobile driver is in position 2.

8. The journalist is between the Thai and the bike driver (point 9), so the Thai must be in position 3.

9. The person watching spy movies is in an odd position (point 12), so the spy movie watcher is in position 1, 3, or 5. However, the spy movie watcher cannot be in position 1 (because the journalist is there) or position 3 (because the social-worker is there). Therefore, the spy movie watcher is in position 5.

10. The person eating lemon is the owner of the turtle (point 5), so the lemon eater is in position 5.

11. The owner of the frog is on the far left (point 6), so the frog owner is in position 1.

12. The person eating lime is the boat driver (point 7), so the lime eater is in position 3.

13. The only remaining position is position 4. Since there are three different nationalities, the person in position 4 must be American.

Lv5-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and each has a unique favorite beverage, food, hobby, job, movie-genre, nationality, and sport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6.

2. From the clues, we can deduce the following:

   - The British is between the Indian (#3) and the person watching comedy movies (#6). So, the British is either #2 or #4. Since the scientist (#5) is on the far left, the British cannot be #2. So, the British is #4.

   - The person watching thriller movies (#5) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (#2 or #3 or #6). Since the British (#4) is watching volleyball, which is on the left or right of the lawyer (#5), the lawyer cannot be the person watching thriller movies. So, the person watching thriller movies is #2 or #6.

   - The person eating cherry (#1) is on the far left.

   - The person who's sport is cricket (#3) is the Indian.

   - The scientist (#5) is on the far left.

   - The person drinking lemonade (#6) is on the left or right of the British (#4). Since the British is watching volleyball, which is on the left or right of the lawyer (#5), the lawyer cannot be the person drinking lemonade. So, the person drinking lemonade is #2 or #6.

   - The person eating strawberry (#2 or #6) is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (#3 or #5). Since the Indian (#3) is playing cricket, which is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies, the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person eating strawberry. So, the person eating strawberry is #2 and the person watching fantasy movies is #4.

   - The person drinking almond-milk (#1 or #3 or #5) is somewhere to the left of the person eating strawberry (#2). So, the person drinking almond-milk is #1.

   - The person eating strawberry (#2) is on the left of the person eating blueberry (#3 or #5). Since the Indian (#3) is playing cricket, which is on the left or right of the lawyer (#5), the lawyer cannot be the person eating blueberry. So, the person eating blueberry is #5.

   - The person watching comedy movies (#1 or #3 or #5) is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (#3). So, the person watching comedy movies is #1 or #5. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the British (#4), it must be #1.

   - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing (#3 or #5) is not the person eating strawberry (#2). So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is #5.

   - The person who's hobby is sudoku (#2 or #3 or #6) is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (#1). Since the person watching comedy movies (#1) is not the person drinking almond-milk, it must be #3.

   - The person who's job is a lawyer (#2 or #4 or #6) is not the person watching thriller movies (#2). So, the person who's job is a lawyer is #4 or #6. Since the British (#4) is watching volleyball, which is on the left or right of the lawyer, the lawyer cannot be #4. So, the lawyer is #6.

   - The person who's job is a dancer (#1 or #3 or #5) is not the scientist (#5). So, the person who's job is a dancer is #1 or #3. Since the person watching comedy movies (#1) is not the person drinking almond-milk (#1), the person who's job is a dancer is #3.

   - The person who's job is a scientist (#1 or #3 or #5) is on the far left. Since the person who's job is a dancer (#3) is not the scientist, the scientist is #1.

   - The person who's movie-genre is fantasy (#4) is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (#3). So, the person who's sport is rugby (#2 or #6) is on the left of the person who's movie-genre is fantasy. Since the person watching comedy movies (#1) is not the person drinking almond-milk (#1), the person who's sport is rugby is #6.

   - The person who's movie-genre is thriller (#2) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (#3). Since the person watching comedy movies (#1) is not the person drinking almond-milk (#1), the person who's movie-genre is thriller is #2.

   - The person who's nationality is British (#4) is watching volleyball (#4). So, the person who's nationality is Indian (#3) is playing cricket (#3). The person who's nationality is Japanese (#1, #2, or #5) is not the scientist (#1) or the British (#4). So, the person who's nationality is Japanese is #2 or #5. Since the person watching comedy movies (#1) is not the person drinking almond-milk (#1), the person who's nationality is Japanese is #5.

3. Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of salsa is on the far left, we can place salsa in the first column. Let's place it in the first row for now.

   |               | fanta | iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      |       |          |        |
   | Job           |       |          |        |
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       |          |        |

   | Pet           |       |          |        |
   | Sport         |       |          |        |

2. The fan of salsa is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since we already placed salsa on the far left, the sports genre must be in the second column. Let's place sports in the second row.

   |               | fanta | iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      |       | sports   |        |
   | Job           |       |          |        |

   | Music-Genre   |       |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |          |        |

   | Sport         |       |          |        |

3. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person drinking fanta. So, we can place cat in the third column and fanta in the second row.

   |               | fanta | iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   | sports   |        |
   | Job           |       |          |        |
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |          | dog/rat|
   | Sport         |       |          |        |

4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is in the second row and we have already placed snowboarding to the left of baseball, we can place snowboarding in the first row.

   |               | fanta |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   |              | sports   |        |

   | Music-Genre   |       |              |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |              |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |              |          | dog/rat|
   | Sport         |       |              |          |        |

5. The person watching musical movies is on the left of the dressmaker. Since we already placed salsa on the far left, musical must be in the second column. Let's place musical in the third row.

   |               | fanta |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   |              | sports   | musical|
   | Job           |       |              |          | dressmaker|
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |              |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       |              |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |              |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |              |          | dog/rat|
   | Sport         |       |              |          |        |

6. The fan of soul is on the left of the manager. Since we already placed musical on the left of the dressmaker, manager must be in the fourth column. Let's place manager in the fourth row.

   |               | fanta |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   |              | sports   | musical|
   | Job           |       |              |          | dressmaker|
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |              |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       |              |          | soul    |
   | Nationality   |       |              |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |              |          | dog/rat |
   | Sport         |       |              |          |        |

7. The owner of the rat is between the coach and the person who's sport is parkour. Since we already placed cat, manager, and the person watching musical movies, the only empty spots are between cat and manager, and between the person watching musical movies and the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person who's sport is parkour must be on the far right due to the Spanish being to its left, the rat must be between cat and manager. So, let's place rat in the second column and the second row.

   |               | fanta | rat        |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   |            |             | sports   | musical|
   | Job           |       | coach      |              |          | dressmaker|
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |            |              |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       | soul       |              |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |            |              |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |            |              |          | parkour|
   | Sport         |       |            |              |          |        |

8. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since we already placed the person who's sport is parkour on the far right, baseball must be in the last column. Let's place baseball in the fifth row.

   |               | fanta | rat        |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   | coach      |             | sports   | musical|
   | Job           |       |            |             |          | dressmaker|
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |            |             |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       | soul       |             |          |        |
   | Nationality   |       |            |             |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |            |             |          | parkour|
   | Sport         |       |            |             |          | baseball|

9. The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we already placed the person who's sport is parkour on the far right, the Spanish must be in the third column. Let's place Spanish in the fourth row.

   |               | fanta | rat        |  snowboarding| iced-tea | juice  |
   | Beverage      | cat   | coach      |             | sports   | musical|
   | Job           |       |            |             |          | dressmaker|
   | Movie-Genre   | salsa |            |             |          |        |
   | Music-Genre   |       | soul       |             |          |        |
   | Nationality   | spanish|            |             |          |        |
   | Pet           |       |            |             |          | parkour|
   | Sport         |       |            |             |          | baseball|

10. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we already placed the person who's sport is snowboarding in the first row and the person who's sport is baseball in the fifth row, the order is correct.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv5-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching spy movies is either to the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Let's assume the spy movie fan is on the left (we'll check the other possibility later). This means the raspberry eater is not in the first or last position.

2. The fan of jazz is on the far left. So, the first position is occupied by the jazz fan, and the second position cannot be raspberry (since raspberry is not the first position).

3. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since the first position is jazz, the third position must be disaster movies. This means the r&b fan is in the second position, and the raspberry eater is in the middle (third position).

4. The person drinking coffee is the one driving the roller. Since we know the position of the jazz fan, r&b fan, and raspberry eater, the coffee drinker must be in the fourth position.

5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person eating raspberry. We already know that the raspberry eater is in the third position.

6. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since the coffee drinker is driving the roller, the biathlon person must be in the first, second, or fourth position. However, the first position is jazz, the second position is r&b, and the fourth position is coffee, so the biathlon person must be in the first position. This means the jazz fan is not the biathlon person, and the biathlon person is not the raspberry eater.

7. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the biathlon person is in the first position, the tea drinker must be in the second position. This means the board-games person is in the fourth position.

8. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. So, the zucchini eater is in the fifth position.

9. The fan of techno is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the board-games person is in the fourth position, the techno fan must be in the third position.

10. The person driving the ship is in the sixth position. Since all other positions are filled, the ship driver must be the puzzles person.

Now, let's check the initial assumption about the spy movie fan being on the left. If the spy movie fan was on the right, the raspberry eater would have to be in the first position, which contradicts the fact that the jazz fan is in the first position. So, our initial assumption was correct, and the spy movie fan is on the left.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Biathlon |   Jazz   |   Raspberry  |   Coffee   |   Zucchini |   Board-games |   Techno    |   Puzzles   |   Spy       |   Ship      |

Lv5-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each person must belong to one category in each row.

2. From rule 5, the person watching time-travel movies is in the middle (position 3). Let's place them in the third row, third column.

3. From rule 10, the person watching superhero movies is in an odd position. Since the positions are numbered 1 to 6, the superhero movie fan can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, since the rugby player is to the left of the superhero movie fan (rule 1), the superhero movie fan cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the superhero movie fan is in position 3. Let's place them in the first row, third column.

4. From rule 12, the person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the magic-tricks hobbyist cannot be in the middle (rule 5), they must be in either position 1 or 2. If they were in position 1, the tea drinker would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 2 (the board-games hobbyist is on the far right). So, the magic-tricks hobbyist is in position 2. Let's place them in the second row, second column. Since the tea drinker is to the right of the magic-tricks hobbyist, they must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Since the tea drinker cannot be in position 6 (rule 2), they must be in position 4 or 5. However, if the tea drinker were in position 4, the roller driver would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 3 (the roller driver drinks tea). So, the tea drinker is in position 5. Let's place them in the second row, fifth column.

5. From rule 4, the milk drinker is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the rock-climbing hobbyist cannot be in the middle (rule 5), they must be in either position 1 or 2. If they were in position 1, the milk drinker would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 1 (the rugby player is to the left of the milk drinker). So, the rock-climbing hobbyist is in position 2. Let's place them in the second row, second row. Since the milk drinker is to the left of the rock-climbing hobbyist, they must be in position 1. Let's place them in the first row, first column (milk).

6. From rule 2, the board-games hobbyist is on the far right. Since the rock-climbing hobbyist is in position 2, the board-games hobbyist must be in position 6. Let's place them in the first row, sixth column.

7. From rule 3, the roller driver drinks tea. Since the tea drinker is in position 5, the roller driver must be in position 1. Let's place them in the first row, first row (roller).

8. From rule 8, the rowing sport is on the left of the rugby sport. Since the rugby sport is in position 3, the rowing sport must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the rowing sport were in position 1, the milk drinker would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 4. So, the rowing sport is in position 2. Let's place them in the second row, second row (rowing).

9. From rule 9, the horse owner is on the right of the pop fan. Since the pop fan is in an odd position (rule 6), they must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, if the pop fan were in position 1, the horse owner would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 9. So, the pop fan is in position 3. Let's place them in the first row, third column (pop). Since the horse owner is to the right of the pop fan, they must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, if the horse owner were in position 6, the board-games hobbyist would have to be in position 1, which contradicts rule 2. So, the horse owner is in position 4. Let's place them in the second row, fourth column (horse).

10. From rule 6, the fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the owner of the trike. Since the trike driver cannot be in the middle (rule 5), they must be in either position 1 or 3. However, if the trike driver were in position 1, the pop fan would have to be in position 6, which contradicts rule 9. So, the trike driver is in position 3. Let's place them in the first row, third row (trike). Since the pop fan is to the right of the trike driver, they must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, if the pop fan were in position 6, the board-games hobbyist would have to be in position 1, which contradicts rule 2. So, the pop fan is in position 5. Let's place them in the second row, fifth column (pop).

11. From rule 1, the favourite beverages are milk, sprite, and tea. We have already placed milk and tea. Since sprite is the only remaining beverage, it must be in position 6. Let's place it in the first row, sixth column (sprite).

12. From rule 7, the person driving the roller is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since the roller driver is in position 1, the rat owner must be in position 2. Let's place them in the second row, second column (rat).

13. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2. Since their favourite music genre is not pop (rule 11), it must be either r&b or salsa. However, since the pop fan is in position 5, the magic-tricks hobbyist's music genre must be salsa. Let's place it in the second row, second row (salsa).

14. From rule 6, the fan of pop is in position 5. Since their favourite sport is not rowing (rule 8) or rugby (rule 12), it must be volleyball. Let's place it in the second row, fifth row (volleyball).

15. From rule 9, the horse owner is in position 4. Since their favourite music genre is not pop (rule 6), it must be either r&b or salsa. However, since the magic-tricks hobbyist is in position 2 with salsa, the horse owner's music genre must be r&b. Let's place it in the second row, fourth row (r&b).

16. From rule 3, the roller driver is in position 1. Since their favourite sport is not rowing (rule 8) or rugby (rule 12), it must be volleyball or something else. However, since the pop fan is in position 5 with volleyball, the roller driver's sport must be something else. Let's assume it's board-games (since we don't have any other sports left). However, this contradicts rule 2 (the board-games hobbyist is on the far right). So, the roller driver's sport must be board-games, but we need to adjust the hobby of someone else to make it work. Let's assume the horse owner's hobby is board-games instead of rock-climbing. This means the horse owner is now in position 1, and the roller driver is in position 6. Since the horse owner's music genre is r&b, the roller driver's music genre must be salsa. Let's place it in the first row, sixth row (salsa).

Now, let's place the sports:
- The rowing sport is in position 2 (rowing)
- The rugby sport is in position 3 (rugby)
- The volleyball sport is in position 5 (volleyball)
- The board-games hobbyist is in position 1 (board-games)
- The magic-tricks hobbyist is in position 2 (salsa)
- The rock-climbing hobbyist is in position 6 (rock-climbing)

The final solution table is:

We don't have enough information to fill in the remaining categories."
Lv5-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Colombian is between the Indian and the American, they cannot be in the first or last position. Let's assume the nationalities are in positions 2, 3, and 1 (American, Colombian, Indian).

2. The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left. Since the American is not in the first position, the cyclist must be in position 1 (American, Colombian, Cyclist).

3. The owner of the goat is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the American and the cyclist are already placed, the goat owner must be in position 3 (American, Goat Owner, Colombian, Cyclist).

4. The person who's sport is climbing is in an odd position. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the climber must be in position 3 (American, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist).

5. The owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position. Since the goat owner, climber, and cyclist are already placed, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 5 (American, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner).

6. The dancer is the person eating orange. Since the cyclist, goat owner, climber, and Colombian are already placed, the dancer must be in position 2 (Dancer, American, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner).

7. The person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the Colombian. Since the Colombian is in position 3, the car driver must be in position 2 (Dancer, Car Driver, American, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner).

8. The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is not yet placed, the mechanic must be in position 4 (Dancer, Car Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner).

9. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person eating peas. Since the cyclist, goat owner, Colombian, and dancer are already placed, the person eating peas must be in position 6 (Dancer, Car Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner, Peas Eater, Traveler).

10. The person who's hobby is photography is to the right of the person driving the car. Since the car driver is in position 2, the photographer must be in position 4 (Dancer, Car Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner, Peas Eater, Traveler, Photographer).

11. The person driving the trike is between the American and the person who's sport is climbing. Since the American is in position 1 and the climber is in position 4, the trike driver must be in position 3 (Dancer, Car Driver, Trike Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner, Peas Eater, Traveler, Photographer).

12. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in position 4, the snowboarder can be in position 5 or 6. However, since the guinea-pig owner is already in position 5, the snowboarder must be in position 6 (Dancer, Car Driver, Trike Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner, Snowboarder, Peas Eater, Traveler, Photographer).

13. The owner of the pony is on the left of the person eating orange. Since the dancer is eating orange and is in position 2, the pony owner must be in position 1 (Pony Owner, Dancer, Car Driver, Trike Driver, American, Mechanic, Goat Owner, Climber, Colombian, Cyclist, Guinea-Pig Owner, Snowboarder, Peas Eater, Traveler, Photographer).

14. The food, hobby, job, nationality, pet, sport, and transport for each person are filled accordingly.

Lv5-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, pets, music genres, movie genres, food, and beverages. Let's assign them to the columns and rows for now, and we'll fill in the blanks as we go.

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |

   | Pet           | dog     | pony       | rat          |

2. From rule 3, we know the Indian is on the far right, so Indian = polish. Swap their places.

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |

   | Pet           | dog     | pony       | rat          |

3. From rule 9, we know the owner of the pony is a fan of reggae. So, Pony = chinese. Swap their places.

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |
   | Food          | asparagus| grapefruit | raspberry    |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

4. From rule 1, we know the favorite beverages are fanta, milk, and mirinda. Since we know the nationalities, we can assign them to the beverages. Let's try fanta for the pony (chinese), milk for the Indian, and mirinda for the polish (dog).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

5. From rule 10, we know the fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. Since we know the beverages, we can deduce that the fan of soul cannot be the pony (fanta) or the dog (mirinda), so it must be the Indian (milk).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

6. From rule 11, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we know the movie genres, we can deduce that the fantasy movie fan cannot be the Indian (fantasy) or the polish (sy), so it must be the pony (sy).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |
   | Food          | asparagus| grapefruit | raspberry    |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

7. From rule 12, we know the fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since we know the hobbies and the fan of soul, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is writing cannot be the Indian (soul), so it must be the pony (puzzles).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | milk       | mirinda      |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

8. From rule 4, we know the person drinking fanta is on the right of the fan of trance. Since we know the beverages, we can deduce that the person drinking fanta cannot be the pony (fanta) or the dog (milk), so it must be the Indian (mirinda).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | mirinda    | milk         |

   | Pet           | dog     |            | rat          |

9. From rule 5, we know the person eating asparagus is on the right of the fan of trance. Since we know the beverages and the fan of trance, we can deduce that the person eating asparagus cannot be the pony (asparagus), so it must be the dog (raspberry).

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta    | mirinda    | milk         |

   | Nationality   | pony     | chinese    | indian       |
   | Pet           | dog     | rat        | pony         |

10. From rule 6, we know the person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since we know the pets and the person eating asparagus, we can deduce that the owner of the rat cannot be the dog (asparagus), so it must be the pony (chinese).

    |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
    | Beverage      | fanta    | mirinda    | milk         |
    | Food          | asparagus| grapefruit | raspberry    |

    | Nationality   | pony     | chinese    | indian       |
    | Pet           | dog     | pony       | rat          |

11. From rule 7, we know the person watching time-travel movies is between the person eating grapefruit and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we know the food, hobbies, and movie genres, we can deduce that the time-travel movie fan cannot be the pony (sy), so it must be the Indian (grapefruit).

    |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
    | Beverage      | fanta    | mirinda    | milk         |
    | Food          | asparagus| grapefruit | raspberry    |
    | Hobby         | camping  | puzzles    | writing      |
    | Movie-Genre   | sy       | martial-arts| time-travel   |
    | Music-Genre   | reggae   | soul       | trance       |
    | Nationality   | pony     | chinese    | indian       |
    | Pet           | dog     | pony       | rat          |

Now we have filled all the cells, and the final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
