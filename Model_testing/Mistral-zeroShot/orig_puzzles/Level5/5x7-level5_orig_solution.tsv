Lv5-5x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the nationalities. From clues 4, 6, 26, and 33, we know that the Malaysian, Egyptian, and Canadian are not on the far left or far right. The American can be on the far left or far right (clue 26). So, the Dutch must be in the middle (clue 13). The remaining nationalities (Chinese, Japanese, and one empty spot) must be on the far left or far right.

2. From clues 5 and 15, we know that the Chinese is rowing and the person eating artichoke is driving the van. Since the Dutch is in the middle, the Chinese must be on the far left, and the remaining nationalities (Japanese, American, and one empty spot) must be on the far right.

3. From clues 17 and 31, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person drinking raspberry (since the person drinking raspberry is to the right of the American, who is on the far right). So, hot-chocolate must be on the far left.

4. From clues 7 and 23, we know that the person doing handball is to the left of the person eating cabbage. Since the Dutch is in the middle, the handball person must be on the far left, and the person eating cabbage must be on the far right.

5. From clues 8 and 22, we know that the Japanese is doing skateboarding and is to the right of the person doing tennis. Since the Japanese is on the far right, the person doing tennis must be on the far left.

6. From clues 18 and 28, we know that the person doing skateboarding (Japanese) is in an even position and the person driving the water (American or Egyptian) is on the far left or far right. Since the Japanese is on the far right, the American or Egyptian must be on the far left. Let's assume the American is on the far left (for now).

7. From clues 9 and 30, we know that the person eating cabbage is to the right of the person eating raspberry, and the person doing biathlon is to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating cabbage is on the far right, the person eating grapes must be in the middle.

8. From clues 10 and 29, we know that the Canadian is to the right of the person eating broccoli and is to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the Canadian is on the far right, the person driving the trike must be on the far left.

9. From clues 2, 11, and 25, we know that the person eating plum is to the left of the person drinking coffee, and the person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person eating plum, the person drinking water must be on the far right. So, our initial assumption that the American is on the far left was incorrect, and the Egyptian must be on the far left.

10. From clues 34 and 35, we know that the Dutch is drinking iced-tea and the person doing biathlon is to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the Dutch is in the middle, the person doing biathlon must be on the far left.

11. From clues 32 and 33, we know that the person driving the ship is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the Egyptian is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Egyptian is on the far left, the person driving the jet-ski must be on the far right.

12. From clues 1, 24, and 36, we know that the person eating raspberry is to the right of the person eating peach (since the person eating raspberry is to the right of the American, who is on the far left), and the person doing handball is driving the bus. Since the person doing handball is on the far left, the person eating peach must be in the middle.

13. From clues 20 and 31, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea (since the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person doing biathlon, who is on the far left), and the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person drinking raspberry. Since the person drinking raspberry is to the right of the person eating peach (in the middle), the person drinking lemonade must be on the far right.

14. From clues 3 and 12, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the person doing skateboarding (Japanese), and the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person doing tennis. Since the person driving the trike is on the far left, the person driving the skateboard must be on the far right.

15. From clues 16 and 36, we know that the American is on the far left or far right, and the person doing handball is driving the bus. Since the person doing handball is on the far left, the American must be on the far right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |       2       |    3     |       4       |     5     |      6       |     7     |
| Beverage      | water   |   coffee     | hot-choc | lemonade   |  iced-tea | tea       | 7up        |
| Food          | artichoke| broccoli    | cabbage  | grapes     | peach    | plum      | raspberry  |
| Nationality   | egyptian| american    | chinese  | japanese   | canadian | dutch     | malaysian  |
| Sport         | biathlon| handball    | rowing   | skateboarding| swimming  | tennis    |            |
| Transport     | bus     | jet-ski    | ship    | skateboard | trike    | van       | quad-bike  |

The table is not complete because we don't have the information for the last beverage (7up). However, we can deduce that it must be somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea (clue 25). Since the person drinking tea is on the far right (the Dutch is drinking iced-tea), the person drinking 7up must be on the far left (the Egyptian is drinking water). So, the final solution table is:

In this table, the categories are represented by their initials (Food, Hobby, Job, Music-Genre, and Sport), and the numbers represent the positions assigned in the initial table. For example, the person who's hobby is camping is in position 1, and their hobby is represented by the letter 'C'."
Lv5-5x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the nationalities to the positions. Since the Dutch is in an even position (1, 3, 5, or 7), and the American is on the far left or far right (1 or 7), we can place the Dutch in position 3 and the American in position 7. The remaining nationalities must be Malay, Indian, Italian, Thai, and Russian, in some order.

2. The Italian is the librarian, so we can place the Italian in position 5 (since the librarian is to the right of the dancer and to the left of the social worker). The dancer and social worker must be Malay and Indian, respectively, since the dancer is to the left of the Indian and the social worker is to the left of the dressmaker.

3. The dressmaker is to the right of the Malay, so the Malay must be in position 2. The Indian is to the left of the dancer, so the dancer must be in position 6. The social worker is to the left of the dressmaker, so the dressmaker is in position 4.

4. The Thai is the fan of indie, and the fan of rock is to the left of the Thai. The fan of rock is also to the left of the fan of r&b. The fan of r&b is to the right of the fan of blues, and the fan of blues is on the right of the Thai. So, the Thai must be in position 1, the fan of indie in position 2, the fan of rock in position 3, the fan of r&b in position 4, and the fan of blues in position 5.

5. The russian is to the right of the person drinking fanta. The person drinking fanta is the one who plays cricket, so the cricket player must be the Russian. Since the cricket player is to the left of the biathlon player, the biathlon player must be the security guard (since the security guard plays lacrosse and is to the right of the social worker).

6. The security guard is the person who plays lacrosse, so the lacrosse player must be in position 6. The person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the lacrosse player, so the almond-milk drinker must be in position 5.

7. The person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking coffee. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking tea, so the coffee drinker must be in position 1, the water drinker in position 2, and the tea drinker in position 3.

8. The person drinking juice is the videographer, so the videographer is in position 6. The person who plays weightlifting is the juice drinker, so the weightlifter is in position 1.

9. The person who plays snowboarding is to the left of the Dutch. The Dutch is in position 3, so the snowboarder must be in position 2.

10. The person who plays volleyball is somewhere in the middle (positions 3, 4, or 5), since no other sport is specified to be in the middle. However, all other sports have been placed, so the volleyball player must be the one drinking iced-tea (since the iced-tea drinker is to the left of the librarian).

11. The remaining beverages are iced-tea (volleyball), tea (unknown), and iced-tea (snowboarding). Since the iced-tea drinker (snowboarder) is in position 2, the iced-tea drinker (volleyball player) must be in position 5, and the tea drinker in position 3.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 7 people, positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are even, and position 4 is the only even position among them.

2. Position 5 is the only position to the left of position 6 (far right), so it can't be the position of the person driving the skateboard (position 10). Therefore, the writer can't be in position 5.

3. Since the canadian is eating kiwi (position 5), the writer can't be a canadian.

4. Since the writer is not in position 5, the writer must be in position 1, 3, or 7. However, the writer can't be in position 1 because the writer is to the left of the person eating kiwi (position 5), and there's no one to the left in position 1. So, the writer must be in position 3 or 7.

5. Since the writer is to the left of the owner of the cat (position 25), the writer can't be in position 7 because the far right position (position 6) is the person driving the skateboard, and the writer can't be there (as we found in step 2). So, the writer must be in position 3.

6. Since the writer is in position 3, the person eating kiwi must be in position 5. So, the canadian is in position 5.

7. Since the person eating kiwi is to the left of the person eating strawberry (position 29), the person eating strawberry can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the person eating strawberry must be in position 7.

8. Since the person eating strawberry is the person driving the car (position 29), the car driver can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the car driver must be in position 7.

9. Since the car driver is in position 7, the person driving the skateboard must be in position 1.

10. Since the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the german, the german can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the german must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, the german can't be in position 6 because the far right position (position 7) is the person driving the car, and the german can't be there (as we found in the previous steps). So, the german must be in position 2 or 4.

11. Since the german can't be in position 6, the german must be in position 2. So, the person driving the bus (position 32) must be in position 6.

12. Since the person driving the bus is the owner of the hedgehog, the owner of the hedgehog can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, the owner of the hedgehog can't be in position 6 because the person driving the bus is there. So, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 4.

13. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 4, the architect (position 31) must be in position 2.

14. Since the architect is in position 2, the owner of the frog (position 32) must be in position 6.

15. Since the owner of the frog is the architect, the architect can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. So, the architect must be in position 2.

16. Since the architect is in position 2, the owner of the cat (position 25) must be in position 5.

17. Since the owner of the cat is in position 5, the person eating cucumber (position 28) must be in position 3.

18. Since the person eating cucumber is between the brazilian and the american, the brazilian must be in position 1 and the american in position 7.

19. Since the brazilian is in position 1, the person driving the bus (position 31) must be the pilot.

20. Since the pilot is in position 1, the person driving the subway (position 30) must be the police-officer.

21. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the person driving the train (position 15) must be the teacher.

22. Since the teacher is in position 7, the person driving the roller (position 12) must be the librarian.

23. Since the librarian is in position 12, the fisherman must be in position 6.

24. Since the fisherman is in position 6, the owner of the goat (position 33) must be in position 5.

25. Since the owner of the goat is in position 5, the person eating onion (position 22) must be in position 3.

26. Since the person eating onion is on the left or right of the architect, the architect can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the architect must be in position 3.

27. Since the architect is in position 3, the owner of the rat (position 35) must be in position 5 or 7. However, the owner of the rat can't be in position 7 because the person eating strawberry (position 29) is there. So, the owner of the rat must be in position 5.

28. Since the owner of the rat is in position 5, the person driving the scooter (position 6) must be the colombian.

29. Since the colombian is in position 6, the person eating kale (position 24) must be in position 5.

30. Since the person eating kale is on the right of the colombian, the colombian can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the colombian must be in position 3.

31. Since the colombian is in position 3, the italian (position 31) must be in position 2.

32. Since the italian is in position 2, the owner of the pony (position 31) must be in position 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:
