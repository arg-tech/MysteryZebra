Lv5-6x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport, so we can fill in the columns.

3. Let's start with the positions of the sports. Since soccer is in an even position and on the left of crime movies, we can place soccer in the first or third position. Let's place it in the first position (1). Since soccer is to the left of crime movies, the crime movies must be in the second or fourth position. Let's place crime movies in the second position (2). Now, badminton is on the far right, so it must be in the fourth position (4). Tennis is on the far left, so it must be in the first position (1). Volleyball is left of spy movies and not in the first or fourth position, so it must be in the second position (2).

4. Now, let's place the movie-genres. Since the fan of electronic is watching crime movies (9), we know that crime movies are in the second position (2). Since the fan of electronic is the owner of the bird (15), the bird must be in the second row.

5. The fan of salsa is to the right of crime movies (5), so it must be in the third or fourth position. Since the fan of salsa is not the owner of the snake (it's the second row), it must be in the fourth position (4).

6. The fan of d&b is the person driving the skateboard (6), so the skateboard must be in the second row. Since the owner of the turtle is to the right of the person driving the skateboard (14), the turtle must be in the first row.

7. The person driving the tram is to the left of the fan of d&b (13), so the fan of d&b must be in the second row. Since the fan of d&b is driving the skateboard (6), the skateboard must be in the second row. This means the tram must be in the first row.

8. The architect is in an odd position (11), so it must be in the third row. Since the architect is not the owner of the snake (it's the second row), the snake must be in the fourth row.

9. The pilot is to the left of the person watching spy movies (4), so the pilot must be in the first row. Since the pilot is not the owner of the turtle (it's in the first row), the pilot must be in the second row. This means the person watching spy movies is in the third row.

10. The fan of musical is to the left of the owner of the snake (2), so the fan of musical is in the first row.

11. The fan of electronic is the owner of the bird (9), so the bird is in the second row.

12. The person watching musical movies is to the left of the person watching spy movies (10), so the musical movies are in the first row.

13. The scientist is to the right of the person watching spy movies (16), so the scientist is in the fourth row.

14. The software-developer is left of the person watching spy movies and not in the first or fourth position, so it's in the second position.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-6x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person playing cricket is on the far left. Since there are 4 types of food, the person playing cricket must be eating corn (1st column). So, the mechanic is eating corn (14).

2. From rule 1, the food options are corn, lettuce, pomegranate, tomato. Since the mechanic is eating corn, the person eating lettuce must be in the 2nd column.

3. From rule 5, the person eating lettuce is on the right of the person eating corn. So, the person eating lettuce is in the 3rd or 4th column.

4. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person eating pomegranate. Since we know the person eating lettuce is in the 3rd or 4th column, the person who's hobby is camping must be in the 2nd column (since cycling can't be in the 1st column due to rule 10). So, the person who's hobby is camping is in the 2nd row and the person eating pomegranate is in the 4th column.

5. From rule 13, the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate. So, the brazilian is in the 3rd or 4th row.

6. From rule 4, the person who's sport is lacrosse is between the russian and the brazilian. Since the brazilian is in the 3rd or 4th row, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in the 2nd row. So, the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the 2nd row and the russian is in the 3rd row.

7. From rule 7, the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. Since the russian is in the 3rd row, the lawyer must be in the 1st or 2nd row.

8. From rule 15, the designer is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. So, the designer is in the 4th row.

9. From rule 2, the coach is on the left of the fan of house. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the 2nd row, the coach can't be in the 2nd row. So, the coach is in the 1st row.

10. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is chess is the fan of r&b. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the 2nd row, the person who's hobby is chess can't be in the 2nd row. So, the person who's hobby is chess is in the 4th row.

11. From rule 6, the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the coach is in the 1st row and the person who's hobby is camping is in the 2nd row, the person who's sport is fishing must be in the 3rd row.

12. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the russian. Since the russian is in the 3rd row, the person who's hobby is baking is in the 4th row.

13. From rule 8, the indonesian is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since the person who's hobby is baking is in the 4th row, the person eating tomato must be in the 1st or 2nd row. Since the coach is in the 1st row and the person who's sport is cricket is in the 3rd row, the person eating tomato must be in the 2nd row. So, the indonesian is in the 1st row.

14. From rule 9, the coach is somewhere to the left of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is in the 3rd or 4th column and the coach is in the 1st row, the person eating lettuce must be in the 4th column.

15. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person eating pomegranate. Since the person who's hobby is camping is in the 2nd row and the person eating pomegranate is in the 4th column, the person who's sport is cycling must be in the 3rd row.

Lv5-6x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Polish is in an odd position, so they can't be in the first or fourth position. Since the table is numbered from left to right, they must be in the second or third position. Let's assume the Polish is in the second position.

2. The owner of the fish is on the far left or far right. Since the Polish is in the second position and can't be the owner of the fish (as the Polish is not on the far left), the fish owner must be in the first or fourth position. Let's assume the fish owner is in the first position.

3. The owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the Polish (who is not the hamster owner) is in the second position and the fish owner is in the first position, the hamster owner must be in the third or fourth position. Let's assume the hamster owner is in the fourth position.

4. The firefighter is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the Polish (who is not a firefighter) is in the second position, the firefighter must be in the first position. The only sport left for the firefighter is weightlifting, so it must be in the third position.

5. The person driving the ship is on the far left or far right. Since the fish owner is in the first position and the firefighter is in the first position, the ship driver can't be in the first position. So, the ship driver must be in the fourth position. The only sport left for the ship driver is rowing, so it must be in the second position.

6. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the french. Since the fish owner is in the first position, the French can't be in the first position. The only nationality left for the French is Mexican, so they must be in the third position.

7. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Since the fish owner, the firefighter, and the French are all placed, the 7up drinker must be in the second or fourth position. Since the Polish is in the second position and the hamster owner is in the fourth position, the 7up drinker must be in the fourth position.

8. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the owner of the fish. Since the fish owner is in the first position, the parkour person must be in the second position.

9. The french is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the French is in the third position, the biathlon person must be in the fourth position.

10. The indian is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the hamster owner is in the fourth position, the Indian must be in the third position.

11. The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the parkour person is in the second position, the teacher must be in the first position.

12. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the hamster owner is in the fourth position, the juice drinker must be in the third position.

13. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the firefighter is in the first position and the weightlifting sport is in the third position, the scooter driver must be in the second position.

14. The person driving the scooter is between the person drinking mirinda and the owner of the rabbit. Since the scooter driver is in the second position, the mirinda drinker must be in the first position and the rabbit owner must be in the third position.

15. The accountant is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the rowing sport is in the second position, the accountant must be in the first or third position.

1. We know that the person eating mango is to the left of the musician. Let's place the musician in the first position (1) and the mango eater in the second position (2).

2. The fan of r&b is to the right of the person eating carrot. Since the pilot eats carrot (10), the fan of r&b cannot be in the first four positions. So, the fan of r&b is in position 5, and the person eating carrot is in position 4.

3. The owner of the goldfish is either to the left or right of the person eating strawberry. Since the pilot eats carrot and is to the right of the fan of r&b (4), the goldfish owner cannot be in positions 1-4. So, the goldfish owner is in position 5, and the person eating strawberry is in position 3.

4. The police-officer is to the right of the fan of r&b (5). The only remaining positions are 6, 7, and 8. Since the fan of reggae is the scientist (5), the police-officer cannot be the scientist. So, the police-officer is in position 8 (job: police-officer, hobby: sudoku).

5. The fan of reggae is the scientist (5). The only remaining positions for the scientist are 1, 2, and 3. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the dog (11), the scientist cannot be the owner of the dog. So, the scientist is in position 1 (job: scientist, music-genre: reggae).

6. The fan of funk is to the left of the person eating mango (1). The only remaining positions for the mango eater are 2 and 3. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the dog (11), the fan of funk cannot be the owner of the dog. So, the mango eater is in position 2 (food: mango).

7. The person who's hobby is writing is to the left or right of the person driving the subway (6). Since the police-officer is in position 8 (job: police-officer, hobby: sudoku), the person driving the subway cannot be the police-officer.

8. The person who's hobby is reading is to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking (8). The only remaining positions for the reader are 1, 2, and 3. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the dog (11), the reader cannot be the owner of the dog. So, the reader is in position 1 (hobby: reading).

9. The owner of the dog is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (8). The only remaining positions for the dog owner are 4, 5, 6, and 7. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the dog (11), the dog owner cannot be the fan of reggae (1). So, the dog owner is in position 6 (pet: dog).

10. The owner of the rat is the person driving the skateboard (9). The only remaining positions for the rat owner are 2, 3, 4, and 5. Since the fan of reggae is to the left of the owner of the dog (11), the rat owner cannot be the fan of reggae (1). So, the rat owner is in position 5 (pet: rat).

11. The person driving the roller is to the left or right of the police-officer (4). The only remaining positions for the roller driver are 2, 3, 6, and 7.

1. Since there are 4 people and the Malaysian is in an even position, they must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume they are in position 2 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

2. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since there are only 3 positions left for the singer, the singer must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the singer is in position 1 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

3. The fan of trance is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since there are only 3 positions left for the snowmobile, it must be in position 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the snowmobile is in position 3 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

4. The person watching epic movies is the person driving the bike. Since there are only 3 positions left for the bike, it must be in position 1, 5, or 7. Let's assume the bike is in position 1 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the fan of reggae. Since there are only 2 positions left for the traveler and the reggae fan, they must be in positions 2 and 4. Let's assume the traveler is in position 2 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

6. The pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Since the Malaysian is in position 2, the pakistani cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the pakistani must be in position 4 or 6. Let's assume the pakistani is in position 4 (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

7. The person watching romance movies is the pakistani. Since the pakistani is in position 4, the romance movies must be in position 4.

8. The person driving the bike is on the left or right of the fan of folk. Since the bike is in position 1 and the folk fan is between the pakistani and the bike, the folk fan must be in position 2.

9. The fan of folk is between the pakistani and the person driving the bike. This is already satisfied since the fan of folk is in position 2, the pakistani is in position 4, and the bike is in position 1.

10. The indonesian is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since there are only 3 positions left, the woodworker must be in position 3.

12. The person who's hobby is traveling is the pakistani. This is already satisfied since the traveler is in position 2 and the pakistani is in position 4.

13. The fan of trance is the pakistani. This is already satisfied since the trance fan is in position 4.

14. The owner of the pony is on the left of the fan of trance. Since the trance fan is in position 4, the pony owner must be in position 3.

15. The malaysian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish. Since the malaysian is in position 2 and the pony owner is in position 3, the fish owner must be in position 1 or 5. However, the fish owner cannot be in position 1 because the bike is there, and the fish owner cannot be in position 5 because the reggae fan is there. So, the fish owner must be in position 7.

16. The owner of the chinchilla is the fan of trance. This is already satisfied since the trance fan is in position 4.

17. The owner of the fish is the person driving the tram. Since the fish owner is in position 7, the tram driver must be in position 6.

Now, let's check our assumptions:
- The Malaysian is in position 2, which is an even position and there are no other Malaysians.
- The singer is in position 1, and there is no one to the left of position 1.
- The snowmobile is in position 3, and there is no one to the right of position 3.
- The bike is in position 1, and the fan of folk is between the pakistani and the bike.

13. The person drinking tea is the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is already at position 2, the person drinking tea is at position 2. But we already have cola at position 2. So, the person drinking tea must be at position 1, which contradicts our initial placement of the fan of rock.

   This puzzle has no solution as given constraints lead to a contradiction.

This is the closest we can get to a solution, but it is not a valid solution due to the contradiction."
Lv5-6x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the airplane driver is on the far left, we can place the airplane driver in the first position. Let's assume the beverage for the airplane driver is Cola (C).

2. The avocado eater is in an even position, so they can't be in the first position (already occupied by the airplane driver). They also can't be in the second position because the Polish is to the left of the tea drinker, and we don't know the tea drinker's position yet. So, the avocado eater must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place the avocado (A) in the 4th position for now.

3. The Polish is to the left of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker (T) must be in the 5th position. The tea drinker's beverage is T.

4. Since the iced-tea drinker is to the right of the avocado eater, the iced-tea drinker (IT) must be in the 5th, 6th, or 7th position. Let's place the iced-tea (IT) in the 6th position for now.

5. The cola drinker (C) is to the left or right of the lime eater, who is the manager (M). Since the airplane driver (C) is already in the first position, the lime eater (M) must be in the 2nd position. So, the lime is L.

6. The water drinker (W) is to the left or right of the tea drinker (T), so the water drinker must be in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Let's place the water (W) in the 1st position for now.

7. The banana eater (B) is on the left of the garlic eater (G), so the garlic eater must be in an odd position. The garlic eater can't be in the 1st position (already occupied by the water drinker), so the garlic eater must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Let's place the garlic (G) in the 7th position for now.

8. The Thai (TH) is between the social-worker (SW) and the garlic eater (G). Since the Thai can't be in the 1st position (already occupied by the water drinker), the Thai must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place the Thai (TH) in the 2nd position for now.

9. The Thai's nationality is Thai (TH), so the social-worker (SW) must be in the 3rd position.

10. The french (F) is on the right of the software-developer (SD), so the software-developer must be in an even position. The software-developer can't be in the 1st position (already occupied by the water drinker), so the software-developer must be in the 4th, 6th, or 7th position. Let's place the software-developer (SD) in the 4th position for now.

11. The iced-tea drinker (IT) is in an even position, so the iced-tea drinker must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Since the iced-tea drinker is to the right of the avocado eater (A), the iced-tea drinker can't be in the 2nd position (already occupied by the Thai). So, the iced-tea drinker must be in the 4th or 6th position. However, since the skateboard driver is on the left or right of the garlic eater (G), and the iced-tea drinker (IT) is to the right of the avocado eater (A), the skateboard driver can't be in the 4th position (already occupied by the iced-tea drinker). Therefore, the iced-tea drinker must be in the 6th position.

12. The skateboard driver (SK) is on the left or right of the garlic eater (G), so the skateboard driver must be in the 5th or 7th position. Since the skateboard driver is to the left or right of the banana eater (B), and the iced-tea drinker (IT) is to the right of the avocado eater (A), the skateboard driver can't be in the 7th position (already occupied by the garlic eater). Therefore, the skateboard driver must be in the 5th position.

13. The motorbike driver (MB) is on the left or right of the banana eater (B), so the motorbike driver must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Since the motorbike driver is to the left or right of the banana eater (B), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the motorbike driver can't be in the 3rd position (already occupied by the motorbike driver). Therefore, the motorbike driver must be in the 5th position.

14. The ferret owner (Fer) is on the left or right of the french (F), so the ferret owner must be in the 1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Since the ferret owner is to the right of the guinea-pig owner (GP), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the ferret owner can't be in the 1st position (already occupied by the airplane driver). Since the motorbike driver (MB) is to the left or right of the banana eater (B), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the ferret owner can't be in the 5th position (already occupied by the skateboard driver). Therefore, the ferret owner must be in the 3rd or 7th position. However, since the Thai (TH) is between the social-worker (SW) and the garlic eater (G), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the ferret owner can't be in the 7th position (already occupied by the garlic eater). Therefore, the ferret owner must be in the 3rd position.

15. The guinea-pig owner (GP) is to the left of the ferret owner (Fer), so the guinea-pig owner must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the Thai (TH) is between the social-worker (SW) and the garlic eater (G), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the guinea-pig owner can't be in the 2nd position (already occupied by the Thai). Therefore, the guinea-pig owner must be in the 4th position.

16. The horse owner (H) is to the right of the banana eater (B), so the horse owner must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Since the Thai (TH) is between the social-worker (SW) and the garlic eater (G), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the horse owner can't be in the 3rd position (already occupied by the ferret owner). Since the motorbike driver (MB) is to the left or right of the banana eater (B), and the skateboard driver (SK) is to the left or right of the garlic eater (G), the horse owner can't be in the 5th position (already occupied by the skateboard driver). Therefore, the horse owner must be in the 7th position.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

| Beverage      | Cola (C) | Iced-tea (IT) | Tea (T) | Water (W) |
| Food          | Lime (L) | Avocado (A) | Banana (B) | Garlic (G) |
| Job           | Manager (M) | Social-worker (SW) | Software-developer (SD) | Thai (TH) |
| Nationality   | Canadian | French (F) | Polish | Thai (TH) |
| Pet           | Ferret (Fer) | Guinea-pig (GP) | Horse (H) | Lizard |
| Transport     | Airplane | Motorbike (MB) | Roller | Skateboard (SK) |

The final solution table is:
