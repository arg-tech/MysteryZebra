Lv5-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, and sports, we can assign each row with a unique hobby, job, and sport. Let's start with the hobbies:
   - Row 1: Board-games (since the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person who's hobby is board-games)
   - Row 2: Chess (remaining hobby)
   - Row 3: Singing (remaining hobby)

2. Now let's assign jobs:
   - Row 1: Freelancer (since the freelancer is on the right of the writer)
   - Row 2: Writer (remaining job)
   - Row 3: Photographer (remaining job)

3. Now let's assign sports:
   - Row 1: Soccer (since the person who's hobby is singing is the person who's sport is soccer)
   - Row 2: Baseball (since the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games)
   - Row 3: Snowboarding (remaining sport, and it's the sport of the person who's hobby is board-games)

4. Now we know the freelancer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is soccer. So, the arrangement should be:
   - Row 1: Freelancer, Baseball, Soccer
   - Row 2: Writer, Chess, Snowboarding
   - Row 3: Photographer, Singing

5. To arrange the rows according to the given conditions, we can rearrange the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: Freelancer, Baseball, Soccer (already in order)
   - Row 2: Writer, Chess, Snowboarding (no specific order given)
   - Row 3: Photographer, Singing (no specific order given)

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can number them from left to right as Person 1, Person 2, and Person 3.

2. From point 4, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an even position. Since there are 3 people, the only even position is the middle, so Person 2's hobby is rock-climbing.

3. From point 2, we know that the fan of blues is on the right of the fan of disco. Since Person 2 is the only one left for rock-climbing, the fan of disco must be either Person 1 or Person 3. If the fan of disco was Person 1, then the fan of blues would have to be Person 3, but that would mean Person 2 (rock-climbing) is not in an even position, which contradicts point 4. So, the fan of disco must be Person 3. Therefore, the fan of blues is Person 1.

4. From point 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance. Since Person 3 is the fan of trance, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be either Person 2 or Person 3. From point 5, we know that the fan of disco is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. If the person drinking hot-chocolate was Person 3, then the fan of disco would be on Person 2's left, but that would mean Person 1 (blues) is not to the right of Person 3 (disco), which contradicts point 2. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be Person 2.

5. From point 3, we know that the person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since Person 1 is the only one left for blues and Person 2 is the hot-chocolate drinker, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be Person 3. Therefore, the person drinking water is Person 1.

Lv5-3x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the journalist eats plum, so let's place the journalist in the second column and second row (since the food and hobbies are in different columns). So, the second row represents ""Job"" and the second column represents ""Hobby"" for the journalist. Let's fill in the hobby as ""sudoku"" and the job as ""journalist"".

   |         |      1      |    2    |     3      |
   | Food    |             |         |            |

   | Job     |             | Journalist|            |

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the journalist's hobby is not chess yet, let's place the woodworking person in the first column and third row (since the hobbies are in different rows). Let's fill in the hobby as ""woodworking"" and the job can be any of the three (let's say ""manager"" for now).

   |         |      1      |    2    |     3      |

   | Hobby   | Woodworking | Sudoku  | Chess      |
   | Job     | Freelancer | Journalist| Manager   |

3. The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the freelancer. Since the freelancer is in the first row and the woodworking person is in the third row, the person with the hobby of chess must be in the second row. Since the journalist already occupies the second row, the person with the hobby of chess must be eating grapes (since plum is taken by the journalist). Let's fill in the hobby as ""chess"" and the job can be any of the three (let's say ""freelancer"" for now).

   |         |      1      |    2    |     3      |

   | Hobby   | Woodworking| Chess   | Sudoku     |
   | Job     | Freelancer| Journalist| Manager   |

4. The journalist is somewhere to the left of the freelancer. Since the journalist is in the second row and the freelancer is in the first row, the journalist is in the first column. Since the journalist eats plum, the person eating grapes must be the freelancer.

   | Job     | Freelancer| Journalist| Manager   |

5. Now, the last job, ""manager"", is left. Since the journalist is in the first column and the freelancer is in the second column, the manager must be in the third column. Since all food options are taken, the manager doesn't have a food preference.

   |         |      1      |    2    |     3      |

Lv5-3x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three people, so we can fill the first row with the three types of food. Let's assume the order is: 1 (Artichoke), 2 (Peas), 3 (Plum).

2. The soul fan is between the person eating plum and the person eating artichoke. Since we already have the order of food, we can deduce that the soul fan must be eating peas. So, the second row should be: 2 (Soul).

3. The person driving the jet-ski is the person eating artichoke, so the third row, column 3 should be: 1 (Jet-ski).

4. The fan of techno is on the far left or far right. Since the soul fan is in the middle, the techno fan must be on the far left or the far right of the table. If the techno fan were on the far left, the third row, column 1 would be: 3 (Techno). However, the soul fan is to the left of the techno fan, which contradicts rule 2. Therefore, the techno fan must be on the far right. So, the third row, column 2 should be: 3 (Techno).

5. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since we know the jet-ski is on the right, the person driving the taxi must be in the first or second position. If the taxi were in the first position, the third row, column 1 would be: 2 (Taxi), which would mean the techno fan is not on the far right, contradicting rule 4. Therefore, the taxi driver must be in the second position. So, the third row, column 1 should be: 2 (Taxi).

6. Now we know the third row: 2 (Taxi), 3 (Techno), 1 (Jet-ski).

7. The music genres are punk, soul, techno. Since soul is already filled, the first row, column 2 should be: 2 (Soul).

8. The person eating plum is to the left of the fan of punk. Since we know the soul fan is eating peas and the techno fan is on the far right, the only position left for the punk fan is the first position. So, the first row, column 3 should be: 3 (Plum).

9. The remaining food is artichoke. Since it's the only one left, it must be in the middle position. So, the first row, column 1 should be: 1 (Artichoke).

The final solution table is:

|               |  1   |  2   |     3     |
| Food          | Artichoke | Soul | Plum     |
| Music-Genre   |      |      |           |
| Transport     |      |      | Jet-ski  |

Now, to fill the last two rows, we can use the process of elimination:

- For the music genre, punk is left. So, the second row, column 1 should be: 3 (Punk).

- For the transport, the only option left is bus. So, the third row, column 1 should be: 1 (Bus).

The final solution table is:

Lv5-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The freelancer is on the left or right of the coach, and on the far right. This means the freelancer cannot be in the first or third column. So, the freelancer must be in the second column.

2. Now we know the freelancer is in the second column, and the coach is watching western movies (from point 5). So, the coach must be in the first row.

3. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the coach is watching western movies (not satire), the surfer cannot be in the first row. So, the surfer must be in the second or third row.

4. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. If the surfer is in the second row, then the soccer player must be in the first row, but the coach is already there. So, the surfer must be in the third row.

5. Now we know the surfer is in the third row and the coach is in the first row. Since the freelancer is in the second column, the only remaining job for the first row is security-guard. So, the security-guard is watching epic movies.

6. The only movie genre left for the second row is satire, and the only sport left for the second row is soccer. So, the freelancer (in the second column) is watching satire movies and plays soccer.

7. The only movie genre left for the third row is western, and the only sport left for the third column is snowboarding. So, the security-guard (in the third row) is watching western movies and plays snowboarding.

Lv5-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three jobs, nationalities, and means of transport. Let's assign them as follows:
   - Jobs: Dressmaker (D), Manager (M), Paramedic (P)
   - Nationalities: French (F), Mexican (X), Thai (T)
   - Transport: Snowmobile (S), Tram (Tt), Trike (Tr)

2. From point 1, the French is on the left of the person driving the trike. So, we can write: F - Tr - something.

3. From point 2, the Thai is between the Manager and the French. Since the French is on the left of the trike driver, the Thai cannot be the trike driver. So, the Thai cannot be in the first or third column. Also, the Thai cannot be on the left of the French, so the Thai must be on the right of the French. So, we can write: F - Tr - T.

4. From point 3, the person driving the trike is the person driving the trike. So, the trike driver is in the third row. So, we can write: F - Tr - T in the first row, and Tr in the third row.

5. From point 4, the dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the trike driver is already determined, the dressmaker cannot be in the first or third column. Also, the dressmaker cannot be on the right of the French (as per point 2), so the dressmaker must be in the second column. So, we can write: D - something - T in the second row.

6. From point 5, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in the second column, the snowmobile driver must be in the third column. So, we can write: D - something - T in the second row, and F - Tr - T in the first row, and Tr - S in the third row.

7. Now, we need to fill the jobs for the second and third rows. Since the dressmaker is in the second row, the job in the second row cannot be dressmaker. Also, the Thai is in the third column, so the job in the third row cannot be Thai (as the Thai is not a paramedic). So, the second row must be Manager or Paramedic, and the third row must be Paramedic or Dressmaker.

8. Since the Manager is not in the third row (as the Thai is in the third column), the second row must be Manager, and the third row must be Dressmaker. So, we can write: D - Manager - T in the second row, F - Tr - T in the first row, and Tr - S in the third row.

9. Now, we know that the Manager is in the second row and the second column is filled with the Dressmaker. So, the Manager must be in the third column. So, we can write: D - Manager - T in the second row, F - Tr - T in the first row, and Manager - Tr - S in the third row.

10. Finally, we know that the Thai is in the third column. So, the Thai must be in the first row (as the French is in the first column). So, we can write: D - Manager - T in the second row, F - Tr - T in the first row, and Manager - Tr - S in the third row.

The final solution table is:

2. From point 1.2, we know that the person who likes hip-hop is between the person watching sports movies and the person watching time-travel movies. This means that either hip-hop is in the second position (2) or the third position (3).

3. From point 1.3, we know that the person who likes reggae is to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since hip-hop can't be in the first position (1) because of point 2, reggae must be in the third position (3).

4. From point 1.4, we know that the person who likes r&b is not in the first position (1) or the third position (3) because of points 2 and 3. So, r&b must be in the second position (2).

5. From point 2.2, we know that the person who likes hip-hop is between the person watching sports movies (1) and the person watching time-travel movies (3). Since reggae is in the third position (3), hip-hop must be in the second position (2).

6. From point 3.3, we know that the freelancer is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (3). Since hip-hop and reggae are in the second and third positions (2, 3), the freelancer must be in the first position (1).

Lv5-3x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different beverages, hobbies, and nationalities. So, we can fill in one of each in the first row. Let's start with the beverages:

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         |         |        |      |
   | Nationality   |         |        |      |

2. From point 1 in the puzzle, we know the person drinking Mirinda is not in the first position (since the person who's hobby is cooking is to the left or right of them). So, Mirinda can only be in the second or third position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         |         |        |      |
   | Nationality   |         |        |      |

3. From point 2 in the puzzle, the nigerian is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the Mirinda drinker can't be in the first position, the nigerian can't be in the second position either (because the nigerian is to the right of the cook, and the cook can't be in the second position). So, the nigerian must be in the third position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         |         |        |      |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

4. From point 3 in the puzzle, the person drinking tea is the australian. So, tea must be in the first position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         |         |        | Australian|
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

5. From point 4 in the puzzle, the person drinking tea is on the right of the nigerian. So, lemonade must be in the second position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         |         |        | Australian|
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

6. From point 5 in the puzzle, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the cook (whose hobby is cooking) is in the second position, the collector can't be in the first position. So, the collector must be in the third position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         | Collecting| Cooking | Australian|
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

7. The only hobby left is magic-tricks. Since the cook is in the second position, the magic-trick person must be in the first position.

   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda | Tea  |
   | Hobby         | Magic-tricks| Cooking | Australian|
   | Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage      | Magic-tricks| Lemonade | Tea  |
| Hobby         | Magic-tricks| Cooking | Australian|
| Nationality   | Nigerian|        |      |

Lv5-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 music genres (Ambient, Folk, Indie) and 3 nationalities (Australian, Brazilian, British). Since there are only 3 slots, each nationality must prefer a different music genre. Let's assign them as follows:
   - Australian: Ambient
   - Brazilian: Indie
   - British: Folk

2. Now, let's assign the pets. Since the British is to the right of the fan of Folk, the British cannot be the owner of the pet that is associated with Folk. So, the pet associated with Folk must be either Cat, Pony, or Snake, but not the pet of the British. Let's assign the pet associated with Folk as Cat.
   - Cat: Brazilian (from step 1)

3. Now, the British is the fan of Folk and owns a pet that is not the Cat. So, the British must own the Pony or the Snake. Since the owner of the Snake is to the left of the fan of Ambient, the British cannot own the Snake. So, the British must own the Pony.
   - Pony: British

4. Now, we know that the Australian is the fan of Ambient and the Brazilian is the fan of Indie. Since the owner of the Snake is to the left of the fan of Ambient, the Snake cannot be the pet of the Australian. So, the Snake must be the pet of the remaining nationality, which is the Australian.
   - Snake: Australian

5. Now, the only pet left is the Cat, which was already assigned to the Brazilian.
   - Cat: Brazilian

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient   | Folk    | Indie     |
| Nationality   | Australian | British  | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Snake     | Pony    | Cat       |

|               | Ambient   | Folk    | Indie     |
| Nationality   | Australian | British  | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Snake     | Pony    | Cat       |

Lv5-3x3-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the nationalities in the first column:

   |               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
   | Beverage      |           |          |         |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |         |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian | Canadian | Russian |

2. Since the jazz fan is in an odd position (not position 1, 2, or 3), they must be in position 3. So, the Music-Genre for position 3 is Jazz.

3. Now we know the Canadian is not in position 3 (since they are to the left of the person drinking sprite), so they must be in position 2 or 1. Since the Canadian is in an even position, they must be in position 2. So, the Nationality for position 2 is Canadian.

4. Since the fan of rock is on the left of the Canadian, they must be in position 1. So, the Music-Genre for position 1 is Rock.

5. The only beverage left is sprite, so it must be in position 3. So, the Beverage for position 3 is Sprite.

6. Since the brazilian is the person drinking fanta, they must be in position 1. So, the Nationality for position 1 is Brazilian.

7. Since the russian is the fan of jazz (which we already know is in position 3), they must be in position 2. So, the Nationality for position 2 is Russian.

Here is the final solution table:

   |               |     1     |    2     |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite   | Cola    |
