Lv5-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and an odd position is 1, 3, or 5, the person watching spy movies can't be in position 2 or 4 (as per rule 4). So, the spy movie person is either 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the spy movie person is in position 1 for now.

2. The person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in position 8 (as per rule 8), the lettuce person can't be in position 1 (as per rule 2). So, the lettuce person is either 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the lettuce person is in position 2 for now.

3. The french is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is in position 8 and the lettuce person is in position 2, the french can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the french must be in position 7 or 9. Let's assume the french is in position 7 for now.

4. The french is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the french is in position 7 and the chess person can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (as per rules 1-3 and 5), the chess person must be in position 9.

5. The person watching fantasy movies is in an even position. Since the Egyptian is in position 8, the fantasy movie person can't be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9 (as per rules 1, 4, and 8). So, the fantasy movie person must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the fantasy movie person is in position 4 for now.

6. The malaysian is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the woodworking person is in position 9 (as per rule 4), the malaysian can't be in position 10. So, the malaysian must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, or 9. But since the malaysian can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 9 (as per rules 1-5), the malaysian must be in position 8.

7. The person driving the subway is in an odd position. Since the Egyptian is in position 8 and the malaysian is in position 8, the subway driver can't be in position 8. So, the subway driver must be in position 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. But since the subway driver can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as per rules 1, 3, 5, and 8), the subway driver must be in position 9.

8. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the subway driver is in position 9 and the spy movie person is in position 1 (as per our assumption), the spy movie person must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 10. But since the spy movie person can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 10 (as per rules 1, 3, 5, and 9), the spy movie person must be in position 2 or 4. But since the lettuce person is in position 2 (as per our assumption), the spy movie person must be in position 4.

9. Now, the table looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Food          | carrot    | lettuce  | tomato      |
   | Hobby         | chess     | filmmaking| woodworking  |
   | Movie-Genre   | spy       | fantasy   | zombie      |
   | Nationality   | egyptian  |          | malaysian   |
   | Transport     | subway    |          |             |

10. The person driving the car is the Egyptian (as per rule 8).

11. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is in position 8 and the malaysian is in position 8, the woodworking person can't be in position 8. So, the woodworking person must be in position 1 or 10. But since the carrot and lettuce are already in positions 1 and 2, the woodworking person must be in position 10.

12. The table is now complete:

    |               |     1      |     2     |      3      |
    | Food          | carrot    | lettuce  | tomato      |
    | Hobby         | chess     | filmmaking| woodworking  |
    | Movie-Genre   | spy       | fantasy   | zombie      |
    | Nationality   | egyptian  |          | malaysian   |
    | Transport     | subway    |          | car         |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is either to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Let's assume the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person eating lettuce (otherwise, we can swap the positions of the rows for lemonade and lettuce).

2. From point 2, we know that the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. So, the possible positions for lemonade and action are [1,2], [2,3], or [3,2]. Let's assume the position is [2,3] (otherwise, we can swap the positions of lemonade and action).

3. From point 3, we know that the person watching drama movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating lettuce. Since we placed lemonade to the left of lettuce, drama must be in position 1.

4. From point 4, we know that the owner of the bird is the manager. Since we placed drama in position 1, the only available position for the manager is 3. So, the bird is in position 3.

5. From point 5, we know that the nurse is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we placed lemonade in position 2, the nurse must be in position 3 or 4. However, since the manager (who owns the bird) is in position 3, the nurse must be in position 4.

6. From point 6, we know that the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird. Since the bird is in position 3, the frog can only be in position 4.

7. From point 7, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the nurse is in position 4, milk can only be in position 1 or 2. However, since we placed lemonade in position 2, milk must be in position 1.

8. From point 8, we know that the manager (who owns the bird) is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog. Since the bird is in position 3 and the frog is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

9. From point 9, we know that the owner of the horse is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Since we placed drama in position 1, the horse can only be in position 2 or 3. However, since we placed lemonade in position 2, the horse must be in position 3.

Final solution table:

|               |     1     |       2        |    3    |

Note that we don't have enough information to fill the last row for food, so we left it empty."
Lv5-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the fan of R&B. Let's place the guinea-pig owner and R&B fan in the second and third columns, respectively, as the first and second columns are already occupied by the beverages.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | sprite | water |
   | Job           |        |            |              |
   | Music-Genre   |        |    R&B    |              |
   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig |              |
   | Transport     |        |            |              |

2. The person drinking water is between the person drinking almond-milk and the fan of R&B. So, the water drinker must be in the first column, and the almond-milk drinker must be in the third column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | almond-milk | sprite |

   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig |              |
   | Transport     |        |            |              |

3. The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the librarian. Since the librarian is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position of the horse owner yet. However, we know that the horse owner cannot be in the first column because the horse is not a pet for the water drinker (as per the given information). So, the horse owner can only be in the second or third column.

4. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far right. Since the jet-ski driver cannot be in the first column (as it is occupied by the water drinker), the jet-ski driver must be in the third column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | almond-milk | sprite |

   | Transport     |        |            | jet-ski |

5. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the jet-ski driver is already in the third column, the train driver must be in the first column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | almond-milk | sprite |

   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

6. The person driving the train is on the left of the entrepreneur. So, the entrepreneur must be in the third column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | almond-milk | sprite |
   | Job           | train-driver |            | entrepreneur |
   | Music-Genre   |        |    R&B    |              |
   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

7. The entrepreneur is on the right of the librarian. Since the entrepreneur is already in the third column, the librarian must be in the second column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | librarian | entrepreneur |
   | Job           | train-driver |            |              |
   | Music-Genre   |        |    R&B    |              |
   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

8. The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of blues. Since the R&B fan is in the second column, the pop fan must be in the third column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | water | librarian | pop-fan |
   | Job           | train-driver |            | entrepreneur |
   | Music-Genre   |        |    R&B    | blues |
   | Pet           |        |    guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

Now, let's find the remaining jobs, pets, and music genres:

9. The only remaining job is the doctor. Since the librarian is in the second column, the doctor must be in the first column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | doctor | librarian | pop-fan |
   | Job           |       |            | entrepreneur |
   | Music-Genre   | sprite |    R&B    | blues |
   | Pet           | almond-milk | guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

10. The only remaining pet is the turtle. Since the horse owner is in the second column and the guinea-pig owner is in the third column, the turtle owner must be in the first column.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | doctor | librarian | pop-fan |
   | Job           | doctor | librarian | entrepreneur |
   | Music-Genre   | sprite |    R&B    | blues |
   | Pet           | turtle | guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | boat   |            | jet-ski |

Now, let's find the remaining transport:

11. Since the boat is already in the first row, the remaining transport is the train.

   |               |   1    |     2      |      3       |
   | Beverage      | doctor | librarian | pop-fan |
   | Job           | doctor | librarian | entrepreneur |
   | Music-Genre   | sprite |    R&B    | blues |
   | Pet           | turtle | guinea-pig | horse |
   | Transport     | train |            | jet-ski |

We have now filled all the cells in the table.

Lv5-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the hamster eats papaya, so let's place the hamster owner with papaya. Since there are only three food options, the owner of the grapefruit must eat either tomato or papaya, but not grapefruit. Similarly, the owner of the lizard must eat either grapefruit or tomato. Let's place the owner of the lizard with grapefruit for now.

2. The owner of the horse is between the owner of the hamster and the videographer. Since the hamster owner is already placed, the horse owner must be either the owner of the lizard (if the lizard owner is the videographer) or the videographer himself (if the lizard owner is not the videographer).

Lv5-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and we have 5 clues that specify the relative positions of some people, we can deduce the positions of all people.

2. From clue 5, we know that the person driving the car is in an even position. Since there are 6 positions (3 for each row), the car driver must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

3. From clue 6, we know that the person who bakes is to the left of the person who plays soccer. Since the car driver is in an even position, the baker must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. From clue 7, we know that the Turkish is to the right of the person who plays water-polo. Since the car driver is in an even position, the Turkish cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6. So, the Turkish must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

5. From clue 1, we know that the airplane driver is to the left of the Canadian. Since the car driver is in position 2, the Canadian cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the Canadian must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

6. From clue 2, we know that the person who plays water-polo is on the left or right of the person who has camping as a hobby. Since the Turkish is to the right of the water-polo player, the camper must be to the left of the water-polo player. Since the Canadian cannot be in position 1 or 2, the camper must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

7. From clue 3, we know that the analyst is between the Turkish and the doctor. Since the Turkish cannot be in position 1 or 2, the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 2 either. So, the analyst must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

8. From clue 4, we know that the analyst is between the person who plays soccer and the person who has camping as a hobby. Since the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 2, the soccer player must be in position 1 or 3, and the camper in position 3 or 5.

9. Since the analyst cannot be in position 1 or 2, the only remaining position for the analyst is position 4. This means the soccer player is in position 1, the camper is in position 3, and the Turkish is in position 5.

10. Now we know the positions of the Turkish, Canadian, and analyst. Since the Turkish is in position 5, the Canadian must be in position 6, and the baker must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (but not 1 since the Canadian is in position 6). Since the soccer player is in position 1, the baker cannot be in position 3, so the baker must be in position 5.

11. This leaves position 3 for the person who has gardening as a hobby and plays golf as a sport. The person who drives the van must be the one with gardening as a hobby since there is only one position left.

Lv5-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person eating peas on the leftmost side, as the person eating cherry is to the right of them. Let's place peas in position 1.

2. Since the person eating cherry is to the right of the person eating peas, we can place cherry in position 3. This leaves position 2 for garlic.

3. Now, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the fan of country. Since we already have peas and cherry placed, the only available position for gardening is position 1. This means the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 3, as they are to the right of the fan of ambient.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of ambient. Since we already have cherry, peas, and gardening placed, the only available position for ambient is position 2.

5. The person drinking sprite is between the owner of the horse and the fan of country. Since we already have cherry, peas, gardening, and ambient placed, the only available positions for horse and country are positions 1 and 3. If country is in position 1, then sprite must be in position 2, but this would violate rule 6 (the person drinking sprite is not between the owner of the horse and the fan of country). Therefore, country must be in position 3, and sprite must be in position 1.

6. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person eating garlic. Since we already have sprite in position 1 and garlic in position 2, this rule is satisfied.

7. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we already have sprite in position 1, the only available positions for lemonade are positions 2 and 3. If lemonade is in position 2, then the person eating garlic would have to be in position 3, which would violate rule 6 (the person drinking sprite is not between the owner of the horse and the fan of country). Therefore, lemonade must be in position 3.

8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since we already have all other beverages placed, the only available position for water is position 2.

9. The owner of the frog is the person drinking sprite. This is already satisfied, as we have sprite in position 1.

10. The person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the person eating lemonade. Since we already have garlic in position 2 and lemonade in position 3, this rule is satisfied.

Lv5-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill the first row with the 3 different beverages, hobbies, music-genres, nationalities, and transport. Let's fill the first column randomly with one of each:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping | classical | american | boat |
   | mirinda | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | car |
   | sprite | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | train |

2. From point 1, we know that the American is driving the boat. So, we swap the American and the boat in the second and fifth columns:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping | classical | boat (american) | car |
   | mirinda | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | sprite | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

3. From point 2, we know that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. Since the American is driving the boat, the person drinking sprite cannot be the American. So, the person drinking sprite must be either the Dutch or the Spanish. Let's assume the Dutch is drinking sprite for now:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping | classical | boat (american) | car |
   | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

4. From point 3, we know that the fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the Dutch is drinking sprite, the person with the hobby of camping must be the Spanish or the American. Let's assume the American is camping for now:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car |
   | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

5. From point 4, we know that the American is in an even position. Since the American is already in the first position, the Spanish must be in the third position:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car |
   | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

6. From point 5, we know that the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat (the American). So, the person drinking mirinda must be the Dutch or the Spanish. Since the Spanish is already in the third position, the Dutch must be drinking mirinda:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car |
   | mirinda | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | sprite | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

7. From point 6, we know that the person driving the car is the fan of classical. Since the Dutch is drinking mirinda and the American is camping, the only person left is the Spanish. So, the Spanish is driving the car:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
   | mirinda | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | sprite | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

8. From point 7, we know that the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the Spanish is driving the car, the Dutch must be drinking sprite:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
   | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

9. From point 8, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the American is driving the boat, the Dutch must be on the right of the American:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
   | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train |
   | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

10. From point 9, we know that the person driving the train is on the left of the American. Since the American is already in the first position, the person driving the train must be the Spanish:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

11. From point 10, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is on the far left. Since the American is camping, the only person left is the Dutch. So, the Dutch has the hobby of writing:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

12. From point 11, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is on the far left. Since the Dutch is already in the second position with the hobby of writing, the American must have the hobby of camping:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess  | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

13. From point 12, we know that the person with the hobby of chess is on the far right. Since the Spanish is already in the third position with the hobby of writing, the only person left is the American. So, the American has the hobby of chess:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess (american) | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

14. From point 13, we know that the person with the hobby of chess is on the far right. Since the American is already in the first position with the hobby of camping, the only position left for the hobby of chess is the third position. So, the Spanish has the hobby of chess:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | camping (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess (american) | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

15. From point 14, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is on the far left. Since the Dutch is already in the second position with the hobby of chess, the only position left for the hobby of writing is the first position. So, the American has the hobby of writing:

    | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
    |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
    | coffee  | writing (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
    | sprite | chess (american) | d&b       | dutch      | train (spanish) |
    | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat |

16. From point 15, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is on the far left. Since the American is already in the first position with the hobby of writing, the beverage of the American must be coffee.

17. From point 16, we know that the person with the hobby of camping is the American. Since the American is already drinking coffee, the only beverage left for the Dutch is mirinda.

18. From point 17, we know that the person with the hobby of chess is the Spanish. Since the Dutch is drinking mirinda, the only beverage left for the Spanish is sprite.

19. From point 18, we know that the person driving the car is the Spanish. Since the Spanish is already in the third position with the hobby of chess, the music-genre of the Spanish must be hip-hop.

20. From point 19, we know that the person driving the boat is the American. Since the American is already in the first position with the hobby of writing, the music-genre of the American must be classical.

21. From point 20, we know that the person driving the train is the Dutch. Since the Dutch is already in the second position with the hobby of chess, the music-genre of the Dutch must be d&b.

So, the final solution table is:

   | Beverage | Hobby | Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |---------|-------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | coffee  | writing (american) | classical | boat (american) | car (spanish) |
   | sprite | chess (american) | d&b       | dutch      | train (dutch) |
   | mirinda | writing (dutch) | hip-hop    | spanish    | boat (spanish) |

Lv5-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the rows with the given categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Pet).

2. From point 1, we have 3 different beverages, so we can write them in the Beverage column: Coffee, Fanta, Tea.

3. Similarly, we have 3 different foods, so we can write them in the Food column: Carrot, Lemon, Orange.

4. We have 3 different hobbies, so we can write them in the Hobby column: Singing, Traveling, Writing.

5. We have 3 different movie genres, so we can write them in the Movie-Genre column: Documentary, Spy, Zombie.

6. We have 3 different pets, so we can write them in the Pet column: Chinchilla, Frog, Rat.

7. Now let's solve the positions based on the given clues:

   - From point 2, we know that the person drinking Fanta is between the person watching Spy movies and the owner of the Rat. So, Fanta cannot be in the first position (as it would have no one on its left), and it cannot be in the third position (as it would have no one on its right). Therefore, Fanta must be in the second position.

   - From point 2, we also know that the person watching Spy movies is to the left of the owner of the Rat. So, Spy cannot be in the third position (as it would be on the right of Rat), and it cannot be in the last position (as it would be on the right of Fanta). Therefore, Spy must be in the first position.

   - From point 3, we know that the person watching Spy movies is on the left of the owner of the Chinchilla. So, Chinchilla cannot be in the first position (as it would be on the left of Spy), and it cannot be in the last position (as it would be on the right of Fanta). Therefore, Chinchilla must be in the second last position.

   - From point 4, we know that the person watching Zombie movies is the person drinking Coffee. So, Coffee must be in the position where Zombie is (which we don't know yet).

   - From point 5, we know that the person eating Carrot is on the left or right of the person eating Lemon. Since the person eating Lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is Singing (point 6), and Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea (point 8), the person eating Carrot cannot be in the first position (as it would be on the left of Lemon), and it cannot be in the last position (as it would be on the right of Tea). Therefore, Carrot must be in the second position.

   - From point 6, we know that the person eating Lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is Singing. Since Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea (point 8), the person eating Lemon must be in the third position.

   - From point 7, we know that the owner of the Chinchilla is on the right of the person who's hobby is Traveling. Since Traveling is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of Chinchilla yet.

   - From point 8, we know that the person who's hobby is Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea. Since Tea is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of Singing yet.

   - From point 5, we know that the person eating Orange is somewhere to the left of the owner of the Chinchilla. Since Chinchilla is in the second last position, Orange must be in the first, second, or fourth position. However, since the person eating Carrot is on the left of the person eating Orange (point 5), Orange cannot be in the fourth position. Therefore, Orange must be in the first or second position.

   - Since Orange cannot be in the first position (as it would be on the left of Fanta, violating point 2), Orange must be in the second position.

   - Now we know that the person eating Orange is in the second position. Since the person eating Carrot is on the left of the person eating Orange, the person eating Carrot must be in the first position.

   - Now we know that the person eating Carrot is in the first position and the person eating Orange is in the second position. Since the person eating Lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is Singing, and Singing is on the right of the person drinking Tea, the person eating Lemon must be in the third position.

   - Now we know that the person eating Lemon is in the third position. Since the owner of the Chinchilla is on the right of the person who's hobby is Traveling, and Traveling is not yet placed, the person who's hobby is Traveling must be in the fourth position.

   - Now we know that the person who's hobby is Traveling is in the fourth position. Since the person drinking Tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is Singing, and Singing is in the first position, the person drinking Tea must be in the second last position.

   - Now we know that the person drinking Tea is in the second last position. Since the person watching Zombie movies is the person drinking Coffee, and Coffee is not yet placed, Coffee must be in the last position.

   - Now we know that the person drinking Coffee is in the last position. Since the owner of the Rat is between the person watching Spy movies and the person drinking Fanta, and Spy is in the first position and Fanta is in the second position, the owner of the Rat must be in the third position.

   - Now we know that the owner of the Rat is in the third position. Since the person watching Spy movies is on the left of the owner of the Chinchilla, and Chinchilla is in the second last position, the person watching Spy movies must be in the second position.

   - Now we know that the person watching Spy movies is in the second position. Since the person watching Zombie movies is the person drinking Coffee, and Coffee is in the last position, the person watching Zombie movies must be in the fourth position.

8. Here is the final solution table:

   |               |     1     |      2      |    3    |    4    |
   | Beverage      | Coffee    | Fanta      | Tea    |         |
   | Food          | Carrot   | Orange     | Lemon  |         |

Lv5-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and we have 5 constraints that involve being to the left or right of someone else, we can deduce that each person is either in the first, second, or third position.

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the first, second, and third positions: Dutch (1), Japanese (2), Malaysian (3).

3. From constraint 8, the Malaysian cannot be in the third position because they cannot be to the right of the person drinking mirinda. So, the Malaysian must be in the first position.

4. Now, the Dutch is in the second position. From constraint 9, the fan of r&b must be in the third position, and the fan of d&b must be in the first position (since the fan of r&b is between the Dutch and the fan of d&b).

5. The gospel fan cannot be in the first position because they are to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, and the card-games hobbyist is in the second position (the Dutch). So, the gospel fan must be in the third position.

6. Now, the card-games hobbyist is in the second position (Dutch). From constraint 3, the drawing hobbyist is to the left of the card-games hobbyist. So, the drawing hobbyist must be in the first position.

7. The remaining hobby is photography. From constraint 5, the drawing hobbyist is to the left of the photography hobbyist. So, the photography hobbyist must be in the third position.

8. Now, the remaining beverages are mirinda, soy-milk, and sprite. From constraint 4, the lemon eater is between the sprite drinker and the gospel fan. Since the gospel fan is in the third position, the sprite drinker must be in the second position. So, the mirinda drinker is in the first position.

9. The remaining food is apricot and onion. From constraint 1, the lemon eater is to the right of the onion eater. Since the sprite drinker is in the second position, the onion eater must be in the first position. So, the apricot eater is in the third position.

The final solution table is:

Lv5-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the videographer is on the far left, we can place the videographer in the first column under Job. Since the fan of blues is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, the fan of blues cannot be in the first column, so it must be in the second or third column. Let's place the fan of blues in the second column under Music-Genre.

2. Since the person eating potato is on the far left, the person eating potato must be in the first column under Food.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the videographer is on the far left, the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in the first column. So, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the second column under Beverage.

4. The fan of funk is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person eating potato is in the first column, the owner of the chinchilla cannot be in the first row. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the second or third row. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in the second column, the owner of the chinchilla cannot be in the second row under Beverage. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the third row. Let's place the owner of the chinchilla in the third row under Pet.

5. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the designer. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in the second column and the owner of the chinchilla is in the third row, the person drinking milk cannot be in the third row. So, the person drinking milk must be in the first row. Since the person eating potato is in the first column, the person drinking milk cannot be in the first column. So, the person drinking milk must be in the third column under Beverage.

6. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in the third row, the owner of the horse cannot be in the third row. So, the owner of the horse must be in the second row. Let's place the owner of the horse in the second row under Pet.

7. The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since the owner of the horse is in the second row, the person eating kale cannot be in the second row. So, the person eating kale must be in the first row. Since the person eating potato is in the first column and the person drinking milk is in the third column, the person eating kale must be in the second column under Food.

8. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the horse is in the second row, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in the second row. So, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first row or the third row. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in the second column and the person eating kale is in the second column, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in the second column. So, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first row under Beverage.

9. Since all the other positions are filled, the only remaining position is the third column under Food. So, the person eating mango must be in the third column under Food.

Here is the final solution table:
