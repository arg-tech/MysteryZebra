Lv5-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person who rows is between the salsa music fan and the person who prefers sailing. Let's place the rower in the middle (position 3). Since salsa is a specific type of music, it can't be in the first or last position, so it must be in position 2. Sailing must be in position 1, and baseball in position 4.

2. From point 2, the project-manager is to the right of the apricot eater. Since we know the rower is in position 3, the project-manager can't be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 4. The manager must be in position 1, and the social-worker in position 2 or 3.

3. From point 3, the documentary watcher is to the left of the writer. Since the project-manager is in position 4, the writer can't be in position 4, so it must be in position 1 or 2. The documentary watcher must be in position 3.

4. From point 4, the garlic eater is on the far left or far right. Since the documentary watcher, project-manager, and rower are all placed, the garlic eater can't be in position 1 or 3, so it must be in position 2.

5. From point 5, the social-worker is to the left of the blueberry eater. Since the garlic eater is in position 2, the social-worker can't be in position 3, so it must be in position 1. This means the blueberry eater is in position 4.

6. From point 6, the social-worker is to the right of the rock music fan. Since the social-worker is in position 1, the rock music fan must be in position 2.

7. From point 7, the hiker is to the left of the thriller watcher. Since the social-worker is in position 1, the hiker can't be in position 2, so it must be in position 3. The thriller watcher must be in position 4.

8. From point 8, the sports movie watcher is to the right of the garlic eater. Since the garlic eater is in position 2, the sports movie watcher must be in position 3.

9. From point 9, the video-games hobbyist is on the far left. Since the hiker is in position 3, the video-games hobbyist must be in position 1.

10. The only food left is blueberry, so it must be in position 4.

11. The only movie genre left is documentary, so it must be in position 3.

12. The only job left is manager, so it must be in position 1.

13. The only hobby left is hiking, so it must be in position 3.

14. The only music genre left is rock, so it must be in position 2.

15. The only sport left is baseball, so it must be in position 4.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv5-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet) and 3 instances for each. Let's assign a number from 1 to 3 to each instance for each variable.

2. From point 1, we know that the person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. So, let's place the person eating pumpkin in the second position (column 2) for the Food variable. Now, the person watching family movies must be in the first position (column 1).

3. The person watching spy movies is between the Mexican and the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pumpkin is in the second position, the Mexican must be in the third position (column 3) for the Nationality variable. The person eating pepper must be in the second position for the Food variable, so it's column 2. The person watching spy movies must be in the middle, so it's column 2 for the Movie-Genre variable.

4. Now, the person with the hobby of board-games is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog and the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is in the second position for the Movie-Genre variable, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in the first position for the Hobby variable. The owner of the frog must be in the third position for the Pet variable.

5. The person with the hobby of board-games is also somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is in the second position for the Movie-Genre variable, the person with the hobby of board-games must be in the first position for the Hobby variable.

6. The person with the hobby of chess is on the left or right of the Turkish. Since the Mexican is in the third position for the Nationality variable, the Turkish must be in the second position. The person with the hobby of chess can be in either the first or second position for the Hobby variable.

7. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is on the right of the British (point 7), the owner of the guinea-pig must be on the left of the owner of the rat. So, the owner of the rat must be in the third position for the Pet variable, and the owner of the guinea-pig can be in either the first or second position for the Pet variable.

8. The person eating mango is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking cola (point 9), the person drinking sprite must be in the middle. The person eating mango can be in either the first or third position for the Food variable.

9. The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking cola. So, the person drinking water must be in the first position for the Beverage variable, and the person drinking cola must be in the third position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | water      | sprite   | cola     |
| Food          | mango      | pumpkin  | pepper   |
| Hobby         | board-games | chess    | traveling |
| Movie-Genre   | family     | spy      | disaster  |
| Nationality   | british    | mexican  | turkish  |
| Pet           | frog       | guinea-pig| rat      |

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact order of the hobby, movie-genre, and pet variables for the first and second positions, we can't fill in the exact order. However, we know the possible combinations for the first and second positions for each variable.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |      1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | water      | sprite   | cola     |
| Food          | mango      | pumpkin  | pepper   |
| Hobby         | board-games | chess    | traveling |
| Movie-Genre   | family     | spy      | disaster  |
| Nationality   | british    | mexican  | turkish  |
| Pet           | frog       | guinea-pig| rat      |
#############

The possible combinations for the first and second positions are:

For the first position:
- Hobby: board-games
- Movie-Genre: family or disaster
- Pet: frog or guinea-pig

For the second position:
- Hobby: chess
- Movie-Genre: spy
- Pet: guinea-pig or rat"
Lv5-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each person will be in one category of each row.

2. Since the person driving the subway is in the middle, we can place the subway driver in the middle row (row 3).

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position, so it can be either 1, 3, or 5. However, since the subway driver is in the middle (3), the rock-climber cannot be in position 3 (as per rule 2). So, the rock-climber must be either 1 or 5. Let's assume the rock-climber is in position 1 for now.

4. The person driving the van is the person who's hobby is singing, so the singing person must be in position 3 (as per rule 4).

5. The person eating broccoli is somewhere to the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since the rock-climber (who is also the turkish, as per rule 5) is in position 1, the broccoli eater cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as the singing person is in position 3). So, the broccoli eater must be in position 2.

6. The gardener is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since the broccoli eater is in position 2, the gardener can be in position 1 or 3. However, the gardener cannot be in position 1 (as the rock-climber is already there), so the gardener must be in position 3.

7. The person eating lime is on the right of the turkish. Since the rock-climber (who is also the turkish) is in position 1, the lime eater must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, the lime eater cannot be in position 2 (as the broccoli eater is there), so the lime eater must be in position 4 or 6. Let's assume the lime eater is in position 4 for now.

8. The fisherman is on the far left. Since the gardener is in position 3 and the rock-climber is in position 1, the fisherman must be in position 6.

9. The fan of punk is somewhere to the right of the fan of folk. Since the gardener is in position 3 and the rock-climber is in position 1, the fan of folk must be in position 2 or 4. However, the fan of folk cannot be in position 2 (as the broccoli eater is there), so the fan of folk must be in position 4. This means the fan of punk must be in position 5.

10. The argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the fisherman is in position 6, the argentine cannot be in position 6. So, the argentine must be in position 1.

11. The architect is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the subway driver is in position 3 and the argentine is in position 1, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2. So, the architect must be in position 5.

12. The architect is on the left of the argentine. However, this contradicts rule 11. There seems to be a mistake in rule 11 or 12. If we ignore rule 11 or 12, the solution would be as follows:

|               |       1       |     2     |      3       |
| Food          | argentine   | broccoli | lime         |
| Hobby         | gardening   | rock-climbing | singing |
| Job           | architect   | fisherman | entrepreneur |
| Music-Genre   | folk        | punk      | hip-hop      |
| Nationality   | argentine   | polish    | turkish     |
| Transport     | subway      | van       | jet-ski      |

However, with the given rules, there seems to be a contradiction in rules 11 and 12, and the puzzle cannot be solved as it stands."
Lv5-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the librarian is to the left of the person who's sport is rowing, and the person who's sport is rowing is the person drinking tea (from point 8), the librarian must be either in the first or second position, drinking either milk, mirinda, or tea.

2. The person eating nectarine is to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is in the third position (from point 1), the person eating nectarine must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth position.

3. The fan of country is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we don't know the position of the volleyball player yet, we can't place the country fan yet.

4. The person drinking mirinda is to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person who's sport is rowing (and thus the librarian) is in the first or second position, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth position.

5. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since the person watching family movies can't be in the first position (because the librarian is there), they must be in the second, fourth, or sixth position.

6. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the architect. Since the librarian is in the first or second position, the architect can't be in the first position, so the person eating pomegranate can be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth position.

7. The person drinking tea is between the person eating cucumber and the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is in the third position, the person drinking tea must be in the second position (to the left of the zombie watcher) and the person eating cucumber must be in the fourth position.

8. Now we know that the librarian is in the first position, drinking tea. The person watching zombie movies is in the third position. The person drinking tea is between the person eating cucumber and the person watching zombie movies, so the person eating cucumber is in the fourth position.

9. The person watching family movies is in the second position. The person watching family movies is on the left of the fan of ambient, so the fan of ambient must be in the fifth or sixth position.

10. The person eating nectarine is in the fifth position. Since the fan of country is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball, and we know the positions of the librarian, the person watching zombie movies, the person watching family movies, and the person eating nectarine, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in the sixth position.

11. The person drinking mirinda is in the sixth position, to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we know the positions of the librarian, the person watching zombie movies, the person watching family movies, the person eating nectarine, and the person who's sport is volleyball, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in the fourth position.

12. The person eating pomegranate is in the fourth position, to the left or right of the architect. Since we know the positions of the librarian, the person watching zombie movies, the person watching family movies, the person eating nectarine, the person who's sport is volleyball, the person who's sport is biathlon, and the person drinking mirinda, the architect must be in the fifth position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating watermelon is the person drinking lemonade, we can place watermelon under 'Food' in column 2 and lemonade under 'Beverage' in row 1. Let's place watermelon in column 3 and lemonade in column 1.

2. Now, we know that the person drinking lemonade is in column 1. Since the fan of punk is on the far left or far right of the person drinking lemonade (column 1), and the fan of techno is on the far right, punk must be in column 2 and techno in column 3.

3. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right, so it can't be in column 1 (since punk is there) or column 3 (since techno is there). Therefore, it must be in column 2.

4. The fan of punk is on the far left or far right, so it can't be in column 2 (since 7up is there). Therefore, it must be in column 1 or 3. Since the fan of techno is on the far right, the fan of punk must be in column 1.

5. Now, the person drinking 7up is in column 2. The person watching crime movies is the person eating cauliflower and is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since we don't know the position of sports movies yet, let's place crime movies in column 3 and cauliflower in column 2.

6. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since we placed mystery movies in column 3 and 7up in column 2, mystery movies must be in column 3.

7. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we placed cauliflower in column 2, the rabbit must be in column 1 or 3. Let's place the rabbit in column 1 for now.

8. The person watching crime movies is the person eating cauliflower, so they are in column 2. Since crime movies are to the right of sports movies, sports movies must be in column 1.

9. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since we placed mystery movies in column 3 and 7up in column 2, mystery movies can be in either column 1 or 3. However, since the person watching crime movies is to the right of the person watching mystery movies, mystery movies must be in column 1.

10. The person watching sports movies is in column 1.

11. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since we placed sports movies in column 1 (which is the leftmost position), the person driving the skateboard must be in column 3. Since the fan of techno is driving the car, the person driving the skateboard must be the owner of the ferret. So, let's place the ferret in column 2.

12. The person driving the car is the fan of techno, so it's in column 3.

13. Now, we have filled all the positions except for grapes. Since the person eating grapes can't be in column 1 (since it's occupied by watermelon and sports movies), it can't be in column 3 (since it's occupied by techno and the ferret). Therefore, it must be in column 2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |      3      |

Lv5-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 columns.

|               |      1       |      2       |       3       |

| Nationality   |              |              |               |
| Sport         |              |              |               |

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since there are 3 different hobbies, we can fill in one hobby in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Collecting
   - Column 2: Fishing
   - Column 3: Traveling

3. Now let's fill in the jobs. Since there are 3 different jobs, we can fill in one job in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Social-worker (since the person watching western movies is the American, and we know the American is on column 2, the job of the person in column 1 must be different from the photographer, so it's either social-worker or freelancer. Since the freelancer is to the left of the fan of funk, and the fan of funk is to the right of the photographer, the job of the person in column 1 cannot be freelancer, so it's social-worker.)
   - Column 2: Photographer (since the person watching western movies is the American, and we know the American is in column 2)
   - Column 3: Freelancer (since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the American, and the person in column 1 is a social-worker, so the person in column 3 must be the freelancer)

4. Now let's fill in the movie-genres. Since there are 3 different movie-genres, we can fill in one genre in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Martial-arts (since the fan of house watches martial-arts movies)
   - Column 2: Satire (since the American watches western movies, and we know the person in column 2 is the photographer, so the genre of the person in column 2 must be different from the genres of the people in columns 1 and 3, and since the fan of house watches martial-arts movies, the genre of the person in column 2 cannot be house, so it's satire)
   - Column 3: Western (since the American watches western movies, and we know the person in column 3 is the freelancer, so the genre of the person in column 3 must be western)

5. Now let's fill in the music-genres. Since there are 3 different music-genres, we can fill in one genre in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Ambient (since the ambient fan is to the right of the freelancer, and the freelancer is in column 3, so the ambient fan must be in column 1)
   - Column 2: Funk (since the fan of funk is to the right of the photographer, and the photographer is in column 2, so the fan of funk must be in column 2)
   - Column 3: House (since the fan of house watches martial-arts movies, and we know the person in column 3 is the freelancer, so the music genre of the person in column 3 must be house)

6. Now let's fill in the nationalities. Since there are 3 different nationalities, we can fill in one nationality in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Italian (since the fan of ambient is to the left of the person who's sport is cricket, and the person in column 1 is the Italian, so the person who's sport is cricket must be in column 2 or 3)
   - Column 2: American (since the person watching western movies is the American, and we know the American is in column 2)
   - Column 3: Malaysian (since the malaysian is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling, and the person in column 3 is the Malaysian, so the person who's sport is cycling must be in column 1 or 2, but since the person in column 1 is the Italian, the person who's sport is cycling must be in column 2)

7. Now let's fill in the sports. Since there are 3 different sports, we can fill in one sport in each column. Let's say:
   - Column 1: Cycling (since the malaysian is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling, and the malaysian is in column 3, so the person who's sport is cycling must be in column 1)
   - Column 2: Water-polo (since the person who's sport is cycling is the Italian, and we know the Italian is in column 1, so the person who's sport is water-polo must be in column 2)
   - Column 3: Cricket (since the person who's sport is cricket is the American, and we know the American is in column 2, so the person who's sport is cricket must be in column 3)

1. Since there are 3 people and an even number of positions, the coffee drinker must be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the coffee drinker is in position 4 for now.

2. The Mexican eats papaya, so we can place the Mexican in position 3 (since the strawberry eater is on the far right and there's only one position left).

3. Now, the coffee drinker must be to the right of the electrician. Since the electrician can't be in position 1 (because the Mexican is in position 3), the electrician can only be in position 2 or 6. Let's assume the electrician is in position 2 for now.

4. The french is to the right of the photographer. Since the Mexican is in position 3, the photographer can only be in position 1 or 5. Let's place the photographer in position 1 for now.

5. The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the photographer is in position 1, the fan of funk can only be in position 2 or 6. Let's place the fan of funk in position 2 for now.

6. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical. Since the photographer is in position 1 and the fan of classical can't be in position 3 (because the strawberry eater is there), the fan of classical can only be in position 2 or 6. Let's place the fan of classical in position 6 for now.

7. Now, the person drinking water must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, or 5). Since the water drinker can't be in position 1 (because the photographer is there), the water drinker can only be in position 4 or 5. However, the water drinker can't be in position 5 because the coffee drinker is there, so the water drinker must be in position 4.

8. The person eating strawberry is on the far right, so it must be in position 3.

9. The person drinking water is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the water drinker is in position 4 and the hiker can't be in position 1 (because the photographer is there) or position 3 (because the strawberry eater is there), the hiker can only be in position 2.

10. Now, we have a complete arrangement:

|               |      1      |      2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | coffee     | electrician | water     |
| Food          | kiwi       | papaya      | strawberry|
| Hobby         | photography | card-games  | hiking    |
| Job           | dancer     | photographer | electrician|
| Music-Genre   | classical  | funk        | d&b       |
| Nationality   | american   | french      | mexican   |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv5-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items (beverages, jobs, music-genres, pets, sports, transport) to be placed in the table. Since there are 3 of each, we can fill in the first row with the unique items from each category. Let's start with the beverages:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | lemonade | milk          |

2. Now let's fill in the jobs. Since the librarian is on the far right, we can place them in the rightmost position:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | lemonade | milk          |
   | Job           | librarian|         | paramedic     |

3. We know that the paramedic is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the librarian is on the far right, the paramedic cannot be in the rightmost position. So, the paramedic must be in the first or second position. Let's place them in the second position for now:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | paramedic| milk          |
   | Job           | librarian|         | mechanic      |

4. Now we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the paramedic is in the second position, the lemonade cannot be in the first position. So, the lemonade must be in the third position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | paramedic| lemonade     |
   | Job           | librarian|         | mechanic      |

5. We know that the fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the mechanic's job is in the third position, the blues fan cannot be in the first or third position. So, the blues fan must be in the second position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | blues    | lemonade     |
   | Job           | librarian| mechanic | paramedic    |

6. Now we know that the owner of the fish is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since the paramedic is in the second position and the blues fan is in the second-to-last position, the fish owner cannot be in the first or last position. So, the fish owner must be in the third position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | blues    | fish         |
   | Job           | librarian| mechanic | paramedic    |

7. We know that the person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in the second position, the roller driver cannot be in the first position. So, the roller driver must be in the third position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | 7up      | blues    | roller       |
   | Job           | librarian| mechanic | paramedic    |

8. Now we know that the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the mechanic's job is in the second position, the rowing person must be in the first position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | blues    | roller       |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| paramedic    |

9. We know that the person driving the jet-ski is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the fish. Since the roller driver is in the third position and the fish owner is in the third-from-last position, the jet-ski driver cannot be in the last position. So, the jet-ski driver must be in the fourth position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | blues    | roller       |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         |             |

10. Now we know that the owner of the rat is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the librarian is in the second position, the rat owner cannot be in the first position. So, the rat owner must be in the third position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | blues    | rat          |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         |             |
   | Pet           |         |         | fish         |

11. We know that the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position. Since the rat owner is in the third position, the rabbit owner must be in the first position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | blues    | rat          |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         | fish         |
   | Pet           | rabbit   |         |             |

12. We know that the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in the second position, the 7up drinker must be in the third, fourth, or fifth position. Since the transport and pet have already been filled, the 7up drinker must be in the fourth position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | blues    | rat          |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         | fish         |
   | Pet           | rabbit   |         | 7up          |
   | Sport         |         |         | swimming     |

13. We know that the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the mechanic's job is in the first position, the swimmer cannot be in the first position. So, the swimmer must be in the second position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | swimming | rat          |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         | fish         |
   | Pet           | rabbit   |         | 7up          |
   | Sport         | weightlifting|         |             |

14. Finally, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in the last position. Let's place it there:

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      | rowing   | swimming | rat          |
   | Job           | mechanic | librarian| jet-ski     |
   | Transport     | tram     |         | fish         |
   | Pet           | rabbit   |         | 7up          |
   | Sport         |         | weightlifting|             |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We'll start by placing the people and their jobs. Since the firefighter is to the left of the social worker and the journalist is to the left of the person drinking water, we can place them in the first three spots from left to right: Firefighter, Social Worker, Journalist.

2. Now, we know the person driving the car is to the left of the social worker and the person driving the car is also to the left of the journalist. So, the car driver must be the firefighter. Let's place the car driver in the first position, making it Firefighter (Car).

3. Since the car driver is on the right of the person driving the skateboard, the skateboard driver must be in the second or third position. However, the journalist is to the left of the person driving the skateboard, so the skateboard driver cannot be in the second position (Journalist). Therefore, the skateboard driver must be in the third position, making it Social Worker (Skateboard).

4. Now, we know the journalist is in the second position, so we can place the job of Journalist in the second row, making it Journalist (#########).

5. Since the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the journalist, and the journalist is in the second position, the person drinking cola can be in the first or third position. However, the firefighter (Car) is in the first position, so the person drinking cola must be in the third position. Let's place Cola in the third row, making it Cola (#########).

6. Now, the person drinking water must be in the second position, so we can place Water in the second row, making it Water (#########).

7. Since the person eating apple is on the left of the person eating zucchini, and the journalist and the person drinking water are already placed, the person eating apple must be in the first position. Let's place Apple in the first row, making it Apple (#########).

8. Now, the person eating zucchini must be in the third position. Let's place Zucchini in the third row, making it Zucchini (#########).

9. Since the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking 7up, and the person drinking cola is already placed, the person drinking 7up must be in the second position. Let's place 7up in the second row, making it 7up (#########).

10. Now, the owner of the rabbit must be in the third position. Let's place Rabbit in the third row, making it Rabbit (#########).

11. Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person owning the turtle, and the social worker (Skateboard) is in the third position, the person driving the quad-bike must be in the second position. Let's place Quad-Bike in the second row, making it Quad-Bike (#########).

12. Now, the owner of the turtle must be in the first position. Let's place Turtle in the first row, making it Turtle (#########).

13. Since the person playing ice-hockey is on the right of the person playing water-polo, and the journalist is in the second position, the person playing water-polo must be in the first position. Let's place Water-Polo in the first row, making it Water-Polo (#########).

14. Now, the person playing ice-hockey must be in the third position. Let's place Ice-Hockey in the third row, making it Ice-Hockey (#########).

15. Since the person playing ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating mango, and the person eating zucchini is already placed, the person eating mango must be in the second position. Let's place Mango in the second row, making it Mango (#########).

Now, the final solution table is:

|             |      1      |     2      |       3       |

| Food        |  Apple     |      Mango  |      Zucchini  |
| Job         |  Firefighter|     Journalist| Social-Worker  |
| Pet         |  Turtle    |      Rabbit  |      Hedgehog  |
| Sport       |  Water-Polo|     Ice-Hockey|      -polo     |
| Transport   |  Car       |     Quad-Bike| Skateboard     |

Lv5-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Job, Pet, Sport, Transport) and 3 instances for each variable. Let's assign them alphabetically:

   Beverage: A (cola), B (fanta), C (hot-chocolate)
   Food: D (carrot), E (cherry), F (garlic)
   Job: G (journalist), H (musician), I (security-guard)
   Pet: J (dog), K (mouse), L (rat)
   Sport: M (badminton), N (biathlon), O (volleyball)
   Transport: P (motorbike), Q (roller), R (tram)

2. From the clues, we know that the rat owner is on the right of the volleyball player and on the left of the badminton player. So, the positions of the rat, volleyball, and badminton must be consecutive and in that order. Let's assume the order is Rat-Volleyball-Badminton.

3. The security-guard is between the roller and the tram. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the security-guard cannot be in the first three positions (as there's no position before the rat). So, the possible positions for the security-guard are 4, 5, or 6.

4. The journalist is to the right of the tram. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the journalist cannot be in the first four positions. So, the journalist can only be in position 5 or 6.

5. The person eating carrot is on the far left or far right. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the carrot eater cannot be in the first three positions (as there's no position to the left of the table). So, the carrot eater can only be in position 4 or 7 or 10.

6. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the garlic eater. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the mouse owner cannot be in the first three positions. So, the mouse owner can only be in position 4, 5, or 6.

7. The person drinking cola is on the right of the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the cola drinker cannot be in the first three positions. So, the cola drinker can only be in position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

8. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the rat, volleyball, and badminton are consecutive, the tram driver cannot be in the first three positions. So, the tram driver can only be in position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

9. The person driving the roller cannot be in the first three positions (as the security-guard is between the roller and the tram). So, the roller driver can only be in position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

10. The owner of the mouse is in an odd position. Since the mouse owner cannot be in the first three positions, the mouse owner must be in position 5 or 9.

11. From the above points, we can deduce that the carrot eater must be in position 10 (far left), the rat owner is in position 2, the volleyball player is in position 3, the badminton player is in position 4, the security-guard is in position 5, the mouse owner is in position 9, the journalist is in position 6, the tram driver is in position 7, the cola drinker is in position 8, the roller driver is in position 9, and the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1.

12. The remaining positions for food, job, pet, and sport are filled based on the available options:

   Food: D (carrot) in position 1, E (cherry) in position 6, F (garlic) in position 10
   Job: G (journalist) in position 6, H (musician) in position 8, I (security-guard) in position 5
   Pet: J (dog) in position 1, K (mouse) in position 9, L (rat) in position 2
   Sport: M (badminton) in position 4, N (biathlon) in position 7, O (volleyball) in position 3
   Transport: P (motorbike) in position 8, Q (roller) in position 9, R (tram) in position 7

So, the final solution table is:
