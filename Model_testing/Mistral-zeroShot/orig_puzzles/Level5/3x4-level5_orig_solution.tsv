Lv5-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the R&B fan is between the action movie fan and the hiking hobbyist (1-2-4). Since there are 4 people and an odd number of positions, the R&B fan must be in position 2.

2. Now we know the positions of the R&B fan (2) and the hiking hobbyist (4). Since the R&B fan is in an odd position (2), the hiking hobbyist must be in position 4 (which is an even position).

3. The drawing hobbyist is to the right of the disaster movie fan (3). Since the hiking hobbyist is in position 4, the disaster movie fan must be in position 1 or 3. But we know that the R&B fan is in position 2, so the disaster movie fan cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the disaster movie fan is in position 3.

4. The blues fan is to the left or right of the disaster movie fan (3). Since the R&B fan is in position 2 and the hiking hobbyist is in position 4, the only remaining positions for the blues fan are 1 and 5. But we know that the singing hobbyist is to the right of the funk music fan (5), so the blues fan cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the blues fan is in position 1.

5. Now we know the positions of the blues fan (1), the R&B fan (2), the hiking hobbyist (4), and the disaster movie fan (3). The only remaining hobby is singing. Since the singing hobbyist is to the right of the funk music fan (5), the singing hobbyist must be in position 5.

6. The only remaining movie genre is action. Since the R&B fan watches action movies (7), the action movie fan is in position 7.

7. The only remaining music genre is funk. Since the singing hobbyist is in position 5, the funk music fan must be in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the nigerian is the teacher, so we can place the teacher in the 4th row and 1st column (Teacher, Nigerian).

2. The person drinking lemonade is between the malaysian and the nigerian. Since the nigerian is already placed, the lemonade must be either between the malaysian and the first position or between the second position and the nigerian. Let's try placing the lemonade between the malaysian and the first position (Lemonade, Malaysian, Nigerian).

3. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the lemonade is already placed, the engineer must be in the second or third column. Let's try placing the engineer in the second column (Designer, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

4. The designer is the person drinking 7up, so we can place the 7up in the first row and first column (Designer, 7up).

5. The canadian is on the left of the nigerian, so the canadian must be in the first column. Since the designer is already in the first column, the canadian must be in the first row (Canadian, Designer, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

6. The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the lemonade is already in the second column, the almond-milk must be in the first or third column. Let's try placing the almond-milk in the third column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Engineer, Fisherman, Teacher).

7. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since the almond-milk is already placed, the fisherman must be in the fourth column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Fisherman, Teacher).

8. The engineer is on the right of the pakistani. Since the engineer is already placed, the pakistani must be in the third column (Canadian, Designer, Almond-milk, Engineer, Pakistani, Teacher).

9. We have placed all the nationalities, so there are no more constraints for nationality.

10. We have placed all the jobs, so there are no more constraints for jobs.

11. We have placed all the beverages, so there are no more constraints for beverages.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv5-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the German is to the right of the paramedic, and the French is to the left of the Brazilian, we can place the German and the French in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the German in position 2 and the French in position 3 for now.

2. The paramedic is on the left or right of the German, so it can be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the paramedic in position 1 for now.

3. The Brazilian is to the left of the French, so it can be in position 1 or 2. Since the paramedic is already in position 1, the Brazilian must be in position 2.

4. The fan of classical is on the right of the German, so it can be in position 3 or 4. Since the paramedic (who might be a fan of classical) is in position 1, the fan of classical cannot be in position 1. So, the fan of classical must be in position 4.

5. The fan of punk is somewhere to the left of the electrician. Since the electrician can only be in position 3 or 4, the fan of punk can be in position 1 or 2. However, the fan of punk cannot be in position 1 because the fan of disco (which we will place later) must be on the left or right of the fan of punk, and there are no more positions to the left of the fan of punk in this case. So, the fan of punk must be in position 2.

6. The french is somewhere to the left of the fan of rock. Since the French is in position 3, the fan of rock can only be in position 4.

7. The fan of disco can be in position 1 or 2, but since the writer is on the right of the fan of disco, the fan of disco cannot be in position 1. So, the fan of disco must be in position 2.

8. Now, the electrician can only be in position 3.

9. The writer is on the right of the fan of disco, so the writer can only be in position 4.

10. Finally, the paramedic must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Let's place the fan of dubstep in the first column and the fantasy movie-genre in the second row. Let's assume the fan of dubstep is a person with job J1.

   |   | 1 (Dubstep) | 2 (Fantasy) | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|-----------|----|----|
   | Job | J1 |          |    |    |
   | Movie-Genre |          | Fantasy |    |    |
   | Music-Genre | Dubstep |          |    |    |

2. The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. So, the coach (J2) should be in the first or second column. Since the fan of dubstep (J1) is in the first column, the coach must be in the second column.

   |   | 1 (Dubstep) | 2 (Fantasy) | 3 | 4 |

   | Job | J1 | J2 (Coach) |    |    |
   | Movie-Genre | Dubstep | Fantasy |    |    |
   | Music-Genre | Dubstep |          |    |    |

3. The person watching epic movies is on the far right. Since the coach (J2) and the fan of dubstep (J1) are already in the first two columns, the epic movie-genre (Epic) should be in the fourth row. The person watching epic movies (J4) should be in the fourth column.

   |   | 1 (Dubstep) | 2 (Fantasy) | 3 | 4 (Epic) |
   |---|---|-----------|----|-----------|
   | Job | J1 | J2 (Coach) |    | J4 (Musician) |
   | Movie-Genre | Dubstep | Fantasy |    | Epic |
   | Music-Genre | Dubstep |          |    |    |

4. The musician is the person watching epic movies (J4). So, the job of the person in the third column is still unknown.

5. The fan of gospel is on the right of the coach (J2). So, the gospel music-genre (Gospel) should be in the third row, and the fan of gospel (J3) should be in the third column.

   |   | 1 (Dubstep) | 2 (Fantasy) | 3 (Gospel) | 4 (Epic) |
   |---|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Job | J1 | J2 (Coach) | J3 (Photographer) | J4 (Musician) |
   | Movie-Genre | Dubstep | Fantasy | Gospel | Epic |
   | Music-Genre | Dubstep |          | Gospel |    |

6. The fan of d&b is the person watching crime movies. Since the fan of gospel (J3) is in the third column, the crime movie-genre (Crime) should be in the second row. The fan of d&b (J5) should be in the first column.

   |   | 1 (D&B) | 2 (Crime) | 3 (Gospel) | 4 (Epic) |
   |---|---|-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Job | J5 (Photographer) | J2 (Coach) | J3 (Photographer) | J4 (Musician) |
   | Movie-Genre | D&B | Crime | Gospel | Epic |
   | Music-Genre | D&B |          | Gospel |    |

7. The photographer is on the right of the fan of dubstep (J1). Since the fan of gospel (J3) is already in the third column, the photographer (J3) must be in the fourth column. But we already placed the photographer (J3) in the third column. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore the last condition (the photographer is on the right of the fan of dubstep), the solution would be:

Lv5-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the turtle is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is volleyball. Let's place the turtle owner in the middle (position 3). Since the chinchilla owner is to the left or right of the turtle owner (rule 4), we can place the chinchilla owner in position 2 or 4. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

2. The Japanese is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla (rule 2), so the Japanese must be in position 1.

3. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball (rule 3). Since the volleyball owner is in position 4, the fish owner can only be in position 4 or 5. However, since the Japanese is in position 1, and the Japanese is not the fish owner (as the Japanese is not a pet owner yet), the fish owner must be in position 5.

4. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing (rule 5), so the climbing owner must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Japanese is in position 1, the climbing owner must be in position 2.

5. The sport of climbing is to the left of the Indonesian (rule 7), so the Indonesian must be in position 3 or 4. Since the turtle owner is in position 3, the Indonesian must be in position 4.

6. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the Indonesian (rule 6), so the baseball owner can be in position 2 or 4. Since the chinchilla owner is in position 2, the baseball owner must be in position 4.

7. The Italian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle (rule 8), so the Italian must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Japanese is in position 1, the Italian must be in position 1.

8. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the Italian (rule 9), so the chinchilla owner must be in position 2.

9. The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is volleyball (rule 1), so the volleyball owner must be in position 4.

10. The indonesian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla (rule 10), so the Indonesian must be in position 4.

Final solution table:

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |     4      |

| Pet           | Chinchilla | Fish    | Turtle    | -          |
| Sport         | Baseball   | Climbing | Volleyball | Swimming   |

Note that we don't have information about the pet of the Indonesian, so we left it as ""-"". However, since there are only four pets, we can deduce that the Indonesian must have a pet, but we can't determine which one without more information."
Lv5-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different beverages, movie genres, and music genres. Let's assign a number from 1 to 4 to each of them for each category.

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of funk is either 1 or 3. Let's assume Funk is in position 1 for now.

3. From point 2, the person watching musical movies is between the person drinking soy-milk (Folk) and the person drinking fanta. So, Musical can't be in position 1 or 4. Let's assume Musical is in position 2 for now.

4. From point 3, the person watching romance movies is on the left of the fan of pop. Since Funk (1) is to the left or right of Pop, Romance can't be in position 1. So, let's assume Romance is in position 3 for now.

5. From point 4, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, Hot-chocolate can't be in position 4. Let's assume Hot-chocolate is in position 2 for now.

6. From point 5, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk. Since we assumed Funk is in position 1, Musical can't be in position 4. So, Musical must be in position 2.

7. From point 6, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since we assumed Romance is in position 3, Comedy and Animation can't be in positions 1 and 4. So, let's assume Comedy is in position 4 for now.

8. From point 7, Animation is in position 1.

9. From point 8, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since we assumed Romance is in position 3, 7up can't be in position 1. So, 7up is in position 4.

10. From point 9, the person watching romance movies is in position 3.

11. From point 5, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of funk. Since we assumed Funk is in position 1, Musical must be in position 2.

12. From point 4, the person drinking fanta is in position 3.

13. From point 2, the person watching musical movies is between the person drinking soy-milk (Folk) and the person drinking fanta. So, Soy-milk (Folk) is in position 1.

14. From point 9, the person drinking 7up is in position 4.

15. From point 1, the fan of funk is in position 1. So, the fan of pop must be in position 2.

16. The only genre left is animation, which must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the dancer is on the left of the pilot, we can place the dancer in the first column and the pilot in the second column. Let's assume the dancer is drinking coffee (C1) and the pilot is drinking cola (C2).

2. The person driving the skateboard is the dancer (C1), so the skateboard is in the first row.

3. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the pilot is driving the helicopter (C2), the motorbike must be in the third row.

4. The pilot is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (C2), so the cola drinker cannot be in the second column. Let's place the cola drinker in the fourth column (C4).

5. The pilot is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the pilot is already placed (C2), the lemonade drinker must be in the third column (C3).

6. The person drinking coffee is between the designer and the person driving the skateboard (C1). Since the skateboard is already placed (C1), the designer must be in the second column (C2).

7. The person driving the van is in an even position. Since we have already placed 4 elements, the van must be in the fifth row.

8. The social-worker is on the far right, so the social-worker must be in the fourth column (C4).

9. The person driving the helicopter is the designer (C2), so the designer must be drinking juice (J2).

Now, let's place the remaining beverages:
- The person drinking lemonade (L3) must be the motorbike driver.
- The person drinking cola (C4) must be the van driver.
- The person drinking coffee (C1) is the dancer, so the dancer must be drinking juice (J1).

Finally, let's place the remaining jobs:
- Since the designer is in the second column (C2), the job of the person in the first column (C1) must be the job of the dancer, so the dancer is a social-worker (SW1).
- The person in the fourth column (C4) is the van driver, so the job of the van driver must be the job of the social-worker, so the social-worker is a pilot (P4).

Here is the final solution table:

```
| Beverage    |     Coffee     |    Cola     |     Juice     |    Lemonade   |
| Job         |     Social-worker    |    Pilot    |     Designer   |     Motorbike  |
| Transport   |     Skateboard    |     Van     |     Helicopter |     Motorbike  |

Note that the table is not formatted as a table in this response due to the limitations of the text-based format. The solution table should have rows and columns, with the headers ""Beverage"", ""Job"", and ""Transport"" at the top, and the solutions in the corresponding cells."
Lv5-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the ship is to the left of the security-guard, and the security-guard can't be in the first position (because the snowmobile driver, who is an entrepreneur, is in the first position), the ship driver must be in the second position.

2. The entrepreneur is the person driving the snowmobile, so he is in the first position.

3. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship, so the grapefruit eater can't be in the first three positions. Since the grapefruit eater is in an odd position, the only remaining odd position is the fourth.

4. The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. Since the grapes eater is in the sixth position (left of the writer), the artichoke eater must be in the seventh position (far right).

5. The person eating grapes is on the left of the writer, so the grapes eater is in the sixth position.

6. The writer is in an even position, so the writer must be in the second or fourth position. Since the entrepreneur (snowmobile driver) is in the first position, the writer can't be in the second position. Therefore, the writer is in the fourth position.

7. The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right. Since the entrepreneur (snowmobile driver) is in the first position, the helicopter driver can't be in the first position. Also, the ship driver is in the second position, so the helicopter driver can't be in the second position either. Therefore, the helicopter driver is in the fourth position.

8. Now we know the positions of all the people except the scooter driver and the security-guard. Since the security-guard is to the right of the ship driver (second position), the security-guard can't be in the third position (because the helicopter driver is in the fourth position). Therefore, the security-guard is in the third position.

9. The only remaining position for the scooter driver is the third position.

So, the final solution table is:

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the rows and the movie-genres to the columns. We'll start with the first row (nationality 1). Since the pakistani is watching comedy movies, let's place them in the comedy column.
