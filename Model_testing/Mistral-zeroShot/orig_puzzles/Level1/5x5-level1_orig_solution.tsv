4. The scientist is on the left of the manager, so we place the scientist in the 2nd column. Since the manager is eating carrot, the scientist cannot be eating carrot or orange (as they are already taken). So, the scientist can eat either radish, nectarine, or corn. Let's place the scientist eating nectarine for now.

5. The engineer is on the right of the person eating nectarine, so the engineer cannot be in the 1st or 2nd column. The engineer cannot be eating carrot or orange (as they are already taken). The engineer cannot be the manager (as the manager is already placed). The engineer cannot be the scientist (as the scientist is already placed). So, the engineer can eat either radish, corn, or nothing. Let's place the engineer eating radish for now.

6. The owner of the goldfish is the engineer (as per rule 6), so we place the goldfish with the engineer. Since the engineer is eating radish, the goldfish cannot be in the 3rd row. So, the goldfish can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 5th row. Let's place the goldfish in the 1st row for now.

   | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

7. The bartender is the person driving the car (as per rule 9), so we place the bartender in the 1st row and the car in the 1st column.

   | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

8. The person driving the train is in the middle, so we place the train in the 3rd row. Since the manager is on the far right, the train must be to the left of the manager, so it goes in the 2nd column.

9. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating radish (as per rule 10), so the chinchilla cannot be in the 5th column. The chinchilla cannot be in the 1st column (as the bartender is there). So, the chinchilla can be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the chinchilla in the 2nd column for now.

   | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

10. The person who's hobby is camping is the owner of the hedgehog (as per rule 12), so we place the hedgehog with the person who's hobby is camping. Since the chinchilla is in the 2nd column, the hedgehog cannot be in the 2nd column. So, the hedgehog can be in the 1st, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. Let's place the hedgehog in the 5th column for now.

    | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

11. The person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the turtle (as per rule 13), so we place the turtle with the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the hedgehog is in the 5th column, the turtle cannot be in the 5th column. So, the turtle can be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the turtle in the 4th column for now.

    | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

12. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person driving the taxi (as per rule 15), so the goldfish cannot be in the 1st column (as the bartender is driving the car). So, the goldfish can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. Since the goldfish is already placed in the 1st column, this rule is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, with the given information, we can fill in the table as follows:

    | Food        |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

   |------|------|------|------|-----|

Lv1-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people are arranged in a row, so we can use numbers 1 to 5 to represent the positions. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer, so sprite must be in position 1, 2, or 3, and soccer must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

2. The dressmaker is in the middle, so they must be in position 3.

3. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the bartender, so biathlon must be in position 4, 5, or 6, and bartender must be in position 1, 2, or 3, but we already know that sprite is in one of these positions, so bartender must be in position 2. Therefore, biathlon is in position 4.

5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left, so they are in position 1.

6. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies, so spy movies are in position 1.

9. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking coffee, so tea is in position 4 or 5, and coffee is in position 3 or 4. Since we know that dressmaker is in position 3, coffee must be in position 4. Therefore, tea is in position 5.

10. The dancer is on the far right, so they are in position 5.

11. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking, so cooking is in position 2 or 3. Since we know that dressmaker is in position 3, cooking must be in position 2.

12. The person drinking 7up is the person watching epic movies, so 7up is in position 3.

13. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person drinking cola, so cola is in position 4 or 5. Since we know that tea is in position 5, cola must be in position 4.

14. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon, so drawing is in position 1 or 2. Since we know that rock-climbing is in position 1, drawing must be in position 2.

15. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing, so skiing is in position 2, 3, or 4. Since we know that dressmaker, biathlon, and cooking are in positions 3, 4, and 2 respectively, skiing must be in position 2. Therefore, sprite is in position 1.

16. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the librarian, so librarian is in position 4.

17. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, so epic movies are in position 3.

Lv1-5x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people and 5 categories (Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality). We also know that each person belongs to one category in each row.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person eating grapefruit is in the middle. Let's place grapefruit in the second position.

3. From rule 12, we know that the person eating mango is on the right of the person eating grapefruit. So, mango goes in the third position.

4. From rule 10, we know that the person eating cherry is the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian must be placed on the far left (rule 14), cherry goes in the first position.

5. From rule 15, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we have already placed cherry and grapefruit, the only available positions for tomato are the fourth and fifth positions. If tomato were in the fourth position, it would be on the left of woodworking, but there is no woodworking yet. So, tomato must be in the fifth position.

6. Now, we have placed cherry, grapefruit, mango, and tomato. The only remaining food is zucchini, which must be in the first position (rule 14).

7. From rule 9, we know that the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the dressmaker. Since we have placed cherry, grapefruit, mango, tomato, and zucchini, the only available positions for documentary are the second and third positions. If documentary were in the second position, it would be on the left of the person eating grapefruit, but we know that the person eating grapefruit is watching documentary (rule 3). So, documentary must be in the third position.

8. From rule 13, we know that the dressmaker watches crime movies. Since we have placed all the food items and documentary, the only available position for crime is the fourth position.

9. From rule 1, we know that there are 5 different movie genres. We have placed crime, documentary, and mystery (rule 1, 3, and 13). The remaining genres are satire and sports. Since the person watching satire movies is on the far right (rule 16), satire must be in the fifth position.

10. From rule 2, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we have placed all the food items, movie genres, and crime, the only available positions for board-games and chess are the first and second positions. If board-games were in the first position, it would be on the right of chess, but we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 2). So, chess must be in the first position and board-games in the second position.

11. From rule 4, we know that the scientist is the person who's hobby is writing. Since we have placed all the food items, movie genres, and hobbies, the only available position for the scientist is the fourth position.

12. From rule 5, we know that the American is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we have placed chess in the first position, the American must be in the second position.

13. From rule 8, we know that the Spanish is on the right of the Indian. Since we have placed the American in the second position, the Indian must be in the first position.

14. From rule 6, we know that the bartender is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since we have placed board-games in the second position, the bartender must be in the first position.

15. From rule 7, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the Indian. Since we have placed the Indian in the first position, the person watching mystery movies must be in the second position.
