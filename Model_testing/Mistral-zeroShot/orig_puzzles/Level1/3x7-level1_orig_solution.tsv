3. From rule 10, we know that the person watching zombie movies is the owner of the horse. Since the horse owner is on the right of the person watching horror movies (rule 4), the horse owner must be in Column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee (rule 14), the horse owner cannot be in Column 1 or 2. Also, the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies (rule 9), so the horse owner cannot be in Column 6 either. So, the horse owner is in Column 3, 4, or 5. Let's assign Horse to 3 for now.

4. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the mouse owner is also the person drinking 7up (rule 13), the fish owner must be in Column 1, 2, or 3. But the person watching animation movies is in the middle (rule 16), so the fish owner cannot be in Column 6. Also, the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee (rule 14), so the fish owner cannot be in Column 2. So, the fish owner is in Column 1. Let's assign Fish to 2.

But we already assigned the mouse to the person drinking 7up (rule 13), so the person watching mystery movies is also the person drinking 7up. Since the person watching comedy movies is on the far right (rule 15), the person watching mystery movies (and drinking 7up) cannot be in Column 7. Also, the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee (rule 14), so the person watching mystery movies (and drinking 7up) cannot be in Column 1 or 2.

Lv1-3x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person watching epic movies (E) on the far left because the person watching comedy movies (C) is to the right of E. Let's place C in the second position.

5. The person watching zombie movies (Z) is the person who's hobby is video-games (VG), so VG must be in the sixth position.

6. The person who's hobby is photography (Ph) is the owner of the rat (R), so R must be in the fifth position. Ph is also watching adventure movies (A), so A must be in the seventh position.

7. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks (MT) is to the left of R, so MT must be in the fourth position.

8. The person who's hobby is traveling (T) is on the far right, so T must be in the seventh position.

9. The person who's hobby is fishing (F) is on the right of the owner of the lizard (L), so F cannot be in the seventh position. F cannot be in the sixth position because VG is there. F cannot be in the fifth position because R is there. So, F must be in the third position.

10. The person who's hobby is puzzles (P) is left of T, but T is already in the seventh position, so P must be in the sixth position.

11. The person watching epic movies (E) is on the right of the person watching spy movies (S), so E must be in the fourth position.

12. The person who's hobby is chess (C) is E, so C must be in the first position.

15. The owner of the lizard (L) is to the left of F, but F is already in the third position, so L must be in the second position.

16. The hobby of the person in the sixth position is puzzles (P), so the movie genre of this person is action (A).

Lv1-3x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person watching martial-arts movies on the far left (column 1).

2. Since the German is on the left of the Turkish and the Canadian is on the right of the Turkish, we can place the Turkish in column 6 and the German in column 5.

3. The Mexican is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the Mexican is also the one watching disaster movies (rule 9), we can place the Mexican in column 4. This means the western movies are in column 3.

4. The Mexican is on the right of the person watching crime movies. Since we already placed the Mexican, the person watching crime movies must be in column 2.

5. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in column 6, the person driving the motorbike is in column 7.

6. The person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is in the middle (rule 10), the zombie movies are in column 1 and the snowmobile driver is in column 5.

7. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the German. Since the German is in column 5, the airplane driver is in column 4.

8. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (who is the Mexican, in column 4). So, the roller is in column 6.

9. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we haven't placed satire movies yet, let's place satire movies in column 3. This means the skateboard is in column 7.

10. The person driving the train is on the right of the person watching crime movies (who is in column 2). So, the train is in column 3.

11. The only remaining movie genre is drama. Let's place it in column 1 (since it's not specified where it should be).

12. The only remaining nationality is Indonesian. Since the snowmobile driver (who is the Indonesian) is in the middle, we don't need to place Indonesian anywhere else.

13. The only remaining means of transport is the car. Since it's not specified where it should be, let's place it in column 6 (to keep the table symmetrical).

Now, let's fill in the nationalities and means of transport:

|               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4      |     5      |    6     |    7    |

14. The person watching drama is Canadian (since the Canadian is on the right of the Turkish, who is in column 6, and the only movie left in column 6 is drama). So, the Canadian is in column 7.

15. The person driving the car is Egyptian (since the only remaining nationality is Egyptian and the car is in column 6).

16. The person driving the motorbike is Indonesian (since the Indonesian is the snowmobile driver and the motorbike is on the right of the Turkish, who is the Indonesian's left).

17. The person driving the airplane is German (since the airplane driver is on the left of the German, who is in column 5).

18. The person driving the roller is Mexican (since the roller is on the right of the Mexican, who is in column 4).

19. The person driving the skateboard is Polish (since the skateboard is on the right of the Polish, who is not placed yet).

20. The person driving the snowmobile is Indonesian (since we already placed the Indonesian as the snowmobile driver).

21. The person watching zombie movies is Turkish (since the zombie movies are on the left of the Turkish, who is in column 5).

22. The person watching satire movies is Mexican (since the skateboard is on the right of the Mexican, who is in column 4, and the satire movies are in column 3).

Now, let's fill in the means of transport:

Lv1-3x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that writing is on the left of reading, so we can place them in the first two columns. Let's assume writing is in column 1 and reading is in column 2.

2. The fan of jazz is the chef, so we place jazz in the row corresponding to the chef. Since the chef is in the middle, it must be in row 4.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is on the far right, so it must be in column 7. Since it's also the manager, we place it in row 3.

4. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the fan of house, so the fan of house must be in column 6. Since it's not already placed, it must be the project-manager, so we place it in row 5.

5. The chef is in the middle, so we have filled the middle row.

6. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the analyst, so it must be in column 1 or 2. Since it's not already placed, it must be the analyst, so we place it in row 1. The fan of blues is on the left of the analyst, so it must be in column 1.

7. The fan of salsa is on the right of the entrepreneur, so it must be in column 7. Since it's not already placed, it must be the entrepreneur, so we place it in row 6.

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the entrepreneur, so it must be in column 6. Since it's not already placed, it must be the project-manager, so we place it in row 5. The entrepreneur is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing, so the person who's hobby is fishing must be in column 7. Since it's not already placed, it must be the nurse, so we place it in row 6.

9. The teacher is on the left of the analyst, so it must be in column 2. Since it's not already placed, it must be the teacher, so we place it in row 2. The person who's hobby is drawing is the teacher, so it must be in column 2.

10. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games, so it must be in column 5. Since it's not already placed, it must be the manager, so we place it in row 3.

11. The fan of disco is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing, so it must be in column 6. Since it's not already placed, it must be the nurse, so we place it in row 6.

12. The nurse is on the left of the entrepreneur, so the manager must be in column 7. Since it's not already placed, it must be the manager, so we place it in row 3.

Now, let's fill the remaining Music-Genre and Job columns:

13. The remaining hobbies are fishing, reading, and drawing. Since reading is already placed, fishing must be in column 1 and drawing must be in column 2. Since fishing is not a job, it must be in the Music-Genre column, so we place it in row 1. Since drawing is the teacher, we place it in row 2.

14. The remaining jobs are analyst, chef, entrepreneur, manager, nurse, project-manager, and teacher. Since the teacher and manager are already placed, the remaining jobs must be analyst, chef, entrepreneur, nurse, and project-manager. Since the nurse is already placed, the remaining jobs must be analyst, chef, entrepreneur, and project-manager. Since the chef is already placed, the remaining jobs must be analyst, entrepreneur, and project-manager.

Lv1-3x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, each with a unique hobby, job, and music-genre preference. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 7.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is on the far right, so let's assign that to person 7.

3. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. So, let's assign the hobby of collecting to person 6.

4. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is puzzles is in the middle. So, let's assign the hobby of puzzles to person 4.

5. From rule 15, the lawyer is on the left of the mechanic. Since we know the card-games person is on the far right, the mechanic must be on the far left. So, let's assign the job of mechanic to person 1.

6. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is writing is the librarian. Since we know the card-games person is on the far right, the writing person cannot be on the far right. Also, the writing person is the fan of d&b (from rule 14). So, let's assign the hobby of writing (and the job of librarian) to person 2.

7. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the writer. Since the writer is person 2, the baker must be on the right, which means they can't be in the middle (where puzzles is). So, let's assign the hobby of baking to person 3.

8. From rule 13, the videographer is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we know the card-games person is on the far right, the drawing person cannot be on the far right either. Also, the drawing person is the videographer (from rule 13). So, let's assign the hobby of drawing (and the job of videographer) to person 5.

9. From rule 7, the fan of country is on the right of the videographer. Since the videographer is person 5, the fan of country must be person 6 or 7. But since the card-games person is on the far right (rule 11), the fan of country cannot be person 7. So, let's assign the hobby of country to person 6.

10. Now, we have the hobbies of all people except for person 1 (job: mechanic), person 4 (hobby: puzzles), and person 7 (hobby: card-games).

11. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the writing person is person 2, the fan of folk must be on the left, which means they can't be in the middle (where puzzles is). So, let's assign the hobby of folk to person 1.

12. From rule 6, the fan of folk is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of folk is person 1, the fan of funk must be person 2 or 3. But since the baker is on the right of the writer (rule 3), the fan of funk cannot be person 2. So, let's assign the hobby of funk to person 3.

13. From rule 4, the fan of folk is on the left of the videographer. Since the videographer is person 5, the fan of folk must be person 4. So, let's assign the hobby of folk to person 4.

14. Now, we have the hobbies of all people except for person 7 (hobby: card-games). Since the card-games person is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (rule 9), the card-games person cannot be person 6 (since the fan of country is person 6). So, let's assign the hobby of card-games to person 7.

15. Finally, from rule 8, the project-manager is in the middle. Since we know the hobbies of all other people, the hobby of the project-manager must be puzzles (since it's the only hobby left). So, let's assign the hobby of puzzles to the project-manager (person 4).

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv1-3x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person eating orange, we can place cycling in the first column and orange in the second column. Let's assume cycling is in column 1 and orange is in column 2.

2. The person eating watermelon is the person who's sport is tennis, so we can place watermelon in the column where tennis is and tennis in the row where watermelon is. Since tennis is the sport of the person on the right of the person eating orange (column 2), we can place tennis in column 3 and watermelon in row 3.

3. The person eating grapefruit is on the far right, so we can place grapefruit in the last column (column 7).

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating peach. Since peach is in a column to the right of column 3 (where watermelon is), skateboarding must be in a column to the left of column 3. Let's place skateboarding in column 1.

5. The social-worker is on the left of the analyst, and the person who's sport is rugby is the social-worker. Since skateboarding is in column 1, the social-worker (and thus rugby) must be in column 2.

6. The doctor is in the middle, so we can place doctor in column 4.

7. The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding, and the police-officer is the person who's sport is skiing. Since skateboarding is in column 1, skiing must be in column 2 or 3. Since the doctor is in column 4, skiing can't be in column 3. So, skiing is in column 2 and the police-officer is in column 2.

8. The fisherman is on the far left, so we can place fisherman in column 1.

9. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling, and the person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since cycling is in column 1 and rugby is in column 2, cricket must be in column 3.

10. The person eating corn is on the right of the journalist, so we can place corn in a column to the right of the journalist's column. Since the doctor is in column 4, corn can't be in column 5. So, corn is in column 6.

11. The person who's sport is swimming is not specified to be in a specific position, so we can place it in any remaining column. Let's place swimming in column 5.

12. The person eating peach is on the left of the coach, and the person eating peach is on the left of the person eating banana. Since peach is in column 1, the coach and banana must be in columns 2 and 3 respectively.

13. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since rugby is in column 2, tennis must be in column 1.

14. The person eating peach is on the left of the person eating banana. Since peach is in column 1 and banana is not yet placed, banana must be in column 2.

15. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling is in column 1, cricket must be in column 3.
