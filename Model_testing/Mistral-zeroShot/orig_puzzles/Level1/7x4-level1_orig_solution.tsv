Lv1-7x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different beverages, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and means of transport. Let's assign temporary names to them for easier reference:

   Beverages: A, B, C, D
   Hobbies: 1, 2, 3, 4
   Jobs: E, F, G, H
   Movie-Genres: X, Y, Z, W
   Music-Genres: T, S, R, Q
   Sports: V, U, I, O
   Means of transport: P, L, K, J

2. From the clues, we can start to make some connections:

   1. A (iced-tea) is related to X (action movies)
   2. R (trance) is to the right of 1 (board-games)
   3. S (techno) is to the right of Z (superhero movies)
   4. F (dancer) is on the far right
   5. F is to the right of W (western movies)
   6. P (airplane) is related to B (mirinda)
   7. I (ice-hockey) is to the left of G (entrepreneur)
   8. S is to the left of F
   9. K (skateboard) is related to Q (salsa)
   10. L (boat) is to the right of E (chef)
   11. I is related to B
   12. P is related to R
   13. O (soccer) is to the right of D (water)
   14. I is related to D
   15. O is G
   16. A is to the left of E
   17. C (sprite) is related to 3 (cooking)

3. Now we can start to fill in the table with the temporary names:

Lv1-7x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as P1, P2, P3, and P4 from left to right.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Australian is on the left of the Pakistani (P1 is Australian), P2 must be Pakistani. Now, the Pakistani is on the right of the person watching family movies (P4), so P4 must be Pakistani as well. This means P3 must be another nationality.

3. Since the Indonesian is on the right of the fan of folk (P3), P3 must be Indonesian. Now, the fan of folk is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography (P2), so P2 must be the photographer.

4. The fan of folk is watching family movies (P4), so P4 is into family movies. Since the person watching family movies is the person who's hobby is gardening (P4 is a gardener), we know P1's hobby is not gardening.

5. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (P4 is watching family movies, so P3 must be watching epic movies). The fan of soul is the person watching epic movies (P3), so P3 is a soul fan.

6. The fan of blues is on the left of the owner of the fish (P1), so P1 is the blues fan. Since the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the owner of the horse (P4 is a Pakistani and not a documentary fan, so P2 must be watching documentaries), P2 is the horse owner.

7. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person driving the trike (P4 is a Pakistani and not a strawberry eater, so P3 must be eating strawberry). The person driving the trike is not P1 (P1 is the blues fan and not a trike driver), so P2 is driving the trike.

8. The person eating garlic is on the left of the person eating cherry (P1 is the blues fan and not a garlic eater, so P2 must be eating garlic). The person eating cherry is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (P2 is the photographer, so P1 must be eating cherry).

9. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left (P1), and the person driving the boat is on the left of the owner of the fish (P1 is the blues fan and not a boat driver, so P2 must be driving the boat). The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the pakistani (P1 is the Australian and not a jet-ski driver, so P3 must be driving the jet-ski).

10. The person driving the roller is not specified, so we can't place it yet.

Here is the table with the current information:

|               | P1   | P2   | P3   | P4   |
| Food          | Cherry| Garlic| Strawberry| Family|
| Hobby         | Photography| Sudoku| Gardening| Documentary|
| Movie-Genre   |      |      |        |       |
| Music-Genre   | Blues |      | Soul   |       |
| Nationality   | Australian| Pakistani| Indonesian| Pakistani|
| Pet           | Rabbit|      |       |       |
| Transport     | Boat | Trike| Jet-ski|       |

We still have some movie genres and a means of transport to place. Let's try to solve those:

11. Since the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the owner of the horse (P2 is the horse owner), P4 must be watching documentaries.

12. The person driving the roller is not specified, so we can't place it yet.

Now, we have filled all the categories except for the remaining movie genre and the means of transport for P3. Since we have no more clues to help us, we can't determine the exact position of the roller or the remaining movie genre for P3.

Here is the final table with the information we could determine:

#############
|               | P1   | P2   | P3   | P4   |
| Food          | Cherry| Garlic| Strawberry| Family|
| Hobby         | Photography| Sudoku| Gardening| Documentary|
| Movie-Genre   |      |      |        | Epic/Family|
| Music-Genre   | Blues |      | Soul   |       |
| Nationality   | Australian| Pakistani| Indonesian| Pakistani|
| Pet           | Rabbit|      |       |       |
| Transport     | Boat | Trike| Jet-ski|       |
#############

We can't determine the exact position of the roller or the remaining movie genre for P3."
Lv1-7x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating kale is not in the first column (due to point 9), so it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the second column for now.

2. Since the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person eating kale (point 1), the sport must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the third column for now.

3. The librarian is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (point 5), so the librarian must be in the first or second column. Let's assume the librarian is in the first column for now.

4. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person watching epic movies (point 6), so the epic movies must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the third column for now.

5. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies (point 7), so horror movies must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Let's assume it's in the first column for now.

6. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (point 8), so the skateboarding must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the fourth column for now.

7. The fan of disco is on the far left (point 9), so it must be in the first column.

8. The person eating grapes is on the left of the owner of the rat (point 12), so the person eating grapes must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the fifth column for now.

9. The chef is the person eating grapes (point 11), so the chef is in the fifth column.

10. The person watching epic movies is the owner of the rat (point 10), so the rat is in the third column.

11. The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching epic movies (point 12), so the person eating potato must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Let's assume it's in the fourth column for now.

12. The dancer is on the far left (point 14), so the dancer is in the first column.

13. The person who's hobby is board-games is the fan of gospel (point 15), so the board-games must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the second column for now.

14. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person eating kale (point 2), so the hobby must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume it's in the fifth column for now.

15. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies (point 13), so the time-travel movies must be in the first or second column. Let's assume it's in the first column for now.

16. The librarian is on the left of the owner of the lizard (point 16), so the librarian must be in the second column.

17. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the fan of gospel (point 17), so the surfing must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Let's assume it's in the first column for now.

Now we have a possible arrangement:

|               |       1       |       2       |     3     |      4      |

| Sport         | Surfing     | Rowing      | Skateboard| Weightlifting|

However, we still need to find the music genre for the person in the third column and the sport for the person in the second column. Let's assume the music genre in the third column is D&B and the sport in the second column is Weightlifting.

|               |       1       |       2       |     3     |      4      |

This table represents the final solution. The table shows the favorite beverages, hobbies, movie genres, music genres, nationalities, sports, and means of transport of the four people."
Lv1-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that each person has a unique hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, and transport. So, we can assign each row with a unique number from 1 to 4.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 12 and 15, we know that the Colombian (C) is on the left of the owner of the turtle (T) and on the right of the Dutch (D). So, C must be in position 1 or 3, and T must be in position 2 or 4. Since the nationalities are unique, T cannot be in position 1, so C must be in position 1 and T in position 2. Now we know that the Dutch is in position 3.

4. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the ship (S) is on the right of the Colombian (C). Since C is in position 1, S must be in position 2.

5. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the hamster (H) is on the left of the person driving the subway (Sub). Since the Dutch is in position 3, the subway driver cannot be in position 1, so H must be in position 1.

6. From rule 9, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (He) is the person driving the skateboard (Sk). Since the Colombian is in position 1 and the hamster owner is in position 1, the skateboard driver cannot be in position 1, so He must be in position 2.

7. From rule 14, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (He) is on the left of the dancer (D). Since He is in position 2, D must be in position 3.

8. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the snake (Sn) is on the left of the project-manager (PM). Since the Dutch is in position 3 and the dancer is in position 3, PM cannot be in position 1, so Sn must be in position 1.

9. From rule 6, we know that the dancer (D) is on the right of the fan of electronic (E). Since D is in position 3, E must be in position 4.

10. From rule 5, we know that the fan of hip-hop (HH) is the person driving the subway (Sub). Since the hamster owner is in position 1 and the dancer is in position 3, Sub cannot be in position 1 or 3, so HH must be in position 2.

11. From rule 16, we know that the person who's hobby is photography (Ph) is on the left of the person watching superhero (SH) movies. Since the Dutch is in position 3 and the dancer is in position 3, Ph cannot be in position 1 or 3, so Ph must be in position 2.

12. From rule 4, we know that the person watching musical (M) movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading (R). Since the Dutch is in position 3 and the dancer is in position 3, M cannot be in position 1 or 3, so M must be in position 2.

13. From rule 8, we know that the fan of folk (F) is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing (Sg). Since the Dutch is in position 3 and the dancer is in position 3, F cannot be in position 1 or 3, so F must be in position 4.

14. From rule 7, we know that the person watching drama (Dr) movies is on the right of the person watching zombie (Z) movies. Since the Dutch is in position 3 and the dancer is in position 3, Dr cannot be in position 1 or 3, so Dr must be in position 4.

15. From rule 1, we know that each person has a unique hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, and transport. So, we can assign each unique value to each category.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-7x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating peas is the person driving the skateboard, so we can place them in the same row and column. Let's place them in position (3,1) (since the first row and column represent Beverage and Transport respectively).

2. The person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is camping, so we can place camping in the same row as peas and skateboard. Let's place camping in position (3,2).

3. The fan of folk is on the far left, so we can place folk in the first position of each row.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since we already have camping in the third position, we can place board-games in the second position of the third row. Now, we can place baking in the fourth position of the third row.

5. The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already have peas and hot-chocolate in the same row, we can place hot-chocolate in the second position of the first row.

6. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the fan of house. Since we already have folk in the first position of the first row, we can place house in the second position of the second row.

7. The person who's sport is water-polo is the person drinking milk. Since we already have water-polo in the first position of the sixth row, we can place milk in the first position of the fifth row.

8. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left. Since we already have water-polo in the first position of the sixth row, this condition is already satisfied.

9. The fan of house is on the right of the person eating kale. Since we already have house in the second position of the second row and kale is yet to be placed, we can place kale in the third position of the second row.

10. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person eating blueberry. Since we already have rowing yet to be placed and blueberry is in the fourth position of the fourth row, we can place rowing in the fifth position of the fourth row.

12. The person watching animation movies is on the far right. Since we already have all other movie-genres placed, we can place animation in the first position of the sixth row.

13. The person driving the car is the fan of trance. Since we already have trance yet to be placed and car is in the fourth position of the fifth row, we can place trance in the fourth position of the fifth row.

Lv1-7x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the colombian is on the far right (7), the nationalities can be arranged as follows: Australian, Chinese, Colombian, Thai.

2. The colombian is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (13), so card-games can be placed next to Australian.

3. The chinese is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket (14), so cricket can be placed next to Thai.

4. The chinese is the owner of the hedgehog (11), so the dancer (6) must be the owner of the cat (12). This means the person driving the subway owns a cat.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right (8), so hot-chocolate must be placed in the last position.

6. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird (2), so the bird must be placed next to the person drinking hot-chocolate.

Lv1-7x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill the first row with the 4 different beverages, the second row with the 4 different foods, the third row with the 4 different hobbies, the fourth row with the 4 different jobs, the fifth row with the 4 different music-genres, the sixth row with the 4 different pets, and the seventh row with the 4 different means of transport.

2. From rule 9, we know that the person eating broccoli is on the far left, so we can place broccoli in the first column of the Food row.

3. From rule 16, we know that the person eating broccoli is on the left of the fisherman, so the fisherman must be in the second column of the Job row.

4. From rule 12, we know that the owner of the frog is on the right of the nurse, so the nurse must be in the first column of the Job row.

5. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different favorite beverages, so we can place the remaining 3 beverages (iced-tea, mirinda, tea) in the remaining columns of the Beverage row. Since the nurse is on the left of the owner of the frog (rule 11), the owner of the frog must be in the second column of the Job row. So, the order of the Job row is now [nurse, fisherman, owner of frog, social-worker].

6. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, so the person driving the helicopter must be in the third column of the Transport row. Since the owner of the frog is on the right of the nurse (rule 12), the person driving the helicopter must be in the fourth column of the Transport row. So, the order of the Transport row is now [helicopter, scooter, tram, trike].

7. From rule 2, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, so the iced-tea must be in the first column of the Beverage row.

8. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the fan of funk, so the fan of funk must be in the fourth column of the Music-Genre row. Since the fan of funk is also the person who's hobby is drawing (rule 14), the hobby of drawing must be in the fourth column of the Hobby row.

9. From rule 11, we know that the social-worker is the person driving the scooter, so the social-worker must be in the third column of the Job row. Since the fan of funk is the person who's hobby is drawing (rule 14), the hobby of drawing must be in the fourth column of the Hobby row. So, the order of the Hobby row is now [card-games, drawing, filmmaking, video-games].

10. From rule 10, we know that the fan of gospel is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, so the fan of gospel must be in the second column of the Music-Genre row.

11. From rule 7, we know that the fan of country is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, so the fan of country must be in the fourth column of the Music-Genre row.

12. From rule 8, we know that the fan of funk is on the left of the person driving the trike, so the person driving the trike must be in the second column of the Transport row.

13. From rule 5, we know that the social-worker is the person driving the scooter, so the scooter must be in the third column of the Transport row.

14. From rule 3, we know that the person eating radish is on the left of the nurse, so the person eating radish must be in the second column of the Food row.

15. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person eating radish, so the person eating radish must be in the second column of the Food row. Since the person eating radish is on the left of the nurse (rule 3), the owner of the chinchilla must be in the fourth column of the Pet row.

16. From rule 4, we know that the owner of the horse is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing, so the owner of the horse must be in the first column of the Pet row.

17. From rule 17, we know that the nurse is on the right of the person drinking tea, so the person drinking tea must be in the third column of the Beverage row.

18. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, so the person driving the helicopter must be in the fourth column of the Transport row.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

|               |        Broccoli       |       Radish       |       Zucchini      |       Apricot      |

| Transport     |   Helicopter      |     Scooter    |     Tram         |      Trike       |

This is the final solution table."

Lv1-7x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the types of food, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transport. We can fill in these categories with the respective options.

3. Let's start with the people:
   - The software-developer owns the lizard (1), so we can place the lizard owner in the Software-Developer row. Since the software-developer is on the far right (10), we can place the software-developer in the 4th row.
   - The software-developer is on the right of the Indonesian (11), so the Indonesian must be in the 3rd row.
   - The Italian is the person watching disaster movies (14), so the Italian is in the row with Disaster as the movie-genre. Since the Italian is to the left of the bartender (2), the Italian cannot be in the 1st or 2nd row. So, the Italian is in the 4th row, and Disaster is in the 4th column.
   - The person driving the subway is British (5), so the British is in the row with Subway as the transport. Since the police-officer is on the left of the person driving the subway (7), the police-officer is in the 1st or 2nd row. The police-officer cannot be in the 1st row because the Italian is in the 1st row with Disaster as the movie-genre, and the Italian is watching Disaster movies (14). So, the police-officer is in the 2nd row.
   - The person driving the bus is on the far left (12), so the bus driver is in the 1st row.
   - The person eating asparagus is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (4), so the goldfish owner is in the 2nd or 3rd row. Since the Indonesian is in the 3rd row, the goldfish owner cannot be in the 3rd row. So, the goldfish owner is in the 2nd row.
   - The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person driving the subway (13), so the person driving the subway cannot be in the 1st column. So, the person driving the subway is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Since the British is in the 1st column, the person driving the subway is not in the 1st column. So, the person driving the subway is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Since the Italian is in the 4th column with Disaster as the movie-genre, the person driving the subway is not in the 4th column. So, the person driving the subway is in the 2nd column.
   - The person watching animation movies owns the dog (16), so the dog owner is in the row with Animation as the movie-genre. Since the software-developer is in the 4th row, the dog owner cannot be in the 4th row. So, the dog owner is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd row. Since the Indonesian is in the 3rd row, the dog owner is not in the 3rd row. So, the dog owner is in the 1st or 2nd row. Since the Italian is in the 4th row with Disaster as the movie-genre, the dog owner is not in the 4th row. So, the dog owner is in the 1st row.
   - The person eating watermelon is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis (8), so the person who's sport is tennis is not in the 1st column. So, the person who's sport is tennis is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Since the Italian is in the 4th column with Disaster as the movie-genre, the person who's sport is tennis is not in the 4th column. So, the person who's sport is tennis is in the 2nd or 3rd column. Since the police-officer is in the 2nd row, the person who's sport is tennis cannot be in the 2nd row. So, the person who's sport is tennis is in the 3rd row.
   - The person who's sport is cycling is watching disaster movies (9), but we already placed the Italian with Disaster as the movie-genre. So, the person who's sport is cycling cannot be Italian. Since the Indonesian is in the 3rd row, the person who's sport is cycling is not Indonesian. So, the person who's sport is cycling is either British or Canadian. Since the British is in the 1st row, the person who's sport is cycling is Canadian.
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person driving the boat (15), so the person driving the boat is not in the 4th column. So, the person driving the boat is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Since the Italian is in the 4th column with Disaster as the movie-genre, the person driving the boat is not in the 4th column. So, the person driving the boat is in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. Since the police-officer is in the 2nd row, the person driving the boat is not in the 2nd column. So, the person driving the boat is in the 1st or 3rd column. Since the Canadian is in the 3rd row with Cycling as the sport, the person driving the boat is not in the 3rd column. So, the person driving the boat is in the 1st column.
   - The canadian is on the right of the librarian (6), so the Canadian is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Since the Italian is in the 4th column with Disaster as the movie-genre, the Canadian is not in the 4th column. So, the Canadian is in the 2nd or 3rd column. Since the police-officer is in the 2nd row, the Canadian is not in the 2nd column. So, the Canadian is in the 3rd column.

4. Now we can fill in the remaining categories:
   - The librarian is in the 2nd column, so the librarian is in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th row. Since the British is in the 1st row, the librarian is not in the 1st row. Since the Italian is in the 4th row with Disaster as the movie-genre, the librarian is not in the 4th row. So, the librarian is in the 2nd row.

Since the police-officer is in the 2nd row, the dog owner is not in the 2nd row. So, the dog owner is in the 1st row.
   - The person watching western movies is the person who's sport is water-polo (3), but we already placed the person driving the boat with water-polo as the sport. So, the person watching western movies cannot be the person driving the boat. Since the Italian is in the 4th row with Disaster as the movie-genre, the person watching western movies is not Italian. So, the person watching western movies is either British, Canadian, or Indonesian. Since the British is in the 1st row, the person watching western movies is not British.
