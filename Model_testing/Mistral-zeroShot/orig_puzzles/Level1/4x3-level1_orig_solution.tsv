Lv1-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating cranberry is the person drinking mirinda. Let's place them in the table:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | mirinda|             | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry|             |           |
   | Hobby         |        |             |           |
   | Music-Genre   |        |             |           |

2. The fan of reggae is on the far left. Since we already placed the cranberry eater on the first column, the reggae fan must be in the first row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | mirinda| reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry|             |           |
   | Hobby         |        |             |           |
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

3. The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of blues. So, the water drinker must be in the second row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | mirinda| reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry|             | water    |
   | Hobby         |        |             |           |
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

4. The person drinking water is the person eating pepper. So, the pepper eater is also in the second row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | mirinda| reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry| water     | pepper   |
   | Hobby         |        |             |           |
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

5. The person eating cauliflower is in the middle. Since we already placed the water and pepper eaters, the cauliflower eater must be in the third row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | mirinda| reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry| water     | cauliflower|
   | Hobby         |        |             |           |
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

6. The person who's hobby is chess is the person eating pepper. But we already placed the pepper eater, so the chess player must be in the first row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | chess  | reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry| water     | cauliflower|
   | Hobby         |        |             | woodworking|
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

7. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle. But we already placed the cauliflower eater, so the woodworking person must be in the second row:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | chess  | reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry| water     | cauliflower|
   | Hobby         | chess  |             | woodworking|
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       |           |

Now, let's fill in the missing music genres:

   |               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
   | Beverage      | chess  | reggae     | water    |
   | Food          | cranberry| water     | cauliflower|
   | Hobby         | chess  | sudoku    | woodworking|
   | Music-Genre   | blues  | folk       | reggae    |

We have filled all the table, so the final solution is:

#############
|               |   1    |      2      |     3     |
| Beverage      | chess  | reggae     | water    |
| Food          | cranberry| water     | cauliflower|

Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the snake owner is on the far left, the first row (column 1) must be ""Snake"" (Nationality).

2. From rule 6, the snake owner is Brazilian, so the third row (Nationality) must be ""Italian"" (since there are only three nationalities).

3. Let's assume the first row (Food) is ""Pear"". Then the second row (Food) must be ""Potato"" (since the person eating pear is on the left of the person eating potato). The third row (Food) must be ""Radish"" (since there are only three types of food).

4. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the third row, the second row (Hobby) must be ""Rock-climbing"".

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since rock-climbing is in the second row, the first row (Hobby) must be ""Traveling"" and the third row (Hobby) must be ""Singing"".

6. The person eating radish is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the rat is not in the third row (Food), it must be in the second row (Pet). So, the second row (Pet) is ""Rat"". The first row (Pet) must be ""Hedgehog"" (since there are only three pets and the snake is in the first row).

Here is the final solution table:

|               | Pear      | Potato   | Radish     |
| Food          |           |         |            |
| Hobby         | Traveling | Rock-climbing | Singing   |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Italian   | Turkish    |
| Pet           | Hedgehog  | Rat       | Snake      |

Lv1-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the software-developer is driving the bus, so let's place the software-developer in the 'Transport' column under 'Bus'.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      |           |                    |         |
   | Job           | Software-developer |           |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |                    |         |
   | Transport     | Bus         |           |         |

2. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the software-developer is already placed, the only person left to be the almond-milk drinker is the chef or the dancer. If the chef were drinking almond-milk, the subway driver would be on the far right, which contradicts the fact that the subway driver is on the right of the almond-milk drinker. So, the dancer must be drinking almond-milk.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) |           |         |

   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

3. Now, the subway driver is the chef.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Subway) |         |

   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

4. The dancer is on the left of the person driving the bus. So, the software-developer cannot be in the first position.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Subway) | Software-developer |
   | Job           |           |           |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |                    |         |
   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

5. The person watching zombie movies is in the middle. Since the dancer and the chef are already placed, the software-developer must be watching zombie movies.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Subway) | Software-developer (Zombie) |

   | Movie-Genre   |           |                    | Zombie |
   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

6. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the software-developer. So, the dancer cannot be watching adventure movies.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Subway) | Software-developer (Zombie) |
   | Job           |           |           |         |

   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

7. The only remaining movie genre for the dancer is satire.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Subway) | Software-developer (Zombie) |
   | Job           |           |           |         |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Satire | Zombie |
   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway |         |

8. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since the software-developer is already placed, the only remaining beverage for the chef is coffee.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Coffee) | Software-developer (Zombie) |

   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Satire | Zombie |
   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway | Train |

9. Now, we have filled all the columns.

   |               |     1     |         2          |    3    |
   | Beverage      | Dancer (Almond-milk) | Chef (Coffee) | Software-developer (Zombie) |

   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Satire | Zombie |
   | Transport     | Bus         | Subway | Train |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 variables for each category (Food, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre), and we know they are different for each row.

2. From point 4, we know that the person eating pear is the fan of rock. So, let's assign 'Rock' to the person eating pear.

3. From point 5, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. Since we already know one person's job and genre preference, let's assign 'Drama' to the person with the job 'Analyst'. Now, the person watching drama is on the right of the analyst, so the person with the job 'Lawyer' or 'Fisherman' must be watching a different genre. Let's assign 'Horror' to the person with the job 'Fisherman' (since we don't have 'Western' yet). Now, the person with the job 'Lawyer' must be watching 'Western'.

4. From point 1, we know that the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of punk. Since we already know the person eating pear is the fan of rock, the person eating the other fruit must be the fan of punk. Let's assign 'Punk' to the person eating the fruit on the left of the pear. Since there are only two fruits left (pear and tomato), the person eating tomato must be the fan of classical music (since we don't have 'Classical' yet).

5. From point 3, we know that the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since we already know the person with the job 'Fisherman' is watching horror, the person with the job 'Analyst' or 'Lawyer' must be the fan of classical. Let's assign 'Classical' to the person with the job 'Analyst' (since we don't have 'Classical' yet in the 'Job' column). Now, the person with the job 'Lawyer' must be the fan of classical music.

6. From point 2, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman. Since we already know the person with the job 'Fisherman' is in the second column, the person eating tomato must be in the first column. So, the table looks like this:

|               |     1     |    2    |     3     |
| Food          | Tomato   | Pear    | Pepper   |
| Job           | Analyst  | Lawyer  | Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   | Classical| Horror  | Drama    |
| Music-Genre   | Classical| Punk    | Rock     |

7. Now, we have filled all the categories with the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1     |    2    |     3     |
| Food          | Tomato   | Pear    | Pepper   |
| Job           | Analyst  | Lawyer  | Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   | Classical| Horror  | Drama    |
| Music-Genre   | Classical| Punk    | Rock     |

Lv1-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people have 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, and pets. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From point 1, we can deduce that the person watching documentary movies (Documentary) cannot be the fisherman (Fisherman) because the fisherman is already assigned a hobby (Documentary). So, the fisherman must be either cooking (Cooking), singing (Singing), or video-games (Video-Games).

3. The owner of the hedgehog (Hedgehog) is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking). Since the fisherman cannot be the cook, the cook must be in the second or third column. But the cook cannot be in the third column because the nurse (Nurse) is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) and is on the far left (first column). So, the cook must be in the second column. This means the hedgehog owner is in the third column.

4. The nurse (Nurse) is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games). Since the nurse cannot be in the first column (already occupied by the person watching documentary movies), the nurse must be in the second or third row. But the nurse cannot be in the third row because the person watching superhero movies (Superhero) is the coach (Coach) and is in the third row (from point 6). So, the nurse must be in the second row.

5. The person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is on the far left (first column). Since we already know that the nurse is in the second row and the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games, the nurse must be in the first row. But this contradicts point 4 because the nurse cannot be in the first row. This means our initial assumption that the fisherman cannot be the person watching documentary movies is incorrect. So, the fisherman is watching documentary movies (Documentary).

6. Now, the fisherman (Fisherman) is watching documentary movies (Documentary). Since the fisherman is not the cook (Cooking) or the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the fisherman must be in the third row. This means the person watching superhero movies (Superhero) is in the second row and is the coach (Coach).

7. The person watching superhero movies (Superhero) is the coach (Coach). Since the coach is not the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) or the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the coach must be in the second column. This means the cook (Cooking) is in the first column.

8. The cook (Cooking) is in the first column. Since the cook is not the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the second or third column. But the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) cannot be in the third column because the owner of the dog (Dog) is the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) and is in the third row. So, the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the second column.

9. The person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is in the second column. Since the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is not the nurse (Nurse), the nurse must be in the first or third row. But the nurse cannot be in the first row because the person watching documentary movies (Documentary) is the fisherman (Fisherman) and is in the first row. So, the nurse must be in the third row.

10. The nurse (Nurse) is in the third row. Since the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games), the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) must be in the first or second row. But the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) cannot be in the first row because the fisherman (Fisherman) is already assigned that hobby (Documentary). So, the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) must be in the second row.

11. The person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is in the second row. Since the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is not the coach (Coach), the coach must be in the first or third row. But the coach cannot be in the third row because the person watching superhero movies (Superhero) is already assigned that job (Coach). So, the coach must be in the first row.

12. The coach (Coach) is in the first row. Since the coach is not the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking), the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) must be in the second or third row. But the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) cannot be in the third row because the owner of the dog (Dog) is the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) and is in the third row. So, the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) must be in the second row.

13. The person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) is in the second row. Since the person who's hobby is cooking (Cooking) is not the fisherman (Fisherman), the fisherman must be in the first or third row. But the fisherman cannot be in the first row because the person watching documentary movies (Documentary) is already assigned that hobby (Documentary). So, the fisherman must be in the third row.

14. The fisherman (Fisherman) is in the third row. Since the fisherman is not the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the first row.

15. The person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is in the first row. Since the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is not the nurse (Nurse), the nurse must be in the second row.

16. The nurse (Nurse) is in the second row. Since the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games), the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) must be in the third row.

17. The person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is in the third row. Since the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is not the coach (Coach), the coach must be in the first row.

18. The coach (Coach) is in the first row. Since the coach is not the fisherman (Fisherman), the fisherman must be in the third row.

19. The fisherman (Fisherman) is in the third row. Since the fisherman is not the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the second row.

20. The person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is in the second row. Since the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is not the nurse (Nurse), the nurse must be in the first row.

21. The nurse (Nurse) is in the first row. Since the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games), the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) must be in the third row.

22. The person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is in the third row. Since the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is not the coach (Coach), the coach must be in the second row.

23. The coach (Coach) is in the second row. Since the coach is not the fisherman (Fisherman), the fisherman must be in the first row.

24. The fisherman (Fisherman) is in the first row. Since the fisherman is not the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the third row.

25. The person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is in the third row. Since the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) is not the nurse (Nurse), the nurse must be in the second row.

26. The nurse (Nurse) is in the second row. Since the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games), the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) must be in the first row.

27. The person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is in the first row. Since the person who's hobby is video-games (Video-Games) is not the coach (Coach), the coach must be in the third row.

28. The coach (Coach) is in the third row. Since the coach is not the fisherman (Fisherman), the fisherman must be in the second row.

29. The fisherman (Fisherman) is in the second row. Since the fisherman is not the person who's hobby is singing (Singing), the person who's hobby is singing (Singing) must be in the first row.

Lv1-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating spinach is on the right of the fan of gospel. Since there are only three options for food and three for music-genre, we can place the spinach eater and the gospel fan in the last two columns and the last two rows, respectively. Let's assume the gospel fan is in the bottom right (2,3). Now, the spinach eater must be in the top right (1,3).

2. The owner of the ferret is in the middle. Since there are only three options for pets, the ferret owner must be in the middle row. Let's place the ferret owner in the middle column (2,2).

3. The fan of indie is on the far left. Since there are only three options for music-genre, the indie fan must be in the top left (1,1).

4. The person eating cherry is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the spinach eater is already in the top right, the cherry eater must be in the top left (1,1). This means the tennis player is in the middle column (2,1).

5. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the cherry eater and the tennis player are already placed, the frog owner must be in the top left (1,2). This means the snowboarder is in the middle row (2,3).

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

  |               |     1     |      2       |    3    |
| Food          | Cherry    | Spinach    | Asparagus|
| Music-Genre   | Indie     | Gospel     | House   |
| Pet           | Frog      | Ferret     | Rat    |
| Sport         | Snowboarding| Tennis    | Sailing |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the metal fan is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Let's put Metal in the Music-Genre of the first row.

2. Now, the police-officer is on the right of the person watching horror movies. Since the metal fan is in the first column, the police-officer cannot be in the first row. So, let's place the police-officer in the second row. This means Horror is in the Movie-Genre of the second row.

3. The dressmaker is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since the police-officer is in the second row, the dressmaker cannot be in the second column. So, let's place the dressmaker in the third column. This means Cherry is in the Food of the third row.

4. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the dressmaker is in the third column, the broccoli eater cannot be in the third row. So, let's place the broccoli eater in the first row. This means Broccoli is in the Food of the first row.

5. The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the broccoli eater is in the first row, the fan of pop cannot be in the first column. So, let's place the fan of pop in the second column. This means Mystery is in the Movie-Genre of the second row.

6. Now, we have only one job left, the accountant. Since the police-officer and the dressmaker are already placed, the accountant must be in the third row.

Here is the final solution table:

|               | Broccoli  | Cherry   | Plum     |
| Food          | Accountant| Dressmaker| Police-Officer|
| Job           |          |          |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Mystery  | Spy      |
| Music-Genre   | Metal    | Pop      | Funk     |

Now, let's fill in the missing jobs:

Since the police-officer is a man (as jobs are gender-specific in this puzzle), the accountant and the dressmaker must be women. Let's assume the accountant is a woman. Then, the dressmaker must be a man. So, the final table is:

|               | Broccoli  | Cherry   | Plum     |
| Food          | Accountant| Dressmaker| Police-Officer|

We have filled in all the information except for the job of the accountant. However, since the job of the accountant was not specified in the puzzle, we cannot definitively determine it. So, the final solution table with the missing job is:

Lv1-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the car is on the far right, so let's place the car driver in the rightmost cell (3).

2. Since the car driver also owns the fish, the fish owner must be in the rightmost cell (3).

3. Now, the person driving the van must be the owner of the rabbit, so let's place the rabbit owner in the middle cell (2).

4. The rabbit owner is on the left of the person watching family movies, so the family movie watcher must be to the right of the rabbit owner, which means they are in cell (3). This means the genre of cell (2) must be something other than family. Let's assume it's animation for now.

5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle, so we've already placed them correctly.

6. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. The only person left on the left side is the person watching animation movies (from our assumption in step 4). So, the spy movie watcher must be to the left of them, which means they are in cell (1).

7. Now, the only hobby left is puzzles. Since it's the only hobby not yet placed, it must be in the remaining cell (1).

8. Lastly, we need to check our assumptions. The person watching family movies is in cell (3), and the person watching animation movies is in cell (2). These are both different from family, so our assumption in step 4 was correct.

Here is the final solution table:

  |               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles   | Woodworking | Magic-tricks |

Lv1-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the ship is in the middle, so the Transport column for the middle row is 'ship'.

2. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person driving the roller, so the Hobby for the first row is 'cooking' and the Transport for the first row is 'roller'.

3. The software-developer is on the far left, so the Job for the first row is 'software-developer'.

4. The accountant is the owner of the guinea-pig, so the Job for the third row is 'accountant' and the Pet for the third row is 'guinea-pig'.

5. The person who's hobby is writing is on the far right, so the Hobby for the second row is 'writing'.

6. The owner of the goldfish is on the far right, but we already placed writing in the second row, so the Pet for the second row must be 'goldfish'.

7. Since the people have 3 different jobs, the Job for the second row must be one of the remaining jobs, which is 'mechanic'.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

  |             |         1          |     2      |    3     |

Lv1-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 jobs, 3 movie-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 pets. So, each category will have one unique item in each row.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the owner of the lizard is on the far left, the first row must be a nationality. Let's assume it's British (B). The second and third rows must then be French (F) and Russian (R) respectively, as they are on the left of the British and the mystery movie watcher (we'll get to that later).

3. The owner of the goat watches martial-arts movies, so the second row must be Martial-Arts (MA). The first and third rows can't be Movie-Genres because of the left-right relationship with the goat owner, so they must be jobs. Let's assume the first row is Chef (C) and the third row is Electrician (E).

4. The electrician is on the far right, so the third row must be Electrician (E). The second row is Martial-Arts (MA), and the goat owner is on the left of the bird owner, so the second row can't be Bird (B). Therefore, the second row must be either Mystery (M) or Epic (Ep). Since the French is on the left of the mystery movie watcher, the second row can't be Mystery (M). So, the second row must be Epic (Ep).

5. The chef is on the left of the Russian, so the first row must be Chef (C). The first and third rows are jobs, and the second row is Epic (Ep). The only remaining movie-genre is Mystery (M), so the third row must be Mystery (M).

6. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat, so the third column must be Bird (B). The second column is Epic (Ep), and the first column is Chef (C). The only remaining pet is Lizard (L), so the first column must be Lizard (L).

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      Lizard   |       Epic      |       Bird      |
| Job           |           |              |             |
| Movie-Genre   |           |              |             |
| Nationality   |           |              |             |
| Pet           | Bird        | Chef          | Goat         |

So, the final table is:

#############
|               |      Lizard   |       Epic      |       Bird      |
| Job           |           |              |             |
