Lv1-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Egyptian is on the left of the Chinese, and the Turkish is on the right of the Turkish (which means the Turkish is on the right of everything to its right), we can place the Egyptian and the Chinese in the first two columns, with the Egyptian on the left. Let's assume the Egyptian is in column 1 and the Chinese is in column 2.

   |               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
   | Food          |           |             |        |         |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese     |        |         |

2. The Thai is on the right of the Chinese, so the Thai must be in column 3.

   |               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
   | Food          |           |             | pomegranate | raspberry |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese     | Thai      |         |

3. The person eating mango is the Turkish, so the Turkish must be in the last column.

   |               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
   | Food          | mango    |             | pomegranate | raspberry |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese     | Thai      | Turkish  |

4. The person eating pepper is on the left of the Turkish, so the pepper must be in column 1.

   |               | pepper   |             | pomegranate | raspberry |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese     | Thai      | Turkish  |

5. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the Chinese, but we already placed the pepper on the left of the Chinese. Since there are only two spots to the left of the Chinese, the raspberry must be in column 2.

   |               | pepper   | raspberry  | pomegranate |       |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese    | Thai        | Turkish |

6. The only food left is pomegranate, which must be in column 3.

   |               | pepper   | raspberry  | pomegranate | mango   |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | Chinese    | Thai        | Turkish |

So, the final solution table is:

2. The person who's hobby is camping is on the far right. Since we already have three hobbies, camping must be in the 4th column.

3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. So, cooking must be in the 3rd column.

5. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since soccer is already in the 3rd row, parkour must be in the 1st row.

Lv1-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching mystery movies is not on the far right (since the drama watcher is there). So, let's place the mystery movie-watcher in the first or second column. Let's place them in the first column for now.

2. The time-travel movie-watcher is to the right of the writing hobby person. Since the mystery movie-watcher is in the first column, the writing hobby person must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Let's place them in the second column for now.

3. The fishing hobby person is watching crime movies. Since the mystery movie-watcher is in the first column, the crime movie-watcher (fishing hobby person) must be in the second or third row. Let's place them in the second row for now.

4. The drama movie-watcher is on the far right. Since the time-travel movie-watcher is in the third column, the drama movie-watcher must be in the fourth column.

5. The traveling hobby person is on the left of the drama movie-watcher. So, the traveling hobby person must be in the first, second, or third column. Since the mystery movie-watcher and the writing hobby person are in the first and second columns, the traveling hobby person must be in the third column.

Now, let's place the remaining movie-genres and hobbies:

- The remaining movie-genre (crime) is watched by the fishing hobby person, so it goes in the second row, first column.
- The remaining movie-genre (drama) is watched by the person on the far right, so it goes in the fourth column, fourth row.
- The remaining movie-genre (mystery) is watched by the person in the first column, so it goes in the first row.
- The remaining movie-genre (time-travel) is to the right of the writing hobby person, so it goes in the third row, second column.
- The remaining hobby (rock-climbing) is not specified yet, but since there are no more places for it in the first three rows, it must be the hobby of the person watching drama movies in the fourth row, fourth column.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different movie genres and 4 different sports. Let's assign each genre to a sport for now:

   |               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Disaster| Drama  | Western   |
   | Sport         | Basketball| Sailing | Surfing | Tennis    |

2. From point 1, we know that the person watching Western movies is the one doing sailing. So, let's swap their positions:

   |               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Disaster| Drama  | Western   |
   | Sport         | Basketball| Sailing | Surfing | Tennis    |

3. Now, the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. So, we need to swap them:

   |               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Disaster| Drama  | Western   |
   | Sport         | Basketball| Tennis  | Sailing | Surfing   |

4. The person watching disaster movies is also on the left of the person watching action movies. So, we need to swap them again:

   |               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Disaster| Drama  | Western   |
   | Sport         | Tennis  | Action  | Sailing | Surfing   |

5. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching western movies. But we already have them in the correct order, so this condition is satisfied.

6. The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right. Since we already have the sports in a row, we just need to make sure basketball is on the far right. We can swap it with surfing:

   |               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Disaster| Drama  | Western   |

Lv1-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating cauliflower, we can place cucumber in the first column and cauliflower in the second column. Let's assume the order is Cucumber (1) and Cauliflower (2).

2. Now, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person eating kiwi. Since we have already placed two food items, let's place kiwi in the third column and the owner of the hedgehog in the fourth column. Let's assume the order is Kiwi (3) and Hedgehog Owner (4).

3. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since we have placed three food items and one pet, let's place the owner of the pony in the second column and pineapple in the first column. However, this violates rule 1 as the person eating cucumber is already in the first column. So, we need to swap the positions of cucumber and pineapple. Let's assume the order is Pineapple (1), Cucumber (2), Kiwi (3), and Hedgehog Owner (4).

4. Finally, the owner of the hamster is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we have already placed the owner of the hedgehog in the fourth column, let's place the owner of the hamster in the third column.

The final solution table is:

| Pet    |           |      |          | Hamster Owner |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact pet for the fourth column. So, the final solution table with the food is:

Lv1-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality |   |   |   | Mexican (X) |
   | Pet        |   |   |   |         |

2. The Pakistani is on the left of the Nigerian, so the Pakistani must be in column 3. Let's assume the Pakistani owns a pet 'Y'.

   | Nationality |   |   | Pakistani (Y) | Mexican (X) |
   | Pet        |   |   |         |         |

3. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the Pakistani (mouse) is already placed, the frog must be in column 1. Let's assume the frog owner is Dutch (F).

   | Nationality | Dutch (F) |   | Pakistani (Y) | Mexican (X) |
   | Pet        |  frog   |   |         |         |

4. The owner of the fish is on the left of the Nigerian. Since the Dutch (fish) is already placed, the Nigerian must be in column 2. Let's assume the Nigerian owns a pet 'G' (which is not goldfish, as it's already taken).

5. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish is already taken, the mouse must be in column 3.

6. The only pet left is the goldfish. Since it's already taken, it must be in column 2. But we placed the Nigerian there. So, the goldfish must be the pet of the Nigerian.

1. We know that the fan of indie is on the far left. So, Indie goes in the first row, first column. Let's put it as 'I'.

2. Since the fan of electronic is on the left of the owner of the rat, and the fan of indie is on the far left, the fan of electronic must be in the first row, second column. Let's put it as 'E'.

3. Now, the owner of the rat must be in the second row, as the fan of electronic is to its left. Let's put it as 'R'.

4. The fan of salsa is on the far right, so it must be in the last column, last row. Let's put it as 'S'.

5. The owner of the ferret is on the far right, so it must be in the third column, last row. Since the fan of salsa is already in the last row, the owner of the ferret must be in the third column, second row. Let's put it as 'F'.

6. Now, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the far left, so it must be in the first column, second or third row (as the first row is already occupied by the owner of the rat). Since the owner of the ferret is in the second row, the owner of the mouse must be in the first column, third row. Let's put it as 'M'.

7. The only genre left is classical. Since it's not on the far left or far right, it must be in the second column. But the second column is already occupied by the fan of electronic and the owner of the ferret. So, classical must be in the first row, second column, which is already occupied by the fan of electronic. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

3. The person driving the car is on the far left (5th condition). Since the chef is already on the far left, the car must be in the 1st row. But we already placed the chef there, so the car and the chef must be the same person.

   | Transport     |          | Motorbike|        |          |

5. The person driving the motorbike is in the third position, so the second row is complete:

   |               | Family   | Airplane | Ship     | Zombie   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Helicopter| Motorbike| Ship     |          |
   | Transport     |          |          | Airplane |          |

6. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since we already placed the ship driver in the third position, the spy movie watcher must be in the fourth position. So, the fourth row is filled:

   |               | Family   | Airplane | Ship     | Spy      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Helicopter| Motorbike| Ship     | Zombie   |
   | Transport     |          |          | Airplane |          |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the bus is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since there are only four people, the bus driver can't be on the far right, so the hot-chocolate drinker must be on the far left. Let's place them there:

   |             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
   | Beverage    | HC   |       | hot-cho-te    |        |
   | Transport   |      |       |               |        |

2. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is on the far left, the cola drinker must be on the far right. Let's place them there:

   |             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
   | Beverage    | HC   | C    | hot-cho-te    | M     |
   | Transport   |      |       |               |        |

3. The person driving the tram is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the bus driver is already placed, the train driver must be on the far right. Let's place them there:

   |             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
   | Beverage    | HC   | C    | hot-cho-te    | M     |
   | Transport   |      |       | T   | T-rain      |

4. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since the cola drinker is on the far right, the taxi driver must be on the far left. The milk drinker must be to the left of the taxi driver, but not the hot-chocolate drinker because of rule 1. So, the milk drinker must be in position 2 and the taxi driver in position 1:

   |             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
   | Beverage    | HC   | M    | hot-cho-te    | C     |
   | Transport   | T   | T-a-xi | T-rain      | B-us   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |
| Beverage    | HC   | M    | hot-cho-te    | C     |
| Transport   | T   | T-a-xi | T-rain      | B-us   |
