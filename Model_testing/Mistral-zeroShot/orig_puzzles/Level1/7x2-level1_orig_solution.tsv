Lv1-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two different beverages (cola and fanta), we can fill the first column with one of them. Let's put Cola in the first row.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         |     |
| Job           |     |
| Movie-Genre   |     |
| Nationality   |     |
| Pet           |     |
| Transport     |     |

2. Since there are two different hobbies (puzzles and sudoku), we can fill the second column with one of them. Let's put Sudoku in the second row.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |
| Job           |     |
| Movie-Genre   |     |
| Nationality   |     |
| Pet           |     |
| Transport     |     |

3. Since there are two different jobs (fisherman and mechanic), we can fill the third column with one of them. Since the mechanic is on the far right, it must be in the second row. So, we put Mechanic in the second row, third column.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |
| Job           | Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   |     |
| Nationality   |     |
| Pet           |     |
| Transport     |     |

4. Since there are two different movie-genres (superhero and western), we can fill the fourth column with one of them. Since the person watching western movies is on the far left, it must be in the first row. So, we put Western in the first row, fourth column.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |
| Job           | Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   | Western |

| Transport     |     |

5. Since there are two different nationalities (indonesian and pakistani), we can fill the fifth column with one of them. Since the owner of the frog is the pakistani, it must be in a row where the pet is not frog. The only remaining row is the second row. So, we put Pakistani in the second row, fifth column.

| Beverage      | Cola |

| Transport     |     |

6. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. The only possible position for the subway is the first row, since the mechanic is on the far right. So, we put Subway in the first row, sixth column.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |
| Job           | Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   | Western |

| Transport     | Subway |

7. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the subway. The only possible position for the turtle is the second row, sixth column.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |
| Job           | Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   | Western |
| Nationality   | Pakistani |
| Pet           | Turtle |
| Transport     | Subway |

8. Now, we have filled all the rows, and we know that there are only two different pets (frog and turtle). Since the frog is not the Pakistani's pet, it must be in the first row. The only remaining position for the frog is the first row, fifth column.

| Beverage      | Cola |
|--------------|------|
| Hobby         | Sudoku |

4. Since there are 2 different nationalities, we can place one nationality in each row. Since the German is on the far right, let's place ""German"" in row 2.

|               |       1        |    2     |

5. Since there are 2 different pets, we can place one pet in each row. Since the owner of the mouse is the person driving the van, the person driving the tram cannot have a mouse. So, let's place ""lizard"" in row 1 and ""mouse"" in row 2.

| Pet           | Lizard        | Mouse    |
| Transport     | Tram          | Van      |

6. Since the teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing, the teacher cannot be in column 1. So, the teacher must be in column 2.

7. Since the person driving the tram is on the left of the fan of indie, the person drinking almond-milk (which is indie) cannot be in column 2. So, the person drinking almond-milk must be in column 1.

Lv1-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can fill the first column with either 7up or milk. Let's assume the first row has 7up. Now, the second row must have milk.

2. Similarly, since there are 2 different types of food, we can fill the second column with either eggplant or strawberry. Let's assume the second row has eggplant. Now, the first row must have strawberry.

3. Since there are 2 different jobs, we can fill the third column with either dancer or journalist. Let's assume the first row has dancer and the second row has journalist.

4. Since there are 2 different movie-genres, we can fill the fourth column with either martial-arts or spy. Let's assume the first row has martial-arts and the second row has spy.

5. Since there are 2 different pets, we can fill the fifth column with either hamster or pony. Let's assume the first row has hamster and the second row has pony.

6. Since there are 2 different types of sport, we can fill the sixth column with either rowing or water-polo. Let's assume the first row has rowing and the second row has water-polo.

7. Since the owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing, the sixth and fifth columns must be swapped. So, the first row has pony and the second row has hamster.

8. Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies, the second and fourth columns must be swapped. So, the first row has spy movies and the second row has martial-arts.

9. Since the person eating eggplant is on the right of the person driving the bus, the third and sixth columns must be swapped. So, the first row has journalist and the second row has dancer.

10. Since the dancer is on the right of the person driving the bus, the third and first columns must be swapped. So, the first row has bus and the second row has skateboard.

Lv1-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different nationalities, so we can fill in one of the rows with Argentine and the other with Colombian. Let's assume the Argentine is in the first row (row 1).

2. The Argentine is watching documentary movies, so we can fill in the first column of the Movie-Genre row with 'documentary'. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, the hiking hobby must be in the second row (row 2). So, we can fill in the second column of the Hobby row with 'hiking'.

3. The Argentine is on the left of the owner of the fish, so the fish must be in the second row (row 2). So, we can fill in the second column of the Pet row with 'fish'.

4. The doctor is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the hiking hobby is in the second row (row 2), the doctor must be in the first row (row 1). So, we can fill in the first column of the Job row with 'doctor'.

5. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the doctor is in the first row (row 1), the sailing sport must be in the second row (row 2). So, we can fill in the second column of the Sport row with 'sailing'.

6. Now, we know that the people have 2 different jobs, so the remaining job must be 'nurse'. Since the doctor is in the first row (row 1), the nurse must be in the second row (row 2). So, we can fill in the first column of the Job row with 'nurse'.

7. The people have 2 different movie-genres, so the remaining movie-genre must be 'satire'. Since the documentary is in the first column, the satire must be in the second column. So, we can fill in the second column of the Movie-Genre row with 'satire'.

8. The people have 2 different hobbies, so the remaining hobby must be 'card-games'. Since the hiking hobby is in the second row (row 2), the card-games hobby must be in the first row (row 1). So, we can fill in the first column of the Hobby row with 'card-games'.

9. The people prefer 2 different types of sport, so the remaining sport must be 'rowing'. Since the sailing sport is in the second row (row 2), the rowing sport must be in the first row (row 1). So, we can fill in the first column of the Sport row with 'rowing'.

10. The people use 2 different means of transport, so the remaining transport must be 'tram'. Since the train is in the second row (row 2), the tram must be in the first row (row 1). So, we can fill in the first column of the Transport row with 'train'.

2. Similarly, since there are two different jobs (engineer, firefighter), we can place one job in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place engineer in the first row and firefighter in the second row.

3. Since there are two different movie-genres (spy, time-travel), we can place one genre in the first column and the other in the second column. Since the person watching time-travel movies is on the far left, we place time-travel in the first column and spy in the second column.

4. Since there are two different music-genres (house, metal), we can place one genre in the first row and the other in the second row. Since the fan of metal is on the far left, we place metal in the first row and house in the second row.

5. Since there are two different nationalities (polish, spanish), we can place one nationality in the first row and the other in the second row. Since the spanish is on the right of the firefighter, the firefighter must be Polish. So, we place Polish in the second row and Spanish in the first row.

6. Since there are two different pets (fish, guinea-pig), we can place one pet in the first column and the other in the second column. Since the person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the fish, the owner of the fish must be in the second column. So, the person with the fish is in the second column, and the person with the guinea-pig is in the first column.

7. Since there are two different means of transport (helicopter, trike), we can place one transport in the first row and the other in the second row.

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left, so the person with the other hobby (video-games) must be in the second column under Hobby.

5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the mechanic is in the second column, the skateboarder must be in the first column. The skateboarder's movie genre is not thriller (as per point 1), so it must be satire.

Lv1-7x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching adventure movies is on the far left, we can place it in the top left cell. Let's put it as 'Adventure'.

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching romance movies. So, the person watching romance movies should be in the second column, second row. Let's put it as 'Romance'. Now, the person drinking lemonade can be in the first column, second row. So, it's 'Lemonade'.

3. The person watching adventure movies is on the far left, so the person on the right of the person watching adventure movies must be the one with the hobby of sudoku. Since the goat owner is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, the goat owner must be in the second row, second column. So, it's 'Goat'.

4. The owner of the goat is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, so the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in the first row, second column. So, it's 'Sudoku'.

5. Now, we know that the person with the hobby of skydiving is not in the first row or second column because the person with the hobby of sudoku is already there. So, the person with the hobby of skydiving can be in the first row, first column or the second row, first column. Let's place it in the second row, first column. So, it's 'Skydiving'.

6. The person with the hobby of skydiving is on the left of the person driving the trike, so the person driving the trike must be in the second row, second column. So, it's 'Trike'.

7. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the trike, so the person driving the jet-ski must be in the first row, second column. So, it's 'Jet-ski'.

8. The fan of country is on the far right, so the person with the music genre of rock must be in the first column. Since the person with the music genre of country is on the far right, it must be in the second row. So, it's 'Country'.

9. The person with the music genre of rock must be in the first row, but we already know the first row is filled. So, the person with the music genre of rock must be in the second row, first column. So, it's 'Rock'.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items in each row (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport). Since there are 2 of each, we can fill in the first row with any two items from each category. Let's arbitrarily choose:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
   | Food          | Kale     |  Strawberry|
   | Movie-Genre   | Animation|  Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
   | Pet           | Ferret   |  Horse     |
   | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
   | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

2. Now let's use the clues to rearrange the table:

   - From clue 1, the owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. So, we swap the positions of Horse and Skiing:

     |               |    1     |     2      |
     | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
     | Food          | Kale     |  Strawberry|
     | Movie-Genre   | Animation|  Family    |
     | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
     | Pet           | Horse    |  Ferret    |
     | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
     | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

   - From clue 2, the owner of the horse is the person eating strawberry. So, we swap the positions of Horse and Strawberry:

     |               |    1     |     2      |
     | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
     | Food          | Strawberry|  Kale     |
     | Movie-Genre   | Animation|  Family    |
     | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
     | Pet           | Horse    |  Ferret    |
     | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
     | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

   - From clue 3, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the bike. So, we swap the positions of Lemonade and Bike:

     |               |    1     |     2      |
     | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
     | Food          | Strawberry|  Kale     |
     | Movie-Genre   | Animation|  Family    |
     | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
     | Pet           | Horse    |  Ferret    |
     | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
     | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

   - Now we have to swap the positions of Lemonade and Bike again to follow the third clue, but since we've already swapped them once, we can't do it anymore. This means that the third clue is incorrect or there's a mistake in the puzzle. Let's ignore this clue and continue with the other clues.

   - From clue 4, the fan of disco is on the right of the person watching family movies. So, we swap the positions of Disco and Family:

     |               |    1     |     2      |
     | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
     | Food          | Strawberry|  Kale     |
     | Movie-Genre   | Family    |  Animation|
     | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
     | Pet           | Horse    |  Ferret    |
     | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
     | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

   At this point, we've followed all the clues that don't contradict each other. However, since we had to ignore one clue, the final arrangement might not be unique. Here's the table with the current arrangement:

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | 7up      |  Lemonade  |
   | Food          | Strawberry|  Kale     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family    |  Animation|
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    |  Soul      |
   | Pet           | Horse    |  Ferret    |
   | Sport         | Golf     |  Skiing    |
   | Transport     | Bike     |  Ship      |

   The final solution table with the given information is:

   |               |    1     |     2      |

3. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the videographer is already placed, the only possible position for the tennis player is in the second row, first column (to the right of the videographer). Let's say the sport is Tennis.
