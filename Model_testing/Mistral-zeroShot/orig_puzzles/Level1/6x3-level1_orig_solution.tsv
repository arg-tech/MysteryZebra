Lv1-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the names of the beverages, food, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport. We also have some clues about their positions.

2. From clue 4, we know that the person driving the tram is on the far right. Since there are 6 positions, the tram driver must be in position 6.

3. From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right. Since the tram driver is already in position 6, the climber must be in position 3.

4. From clue 8, we know that the person eating tomato is in the middle. Since there are 6 positions and the climber is in position 3, the tomato eater must be in position 4.

5. From clue 9, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the climber is in position 3 and the sprite drinker is a pet owner (clue 7), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 1.

6. From clue 7, we know that the person drinking sprite is the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is not the climber (clue 3), the sprite drinker must be in position 5.

7. From clue 6, we know that the person driving the boat is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1, the boat driver must be in position 2.

8. From clue 5, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating apple. Since the apple eater cannot be the climber (clue 3), the indie fan must be in position 4 (as the tomato eater is already in position 4).

9. From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the sprite drinker is the chinchilla owner (clue 7), the weightlifter must be in position 2.

10. From clue 3, we know that the fan of gospel is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1 and the sprite drinker is in position 5, the gospel fan must be in position 3.

11. The only remaining position is position 6, which is the tram driver. Since we know the positions of all other elements, the person in position 6 must be the owner of the rabbit.

The food column is still missing, but we don't have enough information to determine it."
Lv1-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, sports, and means of transport. So, each row and each column will have one unique item.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Turkish is on the left of the person watching zombie movies, and the Malaysian is on the left of the person watching satire movies, we can place the Turkish in the Nationality column of the first row and the Malaysian in the second row. Let's assume the Polish is in the third row.

3. The electrician is Turkish, so he goes in the first row. Since the electrician is on the left of the software-developer, the software-developer goes in the second row.

4. The person who's sport is handball is on the far left. Since the Malaysian is in the second row, handball must be in the first row. Let's assume camping is in the third row and fishing is in the second column.

5. The electrician is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the electrician is in the first row, hiking must be in the third row.

6. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since satire is in the second row, comedy must be in the first column.

7. The electrician is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the electrician is in the first row, zombie must be in the second column.

8. The person driving the motorbike is the one with the hobby of camping. Since camping is in the third row, motorbike must be in the third column.

9. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since rugby is not yet placed, we can't determine the jet-ski's position yet.

10. The only remaining sport is baseball. Since it's not handball, it can't be in the first row. Since it's not rugby, it can't be in the third row. So, baseball must be in the second row.

11. Since baseball is in the second row, the sport column of the third row must be rugby. So, the person driving the jet-ski is the one playing rugby, which means the jet-ski is in the third column.

12. The only remaining movie-genre is satire. Since it's not comedy, it can't be in the first column. Since it's not zombie, it can't be in the second column. So, satire must be in the third column.

13. The only remaining hobby is fishing. Since it's not camping, it can't be in the third row. Since it's not hiking, it can't be in the first row. So, fishing must be in the second row.

Lv1-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is on the far left, we can place them in the first column. Let's assume the American is a dressmaker (D1).

2. Since the Canadian is the videographer (V3), the Canadian cannot be in the first column, so they must be in the second or third column.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving (S) is on the right of the dressmaker (D1), so S cannot be in the first column either. S must be in the second or third column.

4. The owner of the lizard (L) is the person watching documentary movies (Doc). Since the American is a dressmaker and cannot be L, the only option left for L in the first column is the second row.

5. The owner of the guinea-pig (G) is on the right of the German (Ger), so G cannot be in the first column. G must be in the second or third column. Since G is also watching western movies (West), they cannot be in the same column as L (Doc) due to rule 7. So, G must be in the third column.

6. The person driving the train (Tr) is on the left of the person watching western movies (West), so Tr cannot be in the third column. Tr must be in the first or second column. Since the American is a dressmaker (D1) and cannot be Tr, Tr must be in the second column.

7. The owner of the rat (R) is the person driving the bus (Bus), so R must be in the second column.

8. The person who's hobby is cooking (C) is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike (Q), so C cannot be in the third column. C must be in the first or second column. Since C cannot be in the same column as L (Doc) or R (Bus), C must be in the first column.

9. Now we know that the Canadian is the videographer (V3), so the only remaining job for the German is photographer (Ph2).

10. The only remaining movie-genre for the person in the third column is zombie (Z). Since the person in the third column cannot be the American (D1), they must be the photographer (Ph3).

11. The only remaining hobby for the person in the second column is video-games (Vg2).

12. The only remaining transport for the person in the first column is quad-bike (Q1).

Lv1-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating plum is on the far right, so let's place it in the rightmost column of each row.

| Pet           |          |           | goat/rat/rabbit|

2. The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the goat, so the rat must be in the first column and the goat in the second column. Let's place the rat in the first row and the goat in the second row.

|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |

| Pet           | rabbit  |           |             |

3. The firefighter is on the right of the American, so the American must be in the first or second row. Since the firefighter can't be in the first row (because the rat is there), the American must be in the second row. The firefighter can now be placed in the third row.

|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |

| Pet           | rabbit  |           |             |

4. The person watching fantasy movies is in the middle, so it can only be in the second row. Since the American and the firefighter are already in the second row, the person watching fantasy movies must be eating broccoli.

| Pet           | rabbit  |           |             |

5. The manager is the person watching romance movies, so the person watching romance movies must be in the third row. Since the firefighter is already in the third row, the person watching romance movies must be eating nectarine.

6. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the owner of the rabbit, so the person dancing must be in the third column. Since the manager is already in the third column, the person dancing must be the one with the hobby of fishing (British).

7. The British is the person who's hobby is fishing, so the person fishing must be the one with the nationality of german.

8. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the firefighter, so the firefighter must be in the third row. Since the manager is already in the third row, the person eating nectarine must be in the first row.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is not specified to be in a specific position, so we can't determine the hobby for the remaining person.

3. Since the journalist is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, the journalist must be in the first two columns. As the lawyer is already in the first column, the journalist must be in the second column. Let's put the journalist in the ""Job"" column.

Lv1-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the hobby of board-games is not on the far left (rule 7), so it must be in the middle or on the right. Since the coffee drinker is on the right of the person with board-games (rule 1), the hobby of board-games cannot be in the middle. Therefore, it must be on the right.

2. Let's place the hobby of board-games in the rightmost column. Since the hobby of board-games is not on the far left (rule 7), the hobby of writing must be in the leftmost column (rule 4).

3. The hobby of writing is the fan of electronic (rule 4), so electronic is in the first row.

4. Since the hobby of writing is on the far left (placed in step 2), the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be on the far left (rule 3), so it must be in the middle. The nationality of the person with magic-tricks is not Brazilian (rule 3), so it must be either Canadian or Dutch. Let's place it as Canadian for now.

5. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of ice-hockey (rule 5), so the fan of hip-hop must be in the middle row. Since the hobby of board-games is in the rightmost column, the fan of hip-hop cannot be in the rightmost column, so it must be in the left column. This means the sport of ice-hockey is in the middle row and middle column (rule 5).

6. The sport of parkour is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (rule 6), so the person drinking almond-milk must be in the leftmost column. Since the hobby of writing is in the first row and first column, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in the first row, so it must be in the second row. This means the beverage of almond-milk is in the second row and first column.

7. The person eating lime is on the right of the Canadian (rule 8), so the Canadian must be in the middle column. Since the hobby of board-games is in the rightmost column, the Canadian cannot be in the rightmost column, so it must be in the left column. This means the nationality of the person eating lime is Dutch.

8. The person eating mango is on the far right (rule 9), so it must be in the rightmost column. Since the hobby of board-games is in the rightmost column, the person eating mango cannot be in the middle column, so it must be in the leftmost column. This means the food of mango is in the first row and third column.

9. The only remaining nationality is Brazilian. Since the hobby of magic-tricks is in the middle column (placed in step 4), the Brazilian must be in the rightmost column (rule 3).

10. The only remaining sport is weightlifting. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the second row and first column, the sport of weightlifting must be in the second row and second column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Electronic | Hip-hop  | Writing  |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| Almond-milk| Ice-hockey| Lime     |

Lv1-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the musician is in the middle (position 2 or 3), the person watching musical movies must be in position 1. Let's assume the musician is in position 3. So, the person watching musical movies is in position 1.

2. The person who's hobby is traveling is the person eating peach. Since we know the person watching musical movies is in position 1, the person eating peach must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume the person eating peach is in position 2.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person eating peach is in position 2, the person doing skydiving must be in position 1. The person doing volleyball can be in position 3 or 2 (since position 1 is occupied by the person doing skydiving). Let's assume the person doing volleyball is in position 3.

4. The accountant is on the far right. Since the person doing volleyball is in position 3, the accountant must be in position 3.

5. The person watching satire movies is in the middle. Since the musician, the person eating peach, the person doing skydiving, and the accountant are all placed, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1.

6. The fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating zucchini. Since the accountant is in position 3 (far right), the person eating zucchini must be in position 2. So, the fan of gospel is in position 3.

7. The person who's sport is skiing is in the middle. Since the person doing volleyball is in position 3, the person doing skiing must be in position 1.

8. The fan of ambient is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person doing skiing is in position 1, the fan of ambient is in position 0.

1. Since the hamster owner is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with the pets. Let's assume the middle row is 'Hamster'.

2. The Dutch is on the far left, so the first row (Nationality) should be 'Dutch'.

3. The person eating mango is on the left of the Indian. Since the Dutch is on the far left, the second row (Food) should be 'Mango' in the second column, and the third row (Food) should be 'Indian' in the third column.

4. The accountant is on the far right, so the third row (Job) should be 'Accountant'.

5. The videographer is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the hamster owner is in the middle, the second row (Job) should be 'Chef' (as the Dutch is on the left), and the second column of the third row (Job) should be 'Videographer'.

6. The person eating broccoli is on the left of the videographer. Since the second column of the third row (Job) is 'Videographer', the first row (Food) should be 'Broccoli' in the first column.

7. The Dutch is the person driving the bike. Since the Dutch is in the first row, the last column of the fourth row (Transport) should be 'Bike'.

8. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the accountant is on the far right, the second column of the fourth row (Transport) should be 'Trik', and the second row (Movie-Genre) should be 'Epic' in the third column.

Lv1-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating peach is not on the far left (as the fan of ambient is there), and the person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach, the person eating peach cannot be in the first column.

2. The teacher is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the fan of ambient is in the middle and the fan of rock is on the far right, the teacher cannot be in the middle or the far right column. So, the teacher must be in the first column.

3. The person driving the car is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since the teacher is in the first column, the person driving the car must be in the second column.

4. The person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the teacher is in the first column and the person driving the car is in the second column, the person watching mystery movies must be in the third column.

5. The fisherman is on the left of the person playing ice-hockey. Since the person driving the car is in the second column and the person watching mystery movies is in the third column, the person playing ice-hockey must be in the second column. So, the fisherman must be in the first column.

6. The person playing lacrosse is on the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in the first column, the person playing lacrosse must be in the third column.

7. The fan of rock is on the far right. Since the person playing lacrosse is in the third column, the fan of rock must be in the third column.

8. The fan of ambient is in the middle. Since the teacher is in the first column, the person watching mystery movies is in the third column, and the fan of rock is in the third column, the fan of ambient must be in the second column.
