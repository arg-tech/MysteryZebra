Lv1-6x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several steps, starting with the first piece of information and gradually adding more as we go along.

Step 1:
- We know there are 6 people, and each has a food, hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, pet, and sport.
- We also know the relationships between some of them.

Step 2:
1. Let's start with the first piece of information: the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the fan of blues.
   - Since we don't know the positions yet, we can't place them yet. However, we can mark the hobby as ""Gardening"" and the music-genre as ""Blues"" in the first two columns.

Step 3:
2. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
   - We don't have the pets yet, so we can't place them either. However, we can mark the pet column for the second person as ""Rabbit"" and the third person as ""Turtle.""

Step 4:
3. The person eating blueberry is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games.
   - We know the hobby of the third person is video-games (from point 5), so we can mark the food column for the second person as ""Blueberry.""

Step 5:
5. The person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the turtle.
   - We already know the pet of the third person is a turtle, so we can mark the hobby column for the third person as ""Video-games.""

Step 6:
6. The fan of disco is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.
   - We know the pet of the second person is a rabbit, so we can mark the music-genre column for the third person as ""Disco.""

Step 7:
7. The fan of electronic is the person watching spy movies.
   - We don't have the movie-genre for anyone yet, so we can mark the music-genre column for the fourth person as ""Electronic.""

Step 8:
8. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person watching martial-arts movies.
   - We don't have the sport or movie-genre for anyone yet, so we can mark the sport column for the fifth person as ""Lacrosse"" and the movie-genre column for the fifth person as ""Martial-arts.""

Step 9:
9. The owner of the lizard is on the far left.
   - We can mark the pet column for the first person as ""Lizard.""

Step 10:
10. The person eating pomegranate is the owner of the bird.
   - We don't have the pet or food for anyone yet, so we can mark the food column for the sixth person as ""Pomegranate.""

Step 11:
11. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
   - We don't have the sport or hobby for anyone yet, so we can mark the sport column for the first person as ""Ice-hockey"" and the hobby column for the second person as ""Drawing.""

Step 12:
12. The fan of trance is on the left of the person eating lemon.
   - We know the food for the fourth person is lemon, so we can mark the music-genre column for the second person as ""Trance.""

Step 13:
13. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - We don't have the sport or hobby for anyone yet, so we can mark the sport column for the sixth person as ""Rowing"" and the hobby column for the fifth person as ""Collecting.""

Step 14:
14. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
   - We already know the food for the sixth person is pomegranate and the sport for the sixth person is rowing, so this information is redundant.

Step 15:
15. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
   - We already know the movie-genre for the fifth person is martial-arts, and we just placed the hobby for the fifth person, so this information is redundant.

Step 16:
16. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - We don't have the movie-genre for anyone yet, so we can mark the movie-genre column for the sixth person as ""Time-travel.""

   - We already know the food for the fourth person is lemon, so we can mark the movie-genre column for the fourth person as ""Family.""

Step 19:

   - We already know the pet for the first person is a lizard, so this information is redundant.

Step 21:
21. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
   - We don't have the sport or hobby for anyone yet, so we can mark the sport column for the second person as ""Volleyball"" and the hobby column for the first person as ""Fishing.""

Step 22:
22. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the owner of the rat.
   - We don't have the hobby or pet for anyone yet, so we can mark the hobby column for the first person as ""Chess.""

Step 23:
23. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the fan of blues.
   - We already know the music-genre for the third person is blues, so we can mark the music-genre column for the second person as ""Dubstep.""

Step 24:
24. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.
   - We don't have the sport or movie-genre for anyone yet, so we can mark the sport column for the fourth person as ""Climbing"" and the movie-genre column for the third person as ""Comedy.""

Lv1-6x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, so we can fill in the numbers from 1 to 6 in the first column.

2. From rule 3, the person watching crime movies is on the far left, so we can place '1' in the 'Crime' row under the '1' column.

3. From rule 12, the entrepreneur is driving the ship, so we can place '2' (since the entrepreneur is not the person watching crime movies) in the 'Ship' row under the '2' column.

4. From rule 13, the photographer is on the far left, so we can place '3' (since the person watching crime movies is already placed) in the 'Photography' row under the '3' column.

5. From rule 18, the person driving the car is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since we know the person watching crime movies is on the far left, the person watching documentary movies must be on the right of the person watching crime movies, which is '2'. So, we can place '4' (since the person watching crime movies and the photographer are already placed) in the 'Documentary' row under the '4' column and '2' in the 'Car' row under the '4' column.

6. From rule 19, the owner of the frog is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we know the entrepreneur is driving the ship (which is on the left of the dressmaker), the person watching fantasy movies must be on the right of the entrepreneur, which is '3'. So, we can place '5' (since the person watching crime movies, the photographer, the person driving the car, and the owner of the frog are already placed) in the 'Fantasy' row under the '5' column and '3' in the 'Frog' row under the '5' column.

7. From rule 15, the owner of the bird is the person watching musical movies. Since we know the person watching fantasy movies is '3', the person watching musical movies must be '6'. So, we can place '6' in the 'Musical' row under the '6' column and '6' in the 'Bird' row under the '1' column (since the bird owner is on the left of the person driving the taxi).

8. From rule 2, the entrepreneur is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies, so the entrepreneur must be '4' (since the person watching fantasy movies is '3').

9. From rule 14, the social-worker is the fan of punk. Since the social-worker is on the far right and the person watching crime movies is on the far left, the only available spot for the social-worker is '6'. So, we can place '6' in the 'Punk' row under the '6' column.

10. From rule 24, the malaysian is the fan of punk. Since the social-worker is the fan of punk and is '6', the malaysian must be '5'.

11. From rule 11, the American is on the right of the person watching crime movies, so the American must be '2'.

12. From rule 7, the American is the owner of the hamster. Since the American is '2', the hamster owner is '1'.

13. From rule 16, the fan of r&b is on the left of the owner of the frog, so the fan of r&b must be '5' (since the owner of the frog is '5').

14. From rule 23, the fan of soul is on the right of the electrician. Since the electrician has not been placed yet, let's assume the electrician is '6'. Then, the fan of soul must be '4'.

15. From rule 20, the entrepreneur is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies, so the entrepreneur must be '3'.

16. From rule 22, the dressmaker is on the left of the Japanese. Since the photographer is on the far left, the dressmaker must be '2'.

Lv1-6x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the food, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, sports, and transport to the rows and columns.

1. Assign the food:
   - Since the person eating apple is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (A2), and the person driving the tram is the person eating apple (D4), we know that A1 cannot be apple. So, A1 = plum, A2 = apple, A3 = cranberry, A4 = apple, A5 = mango, A6 = pumpkin.

2. Assign the hobbies:
   - The person who's hobby is sudoku is the social-worker (B1), so B1 = sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right (F6), F6 = traveling.

The remaining movie-genres can be assigned as follows: C1 = animation, C2 = western, D1 = animation, D2 = zombie, D3 = mystery, D4 = western, D6 = mystery, E2 = fantasy, E3 = animation, E4 = animation, E5 = sports, E6 = fantasy, F1 = animation, F2 = animation, F3 = animation, F4 = animation, F5 = animation.

5. Assign the sports:
   - The person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is lacrosse (A5 = mango, G5 = sports), so A5 = mango, G5 = lacrosse. The person driving the roller is the person who's sport is skydiving (F4 = traveling, H4 = skydiving), so F4 = traveling, H4 = skydiving. The person driving the boat is the person who's sport is volleyball (F5 = firefighter, G5 = lacrosse, H5 = volleyball), so F5 = firefighter, H5 = volleyball. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the boat (D3 < H5), D3 = mystery. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the far left (I1 = skateboarding). The remaining sports can be assigned as follows: B1 = firefighter, B2 = mechanic, B3 = teacher, B4 = nurse, B5 = social-worker, B6 = freelancer, C1 = biathlon, C2 = climbing, C3 = climbing, C4 = biathlon, C5 = biathlon, C6 = climbing, D1 = cycling, D2 = climbing, D3 = mystery, D4 = western, D6 = western, E1 = biathlon, E2 = climbing, E3 = climbing, E4 = biathlon, E5 = biathlon, E6 = climbing, F1 = climbing, F2 = climbing, F3 = climbing, F4 = climbing, F5 = climbing, F6 = climbing, G1 = animation, G2 = fantasy, G3 = animation, G4 = animation, G5 = lacrosse, G6 = fantasy, H1 = skateboarding, H2 = lacrosse, H3 = volleyball, H4 = skydiving, H5 = volleyball, H6 = lacrosse.

   - The person eating apple is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (A2 > C1), A2 = apple, C1 = card-games. The person driving the tram is the person eating apple (D4 = apple), so D4 = tram. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person watching western movies (G4 < H5), G4 = western, H5 = airplane.
