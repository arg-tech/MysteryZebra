Lv1-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Egyptian is in the middle, we know that positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are occupied by other nationalities. Let's label these positions A, B, C, D, E, and F from left to right.

2. The Egyptian is on the left of the French, so the French cannot be in positions A, B, or C. This means the French is either in D, E, or F.

3. The Dutch is on the right of the French, so the Dutch cannot be in positions A, B, or D. This means the Dutch is either in E or F.

4. The Mexican is on the right of the Italian, so the Italian cannot be in position 7. This means the Italian is either in A, B, C, D, or E.

5. The Thai is on the far left, so the Thai is in position A.

6. The nigerian is on the right of the Dutch, so the Dutch cannot be in position F. This means the Dutch is in position E.

7. Now we know the French is not in positions A, B, or D, and the Dutch is in position E. Since the Dutch is on the right of the French, the French must be in position D.

8. The Italian cannot be in position 7, so the Italian must be in position C.

9. The Mexican is on the right of the Italian, so the Mexican is in position 7.

10. The only nationality left is the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in the middle, the Egyptian is in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |  1   |    2    |    3    |    4     |   5    |   6   |    7     |

Lv1-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the teacher is on the far right, so we can place the teacher in the 7th column.

2. The analyst is on the far left, so we can place the analyst in the 1st column.

3. The analyst is on the left of the manager, so the manager must be in the 2nd column.

4. The manager is on the left of the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur must be in the 3rd column.

5. The librarian is on the right of the nurse, so the nurse must be in the 6th column.

6. The teacher is on the right of the doctor, so the doctor must be in the 5th column.

Now, let's fill in the jobs:

Lv1-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of fishing is on the far right. Since there are 7 hobbies and the drawing person is in the middle, the fishing person must be in the 7th position.

2. Since the fishing person is on the right of the card-games person, the card-games person must be in the 6th position.

3. Now we know that the drawing person is in the 3rd position.

4. The woodworking person is on the left of the card-games person, so woodworking must be in the 5th position.

5. The board-games person is on the right of the rock-climbing person. Since we know the positions of fishing, card-games, drawing, and woodworking, the only available positions for rock-climbing are 1 and 2. If it were in the 1st position, the board-games person would have to be in the 4th position, but that would place the sudoku person in the 5th position, which is where we placed the woodworking person. So, the rock-climbing person must be in the 2nd position, and the board-games person in the 4th position.

6. The sudoku person is on the right of the board-games person, so the sudoku person must be in the 5th position.

7. Now we have filled all the positions except for the 1st. Since all other hobbies are taken, the only hobby left for the 1st position is the remaining hobby, which is card-games (as we placed the fishing person in the 7th position).

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |       1       |      2      |   3    |    4    |      5      |     6      |    7    |

Lv1-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Spanish is on the far left, we can place them in the first column. So, Spanish goes in position 1.

2. The Egyptian is on the left of the Australian. Since the Spanish is on the far left, the Egyptian must be in the second position. So, Egyptian goes in position 2.

3. Now, the Australian must be in the third position because the Egyptian is to their left.

4. The Mexican is on the far right. Since we have already placed the Spanish, Egyptian, and Australian, the Mexican must be in the seventh position. So, Mexican goes in position 7.

5. The Italian is on the left of the Mexican. The only position left to the right of the Mexican is the sixth position. So, Italian goes in position 6.

6. Now, we know the British is in the middle. Counting from the left, the middle position is the fourth. So, British goes in position 4.

7. Finally, we have placed all the nationalities. Here is the final solution table:

1. We know that the snake is in the middle, so we can mark it with S.
2. The turtle is on the far left, so we can mark it with T.
3. The guinea-pig is to the right of the goldfish, and the snake is to the left of the goldfish. Since the snake is in the middle, the goldfish must be on the left of the snake, and the guinea-pig must be to the right of the snake. So, we can mark G and P.
4. The hedgehog is to the left of the lizard, and the turtle is to the left of the hedgehog. Since the turtle is on the far left, the hedgehog must be in the second position. So, we can mark H.
5. Now, we know the positions of T, H, S, G, and P. The lizard must be to the right of the hedgehog, so it can only be in the 4th or 6th position. If it were in the 6th position, the mouse would have to be in the 5th position, but the snake is in the middle, so the lizard must be in the 4th position. So, we can mark L.
6. The only remaining pet is the mouse. Since the lizard is in the 4th position, the mouse must be in the 5th position. So, we can mark M.

The final solution table is:

1. Since the person eating grapes is on the far left, we can place grapes in the first position (1).

2. The person eating apple is on the left of the person eating banana, so apple must be to the left of the banana. However, we can't place apple in the second position because grapes are already there. So, let's place apple in the third position (3).

3. Now, the person eating banana must be to the right of the person eating apple, so banana goes in the fourth position (4).

4. The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person eating banana, so grapefruit goes in the fifth position (5).

5. The person eating lemon is on the left of the person eating pepper, and the person eating pepper is in the middle (position 6). Since we already know the positions of grapes, apple, banana, and grapefruit, the only remaining position for lemon is the second position (2).

6. Now, the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating lettuce. The only remaining positions for lettuce are the first and seventh positions. Since grapes are already in the first position, lettuce must be in the seventh position (7).

4. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since we don't have disaster movies yet, let's place disaster in position 2. Crime should be to the right of disaster (position 3).

Lv1-1x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock, so they can't be in the first two positions. Also, the fan of d&b is in the middle, so it can't be in the first or last position. This means the first three positions can't be house, rock, or d&b. Let's fill the first three positions with the remaining genres: ambient, disco, and folk. So, the first three positions are:

   |               |   ambient | disco   | folk   |  4  |    5    |   6   |  7   |

4. The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of house, so house can't be in the last position. Since we already know the positions of ambient, disco, d&b, and the middle position is already filled with d&b, the last position must be rock.

   | Music-Genre   | ambient  | disco   | d&b    |  4  |          |       |      |

5. The only remaining genre is soul. Since the fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock, and we already know their positions, the fan of house must be in the fifth position.

   | Music-Genre   | ambient  | disco   | d&b    | house  |          |       |      |

3. Now, the goat cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 6th position because it must be on the right of the frog (1st rule) and left of the goldfish (5th rule), and we've placed the pony, cat, and goldfish already. So, the goat can only be in the 3rd position (3).

5. The chinchilla cannot be in the 1st position because it is on the left of the pony (4th rule), and we've already placed the pony. So, the chinchilla can only be in the 2nd position (2).
6. The goldfish is on the left of the goat (5th rule), so it must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. If it were in the 2nd position, the chinchilla would be on its right, violating the 4th rule. So, the goldfish must be in the 3rd position (3).
