Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person eating lime is on the far left, so they are in the first column (Column 1). Let's place lime in the first row.

   |    1    |    2    |     3      |
   |--------|--------|------------|
   | lime   |        |            |

2. The person eating banana is the owner of the pony, so the owner of the pony must be in the third column (Column 3). Since the owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime, the person eating banana must be in the second column (Column 2). Let's place banana in the second row.

   |    1    |    2    |     3      |
   |--------|--------|------------|
   | lime   | banana |            |

3. The person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person eating banana (who is the owner of the pony) is in Column 2, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in the first column (Column 1). Let's place puzzles in the first row.

   |    1    |    2    |     3      |
   |--------|--------|------------|
   | puzzles| banana |            |

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in the first column (Column 1), the person who's hobby is camping must be in the third column (Column 3). Let's place camping in the third row.

   |    1    |    2    |     3      |
   |--------|--------|------------|
   | puzzles| banana | camping    |

5. Now we know that the owner of the pony is in the second column (Column 2) and on the right of the person eating lime, so the person eating lime must be in the first column (Column 1). But we already placed lime in the first column, so this is a contradiction. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

However, if we assume that the person eating lime is in the second column (Column 2) instead of the first column (Column 1), the puzzle can be solved:

   |    1    |    2    |     3      |
   |--------|--------|------------|
   |        | lime   | banana     |
   | puzzles|        |            |
   |        |        | camping    |

In this solution, the person eating kale would be in the third column (Column 3). But since kale is not listed in the table, it's impossible to determine what food the person in the third column is eating."	{}	False	0	False
Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the far right, so let's place the hedgehog owner in the rightmost cell (3).

2. Since the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games, and the hedgehog owner is on the right of the sports movie watcher, we can place the sports movie watcher in the cell to the left of the hedgehog owner (2). Now, the video-games hobbyist must be in the cell to the left of the sports movie watcher (1).

3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the video-games hobbyist is already placed, the gardening hobbyist must be in the leftmost cell (1).

4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since the sports movie watcher and the video-games hobbyist are already placed, the family movie watcher must be in the cell to the left of the sports movie watcher (3). Now, the dog owner must be in the cell to the left of the family movie watcher (2).

5. We know that there are 3 different pets, so the pet in the cell we just placed (2) must be a dog. Since the dog owner is already placed, the pet in the cell to the left (1) must be a different pet, let's say a hamster.

6. Finally, the remaining pet, the hedgehog, is in the rightmost cell (3).

7. For the movie-genres, since the sports movie watcher is already placed, the movie-genre in the cell to the left (1) must be a different genre, let's say action. The remaining genre, family, must be in the leftmost cell (2).

So, the final solution table is:

2. Funk fan is to the right of the ice-hockey fan, so it must be in the second or third row. Since the dubstep fan is in the first row, funk must be in the second row.
   | Dubstep |   | Funk |

3. Gospel fan is the remaining music genre, so it must be in the third row.
   | Dubstep |   | Funk | Gospel |

4. Ice-hockey fan is also the person driving the trike, so we know that the trike is in the second row.
   | Dubstep |   | Funk | Gospel |
   | Ice-hockey |   | Trike |   |

5. The person driving the airplane is on the far left, so it must be in the first row.

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking milk is not on the far right because the person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer, and the dancer can't be on the far right. So, the positions for the beverages are not 1-7up, 2-Juice, 3-Milk.

2. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in the middle, the hobbies can't be 1-Puzzles, 2-Fishing, 3-Magic-tricks.

3. Now, let's consider the jobs. The person drinking milk is on the right of the paramedic, so the jobs can't be 1-Paramedic, 2-Project-manager, 3-Dancer.

4. Combining the information from the previous steps, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer, so the jobs can't be 1-Dancer, 2-Project-manager, 3-Paramedic.

5. Now, let's rearrange the jobs to fit the conditions. The person drinking milk is on the right of the paramedic, so the jobs can be 1-Paramedic, 2-Project-manager, 3-Dancer.

6. Since the person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, the hobbies can be 1-Fishing, 2-Puzzles, 3-Magic-tricks.

Lv1-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of jazz is on the far left, we can place Jazz in the first column.
2. The fan of d&b is on the far right, so we can place d&b in the third column. This also tells us that the dog owner is on the right, so we can place the Dog in the third row.
3. Now we know that the fan of d&b cannot be in the middle (since the fan of Jazz is on the left and the fan of d&b is on the right), so the fan of d&b cannot eat Papaya (since it must be in the middle).
4. The fan of d&b cannot eat Cabbage either, because the owner of the lizard is on the right of the person eating Cabbage, and we already know the fan of d&b is the dog owner.
5. So, the only food left for the fan of d&b is Peas, and the only place left for the fan of d&b is the second column, second row.
6. Now we know that the fan of d&b eats Peas, so the person eating Papaya must be in the middle, which means the second column, first row.
7. The only food left for the person on the far left (the fan of Jazz) is Cabbage, so we place it in the first column, first row.
8. The only pet left for the person on the left is the Hedgehog, so we place it in the first row.
9. The only pet left for the person in the middle is the Lizard, so we place it in the second row.

The final solution table is:

Lv1-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the taxi is the entrepreneur. So, let's place the entrepreneur in the Transport column under the row 3.

   | Transport   |         |              | Taxi         |

2. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since we don't know who is sailing yet, let's assume for now that the person sailing is in the first column. This means the person on skateboard should be in the second column. But the entrepreneur is already in the third column, so the person sailing must be in the third column.

   |             |    3    |      2       |       1       |

   | Transport   |         | Skateboard   | Taxi         |

3. Now we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is in the middle. Since we already placed the entrepreneur and the person sailing, the person playing water-polo must be in the first column.

4. The photographer is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the entrepreneur is driving the taxi and we don't know who is driving the car yet, let's assume for now that the photographer is in the third column. This means the person driving the car must be in the second column. But the person playing water-polo is already in the first column, so the person driving the car must be in the first column. However, we already placed the photographer in the third column, which is a contradiction.

Lv1-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing, and there are only three nationalities, the American cannot be on the leftmost position. So, the American must be in the middle or the rightmost position.

2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the Mexican. Since the American cannot be on the leftmost position, the bus driver must be in the leftmost position. So, the Mexican is in the middle position.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the Spanish. Since the Mexican is in the middle position, the weightlifter must be on the left of the Mexican, which means the weightlifter is in the first position.

4. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the Mexican, but we already placed the weightlifter on the left of the Mexican. This is a contradiction, so we need to reconsider our placement of the weightlifter. Let's assume the weightlifter is in the rightmost position for now.

5. The person who's sport is weightlifting is driving the van. Since the weightlifter is in the rightmost position, the van driver is the Mexican (as the bus driver is already placed).

Now, let's check the sports:
- The American cannot be a surfer because the American is on the right of the surfer, and the surfer is the Mexican (who is in the middle). So, the American must be a baseball player or a weightlifter. Since the American cannot be a weightlifter (as we placed the weightlifter as the Mexican), the American is a baseball player.
- The surfer cannot be the Mexican (as the Mexican is the weightlifter), so the surfer must be Spanish.
- The remaining sport and nationality is baseball and American.

Now, let's check the transport:
- The bus driver is the Mexican (who is the van driver), so the bus is driven by the Mexican.
- The scooter is the only remaining transport, so it must be driven by the American (who is a baseball player).

So, the final solution table is:

2. The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching satire movies, so the person watching satire movies cannot be in the first column. Therefore, the person eating cauliflower must be in the first column, and the person eating potato must be in the second column.

3. Since the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing, and the person eating cauliflower is the person watching satire movies, the person skiing must be in the third row.

4. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the satire watcher, so the person watching thriller movies must be in the third column.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since the person skiing is in the third row, the person snowboarding must be in the second row.

1. We know that the person with the rat is in the middle, so we can fill the second column with 'rat'.

2. Since the person with the rat is in the middle, the person with soccer must be on the left or the right. If the person with soccer was on the left, the person with lacrosse would have to be on the right, but that would violate the third condition (lacrosse is to the right of the snake owner). So, the person with soccer must be on the right.

3. Now, we know the person with soccer is on the right, so the person with lacrosse must be on the left. This means the person with the snake must be in the middle (to the left of lacrosse).

4. The person with coffee is in the middle, but we've already placed the rat and the snake in the middle positions. So, coffee must be in the first or the third column. Since the person with soccer is on the right, and we want to avoid having two middle positions filled, coffee must be in the first column.

5. Now, the only beverage left is sprite. Since the person with the goat is the one drinking 7up, the person with sprite must be the one with the goat. So, the goat is in the third column.

6. Finally, the only sport left is cricket. Since soccer is on the right, and we want to avoid having two people on the right, cricket must be on the left.
