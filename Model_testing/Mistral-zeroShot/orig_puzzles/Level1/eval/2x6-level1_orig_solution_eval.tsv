Lv1-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Let's place the woodworking hobby on the far left (column 1) and the lemonade beverage on the rightmost column (column 6).

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking |   |   |   |   | lemonade |

2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. So, we place skydiving to the right of lemonade (column 5).

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking |   |   | skydiving | lemonade |

3. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee can't be in column 1 (because it's on the right of both woodworking and coffee), we place puzzles in column 2.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking | puzzles |   | skydiving | lemonade |

4. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since coffee can't be in column 1 (because it's on the right of woodworking), we place coffee in column 2.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking | coffee  |   | skydiving | lemonade |

5. The person drinking coffee is also on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since coffee is already in column 2, woodworking must be in column 1.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking | coffee  |   | skydiving | lemonade |

6. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since puzzles is already in column 2, writing must be in column 3.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | woodworking | coffee  | writing  | skydiving | lemonade |

7. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since we have already placed lemonade and milk in the rightmost columns, we can't place cola in column 5 or 6. So, let's place cola in column 4.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |

   | woodworking | coffee  | writing  | cola     | skydiving | milk    |

8. The person who's hobby is iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is already in column 2, iced-tea must be in column 1.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | iced-tea | woodworking | coffee  | cola     | skydiving | milk    |

9. The person drinking iced-tea is also on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since iced-tea is already in column 1, writing must be in column 3.

   |    1   |    2    |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
   |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
   | iced-tea | woodworking | coffee  | cola     | writing  | skydiving | milk    |

10. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since cola is already in column 4, milk must be in column 5.

    |    1   |    2   |      3      |     4     |     5     |    6    |
    |--------|---------|-------------|-----------|-----------|---------|
    | iced-tea | woodworking | coffee  | cola     | writing  | milk    | skydiving |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the lizard. This means the Guinea-Pig cannot be in the last column (column 6).

2. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the owner of the lizard, and the lizard cannot be in the last column, the mouse cannot be in the last row (row 6).

3. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse cannot be in the last row, the dog cannot be in the last row either.

4. The owner of the goldfish is on the far left. This means the goldfish must be in the first column (column 1).

5. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig is not in the last column, the drama movies cannot be in the last row.

6. The owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish is in the first column, the goat must be in the second column.

7. The person watching sports movies is the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse is not in the last row, the sports movies cannot be in the last row either.

8. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the sports movies cannot be in the last row, the disaster movies cannot be in the last column.

9. The person watching action movies is the owner of the goldfish (from point 9).

Now let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |    2    |    3     |   4    |     5      |   6    |

| Pet           |         | Guinea-Pig | Mouse   |         |           |        |

10. The owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (point 6). So, the goat must be in the second row and second column.

11. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the mouse (point 3). Since the dog cannot be in the last row, the dog must be in the first row. This means the mouse must be in the second row.

12. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person watching family movies (point 2). Since the mouse is in the second row, the family movies cannot be in the first column. So, the family movies must be in the second column.

13. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies (point 8). Since the family movies are in the second column, the disaster movies must be in the third column.

14. The person watching sports movies is the owner of the mouse (point 7). Since the mouse is in the second row, the sports movies must be in the fifth row.

Now let's fill in the remaining pets:

|               |    1     |    2    |    3     |   4    |     5      |   6    |

| Pet           | Goldfish | Guinea-Pig | Dog     | Drama  | Action     | Mouse  |

15. The only pet left is the lizard. Since the guinea-pig is to the left of the lizard (point 1), the lizard must be in the fourth column.

16. The only movie genre left is the family movies. Since the family movies are on the left of the disaster movies (point 12), the family movies must be in the first column.

Now let's fill in the remaining movie genres:

|               |    1     |    2    |    3     |   4    |     5      |   6    |

Lv1-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know that the Colombian is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (column 6).

2. Since the Colombian is the fan of country (rule 9), we can place country in the first row (row 1) of column 6.

3. Now, the fan of country is on the right of the German (rule 4). So, the German must be in the 5th column (column 5). Since the fan of country is blues (from rule 1), the blues must be in the first row (row 1) of column 5.

4. The fan of punk is on the left of the British (rule 6), so the British cannot be in the first or second row. The British cannot be in the last column (column 6) because the Colombian is there. So, the British must be in the 3rd row (row 3) and the fan of punk must be in the 2nd row (row 2). Since the fan of punk is on the right of the fan of soul (rule 1), the fan of soul must be in the 1st row (row 1). The fan of soul is soul (from rule 1), so we have filled the first row.

5. The fan of punk is on the right of the Polish (rule 5), so the Polish cannot be in the first or second row. The Poles cannot be in the last column (column 6) because the Colombian is there. So, the Poles must be in the 4th column (column 4). Since the fan of punk is punk (from rule 5), the punk must be in the 2nd row (row 2).

6. The fan of indie is the Chinese (rule 8), so the Chinese must be in the 4th column (column 4) and the indie must be in the 3rd row (row 3).

7. The fan of soul is on the right of the fan of indie (rule 3), so the fan of indie cannot be in the last column (column 6). The fan of soul is soul (from rule 1), so the soul must be in the 1st row (row 1).

8. The fan of blues is on the right of the Colombian (rule 2), so the Colombian cannot be in the last column (column 6). The fan of blues is blues (from rule 1), so the blues must be in the 1st row (row 1).

9. The only remaining music genre is classical. Since all other genres are taken, classical must be in the 6th row (row 6). The nationality for classical can be any of the remaining (British, German, Polish). Let's place the British in the 6th row (row 6) and the classical in the 5th column (column 5).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the airplane is on the far left, and the fan of country is on the far left. So, the first row and the second row should be:
   - Music-Genre: Country
   - Transport: Airplane

2. Now, we know the fan of country is on the far left, so the fan of blues must be in the second position (to the right of country).
   - Music-Genre: Blues

3. The fan of indie is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep is on the far right, indie must be in the fourth position (to the left of dubstep).
   - Music-Genre: Indie

4. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi driver is the fan of disco (from point 5), the taxi driver must be in the third position, and the snowmobile driver in the fifth position.
   - Transport: Taxi (Disco fan)
   - Transport: Snowmobile

5. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the bike yet.

6. The fan of dubstep is on the far right. Since we know the positions of the other music fans, dubstep must be in the sixth position.
   - Music-Genre: Dubstep

7. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the fan of blues. Since blues is in the second position, the helicopter driver must be in the third position.
   - Transport: Helicopter

8. Now, the only remaining position for the fan of classical is the first position (to the left of country).
   - Music-Genre: Classical

9. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is in the fifth position, the ship driver must be in the fourth position.
   - Transport: Ship

10. Finally, the only remaining position for the fan of disco is the third position (since the taxi driver is the fan of disco).

Lv1-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people, and each person represents a row in the table. Each person has a nationality and a preferred music genre.

2. We also know that each person is in one of the columns from 1 to 6.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the American is on the far right, we can place them in column 6. The Chinese is to the left of the American, so they go in column 5. The Mexican is to the right of the fan of dubstep, so the fan of dubstep cannot be in column 6 (since the American is there). Therefore, the fan of dubstep must be in column 1, and the Mexican is in column 2.

4. The Australian is to the left of the fan of country, so the fan of country cannot be in columns 6 or 5 (since the American and Mexican are there). The fan of country must be in column 4, so the Australian is in column 3.

5. The German is the fan of pop, so they go in column 1.

6. The fan of indie is to the right of the Chinese and to the left of the fan of disco. Since the Chinese is in column 5 and the fan of disco is to the right of the brazilian, the fan of disco cannot be in column 6. So, the fan of disco is in column 2, and the fan of indie is in column 3.

7. The brazilian is to the left of the fan of disco, so the brazilian is in column 4.

8. Now we have filled all the nationalities. The music genres are also filled now.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-2x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the owner of the dog is on the far left (position 1). Let's place the dog in position 1.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor |   |   |   |   |   |
| Pet     | dog |   |   |   |   |   |

2. Since the owner of the dog is on the far left, the owner of the snake must be on the right of the owner of the dog (position 6). Let's place the snake in position 6.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor |   |   |   |   |   |
| Pet     | dog |   |   |   |   | snake |

3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the snake, so the chinchilla must be in position 5.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor |   |   |   | chinchilla | snake |
| Pet     | dog |   |   |   |   |   |

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person driving the bike, and the owner of the horse is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the owner of the horse is driving the trike (from point 5), the owner of the guinea-pig must be driving the roller. Let's place the guinea-pig in position 3 and the roller in position 4.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor | roller | guinea-pig | horse (trike) | chinchilla | snake |
| Pet     | dog |   |   |   |   |   |

5. The person driving the bike is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the roller is already in position 4, the bike must be in position 2.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor | bike | roller | horse (trike) | chinchilla | snake |
| Pet     | dog |   | guinea-pig |   |   |   |

6. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the owner of the dog. Since the dog is in position 1, the snowmobile must be in position 6.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor | bike | roller | horse (trike) | chinchilla | snowmobile |
| Pet     | dog |   | guinea-pig |   |   |   |

7. The remaining pet is the turtle. Since there are no available positions left, the turtle must be in position 5, replacing the chinchilla.

| Pet | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
|-----|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transport | motor | bike | roller | horse (trike) | turtle | snowmobile |

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the fan of punk. Since we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of punk (weightlifting), we can place the fan of punk in the table:

   |               |   1   |    2     |     3      |     4      |   5   |       6       |

4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't have any other information about their positions yet, let's place biathlon and ice-hockey for now:

   |               |   1   |    2     |     3      |     4      |   5   |       6       |

5. The person who's sport is golf is the fan of salsa. Since we know that the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of ambient, let's place the fan of salsa:

   |               |   1   |    2     |     3      |     4      |   5   |       6       |

   | Sport         | golf  | biathlon |            |          |       | ice-hockey   |

6. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we know that the fan of hip-hop is the person who's sport is volleyball, we can place ice-hockey:

   |               |   1   |    2     |     3      |     4      |   5   |       6       |

8. The person who's sport is rugby is not mentioned in the puzzle, so we don't have enough information to place it.

9. The person who's sport is reggae is not mentioned in the puzzle, so we don't have enough information to place it.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking tea. Let's place them in the first two spots: [soy-milk, tea].

2. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is already placed, let's place juice in the next available spot: [soy-milk, tea, juice].

3. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the bus. Let's place bus in the first available spot after tea (since we don't know the order of the transports yet): [soy-milk, tea, juice, bus].

4. The person driving the van is the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, we swap hot-chocolate and van: [soy-milk, tea, juice, hot-chocolate, van].

5. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since soy-milk is already placed, let's place bike in the first available spot after juice: [soy-milk, tea, juice, hot-chocolate, van, bike].

6. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we already have them in the correct order, this condition is satisfied.

7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since we already have them in the correct order, this condition is satisfied.

8. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since hot-chocolate is already placed, let's place snowmobile in the first available spot: [soy-milk, tea, juice, hot-chocolate, van, bike, snowmobile].

9. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we don't know the order of the beverages yet, let's place sprite in the first available spot: [soy-milk, tea, juice, sprite, hot-chocolate, van, bike, snowmobile].

10. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since sprite is already placed, let's place iced-tea in the next available spot: [soy-milk, tea, juice, sprite, hot-chocolate, van, bike, snowmobile, iced-tea].

Now, let's place the transports in the correct order based on the condition that the person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the bus:

[soy-milk, tea, juice, sprite, hot-chocolate, van, subway, bike, snowmobile, iced-tea]

Since we don't have any more conditions to arrange the transports, this is the final solution:

```
| Beverage    | soy-milk | tea      | juice    | sprite   | hot-chocolate | van   | subway | bike   | snowmobile | iced-tea |
| Transport   |         |         |         |         |              |      |        |        |            |          |
```

However, the table format doesn't allow for more than 6 columns, so we can't display the full solution in the table provided.

Lv1-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching family movies is on the far right (let's denote this position as R), so the person eating peas is in position 6.

2. The person watching mystery movies is to the left of the person watching family movies, so it must be in position 5. Since the person eating cranberry is watching mystery movies (from rule 3), cranberry goes in position 5.

3. Now, the person eating broccoli is on the far right (rule 2), so it must be in position 1.

4. The person eating onion is to the right of the person watching western movies (rule 4), so onion can't be in position 2 (since it would mean the person watching western movies is in position 1, but we already placed broccoli there). So, onion must be in position 3 or 4. If onion were in position 3, the person watching western movies would have to be in position 2, but we can't place the person eating cranberry there because it's already in position 5. Therefore, onion must be in position 4.

5. The person watching thriller movies is on the far right (rule 5), so it must be in position 1.

6. The person eating kiwi is to the left of the person watching satire movies (rule 8), and the person watching satire movies is to the left of the person watching thriller movies (rule 9). So, satire must be in position 2, and kiwi in position 3.

7. Now, we are left with position 6. Since it's the only empty position and it's the position of the person watching family movies (from rule 7), the person eating the remaining food, which is either cranberry, onion, or peach, must be in position 6. But we already placed cranberry and onion, so the person eating peach must be in position 6.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Food      | Peach | Kiwi  | Broccoli | Onion | Cranberry | Peas   |
|----------|-------|-------|----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| Movie-Genre| Family| Satire|          | Western| Mystery   | Thriller|
