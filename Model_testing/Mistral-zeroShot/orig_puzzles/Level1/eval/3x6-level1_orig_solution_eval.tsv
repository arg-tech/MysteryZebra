Lv1-3x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Malaysian is on the far left (4), the hobby of the person to their right must be hiking (6).
2. The person with the hobby of cooking (3) is on the left of the hobby of hiking (1). So, the possible positions for cooking are 2, 4, and 6. Since the Malaysian is in position 1, hiking must be in position 6. So, cooking can be in positions 2 or 4.
3. The Polish is the fan of metal (3). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the Polish cannot be in position 1. So, the Polish must be in position 5 or 6. But since the fan of metal is the Polish, and the hobby of hiking is in position 6, the Polish cannot be in position 6. So, the Polish must be in position 5.
4. The American is the fan of folk (7). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the American cannot be in position 1. So, the American must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the fan of folk is on the left of the fan of gospel (8), the American cannot be in position 6. So, the American must be in position 2 or 4.
5. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel (8). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the fan of trance cannot be in position 1. So, the fan of trance must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the fan of gospel is on the far right (9), the fan of trance cannot be in position 6. So, the fan of trance can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
6. The fan of punk is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (10). Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the fan of punk cannot be in position 1. So, the fan of punk must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the person with the hobby of photography is on the far right (11), the fan of punk cannot be in position 6. So, the fan of punk can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
7. The person who's hobby is hiking is the Chinese (6).
8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left (12).
9. The fan of gospel is on the far right (9).
10. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the American (5).
11. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the fan of gospel (11).

Now let's put the information together:

- The Malaysian is in position 1, the hobby of hiking is in position 6, and the hobby of cooking is in position 2 or 4.
- The Polish is in position 5, the fan of metal is the Polish, and the American is either in position 2 or 4.
- The fan of trance is in position 2, 3, or 4, the fan of gospel is in position 9, and the fan of punk is in position 2, 3, or 4.
- The person who's hobby is board-games is in position 12.

Since the fan of trance cannot be in position 6 (because the hobby of hiking is in position 6), the fan of trance must be in position 2. This means the American is in position 4, the fan of gospel is in position 3, and the fan of punk is in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |      1      |   2    |      3      |     4     |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby         | Board-games| Trance | Gospel     | Folk     | Metal   | Hiking  |
| Music-Genre   |           |       |            |          |        |         |
| Nationality   | Malaysian  |       |            | American  | Polish  | Chinese |

We still need to fill in the music-genres. Since the American is a fan of folk (7), the fan of folk must be in position 4. Since the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of folk (11), the fan of gospel must be in position 3. Since the fan of punk is on the right of the fan of gospel (10), the fan of punk must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-3x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The teacher is on the far left, so the teacher is in the first column and drinking coffee (C1).
2. The police-officer is on the right of the person drinking tea, so the person drinking tea (T) must be in the second column. Since the teacher is drinking coffee, the tea drinker can't be in the first row (as it would violate rule 3). So, T is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, the police-officer can't be in the first row (as it would violate rule 2), so T can't be in row 2. Also, T can't be in row 6 (as it would violate rule 9). So, T is in row 3, 4, or 5. But T can't be in row 4 (as it would violate rule 4), so T is in row 5.

3. The person drinking hot-chocolate (H) is on the left of the person drinking sprite (S). Since T is in column 5, H must be in column 4. H can't be in row 1 (as it would violate rule 4), so H is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But H can't be in row 6 (as it would violate rule 9), so H is in row 2, 3, or 4. However, H can't be in row 3 (as it would violate rule 4), so H is in row 2.
4. S is on the right of H, so S is in column 6. S can't be in row 1 (as it would violate rule 4), so S is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But S can't be in row 4 (as it would violate rule 4), so S is in row 2, 3, or 5. However, S can't be in row 3 (as it would violate rule 4), so S is in row 2 or 5. But S can't be in row 2 (as it would violate rule 5), so S is in row 5.
5. The police-officer (P) is on the right of the Spanish (E), so E is in column 1. E can't be in row 1 (as it would violate rule 11), so E is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But E can't be in row 6 (as it would violate rule 8), so E is in row 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, E can't be in row 4 (as it would violate rule 11), so E is in row 2, 3, or 5. But E can't be in row 3 (as it would violate rule 10), so E is in row 2.
6. The person drinking cola (C) is the Indian (I), so I is in column 2. I can't be in row 1 (as it would violate rule 10), so I is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But I can't be in row 6 (as it would violate rule 12), so I is in row 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, I can't be in row 4 (as it would violate rule 11), so I is in row 2, 3, or 5. But I can't be in row 3 (as it would violate rule 9), so I is in row 2 or 5. But I can't be in row 2 (as it would violate rule 5), so I is in row 5.
7. The Spanish (E) is on the left of the person drinking cola (I), so I is in row 2.
8. The thai (T) is on the left of the American (A), so A is in column 6. A can't be in row 1 (as it would violate rule 6), so A is in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But A can't be in row 6 (as it would violate rule 8), so A is in row 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, A can't be in row 4 (as it would violate rule 7), so A is in row 2, 3, or 5. But A can't be in row 3 (as it would violate rule 12), so A is in row 2 or 5. But A can't be in row 2 (as it would violate rule 10), so A is in row 5.
9. The person drinking coffee (C1) is on the left of the Thai (T), so T is in column 1.
10. The architect (A) is on the right of the fisherman (F), so F is in column 5.
11. The canadian (Ca) is on the far right, so Ca is in column 6.
12. The project-manager (Pm) is on the right of the Indian (I), so I is in column 2.

Now we have the following table:

|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |        4        |       5        |     6     |

| Nationality   | thai    | spanish       |           | indian         |                | canadian  |

But we have a mistake in the jobs: the teacher is a teacher, not a police-officer. So, the police-officer must be in column 1, and the teacher in column 5. The table should be:

|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |        4        |       5        |     6     |

| Nationality   | thai    | spanish       |           | indian         |                | canadian  |

Lv1-3x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pineapple is on the left of the fan of folk, and the fan of rock is the person eating tomato, we can place the fan of folk and pineapple on the left side of the table, and the fan of rock and tomato on the right side.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person eating apricot. So, we can place the person eating apricot on the left side, and the person drinking soy-milk on the right side.

3. The person drinking mirinda is the person eating watermelon. So, we can place them together.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left, on the same row as the fan of folk. Since the fan of folk is already placed, we can place the iced-tea and the fan of trance on the first row.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of trance. Since the iced-tea is already placed, we can place the fan of trance to the right of it.

6. The fan of punk is on the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the fan of rock and tomato are already placed on the right side, we can place the fan of punk and pomegranate on the left side.

7. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the pineapple is already placed, we can place the hot-chocolate to the left of it.

8. The person eating tomato is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the tomato is already placed, we can place the almond-milk to the right of it.

9. The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of rock and tomato are already placed on the right side, we can place the fan of pop and ambient on the left side.

10. The fan of pop is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the fan of pop is already placed, we can place the person drinking soy-milk to the right of it.

Now, let's arrange the remaining items:

- The only remaining item on the left side is the person eating pomegranate. Since the fan of punk is already placed to the left of it, we can place the person eating pomegranate to the right of the fan of punk.

- The only remaining item on the right side is the person eating watermelon (mirinda). Since the person drinking mirinda is already placed, we can place the person eating watermelon to the left of it.

- The only remaining item is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person eating pineapple is already placed to the right of it, we can place the person drinking hot-chocolate to the left of the person eating pineapple.

Lv1-3x6-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the sports to the first row:

1. Since the person who's sport is climbing is on the far left (1st position), we can assign climbing to the 1st row.
2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating pomegranate (5th row), so skateboarding must be in the 2nd row.
3. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person who's sport is golf (6th row), so biathlon must be in the 3rd row, and golf in the 4th row.
4. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person eating asparagus (5th row), so sailing must be in the 6th row.

Now let's assign the music genres to the second row:

5. The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon (4th row), so funk must be in the 2nd row.
6. The fan of ambient is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (6th row), so ambient must be in the 5th row.
7. The fan of classical is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (6th row), so classical must be in the 1st row.
8. The fan of dubstep is eating kiwi (3rd column), so dubstep must be in the 3rd row.
9. The fan of folk is skiing (6th row), so folk must be in the 4th row.
10. The fan of disco is left open for now.

Now let's assign the food to the first row:

11. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating pomegranate (5th row), so the person eating pomegranate must be in the 2nd row.
12. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating kiwi (3rd column), so the person eating pumpkin must be in the 5th column.
13. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (6th row), so the person eating asparagus must be in the 1st column.
14. The person eating cranberry is the person who's sport is skateboarding (2nd row), so cranberry must be in the 2nd column.
15. The person eating kiwi is the fan of dubstep (3rd row), so kiwi must be in the 3rd column.
16. The person eating potato is left open for now.

Now let's assign the remaining food:

17. The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating asparagus (1st column), so the person eating potato must be in the 2nd column.
18. The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (2nd row), so the person eating pomegranate must be in the 4th column.
19. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating kiwi (3rd column), so the person eating pumpkin must be in the 6th column.

Now we have filled all the rows and columns except for the food in the 5th column and the music genre in the 5th row. Since we know the positions of the other food and the sports, we can deduce that the person eating the remaining food in the 5th column must be eating cranberry (2nd column), as it is the only food left.

20. The person eating cranberry is the person who's sport is skateboarding (2nd row), so the person eating cranberry must be in the 5th column.

Now we have filled all the rows and columns. The final solution table is:

Lv1-3x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Let's place the ship and documentary movies in the table. Since there are 6 positions, the ship can only go in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place the ship in the 1st position (|Ship|Documentary|).

2. Now, the person driving the roller is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the ship is in the 1st position, the roller can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. Let's place the roller in the 2nd position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|). Now, the person drinking milk can only be in the 3rd, 5th, or 6th position. Let's place the milk in the 3rd position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|).

3. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. So, horror movies can only be in the 4th or 6th position. Let's place horror movies in the 4th position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Horror|).

4. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position (due to the roller and milk), let's place hot-chocolate in the 2nd position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Horror|Hot-chocolate|). Now, mystery movies can only be in the 5th or 6th position. Let's place mystery movies in the 5th position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|).

5. The person drinking 7up is the person watching drama movies. Since drama movies are on the far right, 7up must be in the 6th position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|).

6. The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since juice can only be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position, let's place juice in the 4th position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Juice|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|). Now, musical movies can only be in the 2nd position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|).

7. The person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position, let's place the helicopter in the 6th position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|). Now, water can only be in the 1st position (|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

8. The person driving the skateboard is the person watching drama movies. Since drama movies are in the 6th position, the skateboard must be in the 1st position (|Skateboard|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

9. The person driving the taxi is the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda must be in the 6th position, the taxi must be in the 1st position (|Skateboard|Taxi|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

10. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person drinking water. Since water is in the 1st position, the helicopter must be in the 2nd position (|Skateboard|Taxi|Ship|Documentary|Roller|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

11. The person driving the roller is the person watching documentary movies. Since documentary movies are in the 2nd position, the roller must be in the 1st position (|Skateboard|Taxi|Ship|Roller|Documentary|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

12. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching horror movies. Since horror movies are in the 3rd position, drama movies must be in the 4th position (|Skateboard|Taxi|Ship|Roller|Documentary|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Drama|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|).

13. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the taxi is in the 1st position and documentary movies are in the 2nd position, this condition is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

|Skateboard|Taxi|Ship|Roller|Documentary|Milk|Musical|Helicopter|Drama|Horror|Hot-chocolate|Mystery|7up|Water|

Lv1-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 food items, 6 movie genres, and 6 music genres. Each row (food, movie-genre, music-genre) should have a unique item from its respective list.

2. Let's assign the food items to the first row (Food):
   - Since the fan of trance is eating tomato (1. trance eats tomato), we can place tomato in the 6th column (column 1 has been taken by another food item).
   - The person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating pineapple (7. eggplant > pineapple), so we can place pineapple in the 4th column and eggplant in the 5th column.
   - The person eating cherry is on the left of the person eating eggplant (12. cherry < eggplant), so we can place cherry in the 3rd column.
   - The person eating blueberry is on the left of the fan of electronic (5. blueberry < electronic), so we can place blueberry in the 2nd column.
   - The person eating pear is left of the fan of reggae (13. pear < reggae), so we can place pear in the 1st column. This leaves the 6th food item, which must be placed in the 6th column.

3. Now let's assign the movie genres to the second row (Movie-Genre):
   - The person watching adventure movies is the fan of reggae (6. adventure = reggae), so we can place reggae in the 6th column (since we already know that the fan of reggae is watching adventure movies).
   - The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (3. romance < adventure), so we can place romance in the 5th column.
   - The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person eating pineapple (9. satire < pineapple), so we can place satire in the 4th column.
   - The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person eating eggplant (10. horror > eggplant), so we can place horror in the 5th column.
   - The person watching musical movies is on the right of the fan of trance (2. musical > trance), so we can place musical in the 3rd column. This leaves the 6th movie genre, which must be placed in the 6th column.

4. Finally, let's assign the music genres to the third row (Music-Genre):
   - The fan of gospel is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (4. gospel < adventure), so we can place gospel in the 2nd column.
   - The fan of electronic is on the left of the person watching satire movies (8. electronic < satire), so we can place electronic in the 1st column.
   - The fan of r&b is on the far right (11. r&b is in the 6th column), so we can place r&b in the 6th column.
   - The fan of trance is on the right of the person watching musical movies (2. trance > musical), so we can place trance in the 3rd column.
   - The fan of disco is not specified yet, but since there are only 6 music genres and we have placed 5 of them, disco must be in the 4th column.
   - The fan of electronic is not specified to be on the left of any other music genre, so it can be in any column. However, since we have placed it in the 1st column already, the remaining music genre, which is electronic, must be in the 5th column.

Lv1-3x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, sports, and transports are all different for each person, so we can fill in unique symbols for each column and row. Let's use H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 for hobbies, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6 for sports, and T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6 for transports.

2. From the given information, we can start by placing some people based on their hobbies and sports:
   - H6 is collecting because it's on the right of the person driving the helicopter (T3). Let's place H6 in column 6.
   - S2 is cricket because it's the person who's hobby is video-games (H5).
   - S4 is baseball because it's on the far right (column 6) and also the same as H6 (rock-climbing, from condition 9).
   - S1 is rugby because it's on the left of the person driving the train (T4) and also the person who's hobby is cooking (H3, from condition 12).

   - H1 is the hobby on the left of H6 (collecting) because it's not cooking (H3) or drawing (H1). Let's place H1 in column 1.
   - H2 is the hobby on the left of H3 (cooking) because it's not collecting (H6) or drawing (H1). Let's place H2 in column 2.
   - H3 is cooking because it's the hobby on the left of H6 (collecting) and also the sport is rugby (S1).
   - H4 is the hobby on the left of H5 (video-games) because it's not collecting (H6) or cooking (H3). Let's place H4 in column 4.

5. We can now place some sports based on their positions:
   - S3 is handball because it's on the left of S5 (surfing, from condition 13) and not rugby (S1).
   - S5 is surfing because it's on the right of S3 (handball) and also the same as H4 (rock-climbing, from condition 7).

6. We can now place the remaining hobbies and sports:
   - H5 is video-games because it's the sport of S2 (cricket).
   - S6 is weightlifting because it's the remaining sport and not any of the sports we've placed so far.

7. Finally, we can place the remaining transport:
   - T1 is the jet-ski because it's the remaining transport and not any of the transports we've placed so far.
   - T2 is the roller because it's on the right of T3 (helicopter) and on the left of H1 (drawing, from condition 11).
   - T5 is the scooter because it's on the left of T4 (train) and on the right of T3 (helicopter).

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is the person eating onion, so onion goes in the third column (column 3).

9. The person eating lime is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so fantasy movies cannot be in the first three columns. Let's place fantasy movies in the second row (row 2).

10. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, so comedy movies cannot be in the first five rows. Let's place comedy movies in the sixth row (row 6).

11. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing, so dancing cannot be in the sixth column. Let's place dancing in the fifth column (column 5).

12. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing, so video-games goes in the sixth row (row 6).

Now, let's place the remaining food items:

13. The only remaining food item is spinach. Since it's not a neighbor to any of the already placed food items, it can go in any of the six columns. Let's place spinach in the first column (column 1).

Finally, let's place the remaining movie genres:

14. The only remaining movie genre is animation. Since it's not a neighbor to any of the already placed movie genres, it can go in any of the six rows. Let's place animation in the third row (row 3).

15. The only remaining movie genre is comedy. Since it's on the right of gardening, it goes in the sixth row (row 6).

Here is the final solution table:

```
