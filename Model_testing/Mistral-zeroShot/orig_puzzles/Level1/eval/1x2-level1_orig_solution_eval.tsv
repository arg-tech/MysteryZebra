Lv1-1x2-1	"Let's break this down:

1. We have two types of food: asparagus and spinach.
2. The person eating asparagus is on the left of the person eating spinach.

From this information, we can deduce that the arrangement of the food must be either:

| Food   | 1   | 2   |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Asparagus |#############| |
| Spinach |       |#############|

or

| Food   | 1   | 2   |
|--------|-----|-----|
| Asparagus |#############|
| Spinach |       |#############|

Since the table only has two rows, the first arrangement is the correct one. So, the final solution table is:

```
############# | Asparagus |
|             |----------|
############# | Spinach  |
```

Final answer:

```
############# | Asparagus |
|             |----------|
############# | Spinach  |

Lv1-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people watching different movie genres, and one of them is watching a family movie, which is on the far right.

2. Since there are only two people and one genre (family) is on the far right, the other genre (documentary, for example) must be on the left.

3. Now, we can fill in the table:

   |               |      1      |   2    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Family |

   Since the family movie is on the far right, the table with the final solution is:

   |               |      1      |   2    |
   | Movie-Genre   |############| Family |
   |#############| Documentary|#############

   In this table, the '############' represents the unknown person, and the solution is that the person on the left is watching a documentary, and the person on the right is watching a family movie."	{}	False	0	False
Lv1-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. There are two different music genres: house and R&B.
2. The fan of house is on the far right.

Let's assign the genres to the columns:

1. Column 1: R&B (since the house fan is on the far right, the R&B fan must be on the left)
2. Column 2: House (as per the given condition)

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Music-Genre   |   1   |   2   |
#############
| R&B           |   ### |   ### |
| House         |   ### |   ### |

Since we don't have specific values for the cells, we'll fill them with '#' to represent the unknown preferences of the individuals."	{'r&b': ['', ''], 'house': ['', '']}	False	0	False
Lv1-1x2-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. The people have 2 different hobbies: dancing and writing.
2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.

Let's assign the hobbies to the columns based on the given information:

1. If the person on the left has writing as a hobby, then the person on the right must have dancing as a hobby. So, the first column could be 'Writing'.
2. Now, since the hobbies are different, the second column must have 'Dancing'.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Writing   | Dancing |

This table represents the final solution to the given logic puzzle."	{}	False	0	False
Lv1-1x2-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. There are two people, and they prefer two different music genres: country and pop.
2. The fan of pop is on the left of the fan of country.

Let's assign the music genres to the two people:

1. Let's assume the person on the left prefers pop (P).
2. Since the fan of country (C) is on the right, we can now fill in the table:

|               |  1  |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | Pop | Country |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-1x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two pets: fish and hamster.
2. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the owner of the fish.

From this information, we can deduce that the arrangement must be either:

|       |  1   |    2    |
|-------|------|---------|
| Pet   | Fish | Hamster |

or

|       |  1   |    2    |
|-------|------|---------|
| Pet   | Hamster| Fish    |

Since the owner of the hamster is on the right of the owner of the fish, the first arrangement is the correct one.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x2-7	"To solve the puzzle, we can use the given information to deduce the nationalities of the two individuals.

1. Since there are only two nationalities (Australian and Egyptian), we can represent them as A and E, respectively.

2. The Australian is on the far left, so the first row must be A.

3. Now we have the following table:

   |               |      A      |     B     |
   | Nationality   |            |          |

4. Since there are only two nationalities, the second row must be E.

5. So the final solution table is:

   |               |      A      |     E     |
   | Nationality   | Australian |   Egyptian |

   Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. There are two people, and they prefer two different music genres: d&b and jazz.
2. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz.

Let's assign the music genres to the columns:

|   | d&b  | jazz |
|--|------|------|

Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of jazz, we can assign the person who prefers d&b to column 1 and the person who prefers jazz to column 2.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   | d&b  | jazz |
#############
```

In this table, the first column represents the person who prefers d&b, and the second column represents the person who prefers jazz, with the person who prefers d&b on the left."	{}	False	0	False
Lv1-1x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food: cherry and kale.
2. The person eating cherry is on the left of the person eating kale.

From this information, we can deduce the following:

- If the first column has cherry, the second column must have kale, because the condition about the position of the eaters is met. However, this would mean that the first eater is eating cherry and not eating it, which is a contradiction. So, the first column cannot have cherry.

- If the first column has kale, the second column must have cherry, because the condition about the position of the eaters is met. In this case, the first eater is eating kale, which is possible. So, the first column can have kale.

Final solution:

```
#############
|   Kale    | Cherry |

Lv1-1x2-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's use the given information:

1. There are two jobs: software-developer and teacher.
2. The software-developer is on the left of the teacher.

Let's assign the jobs to the columns based on the given information:

1. If we place the software-developer on the left, the only possible job for the right column is the teacher, as the software-developer must be on the left.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
