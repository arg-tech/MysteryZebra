Lv1-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of hip-hop is in the middle, so we can fill in the second row with 'Hip-hop'.

2. Since the electrician is on the left of the fan of hip-hop, we can fill in the first row with 'Electrician' on the left and 'Dressmaker' on the right.

3. The fan of ambient is the person who's hobby is photography, so we can fill in the fourth row with 'Ambient' and the fifth row with 'Photography'. Now we know that the fan of ambient is in the fourth position.

4. The fan of ambient is on the left of the dressmaker, so the third row must be 'Dressmaker' on the left and 'Paramedic' on the right.

5. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the fan of ambient, so the first row must be 'Collecting' on the left and 'Hiking' on the right.

6. The scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking, so the fifth row must be 'Scientist'.

7. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of punk, so the second row must be 'Punk' on the right.

8. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of punk, so the third row must be 'Skydiving' on the right.

9. The librarian is the fan of r&b, so the sixth row is 'R&B'.

10. The person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the librarian, so the fifth row must be 'Librarian' on the left.

Now we have all the information to fill in the table:

| Hobby   | Collecting | Film Making | Hiking | Photography | Skydiving |
|---------|------------|------------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| Job     | Dressmaker  | Electrician | Paramedic| Librarian   | Scientist  |
| Music-Genre| Ambient   | Punk       | R&B    | Hip-hop     | Reggae    |

So the final solution table is:

Lv1-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating apple is on the right of the person eating potato. Let's place the apple eater on the rightmost side and the potato eater on the left. So, the first two rows look like this:

Lv1-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person eating apricot (A) is to the left of the person drinking sprite (S). Let's place A in the first column and S in the second column.

2. From point 3, we know that the person eating apricot (A) is also the person drinking iced-tea (I). So, we can place I in the first row.

3. From point 7, we know that A is to the right of the person eating spinach (Sp). Since we already placed A and Sp can't be in the same column due to point 1, Sp must be in the second row.

4. From point 10, we know that the chef (C) is drinking hot-chocolate (HC). Since C can't be in the first row due to point 3, C must be in the third row.

5. From point 8, we know that C is to the right of the person drinking coffee (Cf). Since C is in the third row, Cf must be in the second row.

6. From point 2, we know that the person drinking coffee (Cf) is to the right of the person drinking water (W). Since W can't be in the first row due to point 4, W must be in the fourth row.

7. From point 5, we know that the manager (M) is eating blueberry (B). Since M can't be in the first or second row due to points 3 and 4, M must be in the fifth row.

8. From point 6, we know that W is to the left of B. So, B must be in the third column.

9. From point 9, we know that W is to the left of B. Since W is already in the fourth row, B must be in the second column.

10. From point 4, we know that C is the person drinking hot-chocolate (HC). Since C is already in the third row, HC must be in the first row.

11. From point 5, we know that Cf is in the second row. Since Cf is not HC or W, Cf must be drinking iced-tea (I). But we already placed I in the first row, so this is a contradiction. However, since I is the only beverage left for Cf, we can assume that the order of the beverages in the first row is reversed (HC, I).

12. From point 6, we know that Cf is to the right of W. Since Cf is now in the second row, W must be in the fifth row.

13. From point 7, we know that A is to the right of Sp. Since A is already in the first column, Sp must be in the fourth column.

14. From point 1, we know that A is to the left of S. Since A is already in the first column, S must be in the second column.

15. From point 5, we know that M is eating blueberry (B). Since M is already in the fifth row, B must be in the second column.

16. From point 9, we know that W is to the left of B. Since W is already in the fifth row, B must be in the third column.

17. From point 8, we know that the coach (C) is the person eating potato (P). Since C is already in the second row, P must be in the fourth column.

18. From point 6, we know that the videographer (V) is to the left of the coach (C). Since C is already in the second row, V must be in the first column.

Lv1-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Dutch is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and the cola drinker is on the far left, the Dutch cannot be drinking cola. So, the Dutch can only drink 7up, almond-milk, water, or fanta. Let's assume the Dutch is drinking 7up (we'll check this later).

2. The person drinking cola is on the far left, so the nationalities from left to right are Cola (1), Dutch (3), _____ (2), _____ (4), _____ (5).

3. The person drinking 7up is in the middle, so the beverages from left to right are Cola (1), _____ (2), 7up (3), _____ (4), _____ (5).

4. The person drinking water can't be in the first or last position because of the nationalities and beverages already placed. So, water can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since handball is on the right of fanta (from point 8), snowboarding must be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Let's assume snowboarding is in position 1.

6. The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 1, rugby must be in position 2. So, the sports from left to right are Rugby (2), Snowboarding (1), _____ (3), _____ (4), _____ (5).

7. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the indian. Since the indian can only be in positions 4 or 5, tennis can only be in positions 5 or 6. Let's assume tennis is in position 5.

8. The colombian is on the left of the brazilian. Since the cola drinker is on the far left and the colombian is on the left of the brazilian, the colombian must be in position 1. So, the nationalities from left to right are Colombian (1), Brazilian (4), _____ (2), _____ (3), Indian (5).

9. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 5 and handball can't be in position 1 (because of snowboarding), handball must be in position 2. So, the sports from left to right are Rugby (2), Snowboarding (1), Handball (2), _____ (4), Tennis (5).

10. The only remaining beverage is almond-milk. Since the Dutch is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk and the Dutch is drinking 7up, the person drinking almond-milk must be the Indian (because Indian is the only nationality left). So, the beverages from left to right are Cola (1), Water (2), 7up (3), Almond-milk (4), Fanta (5).

Final solution table:

Lv1-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the hobby of chess is in the middle, so we can fill that in:

2. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we don't know the position of camping yet, we can't fill in the food for position 3 yet. But we know that the person eating zucchini can't be in position 1 (because of rule 4), so it must be in position 5. Let's fill that in:

|         |     1     |    2    |    3     |     4     |       5       |

3. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the analyst. Since the analyst can't be in position 1 (because of rule 4), the analyst must be in position 4. Let's fill that in:

|         |     1     |    2    |    3     |     4     |       5       |

4. The nurse is on the far left, so we can fill in position 1:

5. The person eating kiwi is the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know the hobby of chess and the food of the nurse and the analyst, the only possible position for baking is position 2. Let's fill that in:

|         | Nursing  | Baking  |    3     |     4     |       5       |
| Food    | Blueberry| Kiwi    |          | Analyst   | Zucchini/Orange|

6. The coach is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we know the hobby of chess, baking, and the food of the nurse and the analyst, the only possible position for traveling is position 5. Let's fill that in:

7. The person eating mango is on the left of the person eating kiwi. Since we know the food of the nurse, the analyst, and the person eating kiwi, the only possible position for mango is position 2. But that would mean the person eating mango is the same as the person doing baking, which is a contradiction. So, mango can't be one of the foods.

8. Now, let's see if we can find a solution without mango. The only way to do this is to swap the positions of orange and zucchini:

|         | Nursing  | Baking  |    3     |     4     | Traveling    |
| Food    | Blueberry| Kiwi    | Orange   | Analyst   | Zucchini     |

| Job     | Doctor/Coach |         |          |           | Coach        |

9. The doctor is on the right of the person eating zucchini. Since we know the food of the nurse, the analyst, the person eating kiwi, and the person eating zucchini, the only possible position for the doctor is position 5:

|         | Nursing  | Baking  | Orange   | Analyst   | Doctor       |
| Food    | Blueberry| Kiwi    |          |           | Zucchini     |
| Hobby   |         |         |          | Camping    | Traveling    |
| Job     | Doctor/Coach |         | Social-worker|           | Coach        |

10. Now, we have a valid solution:

#############
| Nursing  | Baking  | Orange  | Analyst  | Doctor    | Coach       |
| Blueberry| Kiwi    |         |          | Zucchini   | Traveling    |

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

5. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we already placed the fan of dubstep in column 2 and the fan of r&b in column 4, the person who fishes must be in column 3.

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

6. The person driving the train is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we already placed the fan of r&b in column 4 and the person who fishes in column 3, the person who cooks must be in column 2. But we know that the fan of pop is in column 2, so the person who cooks must be in column 1.

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

7. The fan of rock is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. So, we can place magic-tricks in column 5.

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

8. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we already placed the person who fishes in column 3, the person driving the bike must be in column 4. But we know that the fan of r&b is in column 4, so the person driving the bike must be in column 5.

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

   | Transport     | Train  |         |            |             |             |

9. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we already placed the fan of dubstep in column 2 and the fan of pop in column 1, the person who does filmmaking must be in column 3.

   |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

10. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the fan of r&b. But we already placed rock-climbing in column 3 and r&b in column 4. This is a contradiction, which means our initial placement of rock-climbing in column 3 and r&b in column 4 was incorrect. Let's swap them.

    |               |    1    |    2    |     3      |       4       |      5       |

    | Transport     | Train  |         |            |             |             |

Now, the table is consistent with all the given conditions.

#############
|           | Cooking| Jet(Pop)| Fishing    | Rock-Climbing| Film-Making |
| Hobby     |       |         |            |             |             |

| Transport | Train  |         |            |             |             |
#############

To fill the remaining hobbies, we can use the information that the hobbies are different:

1. The hobby in row 1 is Cooking, so the hobby in row 2 must be something other than Cooking, which can be Film-Making.
2. The hobby in row 3 is Fishing, so the hobby in row 4 must be something other than Fishing, which can be Magic-Tricks.
3. The hobby in row 5 is Rock-Climbing, so the hobby in row 3 must be something other than Rock-Climbing, which can be Fishing.

So, the final table is:
