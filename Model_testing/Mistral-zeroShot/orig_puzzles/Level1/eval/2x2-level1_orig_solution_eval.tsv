Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, each preferring a different movie genre (epic and musical) and a different mode of transport (subway and trike).

2. The person watching an epic movie is on the left of the person driving the subway. This means that the person watching an epic movie cannot be driving the subway, as they must be on the left of it. So, the epic movie viewer is either watching a movie or driving a trike.

3. Since there are only two people and they prefer different movie genres, the person driving the subway must be watching a musical.

4. Now, we know that the person watching an epic movie is not driving the subway, so they must be driving the trike or watching a musical. But we already know that the person driving the subway is watching a musical, so the person watching an epic movie must be driving the trike.

5. Finally, since the person watching an epic movie is on the left of the person driving the subway, the arrangement must be as follows:

| Movie-Genre | Transport |
|------------|----------|
| Epic      | Trike    |
| Musical   | Subway   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Transport |

Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different types of food (eggplant, kiwi) and two different types of sports (skateboarding, snowboarding).

2. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

3. Let's assign the variables F1 and F2 for the food, and S1 and S2 for the sports.

4. Since there are two types of food and two types of sports, we can write the possible combinations as follows:

   |         |       1       |      2       |
   | Food    | F1 (eggplant) | F2 (kiwi)    |
   | Sport   | S1 (skateboarding) | S2 (snowboarding) |

5. Now, let's consider the condition that the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means that the person who eats kiwi must be in column 2, and the person who does skateboarding must be in column 1.

6. So, the final solution table would be:

   |         |       1       |      2       |
   | Food    | F1 (eggplant) | F2 (kiwi)    |
   | Sport   | S2 (snowboarding) | S1 (skateboarding) |

   So, the final solution is:

Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages: milk and soy-milk. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. We also know there are two different types of food: orange and spinach. Let's label them as C and D respectively.

3. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person eating spinach. This means that if we arrange them in a row, it would look like this: C - D - A or D - A - C (since we don't know the exact order yet).

4. Since there are only two positions left for two different foods, the only possible arrangement is D - A - C.

5. Now, we can fill in the table:

   |            |    1     |   2    |
   | Beverage   | soy-milk (B) | milk (A) |
   | Food       | spinach (D) | orange (C) |

Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two nationalities: French and Indonesian. Let's denote F for French and I for Indonesian.

2. We also know there are two sports: cycling and parkour. Let's denote C for cycling and P for parkour.

3. The Indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. This means that if the cyclist is in column 1, the Indonesian must be in column 2, and if the cyclist is in column 2, the Indonesian must be in column 1.

4. Since there are only two nationalities and they are different, we can't have two cyclists or two parkour athletes. So, one person must do cycling and the other person must do parkour.

5. Let's assume the cyclist is in column 1. Then, the Indonesian must be in column 2. The remaining nationality (French) and sport (parkour) must go into the empty cell in column 1, row 2.

6. However, if we place the French in column 1, row 2, the Indonesian would be in column 2, row 1, which contradicts the rule that the Indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.

7. Therefore, our initial assumption was wrong. The cyclist must be in column 2, row 1. The Indonesian must be in column 1, row 2. The French and parkour athlete must be in the remaining cell, which is column 2, row 2.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages: hot-chocolate and sprite.
2. We also know there are two different movie genres: crime and horror.

Let's assign variables to the unknowns:
- B1 and B2 for the beverages (B1 = hot-chocolate, B2 = sprite)
- M1 and M2 for the movie genres (M1 = crime, M2 = horror)

From the puzzle, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies. This means that the arrangement must be:
- If B1 = hot-chocolate, then M1 = crime (since hot-chocolate is on the left)
- If B2 = sprite, then M2 = horror (since sprite is on the right)

Now we can arrange the table:

|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Sprite |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime         | Horror |

Lv1-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food: apple and asparagus. Let's denote apple as A and asparagus as S.

2. We have two types of transport: helicopter (H) and taxi (T).

3. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus. This means that if we arrange them in a row, it would look like this: S _ T.

4. Since there are only two people (one eating and one driving), the other person must be eating an apple (A). So, the arrangement would be: S A T.

5. Now, we can fill in the table:

|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | S (asparagus) | A (apple) |

Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages (almond-milk, soy-milk) and two different hobbies (dancing, writing).

2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

3. Since there are only two people, and one of them is a writer, the other one must not be a writer. So, the person on the left of the almond-milk drinker must be either a dancer or a soy-milk drinker.

4. If the person on the left was a dancer, then the writer would have to be on the right of the soy-milk drinker, but since the writer is already placed, this is not possible.

5. Therefore, the person on the left must be a soy-milk drinker. This leaves the right seat for the writer and the almond-milk in the left seat.

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Almond-milk| Writing |
| Soy-milk   | Dancing |

Lv1-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages: cola and mirinda. Let's denote them as B1 (cola) and B2 (mirinda).

2. We also know there are two different jobs: firefighter (J1) and writer (J2).

3. The writer is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. This means that if we denote the positions as (1, 2) for the table, the writer must be in position 2, and the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1.

4. Now we know the job of the person in position 1 (let's call it P1). Since there are only two jobs, the person in position 2 must have the other job (let's call it P2).

5. Since the jobs and beverages are independent, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |      1      |   2    |
   | Beverage   | B1         | B2     |
   | Job        | P1         | P2     |

6. Now we need to assign the specific beverages and jobs to the positions. Since the writer is in position 2, P2 must be writer. The only remaining job is firefighter, so P1 must be a firefighter.

7. Since there are only two beverages, B1 must be cola, and B2 must be mirinda.

8. So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two nationalities (Brazilian and Colombian) and two pets (Ferret and Mouse).

2. The Brazilian is on the right of the owner of the Ferret. This means that the owner of the Ferret cannot be Brazilian because the Brazilian is on their right, and we know there are only two nationalities.

3. So, the owner of the Ferret must be Colombian. Let's place the Colombian in the first column and the Ferret in the first row:

   | Nationality   |     1     |     2     |
   |--------------|----------|----------|
   | Pet           | Ferret   |          |
   | Nationality   | Colombian|          |

4. Now, we know that the Brazilian is on the right of the owner of the Ferret, so the Brazilian must be in the second column and the second row. But the pet in the second row is not specified yet.

Lv1-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different favorite beverages: 7up and tea. Let's assign them to the columns, with tea in column 1 and 7up in column 2 for now.

   |            |     1      |   2    |
   | Beverage   | Tea       | 7up   |

2. We also know there are 2 different hobbies: card-games and hiking. Let's assign them to the rows, with card-games in row 1 and hiking in row 2 for now.

   | Hobby      |     1      |   2    |
   |-----------|-----------|-------|
   | Card-games| Person A  |       |
   | Hiking    |           | Person B|

3. Now we know that the person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. This means Person B must be drinking tea.

   | Hobby      |     1      |   2    |
   |-----------|-----------|-------|
   | Card-games| Person A  | Person B (Tea) |
   | Hiking    |           | Person C (7up) |

4. Since we know that there are only 2 different beverages, Person A must be drinking 7up.

   | Hobby      |     1      |   2    |
   |-----------|-----------|-------|
   | Card-games| Person A (7up) | Person B (Tea) |
   | Hiking    |           | Person C (7up) |

5. However, we have two people drinking 7up, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption about the beverages was incorrect. Let's swap the beverages in the columns.

   |-----------|-----------|-------|
   | Card-games| Person A (Tea) | Person B (7up) |
