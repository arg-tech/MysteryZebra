Lv1-7x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let's use B for beverage, H for hobby, J for job, M for movie-genre, N for nationality, P for pet, and T for transport. We'll use numbers 1-7 to represent the seven people.

2. Let's start with the given information:
   - The Chinese is driving the tram (T7), so T7 = tram, N7 = Chinese.
   - The person driving the skateboard (T5) is the journalist (J5), and J5's hobby (H5) is skydiving (S). So, T5 = skateboard, H5 = skydiving, J5 = journalist.
   - The person driving the quad-bike (T4) is the Polish (N4) and watches western movies (M4). So, T4 = quad-bike, N4 = Polish, M4 = western.
   - The person driving the bike (T3) is on the right of the Turkish (N6), so T3 is not on the far left or far right. Also, T3 is not the tram, skateboard, quad-bike, or motorbike (since we know who drives those). So, T3 = bike.
   - The person driving the motorbike (T2) is on the left of the Australian (N1), so T2 is not on the far right. Also, T2 is not the tram, skateboard, quad-bike, bike, or taxi (since we know who drives those). So, T2 = motorbike.
   - The person driving the taxi (T1) is on the left of the owner of the rat (P1), so T1 is not on the far right. Also, T1 is not the tram, skateboard, quad-bike, bike, or motorbike (since we know who drives those). So, T1 = taxi.

3. Now let's use the given information to fill in more details:
   - The person driving the skateboard (J5) is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (B5), so B5 = soy-milk.
   - The person drinking tea (B2) is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (H2), so H2 = photography, B2 = tea.
   - The person drinking water (B6) is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (J5), so B6 = water.
   - The person drinking cola (B1) is the person who's hobby is board-games (H1), so H1 = board-games, B1 = cola.
   - The person drinking milk (B3) is on the right of the owner of the cat (P3), so P3 = cat, B3 = milk.
   - The person drinking mirinda (B4) is the owner of the dog (P4), so P4 = dog, B4 = mirinda.
   - The owner of the goldfish (P2) is on the left of the entrepreneur (J2), so J2 is not on the far left. Also, J2 is not the journalist (since we know who drinks soy-milk). So, J2 = entrepreneur.
   - The person watching comedy movies (M3) is the person drinking soy-milk (B5), so M3 = comedy.
   - The person watching western movies (M4) is the Polish (N4), so M4 = western.
   - The person watching animation movies (M1) is in the middle, so M1 = animation.
   - The person watching romance movies (M2) is the paramedic (J6), so M2 = romance.
   - The person watching musical movies (M5) is on the right of the person drinking coffee (B6), so B6 = coffee, M5 = musical.
   - The person who's hobby is fishing (H4) is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (H6), so H4 = fishing, H6 = traveling.
   - The person who's hobby is drawing (H3) is in the middle, so H3 = drawing.
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving (S) is on the left of the firefighter (J7), so J7 = firefighter, S = skydiving.
   - The Australian (N1) is on the right of the person driving the taxi (T1), so N1 = Australian.
   - The British (N2) is on the left of the person watching spy movies (M2), so N2 = British.
   - The person who's hobby is cooking (H6) is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (P2), so H6 = cooking.
   - The person who's hobby is traveling (H6) is on the right of the person drinking tea (B2), so H6 = traveling.
   - The person who's hobby is board-games (H1) is on the far left, so H1 = board-games.

4. Now we have filled in all the information:

The movie genre for person 2 (M2) is romance, but it's not filled in yet. However, we know that the journalist (J5) watches comedy movies (M3), and the journalist is on the right of the analyst (J6). So, the analyst must be watching romance movies (M2).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-7x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people with specific positions:
   - The person eating watermelon is on the far left (1)
   - The accountant drives the bike (4), so he is on the left of the person eating cherry (7). Let's place the accountant as the first row, second column. The person eating cherry is in the second row, third column.
   - The paramedic is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (18), so the paramedic must be in the last row. The person who's sport is swimming is in the middle row.
   - The mechanic is on the far right (34), so he is in the last row, last column.
   - The pilot is on the right of the fan of funk (29), so the pilot is in the last row, one column before the mechanic.
   - The owner of the turtle is on the left of the mechanic (35), so the turtle owner is in the second to last row, second to last column.

2. Now let's place some people based on their hobbies:
   - The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (1), so the baking person is in the first row, first column. The chess person is in the first row, second column.
   - The security-guard is on the left of the accountant (2), so the security-guard is in the first row, third column.
   - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography (3), so the rock-climbing person is in the first row, fourth column. The photography person is in the first row, fifth column.
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person driving the ship (10), so the singing person is in the first row, sixth column.
   - The fan of pop is in the middle (21), so he is in the middle row, middle column.
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far right (19), so the skydiving person is in the last row, last column.

3. Now let's place some people based on their sports:
   - The person who's sport is swimming is in the middle row (18), so we already have this.
   - The person eating cherry is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (5), so the person who's sport is swimming is in the middle row, fourth column. The person eating cherry is in the middle row, third column.
   - The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating papaya (8), so the skateboarding person is in the second row, first column. The person eating papaya is in the second row, second column.
   - The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person eating cherry (33), so the badminton person is in the third row, third column.
   - The person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the fan of pop (24), so the rowing person is in the second row, sixth column.
   - The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the security-guard (22), so the weightlifting person is in the last row, fifth column.
   - The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (27), so the skiing person is in the second to last row, fourth column.

4. Now let's place some people based on their pets:
   - The owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the bike (30), so the rat owner is in the first row, seventh column.
   - The owner of the dog is on the right of the person driving the boat (32), so the dog owner is in the last row, third column.
   - The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (36), so the goldfish owner is in the first row, seventh column.
   - The owner of the turtle is on the left of the mechanic (35), so we already have this.
   - The owner of the chinchilla and the frog are left to be placed. Since we have no more specific clues about their positions, we can't determine their exact positions.

5. Finally, let's place some people based on their music genres:
   - The fan of ambient is on the right of the person driving the ship (17), so the ambient fan is in the last row, sixth column.
   - The fan of d&b, disco, funk, and gospel are left to be placed. Since we have no more specific clues about their positions, we can't determine their exact positions.

Unfortunately, we can't determine the exact positions for the chinchilla, frog, d&b, disco, funk, and gospel fans due to the lack of specific clues about their positions.

Here is the final solution table with the determined positions:

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Let's place spy movies and lemonade in the table, and we'll place them in the first two empty cells in a column. Let's assume that spy movies are in the 1st row and lemonade is in the 2nd row.
