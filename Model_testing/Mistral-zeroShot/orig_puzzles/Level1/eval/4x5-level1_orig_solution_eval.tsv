Lv1-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, the British is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column. Since the British is the dancer (rule 6), we can fill the first row with ""Dancing"", ""British"", and we don't have a pet for the British yet.

2. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the British. Since there are only 4 more hobbies, the hobby of the person in the second column must be baking. So, we can fill the second row with ""Baking"", and we don't have a nationality or pet for this person yet.

3. From rule 11, the owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the British is not the baseball player (as they are already placed), the baseball player must be in the third column. So, we can fill the third row with ""Baseball"", and since the owner of the hamster is the baseball player, we can fill the third column with ""Hamster"".

4. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. So, the hobby of the person in the fourth column must be reading. We can fill the fourth row with ""Reading"".

5. From rule 3, the person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is already placed, the cyclist must be in the fifth column. So, we can fill the fifth row with ""Cycling"".

6. From rule 4, the person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is not yet placed, they must be in the fourth column. So, we can fill the second column with ""Chinese"".

7. From rule 5, the Pakistani is the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster is already placed, the Pakistani is the person in the third column.

8. From rule 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the owner of the snake. Since the snake has not been placed yet, the lacrosse player must be in the first column. So, we can fill the first row with ""Lacrosse"".

9. From rule 7, the owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the skiing player is not yet placed, they must be in the fifth column. So, we can fill the first column with ""Frog"".

10. From rule 2, the person who's sport is swimming is the person who's hobby is singing. Since singing is not yet placed, the swimmer must be in the second column. So, we can fill the second row with ""Swimming"".

11. From rule 12, the owner of the horse is on the far right. Since all other pets are already placed, the horse owner must be in the fifth column. So, we can fill the fifth row with ""Horse"".

12. Now we have all the nationalities, so we can fill the Nationality column: ""Brazilian"", ""Chinese"", ""Pakistani"", ""British"", ""Russian"".

13. Finally, we can fill the Pet column: ""Frog"", ""Hamster"", ""Horse"", ""Rabbit"", ""Snake"".

The final solution table is:

Lv1-4x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the photographer is not Argentine (from condition 1), so they can be any of the other nationalities. Let's assume the photographer is Indonesian for now.

2. The Mexican is watching animation movies (condition 2), so we can place them in the second column and third row (since there are 5 different movie genres).

3. The Indonesian is on the right of the Russian (condition 3), so the Russian must be in the first column. Since the Russian is eating kiwi (condition 9), we can place them in the first row, first column.

4. The person eating cucumber is in the middle (condition 10), so they must be in the third column and second row (since there are 5 different foods).

5. The person eating lettuce is on the left of the Mexican (condition 11), so they must be in the second column and first row.

6. The person eating kiwi is the architect (condition 12), so they must be in the first row, but we already placed the Russian there. This means the photographer cannot be Indonesian, and the only other nationality left for the photographer is Argentine. So, the photographer is Argentine, and the architect is Russian.

7. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the Argentine (condition 13), so they must be in the first column and fifth row.

8. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left (condition 4), so they must be in the first column and first row. This means the food they eat is lettuce (since we already placed the Russian there).

9. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching family movies (condition 5). Since the Mexican is watching animation, the person watching family movies must be in the fourth column and third row (since there are 5 different movie genres). This means the person watching martial-arts movies is in the fifth column and third row.

10. The dressmaker is on the right of the person watching documentary movies (condition 6), so they must be in the second column and second row.

11. The scientist is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (condition 7), so they must be in the fourth column and first row.

12. The only remaining position is the fifth column and fifth row. This person must be eating artichoke (since we already placed all other foods), so they must have one of the remaining jobs. Since all other jobs are already assigned, this person must be the accountant.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Egyptian is on the far right, so let's place them in the last column (Column 5).

2. Since the Egyptian is also the person who's hobby is cooking (from rule 11), we can place Cooking in the first row of Column 5.

3. Now, the Egyptian is on the right of the German (rule 8), so the German must be in Column 4. Since the Australian is in the middle (rule 3), the German must be in the leftmost position of Column 4. So, Nationality: German, Hobby: (empty), Beverage: (empty), Transport: (empty) in Row 4, Column 4.

4. The Australian is in the middle (rule 3), so they must be in Column 3. Since the person drinking milk is in the middle (rule 4), the Australian must be drinking milk. So, Nationality: Australian, Beverage: Milk, Hobby: (empty), Transport: (empty) in Row 3, Column 3.

5. The Dutch is on the left of the person drinking water (rule 12), so the Dutch must be in Column 1 or Column 2. Since the Dutch is also the person drinking tea (rule 13), they must be in Column 2. So, Nationality: Dutch, Beverage: Tea, Hobby: (empty), Transport: (empty) in Row 2, Column 2.

6. The person driving the scooter is on the right of the Dutch (rule 10), so the scooter must be in Column 3, 4, or 5. Since the Egyptian is on the far right (Column 5), the scooter must be in Column 3 or Column 4. However, the Egyptian is also on the right of the German (Column 4), so the scooter must be in Column 3. So, Transport: Scooter, Beverage: (empty), Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty) in Row 3, Column 3.

7. The person driving the train is in the middle (rule 9), so they must be in Column 3. Since the Australian is in Column 3 (already placed), the train driver must be in Row 2. So, Transport: Train, Beverage: (empty), Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty) in Row 2, Column 3.

8. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (rule 7), so the quad-bike must be in Column 1, 2, or 3. Since the Dutch is in Column 2 (already placed) and the Egyptian is in Column 5 (already placed), the quad-bike must be in Column 1. So, Transport: Quad-bike, Beverage: (empty), Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty) in Row 1, Column 1.

9. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the quad-bike (rule 7), so the snowmobile must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the Dutch is in Column 2 (already placed), the Australian is in Column 3 (already placed), the train is in Column 3 (already placed), and the Egyptian is in Column 5 (already placed), the snowmobile must be in Column 4. So, Transport: Snowmobile, Beverage: (empty), Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty) in Row 1, Column 4.

10. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking water (rule 12), so the fanta must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the Dutch is in Column 2 (already placed), the Australian is in Column 3 (already placed), the train is in Column 3 (already placed), the Egyptian is in Column 5 (already placed), and the snowmobile is in Column 4 (already placed), the fanta must be in Column 4. So, Beverage: Fanta, Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty), Transport: (empty) in Row 1, Column 4.

11. The person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking fanta (rule 12), so the water must be in Column 5. So, Beverage: Water, Hobby: (empty), Nationality: (empty), Transport: (empty) in Row 1, Column 5.

12. Now, we have filled all the nationalities, so we can fill the hobbies. The Egyptian is the person who's hobby is cooking (rule 11), so the hobby in Row 4, Column 4 must be Reading. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (rule 2), so the hobby in Row 3, Column 3 must be Writing. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading (rule 2), so the hobby in Row 2, Column 2 must be Magic-tricks.

13. Finally, we can fill the beverages. Since the Dutch is drinking tea (rule 13), the person in Row 2, Column 1 must be drinking Sprite. Since the person drinking water is in Column 5 (already placed), the person in Row 5, Column 1 must be drinking Fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in Column 4 (already placed), the person in Row 5, Column 2 must be drinking Milk. Since the Australian is drinking milk (already placed), the person in Row 1, Column 3 must be drinking Tea. Since the person drinking tea is the Dutch (already placed), the person in Row 1, Column 1 must be drinking Sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking fanta (rule 12), the person in Row 1, Column 2 must be drinking Water.

3. From rule 4, the fan of country is watching drama movies. So, let's place country in the drama row and column.
4. From rule 6, the person driving the ship is to the right of the person watching drama movies. Since we know the position of drama (country), we can place ship in the next available column to the right.
5. From rule 1, the person watching horror movies is to the left of the fan of country (which is now in the drama row). So, horror must be in a column to the left of country (drama).
6. From rule 10, the person eating zucchini is the fan of indie. Since we know the position of indie (horror), we can place zucchini in the next available row below horror.
7. From rule 11, the person eating lemon is to the left of the person eating zucchini. So, lemon must be in a row above zucchini.
8. From rule 9, the fan of pop is to the left of the person eating kale. Since we know the position of kale (not yet determined), pop must be in a column to the left of kale.
9. From rule 5, the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the fan of pop. Since we know the position of pop, we can place scientific in the next available row below pop and to the right of pop.

12. From rule 7, the person driving the car is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since we don't know the position of time-travel movies yet, we can't place car yet.
13. From rule 12, the person driving the bike is to the left of the fan of techno. Since we don't know the position of techno yet, we can't place bike yet.

Now let's fill in the remaining items:

- Time-travel movies can't be in the first row because it would violate rule 6 (ship is to the right of drama). So, time-travel movies must be in the second row. Since it can't be in the middle (van is there), it must be in the third row.
- Techno can't be in the fifth column because it would violate rule 12 (bike is to the left of techno). So, techno must be in the fourth column.
- Car can't be in the first or second row because it would violate rule 7 (car is to the right of time-travel movies). So, car must be in the third or fourth row. Since it can't be in the third row (van is there), it must be in the fourth row.
- Kale can't be in the first or second column because it would violate rule 8 (pop is to the left of kale). So, kale must be in the third or fourth column. Since it can't be in the fourth column (techno is there), it must be in the third column.

2. The security-guard is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since the mechanic (d&b fan) is in the 2nd position, the security-guard must be in the 1st position.

3. The designer is the person who's sport is parkour. Since the security-guard is in the 1st position, the designer must be in the 6th position (as there are 5 people).

4. The person eating potato is on the far right. Since the mechanic (d&b fan) is in the 2nd position, the potato eater must be in the 5th position.

Lv1-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the pilot is on the left of the person eating banana, so the pilot cannot be in the first column. Therefore, the banana eater must be in the first column, and the pilot in the second column.

2. The person driving the train is the freelancer, so the freelancer must be in the second row. Since the train driver cannot be in the first column (as the pilot is there), the freelancer (train driver) must be in the third column.

3. The person eating raspberry is in the middle, so they are in the third column and third row.

4. The designer is the Australian, so the Australian must be in the fourth column. Since the designer cannot be in the first row (as the banana eater is there), the designer must be in the fifth row. Also, the designer eats cherry, so the cherry eater is in the fourth column and fifth row.

5. The french is on the far right, so the French must be in the fifth column. Since the designer is already in the fifth row and fifth column, the French cannot be in the fifth row. Therefore, the French must be in the fourth row.

6. The Egyptian is on the left of the person driving the airplane, so the Egyptian cannot be in the fifth column (as the French is there). The Egyptian also cannot be in the first column (as the pilot is there), so the Egyptian must be in the second or third column. The Egyptian is also on the left of the person driving the airplane, so the Egyptian cannot be in the third column (as the raspberry eater is there). Therefore, the Egyptian must be in the second column. The person driving the airplane is not yet determined, but it must be in the first row as the Egyptian is in the second column.

7. The Dutch is in the middle, so the Dutch must be in the third row. Since the freelancer (train driver) is already in the third row, the Dutch must be in the second row.

8. The person eating lettuce is on the left of the pilot, so the lettuce eater must be in the first column. Since the banana eater is already in the first column, the lettuce eater must be in the second column.

9. The person driving the boat is on the left of the engineer, so the boat driver must be in the first column. Since the lettuce eater is already in the second column, the boat driver must be in the first row. The engineer must be in the second row, but not in the first or third column (as the pilot, lettuce eater, and boat driver are already there). Therefore, the engineer must be in the fourth column.

10. The person driving the tram is the British, so the British must be in the fifth row. Since the British cannot be in the fifth column (as the French is there), the British must be in the fourth column. Since the engineer is already in the fourth column, the tram driver (British) must be in the third column.

11. The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person driving the train, so the artichoke eater must be in the fifth column. Since the French, British, and engineer are already in the fourth column, the artichoke eater must be in the fifth row.
