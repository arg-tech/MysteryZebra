Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fans of 4 different music-genres are arranged in a row, and they are ambient, country, r&b, and soul.

2. Let's assign the genres to the positions from left to right (1, 2, 3, 4). We can start with any genre, but let's start with ambient.

3. Since the fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of soul, ambient cannot be in position 4. So, it can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

4. If ambient were in position 1, then soul would have to be in position 2, but that would mean country and r&b would have to be on the same side of soul, which contradicts the second rule. So, ambient cannot be in position 1.

5. If ambient were in position 2, then soul would have to be in position 3, and country would have to be in position 1. This would mean r&b is in position 4, which is correct according to our given genres. However, this arrangement violates the third rule because it places country to the left of ambient. So, ambient cannot be in position 2.

6. Therefore, ambient must be in position 3. This means soul is in position 4, country is in position 1, and r&b is in position 2. But this arrangement also violates the third rule because it places country to the left of ambient.

7. Let's try another arrangement: r&b in position 1, country in position 2, ambient in position 3, and soul in position 4. This arrangement satisfies all the rules.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | r&b | country | ambient | soul |

Lv1-1x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the turtle is on the far right, we can place the turtle in the last column (column 4).

2. The owner of the bird is on the far left, so we place the bird in the first column (column 1).

3. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since the bird is in the first column, the mouse can only be in the second column (column 2).

4. Now, we are left with the guinea-pig. Since all other pets have their places, the guinea-pig must be in the third column (column 3).

The final solution table is:

  |       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |

Lv1-1x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From the third rule, we know that the person who enjoys board-games is between the person who enjoys baking and the person who enjoys rock-climbing.

2. From the second rule, we know that the person who enjoys board-games is on the left of the person who enjoys rock-climbing. So, the order must be: Rock-climbing, Board-games, Baking.

3. Now, from the first rule, we know that the person who enjoys puzzles is on the left of the person who enjoys baking. Since we already know the order of baking and rock-climbing, the only possible position for puzzles is the first position. So, the order is: Puzzles, Rock-climbing, Board-games.

4. Finally, the only hobby left is baking, which must be in the third position according to the order we found earlier. So, the final solution table is:

   |         |    1    |   2    |      3      |
   | Hobby   | Puzzles | Rock-climbing | Baking |

Lv1-1x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the roller is on the far left, so the first row must be filled with 'roller'.

2. Since the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the van, and the roller is on the far left, the jet-ski must be in the second position. So, the second row should be 'jet-ski'.

3. Now, we know that the van is on the far right, so the fourth row must be 'van'.

4. This leaves the third row. Since there are only three types of transport left (bike and two unspecified), and we've filled the first and second positions, the third row must be 'bike'.

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |   1    |  2   |    3    |  4  |

Lv1-1x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who plays lacrosse is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column with 'lacrosse'.

|     | 1   |    2    |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|---------|---------|----------|
| Sport| lacrosse|         |         |          |

2. The person who plays baseball is on the far right, so it must be in the last column. Since the person who plays parkour is to the left of the baseball player, parkour must be in the second-to-last column.

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|
| Sport| lacrosse| parkour|         | baseball  |

3. Now, we only have cycling left. Since it's a different sport from the ones we've placed, it can go in any of the remaining columns. However, to satisfy the condition that parkour is to the left of baseball, cycling cannot be in the last column. So, cycling must be in the first or second column.

   If cycling is in the first column, the table would look like this:

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|
| Sport| cycling| parkour| baseball | lacrosse  |

   But this arrangement violates the rule that parkour is to the left of baseball, so cycling cannot be in the first column.

   Therefore, cycling must be in the second column:

|     | 1   | 2   |    3    |    4     |
|-----|-----|------|---------|----------|
| Sport| lacrosse| cycling| baseball | parkour   |

Lv1-1x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching animation movies is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 4).

2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we already placed animation in the last column, the only possible position for martial-arts movies is in the third column (from the right).

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies. This means that musical movies must be in the second column (from the right).

4. Now, we are left with the first column for the genre that hasn't been placed yet, which is satire.

So, the final solution table is:

1. Since the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating orange, we can place the orange in the second position (2) and the nectarine in the third position (3).

2. The person eating peas is on the left of the person eating orange, so peas must be in the first position (1).

3. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating peas, so raspberry must be in the fourth position (4).

Lv1-1x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the skateboard is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column:

|------------|-----------|----|-----|----|
| Transport   |           |    |     |    |

2. Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person driving the trike, and the skateboard is on the far left, the trike must be in the second position, and the jet-ski in the third position:

|             | Skateboard | Trike | Jet-ski |   |
|------------|-----------|-------|---------|----|
| Transport   |           |       |         |    |

3. Now, the person driving the tram is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, so the tram must be in the fourth position:

|             | Skateboard | Trike | Jet-ski | Tram |
|------------|-----------|-------|---------|------|
| Transport   |           |       |         |      |

So, we have filled all the positions with the means of transport, but we still don't know the order of the people driving them. However, the puzzle doesn't require us to know the order, so we can stop here.

Lv1-1x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fans of 4 different music-genres are arranged in a row, and they are not repeated. So, we can write down the genres in any order. Let's start with soul, electronic, reggae, and d&b.

2. The fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of soul. So, reggae cannot be in the first position, and soul cannot be in the last position. Let's swap them: soul, electronic, reggae, d&b.

3. The fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of soul. This means electronic must be before soul. So, let's swap electronic and soul: electronic, reggae, soul, d&b.

4. The fan of reggae is on the left of the fan of d&b. This means reggae cannot be in the last position, and d&b cannot be in the first position. Since we already placed reggae second and electronic first, d&b must be in the third position. So, the final arrangement is: electronic, reggae, soul, d&b.

Here is the final solution table:

3. The car driver is on the far right (condition 2), so it must be in the last position.
