Lv1-7x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category and person:

- Food: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6
- Hobby: H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6
- Movie-Genre: M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6

- Sport: S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6
- Transport: T1, T2, T3, T4, T5, T6

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From 15 and 16, we know that F6 (the person eating radish) and S6 (the person who's sport is badminton) are on the far right. Since there are only 6 people, F6 = badminton.
2. From 17, we know that F4 (the person eating carrot) is on the left of F6.
3. From 23, we know that F3 (the person eating garlic) is on the left of M3 (the person watching comedy movies). Since M3 can't be F6 (badminton), M3 must be F1, F2, or F5. But F1 can't be on the left of F6, so M3 = F2 (cauliflower).

7. From 21, we know that F1 (the person eating onion) is the fan of H6 (the person who's hobby is hip-hop).
