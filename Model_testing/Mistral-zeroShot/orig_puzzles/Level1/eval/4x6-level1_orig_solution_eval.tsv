Lv1-4x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, jobs, music-genres, and pets are all different for each person. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From rule 7, the fan of classical is on the far left, so it's in position 1. Let's assign it the number 1 for the music-genre.

3. From rule 6, the engineer is on the right of the fan of classical, so the engineer is in position 2. Let's assign it the number 2 for the job.

4. From rule 16, the teacher is on the left of the engineer, so the teacher is in position 1. Let's assign it the number 3 for the job.

5. From rule 14, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the lizard (rule 15). Since the lizard is a pet, it must be in a higher position than the hedgehog. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles (and owns the lizard) must be in position 3 or 4. The person who owns the hedgehog must be in position 2. Let's assign the hobby of puzzles to position 3 and the hobby of collecting to position 2 (since it's on the left of the owner of the bird, which we'll assign later). Let's assign the pet of hedgehog to position 2 and the pet of lizard to position 3.

6. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 2, the owner of the bird must be in position 1. Let's assign the pet of bird to position 1.

7. From rule 13, the project-manager is the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 2, the project-manager (and the mouse) must be in position 6. Let's assign the pet of mouse to position 6.

8. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of classical is in position 1, the fan of gospel must be in position 2. Let's assign the hobby of fishing to position 4.

9. From rule 8, the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the owner of the mouse (which we know is the project-manager). Since the project-manager is in position 6, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 5. Let's assign the music-genre of hip-hop to position 5.

10. From rule 17, the owner of the mouse (project-manager) is on the right of the musician. Since the project-manager is in position 6, the musician must be in position 5. Let's assign the job of musician to position 5.

11. From rule 9, the fan of soul is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we haven't assigned the hobby of card-games yet, let's assign it to position 3 (since it's on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles, which we assigned to position 3). Let's assign the music-genre of soul to position 4.

12. From rule 12, the fan of trance is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we assigned the hobby of collecting to position 2, the fan of trance must be in position 1. Let's assign the music-genre of trance to position 1.

13. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the project-manager (which we know is in position 6). Let's assign the hobby of filmmaking to position 6.

14. From rule 4, the fan of reggae is the owner of the mouse (which we know is the project-manager). But we already assigned the hobby of reggae to position 4. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, with the information given, we can fill in the table up to this point:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |    4     |        5        |     6      |
| Hobby         | Classical  | Collecting | Card-games | Reggae   | Soul            | Filmmaking |
| Job           | Engineer   | Teacher    |            |         | Musician        | Project-Manager |
| Music-Genre   | Trance     |            |            |         |                 |            |
| Pet           | Bird       | Hedgehog   |            | Mouse    |                 | Rat         |

The hobby, job, and pet for positions 2, 4, and 6 are missing, and the music-genre for position 3 is missing due to the contradiction in rule 4."	{'hobby': ['classical', 'collecting', 'card-games', 'reggae', 'soul', 'filmmaking'], 'job': ['engineer', 'teacher', '', '', 'musician', 'project-manager'], 'music-genre': ['trance', '', '', '', '', ''], 'pet': ['bird', 'hedgehog', '', 'mouse', '', 'rat']}	True	1	False
Lv1-4x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

   Let C be the Chinese, B be the British, J be the Japanese, E be the Egyptian, K be the Colombian, Pk be the Pakistani.
   Let A, R, S, H, Sc, Sp, Ff, Fs, Fh, Fp be the action, romance, scientific, sports, chinchilla, ferret, fish, horse, snake, pet of the project-manager respectively.

2. From the given clues, we can start placing them in the table:

   - The person watching sports movies (Sp) is on the right of the Pakistani (Pk), so Sp cannot be in the first position. So, Sp must be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth position.
   - The person watching sports movies (Sp) is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla (Ch), so Sp cannot be in the sixth position. So, Sp must be in the second, third, or fifth position.
   - The person watching sports movies (Sp) is on the right of the project-manager (P), so Sp cannot be in the second position. So, Sp must be in the third or fifth position.

Lv1-4x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the software-developer is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (column 6). Let's fill the other jobs from left to right, keeping in mind the constraints. The firefighter is eating strawberry, so they go in the first column (column 1). The doctor is on the left of the electrician, so the doctor goes in the second column (column 2). The electrician is eating nectarine, so they go in the third column (column 3). The manager and teacher are left, and the teacher is on the right of the software-developer, so the teacher goes in the fourth column (column 4) and the manager in the fifth column (column 5).

2. Now let's fill the food columns. The person eating nectarine is the electrician, so we already know that. The fan of ambient is the person eating nectarine, so the nectarine goes in the third column (column 3). The fan of folk is on the left of the software-developer, so the fan of folk goes in the second column (column 2). The fan of house is the person eating grapefruit, so the grapefruit goes in the first column (column 1). The fan of dubstep is the person driving the boat, so the boat goes in the fifth column (column 5). The fan of electronic is on the right of the teacher and on the left of the person driving the helicopter, so the electronic goes in the fourth column (column 4). The person eating cherry is on the left of the doctor, so the cherry goes in the second column (column 2). The person eating apple is on the right of the software-developer, so the apple goes in the sixth column (column 6). The person driving the van is on the left of the person eating grapefruit, so the van goes in the second column (column 2). The person driving the tram is on the left of the person driving the boat, so the tram goes in the fourth column (column 4). The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the tram, so the helicopter goes in the sixth column (column 6). The person eating strawberry is the firefighter, so the strawberry goes in the first column (column 1).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-4x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the avocado eater is on the right of the subway driver. Let's place the subway driver in the last position (6) and the avocado eater in the position to its right (5).

2. The Chinese is on the right of the disco fan. Since the disco fan is the Canadian (from rule 8), the Chinese cannot be in the first five positions. So, the Chinese must be in position 6.

| Food          |  6 |      |     |     |     |     |

| Transport     | Car|      |     |     |     | Tram|

3. The Italian is the train driver (rule 3). Since the train driver is the Italian, the Italian cannot be in the first five positions. So, the Italian must be in position 6.

5. The Pakistani is on the left of the Canadian (rule 6). So, the Pakistani must be in position 3.

6. The person eating avocado is the fan of r&b (rule 9). Since the avocado eater is in position 5, the r&b fan must be in position 5.

| Food          |  6 |      | Carrot| Pakistani| R&B  |     |
| Music-Genre   | Disco|      | Chinese| Italian|     |     |

7. The person eating cabbage is on the far left (rule 10). So, the cabbage eater must be in position 1.

| Transport     | Car|      |      |      |     | Tram|

8. The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person driving the roller (rule 11). Since the roller driver is the carrot eater (rule 13), the cabbage eater must be in position 2.

| Food          | Cabbage| Carrot|      | Pakistani| R&B  |     |
| Music-Genre   | Disco|      | Chinese| Italian|     |     |

10. The person driving the scooter is the fan of trance (rule 14). Since the British is the scooter driver (rule 16), the trance fan must be the British. But we already placed the British in position 1 (as the cabbage eater). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the British is not the scooter driver, then the trance fan must be in position 6. But we already placed the trance fan in position 4 (as the roller driver). This is also a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Therefore, it appears that there is an inconsistency in the given puzzle."	{'food': ['cabbage', 'carrot', 'blues', 'pakistani', 'r&b', ''], 'music-genre': ['disco', '', '', 'chinese', 'italian', ''], 'nationality': ['british', 'canadian', 'pakistani', '', '', ''], 'transport': ['car', 'roller', '', '', '', 'tram']}	True	4	False

Lv1-4x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:
