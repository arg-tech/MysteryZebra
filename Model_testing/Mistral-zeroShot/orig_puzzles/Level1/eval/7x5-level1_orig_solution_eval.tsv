Lv1-7x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will fill the table step by step, starting with the given information and using logical deductions.

Step 1:
- The brazilian is on the far left (position 1). Let's place Brazilian in position 1.
- The dutch is on the right of the chef (position 1) and in the middle (position 3). Let's place Dutch in position 3.
- The dutch is also in the middle (position 3), so the nationalities on the left and right must be different. Since Brazilian is already on the far left, the only option for the left of Dutch is Italian (position 2).

Step 2:
- The brazilian is on the left of the fan of electronic (position 4). Let's place Brazilian's hobby (reading) in position 4.

3. The fan of soul is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we know the polish is traveling, we can place the soul fan to the right of the polish:

4. The person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking fanta. We can place fanta in the camping row and column:

   |               |      1       |    2     |     3     |      4      |       5        |

5. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we know the camping person is on the left of the gardening person, we can place badminton in the camping row:
