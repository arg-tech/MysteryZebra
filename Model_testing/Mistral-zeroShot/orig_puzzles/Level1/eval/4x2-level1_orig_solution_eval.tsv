Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of traveling is on the far right, we can fill the rightmost column for the hobby as 'Traveling'.

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Traveling    |           |

| Transport   |               |           |

2. Since the designer is on the far right, the leftmost column for the Job must be 'Social-worker'.

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Traveling    |           |

| Transport   |               |           |

3. The people have 2 different sports, and soccer is one of them. Let's place soccer in the right column for Sport. Since the person who plays soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski, the left column for Sport must have 'Volleyball'.

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Traveling    | Volleyball|
| Job         | Social-worker| Social-worker|
| Sport       | Soccer      | Volleyball |
| Transport   |               |           |

4. The people have 2 different means of transport, and bike is one of them. Since we already have a person using a jet-ski (the person who is on the left of the soccer player), the person using a bike must be on the left. So, the right column for Transport is 'Jet-ski'.

|             |       1       |     2     |

Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different jobs, 2 different beverages, 2 different movie-genres, and 2 different sports, we can place one of each in the first column. Let's place the entrepreneur (E) in the first row, the action movie-genre (A) in the first column under movie-genre, and snowboarding (S) in the first row under sport.

   |               |      1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      |              |             |

   | Sport         | Snowboarding |             |

2. Now, the person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we already have the action movies in the first column, the lemonade must be in the second column.

   |               |      1       |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade   |

   | Sport         | Snowboarding |             |

3. The person drinking almond-milk cannot be the entrepreneur (as they are already in the first row), so the lawyer (L) must be in the first row and the almond-milk must be in the second row.

   |               |      1       |      2      |

   | Sport         | Snowboarding |             |

4. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, so the time-travel (T) movie-genre must be in the second column.

5. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, so the sport of the person on the right must be surfing (S).

   | Sport         | Snowboarding | Surfing    |

6. Since there are 2 different sports, the person doing surfing must be on the right. So, the order of the people is: Lawyer, Entrepreneur, and the sport order is: Snowboarding, Surfing.

   |               |      1       |      2      |

Lv1-4x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, iced-tea, and soy-milk. Let's place them in the first column, with soy-milk in the first row (1A) and iced-tea in the second row (1B).

   |               |    1A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |

   | Transport     |           |           |

2. We know there are two different types of food, apple, and avocado. Since the person eating apple is on the far left, we place apple in the first column (2A) and avocado in the second column (2B).

   |               |    2A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Apple     |  Avocado   |

   | Transport     |           |           |

3. We know there are two different music-genres, ambient, and country. Since the fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, the country fan must be in the first row (1A) and the ambient fan in the second row (1B).

   |               |    2A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Apple     |  Avocado   |
   | Music-Genre   | Country   |  Ambient   |
   | Transport     |           |           |

4. We know the person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi. Since we already placed the iced-tea in the first row (1A), the person driving the taxi must be in the first column (2A). This means the transport options must be placed in the second column (1B).

   |               |    2A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |

   | Music-Genre   | Country   |  Ambient   |
   | Transport     | Taxi      |  Quad-Bike |

5. Now we know the person driving the taxi is in the first row (1A) and the first column (2A). Since the country fan is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, the country fan must be in the second row (1B) and the person drinking soy-milk must be in the second column (1B).

   |               |    2A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |

   | Music-Genre   | Country   |  Ambient   |
   | Transport     | Taxi      |  Quad-Bike |

6. Now we can place the people in their respective positions:

   |               |    2A     |     1B     |
   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea  |  Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Apple     |  Avocado   |
   | Music-Genre   | Country   |  Ambient   |
   | Transport     | Taxi      |  Quad-Bike |

   The person eating apple is on the far left, so they are in the first column (2A). The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi, so they are in the first row (1A). The fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, so they are in the second row (1B). The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (in the second column, 1B).

   The final solution table is:

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different favorite beverages, iced-tea, and soy-milk. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. Similarly, there are two types of food, lemon and papaya. Let's label them as C and D respectively.

3. There are two jobs, nurse and security-guard. Let's label them as E and F respectively.

4. There are two music-genres, punk and techno. Let's label them as G and H respectively.

5. The fan of punk is on the far left. So, punk must be in the first column, which means G.

6. The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we don't know the position of iced-tea yet, let's assume for now that the nurse is in the second column (E). This means the iced-tea must be in the first or third column.

7. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon. Since we don't know the position of soy-milk yet, let's assume for now that the person eating lemon is in the second row (C). This means the soy-milk must be in the first or third row.

8. Now, let's see if we can place the nurse (E) to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. If the iced-tea was in the first row, the nurse would have to be in the third column, but that would mean no room for the soy-milk (which is in the second column according to our assumption). So, the iced-tea must be in the third row.

9. Now, the nurse (E) can be placed in the second column, as we assumed earlier. The iced-tea is in the third row.

10. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon. So, the lemon (C) must be in the second row. This means the papaya (D) must be in the first row.

11. The last job (F) and music-genre (H) can be placed anywhere, as we have placed all other elements.

Lv1-4x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people have 2 different hobbies, 2 different music-genres, 2 different types of sport, and 2 different means of transport. This means that each row and each column should have unique entries.

2. The fan of classical music is on the far left. This means that in the first column, the entry for Music-Genre must be Classical.

3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person driving the roller. This means that the person in the second row (since the roller is on the far right in the Transport column) must be doing skateboarding. So, the entry for Sport in the second row is Skateboarding.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since we already know that the second row is Skateboarding, the third row must be Video-Games (as it's the only hobby left).

5. Now, we know that the first row is not Skateboarding (because of point 3) and not Video-Games (because of point 4). So, the first row must be Skydiving (as it's the only hobby left).

6. The people prefer 2 different types of sport. We already have Skateboarding in the second row. The only sport left is Sailing. So, the entry for Sport in the first row is Sailing.

7. The people use 2 different means of transport. We already have Roller in the last column. The only transport left is Quad-bike. So, the entry for Transport in the first row is Quad-bike.

8. The people prefer 2 different music-genres. We already have Classical in the first column. The only music-genre left is Country. So, the entry for Music-Genre in the second column is Country.

Lv1-4x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left, so we can place hip-hop in the first column. Let's place it in the first row, but we don't know which food it corresponds to yet.

3. The person who prefers r&b is on the right of the hip-hop fan, so we place r&b in the second column of the first row.

4. Now we know that the person who prefers cycling is to the right of the hip-hop fan, so we place cycling in the third row, but we don't know which sport it corresponds to yet.

5. The person who prefers baseball is on the left of the cycling fan, so we place baseball in the third row, but we don't know which sport it corresponds to yet.

6. The tram driver is on the far right, so we place tram in the fourth row, fourth column.

7. The tram driver is on the right of the person eating nectarine, so the person eating nectarine must be in the first column of the fourth row. Since we already have the tram there, the person eating nectarine must be in the first column of the third row.

Lv1-4x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (board-games and reading), we can assign them to the two columns. Let's say board-games in column 1 and reading in column 2.

2. Similarly, since there are two different jobs (entrepreneur and software-developer), we can assign them to the two rows. Let's say entrepreneur in row 1 and software-developer in row 2.

3. Now, let's use the information about the movie genres. Since there are two different genres (thriller and zombie), we can assign them to the two cells that don't have the hobby of board-games (since the person watching thriller movies is on the far left). Let's say thriller in the top-right cell and zombie in the bottom-right cell.

4. Now, we know that the person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur (from point 2). So, the top-right cell should have 'entrepreneur' and 'zombie'.

5. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (from point 1). Since the hobby of board-games is in column 1, the person driving the jet-ski should be in the leftmost cell, which is the top-left cell. So, the top-left cell should have '#############' (jet-ski) and the hobby of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the hobby of the person driving the jet-ski can't be board-games (because it's on the right), it must be reading.

6. Now, the person watching thriller movies is on the far left (from point 3). Since the person watching thriller movies can't be in the top-left cell (because it's occupied by the person driving the jet-ski), it must be in the bottom-left cell. So, the bottom-left cell should have 'software-developer' (since the entrepreneur is in the top-right cell) and 'thriller'.

7. Finally, the means of transport can be filled in the remaining cells. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in the top-left cell, the person using the trike should be in the bottom-left cell (since the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games). So, the bottom-left cell should have 'trike'. The top-right cell already has 'jet-ski'.

Lv1-4x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, and 2 different jobs. So, we can represent each category with a unique letter (A, B) for beverages, C, D for foods, E, F for hobbies, and G, H for jobs.

2. From the given clues, we can make the following deductions:
   - The teacher (G) is on the left of the person eating cucumber (C), so G cannot be in column 2. Therefore, G can only be in column 1.
   - The person eating spinach (D) is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A), so D cannot be in row 1. Therefore, D can only be in row 2.
   - The teacher (G) is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (F), so G cannot be in column 2. Therefore, G can only be in column 1.

3. Now we have placed the teacher (G) in the first row and first column. The remaining job (H) must be in the second row.

4. Since the teacher (G) is a job, the remaining job (H) must be a different job, so H cannot be a scientist (S). Therefore, H must be a teacher (T) as well, which contradicts our initial placement of the teacher in the first row. This means our initial assumption that both jobs are teachers is incorrect.

5. Let's assume one job is a scientist (S) and the other is a teacher (T). Since the teacher (T) is on the left of the person eating cucumber (C), the scientist (S) must be in the first row. The scientist (S) cannot be in the first column because the teacher (T) is already there. So, the scientist (S) must be in the second column.

6. Now we know the scientist (S) is in the second column of the first row. The remaining job (T) must be in the second row. Since the person eating spinach (D) is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A), the job (T) cannot be in the second column. Therefore, the job (T) must be in the first column of the second row.

7. The remaining food (D) must be in the first row because the person eating spinach (D) is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A). The only available spot for D in the first row is the second column.

8. The remaining food (C) must be in the second row because the teacher (T) is on the left of the person eating cucumber (C). The only available spot for C in the second row is the first column.

9. The remaining beverage (A) must be in the second row because the person eating spinach (D) is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A). The only available spot for A in the second row is the second column.

10. The remaining hobby (F) must be in the first row because the teacher (T) is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (F). The only available spot for F in the first row is the second column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |   Coffee   |   7up    |
| Food       |   Cucumber |  Spinach |
| Hobby      |  Chess     | Board-games|
| Job        |  Scientist |  Teacher  |
```

The final solution is:
- Beverage 1: Coffee
- Beverage 2: 7up
- Food 1: Cucumber
- Food 2: Spinach
- Hobby 1: Chess
- Hobby 2: Board-games
- Job 1: Scientist
- Job 2: Teacher"	{'beverage': ['coffee', '7up'], 'food': ['cucumber', 'spinach'], 'hobby': ['chess', 'board-games'], 'job': ['scientist', 'teacher']}	True	0	False
Lv1-4x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different nationalities (Malaysian and Polish), we can place one of them in each row. Let's place the Polish in the first row and the Malaysian in the second row.

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Food          |           |           |
   | Music-Genre   |           |           |
   | Nationality   | Polish    | Malaysian |
   | Pet           |           |           |

2. We know that the Polish is the owner of the rabbit. Since there are only 2 pets, the owner of the lizard must be the Malaysian. So, let's place the rabbit with the Polish and the lizard with the Malaysian.

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Food          |           |           |
   | Music-Genre   |           |           |
   | Nationality   | Polish    | Malaysian |
   | Pet           | Rabbit    | Lizard    |

3. Now, the fan of folk is on the right of the person eating artichoke. Since there are only 2 food items and 2 music genres, the person eating artichoke must be a fan of blues. So, let's place blues with the Malaysian and folk with the Polish.

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Food          | Artichoke| Blueberry |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues    | Folk      |
   | Nationality   | Polish    | Malaysian |
   | Pet           | Rabbit    | Lizard    |

4. Now, the Polish is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the Polish is already in the first row and the lizard is with the Malaysian in the second row, the current arrangement already satisfies this condition.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | Artichoke| Blueberry |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | Folk      |
| Nationality   | Polish    | Malaysian |
| Pet           | Rabbit    | Lizard    |
