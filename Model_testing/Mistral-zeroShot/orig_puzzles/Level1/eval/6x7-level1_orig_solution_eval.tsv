1. Let's start by placing the people with unique conditions. We know the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Let's place the scientific movie-watcher in the first column and the documentary movie-watcher in the second column.

   |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |    4    |      5      |       6        |        7        |

Step 1:
1. Place the person drinking coffee (C) and the owner of the goldfish (G) on the left and right respectively.
2. Since the goldfish owner is on the left of the person drinking coffee, we can place the other beverages (A, L, S, I, J) in the remaining positions, keeping in mind that A is on the far left (9).
3. Now, we know that A is drinking almond-milk, so we can place the other beverages (C, L, S, I, J) as their respective drinks.

Step 2:
4. Place the Australian (AUS) and the collector (C) on the right and left of each other.
5. Since the collector is on the right of the Australian, we can place the other nationalities (AM, AR, BR, IN, JP, TH, TW) in the remaining positions, keeping in mind that AM is in the middle (19).

Lv1-6x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's the solution:

1. Let's start with the given information about the positions of the lizard owner and the iced-tea drinker. We know that the lizard owner is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Let's denote the positions as follows:

   |               |      1      |     2      |       3       |      4      |    5     |      6       |        7        |
   | Beverage      |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |
   | Hobby         |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |
   | Job           |             |            |               |             |    cher  |              |                 |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |
   | Nationality   |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |
   | Pet           |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |

   Since the lizard owner is on the right of the iced-tea drinker, we can write iced-tea in position 2 and the lizard owner in position 3.

2. Next, let's place the goat owner and the dancer based on their positions. The goat owner is on the left of the dancer. So, we can write dancer in position 1 and goat in position 2.

   |               |      1      |     2      |       3       |      4      |    5     |      6       |        7        |

3. Now, let's place the person who fishes on the left of the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the lizard owner is on the left of the iced-tea drinker, and the goat owner is on the left of the dancer, the only available position for the fisher is position 4.

   |               |      1      |     2      |       3       |      4      |    5     |      6       |        7        |
   | Beverage      |             |            |               | hot-chocolate|          |              |                 |

   | Nationality   |             |            |               |             |          |              |                 |

4. The pakistani is the project-manager, so we can write project-manager in position 4. Since the fisher is on the left of the hot-chocolate drinker, the pakistani (project-manager) must be drinking hot-chocolate.

   |               |      1      |     2      |       3       | project-manager|    5     |      6       |        7        |

5. The german is in the middle, so we can write german in position 5.

6. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person watching epic movies, and the person watching epic movies is the person drinking iced-tea (from rule 24). So, the lizard owner must be watching epic movies. Since the lizard owner is on the left of the iced-tea drinker (from rule 1), the lizard owner must be in position 3.

1. Let's start by placing the people based on their food preferences:
   - The analyst eats zucchini (5), so we place him in the 5th row.
   - The security-guard eats eggplant (1), so he is in the 1st row. Since the analyst is on his right, the analyst cannot be in the 2nd row, so the security-guard must be in the 1st row.
   - The person eating corn (4) must be in the middle (3rd row).
   - The person eating lemon (6) is on the right of the analyst, so the analyst cannot be in the 6th row, and the person eating lemon must be in the 5th row.

   - The person eating cucumber (3) is driving the snowmobile (7), so he is in the 1st row. The police-officer is on his left (25), so the police-officer is in the 2nd row.
   - The person eating orange (2) and zucchini (5) are the only ones left, so they must be in the 2nd and 4th rows respectively.

2. Now let's place the people based on their hobbies:

   - The person with the hobby of cooking (31) is the person with the sport of tennis (11), so he is in the 5th row.

3. Now let's place the people based on their jobs:

   - The photographer (3) is on the left of the nurse (30), so the photographer is in the 4th column.
   - The analyst (5) is in the 5th row, so the analyst cannot be the nurse, photographer, bartender, or police-officer. The only remaining job is the security-guard, so the analyst must be the security-guard.
   - The person driving the snowmobile (7) is the person eating cucumber (3), so the person driving the snowmobile is in the 1st row.
   - The person driving the jet-ski (21) is the person with the sport of surfing (16), so the person driving the jet-ski is in the 6th row.
   - The person driving the taxi (15) is the person with the sport of handball (24), so the person driving the taxi is in the 2nd row.

   - The person driving the ship (12) is on the left of the fan of gospel (27), so the person driving the ship is in the 5th column.
   - The person driving the trike (not specified) is the person with the sport of surfing (16), but we already know the person driving the jet-ski is the person with the sport of surfing, so the person driving the trike is in the 6th row.

   - The person with the sport of handball (24) is driving the taxi (15), so the person with the sport of handball is in the 2nd row.
   - The person with the sport of surfing (16) is the person driving the jet-ski (21) and the bartender (26), but we already know the person driving the jet-ski is the person with the sport of surfing, so the bartender is in the 6th row.

Lv1-6x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, music-genres, pets, and beverages. Let's assign them to the rows and columns.

   |               | Almond-Milk | Coffee   | Fanta   | Iced-Tea | Lemonade | Milk     | Water   |
   | Beverage      |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
   | Hobby         |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
   | Job           |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
   | Music-Genre   |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
   | Nationality   |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
   | Pet           |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |

   We'll use the given clues to fill in the table.

2. The indonesian is the musician (1), so we can place the Indonesian in the Musician row and the Music-Genre of Indie in the same column as the Indonesian (10).

   | Job           |             |          |         |          |          |          |         |
