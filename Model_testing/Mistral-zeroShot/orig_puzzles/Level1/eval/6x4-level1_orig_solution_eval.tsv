Lv1-6x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people and 6 variables for each person (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality). Let's assign variables to each person:

   Person A: (Beverage1, Hobby1, Job1, MovieGenre1, MusicGenre1, Nationality1)
   Person B: (Beverage2, Hobby2, Job2, MovieGenre2, MusicGenre2, Nationality2)
   Person C: (Beverage3, Hobby3, Job3, MovieGenre3, MusicGenre3, Nationality3)
   Person D: (Beverage4, Hobby4, Job4, MovieGenre4, MusicGenre4, Nationality4)

2. From the clues, we can start to fill in some information:

   - Beverage1 = juice (from clue 12)
   - MusicGenre4 = techno (from clue 10)
   - Nationality2 = australian (from clue 2)
   - Hobby2 = cooking (from clue 3)
   - MovieGenre2 = musical (from clue 10, since techno is on the left of cooking)
   - Beverage4 = lemonade (from clue 5, since lemonade is on the right of the Egyptian)
   - Nationality3 = german (from clue 7, since the fan of d&b is on the right of the German)
   - MusicGenre3 = d&b (from clue 3, since the fan of d&b is on the right of the chef)
   - Nationality1 = not australian or german (from clues 2 and 7)
   - Nationality1 â‰  Egyptian (from clue 5)

3. Now let's use the position clues to fill in more information:

   - Person A is on the left of Person B (since lemonade is on the left of the fan of techno)
   - Person C is on the right of Person D (since sprite is on the right of the Egyptian)
   - Person C is on the right of Person B (since sprite is on the right of the german)

4. Now we can use the job and hobby clues to fill in more information:

   - Job1 = software-developer (from clue 13, since the software-developer is the person who's hobby is baking)
   - Hobby3 = baking (since the software-developer is the person who's hobby is baking)
   - Job4 = journalist (from clue 9, since the person watching thriller movies is the journalist)
   - MovieGenre4 = thriller (from clue 9)

5. Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the information:

   - Person A is not the Australian (from clue 2) and not the German (from clue 7), so Person A must be Polish or Egyptian. Since Person A is on the left of Person B, and Person B is the Australian, Person A must be Egyptian. So, Nationality1 = Egyptian.
   - Person A drinks juice (from clue 12), so Beverage1 = juice.
   - Person B drinks sprite (from clue 2), so Beverage2 = sprite.
   - Person C drinks mirinda (since sprite is on the right of mirinda and mirinda is not lemonade or juice), so Beverage3 = mirinda.
   - Person D drinks lemonade (from clue 5), so Beverage4 = lemonade.
   - Person A's hobby is not cooking (since cooking is on the left of Person B), not fishing (since fishing is on the far right), and not gardening (since we don't have enough information yet to place gardening). So, Hobby1 = baking.
   - Person B's hobby is cooking (from clue 3), so Hobby2 = cooking.
   - Person C's hobby is not cooking (since cooking is on the left of Person B), not baking (since the software-developer is the person who's hobby is baking), and not fishing (since fishing is on the far right). So, Hobby3 = fishing.
   - Person D's hobby is not cooking (since cooking is on the left of Person B), not baking (since the software-developer is the person who's hobby is baking), and not fishing (since we don't have enough information yet to place fishing). So, Hobby4 = gardening.
   - Person A watches musical movies (since techno is on the left of cooking), so MovieGenre1 = musical.
   - Person B watches satire movies (since cooking is on the left of Person B), so MovieGenre2 = satire.
   - Person C watches scientific movies (since the chef is the person watching scientific movies and the chef is on the right of the fan of d&b), so MovieGenre3 = scientific.
   - Person D watches thriller movies (from clue 9), so MovieGenre4 = thriller.
   - Person A listens to dubstep (since techno is on the left of cooking), so MusicGenre1 = dubstep.
   - Person B listens to d&b (since sprite is on the right of the german), so MusicGenre2 = d&b.
   - Person C listens to jazz (since mirinda is not lemonade, juice, sprite, or techno), so MusicGenre3 = jazz.
   - Person D listens to techno (from clue 10), so MusicGenre4 = techno.

6. Now we have filled in all the variables:

   Person A: (juice, baking, software-developer, musical, dubstep, Egyptian)
   Person B: (sprite, cooking, journalist, satire, d&b, Australian)
   Person C: (mirinda, fishing, videographer, scientific, jazz, German)
   Person D: (lemonade, gardening, chef, thriller, techno, Polish)

So, the final solution table is:

2. The architect is on the far left, so we place it in column 1.

3. The owner of the dog is not the Brazilian (from point 2), so the dog owner must be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the architect is in column 1, the dog owner cannot be in column 1. If the dog owner were in column 2, the Brazilian would have to be in column 3, but the person eating kiwi is in column 4, so the dog owner must be in column 3.

4. Now we know the dog owner is an electrician (from point 6), so we place the electrician in row 3.

5. The person eating avocado is the owner of the chinchilla (from point 4), so the chinchilla owner must be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

6. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (from point 5).

8. The person watching drama movies cannot be the Russian (from point 12), so the Russian must be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the architect, electrician, and person watching superhero movies are already placed, the Russian must be in column 1. This means the person watching drama movies is the Brazilian (since the Brazilian is in column 2).

9. The person watching time-travel movies cannot be the Japanese (from point 12), so the Japanese must be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the architect, electrician, and person watching superhero movies are already placed, the Japanese must be in column 3.

15. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the doctor (from point 10), so the doctor must be in column 2 or 3. Since the electrician, Brazilian, and person watching superhero movies are already placed, the doctor must be in column 3.

1. We know there are 4 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label the people A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From point 1, we know the beverages are coffee, fanta, juice, and tea. Let's assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: coffee (we'll figure out the person later)
   - Row 2: fanta
   - Row 3: juice
   - Row 4: tea

3. From point 2, we know the foods are eggplant, garlic, lime, and plum. Let's assign them to the columns as follows:
   - Column 1: eggplant
   - Column 2: garlic
   - Column 3: lime
   - Column 4: plum

4. From point 3, we know the hobbies are cooking, gardening, magic-tricks, and sudoku. Let's assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: cooking (we'll figure out the person later)
   - Row 2: gardening
   - Row 3: magic-tricks
   - Row 4: sudoku

5. From point 4, we know the nationalities are brazilian, dutch, french, and german. Let's assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: brazilian (we'll figure out the person later)
   - Row 2: dutch
   - Row 3: french
   - Row 4: german

6. From point 5, we know the pets are chinchilla, dog, frog, and rat. Let's assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: chinchilla (we'll figure out the person later)
   - Row 2: dog
   - Row 3: frog
   - Row 4: rat

7. From point 6, we know the means of transport are car, jet-ski, snowmobile, and train. Let's assign them to the rows as follows:
   - Row 1: train (we'll figure out the person later)
   - Row 2: car
   - Row 3: jet-ski
   - Row 4: snowmobile

8. Now let's use the given clues to fill in the table:

   - From point 1, we know the brazilian is on the right of the person eating plum. So, the brazilian can't be in column 1 (plum is in column 4), so the brazilian is in column 2, 3, or 4. Since the french is on the far right (column 4), the brazilian can't be in column 4. So, the brazilian is in column 2 or 3. If the brazilian is in column 2, then the person eating plum is in column 4. But the owner of the rat is on the far right (column 4), so the brazilian must be in column 3. So, the person eating plum is in column 1.

   - From point 10, we know the person drinking juice is on the right of the brazilian. So, the person drinking juice is in column 4.

   - From point 11, we know the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person eating eggplant. So, the person eating eggplant is in column 1.

   - From point 9, we know the dutch is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, the dutch is in column 1, 2, or 3. Since the brazilian is in column 3, the dutch can't be in column 3. So, the dutch is in column 1 or 2. If the dutch is in column 1, then the person cooking is in column 4. But the person driving the jet-ski is the person who's hobby is cooking (point 8), so the dutch can't be in column 1. So, the dutch is in column 2.

   - From point 8, we know the person driving the jet-ski is the person who's hobby is cooking. So, the person cooking is in row 2.

   - From point 7, we know the person doing sudoku is the person drinking juice. So, the person doing sudoku is in row 3.

   - From point 13, we know the person driving the car is on the left of the person doing sudoku. So, the person driving the car is in row 1.

   - From point 6, we know the person driving the train is on the right of the person doing gardening. So, the person doing gardening is in row 1, 2, or 4. If the person doing gardening is in row 1, then the person driving the train is in row 4. But the owner of the rat is on the far right (column 4), so the person doing gardening can't be in row 1. If the person doing gardening is in row 2, then the person driving the train is in row 3. But the person driving the train is the owner of the chinchilla (point 5), and the only available spot for the chinchilla is row 1. So, the person doing gardening is in row 4.

   - From point 5, we know the person driving the train is the owner of the chinchilla. So, the person driving the train is in row 1.

   - From point 4, we know the french is on the far right. Since the person doing gardening is in row 4, the french must be in row 3.

   - From point 12, we know the owner of the frog is on the left of the person drinking tea. So, the person drinking tea is in column 2, 3, or 4. If the person drinking tea is in column 2, then the owner of the frog is in column 1. But the person driving the car is in column 1 (point 13), so the person drinking tea can't be in column 2. If the person drinking tea is in column 3, then the owner of the frog is in column 2. But the person driving the jet-ski is in column 2 (point 8), so the person drinking tea can't be in column 3. So, the person drinking tea is in column 4.

   - From point 14, we know the person doing magic-tricks is in row 4.

   - From point 15, we know the person driving the snowmobile is in row 4.

9. Now we have filled in most of the table:

|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      | coffee      | fanta    | juice     | tea     |
| Food          | eggplant    | garlic   | lime      | plum    |
| Hobby         | cooking     | gardening | magic-tricks| sudoku  |
| Nationality   | dutch       | brazilian | french    | german  |
| Pet           | chinchilla  | dog      | frog      | rat     |
| Transport     | car        | jet-ski  | snowmobile| train   |

10. The only thing left to figure out is the beverage of the person in row 4. Since the person doing magic-tricks is in row 4, the person in row 4 can't drink juice (point 7). Since the person driving the snowmobile is in row 4, the person in row 4 can't drink coffee (point 5). So, the person in row 4 must drink tea.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-6x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the nationalities to the people. Since the Malaysian is on the right of the person who does magic-tricks, and the freelancer is on the left of the Malaysian, we can place the Malaysian in column 4. The only nationality left is German, so it goes in column 1. The remaining two nationalities are Australian and Japanese, so they go in columns 2 and 3 respectively.

2. The electrician is on the left of the German, so the electrician goes in row 1 of columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the electrician is not the German (as we placed the German in column 1), the electrician must be in column 2 or 3. However, the electrician cannot be in column 3 because the person eating orange is on the right of the Japanese, and the only fruit left for the person in column 3 is orange. So, the electrician must be in column 2.

3. The person eating blueberry is on the left of the engineer, so the engineer cannot be in the first three rows. The only remaining row for the engineer is row 4.

4. The person driving the jet-ski is the one eating raspberry (from clue 12), so raspberry must be in row 4 and column 3. This means the jet-ski driver is in row 4 and column 3.

5. The person driving the van is on the left of the mechanic (clue 4), so the mechanic cannot be in the first three rows. The only remaining row for the mechanic is row 4. Since the mechanic is not the jet-ski driver (as we placed the jet-ski driver in row 4 and column 3), the mechanic must be in row 4 and a column other than 3. However, the mechanic cannot be in column 1 because the person watching satire movies is on the left of the mechanic (clue 5), and the only satire movie left is in column 1. So, the mechanic must be in column 2.

6. The person driving the scooter is on the far left (clue 14), so it goes in row 1 and column 1.

7. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking (clue 11), so the person who's hobby is baking cannot be in the last three columns. The only hobby left for the person in column 1 is filmmaking, so the person who's hobby is baking must be in column 2. This means the person watching sports movies is in column 3.

8. The person eating onion is the person who's hobby is baking (clue 11), so onion must be in row 2 and column 2.

9. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the mechanic (clue 5), so the person watching satire movies must be in column 2. This means the satire movie genre is in column 4.

10. The person eating orange is on the right of the Japanese (clue 6), so the person eating orange must be in column 3. This means the orange fruit is in row 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, the orange cannot be in row 1 because the person driving the scooter is in row 1 and column 1. The orange also cannot be in row 2 because the person eating onion is in row 2 and column 2. So, the orange must be in row 3 or 4. However, the orange cannot be in row 4 because the jet-ski driver is in row 4 and column 3. So, the orange must be in row 3.

11. The electrician is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (clue 13), so the electrician must be in row 1 or 2. However, the electrician cannot be in row 1 because the person driving the scooter is in row 1 and column 1. So, the electrician must be in row 2.

12. The only movie genre left for the person in row 1 is horror, so the person in row 1 must be watching horror movies.

13. The only job left for the person in row 1 is mechanic, so the person in row 1 is a mechanic.

14. The only hobby left for the person in row 2 is photography, so the person in row 2 has photography as a hobby.

15. The only job left for the person in row 2 is engineer, so the person in row 2 is an engineer.

16. The only fruit left for the person in row 3 is orange, so the person in row 3 is eating orange.

17. The only hobby left for the person in row 3 is magic-tricks, so the person in row 3 has magic-tricks as a hobby.

18. The only job left for the person in row 3 is freelancer, so the person in row 3 is a freelancer.

19. The only movie genre left for the person in row 4 is musical, so the person in row 4 is watching musical movies.

20. The only nationality left for the person in row 4 is Australian, so the person in row 4 is Australian.

21. The only transport left for the person in row 4 is van, so the person in row 4 is driving a van.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-6x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows in the table.

2. We know that there are 4 different favorite beverages, jobs, music-genres, pets, sports, and means of transport. Let's fill in the first column of each row with the different options for each category.

3. From point 11, we know that the owner of the rat is on the far left. So, the first row should be Rat, and the music-genre, sport, and transport should be filled in such a way that the conditions for the rat owner are met. Let's assume the first row is: Rat, Metal, Ice-hockey, Helicopter.

4. From point 14, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is on the far left. Since the Rat is already on the far left, Badminton must be in the second row. The rest of the second row can be filled in based on the conditions for the Badminton player. Let's assume the second row is: (empty for pet), Jazz, Badminton, Boat.

5. From point 13, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. So, the third row should be Goldfish, and the sport should be Ice-hockey. The rest of the third row can be filled in based on the conditions for the Goldfish owner and the Ice-hockey player. Let's assume the third row is: Goldfish, (empty for pet), Ice-hockey, Snowmobile.

6. From point 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since the Goldfish is already on the left of the Jazz fan, the Lizard owner must be in the fourth row. The rest of the fourth row can be filled in based on the conditions for the Lizard owner. Let's assume the fourth row is: Lizard, (empty for pet), (empty for music-genre), Train.

7. From point 3, we know that the doctor is the fan of jazz. Since the Jazz fan is already in the second row, the Doctor must be in the first row. So, the first row should be revised to: Rat, Metal, Ice-hockey, Helicopter (Doctor).

8. From point 6, we know that the chef is on the right of the journalist. Since the Journalist is not yet placed, we can't determine the chef's position yet. Let's assume the fifth row is: (empty for pet), (empty for music-genre), (empty for sport), (empty for transport), Journalist (Chef on the right).

9. From point 7, we know that the doctor is on the right of the fan of trance. Since the Trance fan is not yet placed, we can't determine the doctor's position yet. Let's assume the sixth row is: (empty for pet), Trance, (empty for sport), (empty for transport), (Doctor on the right).

10. From point 8, we know that the tea drinker is on the right of the goldfish owner. Since the Goldfish owner is in the third row, the Tea drinker must be in the fourth row. So, the fourth row should be revised to: Lizard, (empty for pet), Tea, Train (Goldfish owner on the left).

11. From point 9, we know that the engineer is on the far right. Since the Tea drinker is already on the far right of the fourth row, the Engineer must be in the sixth row. So, the sixth row should be revised to: (empty for pet), Trance, (empty for sport), (empty for transport), Engineer.

12. From point 2, we know that the person drinking water is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the Ice-hockey player is in the third row, the Water drinker must be in the fifth row. So, the fifth row should be revised to: (empty for pet), (empty for music-genre), Ice-hockey, Snowmobile, Water.

13. From point 5, we know that the person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the Surfing player is not yet placed, we can't determine the boat driver's position yet. Let's assume the seventh row is: (empty for pet), (empty for music-genre), Surfing, Boat, (empty for sport).

14. From point 12, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the train. Since the Train driver is already in the fourth row, the Iced-tea drinker is the Lizard owner. So, the fourth row should be revised to: Lizard, (empty for pet), Iced-tea, Train.

Now, let's fill in the remaining information based on the conditions for the Surfing player and the remaining pets:

15. The Surfing player is on the left of the owner of the goat. Since the Goat owner is not yet placed, the Surfing player must be in the second row. So, the second row should be revised to: (Goat), (empty for music-genre), Surfing, Boat.

16. The remaining pet, the goat, must be in the first row. Since the Rat owner is already in the first row, the Goat must be the pet of the Doctor. So, the first row should be revised to: Rat, Metal, Ice-hockey, Helicopter (Doctor, Goat).

Now, we have the final solution table:
