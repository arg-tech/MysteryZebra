Lv1-4x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking 7up is not in the last position (due to condition 15), so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the person drinking fanta is on the far left (condition 12), 7up cannot be in position 1. So, 7up is either in position 2 or 3.

2. Let's assume 7up is in position 2. Then, water must be in position 1 (since 7up is on its left, and water is the only option left for position 1). This means the person drinking water is on the far left (condition 15).

3. Now, the person drinking fanta is on the far left (since 7up is not in position 1), so fanta must be in position 6.

4. The fan of salsa is on the far left (condition 5), so it must be in position 7.

5. The person driving the bike is the person who's sport is tennis (condition 3), so tennis must be in position 4 (since the person driving the bike is in the middle, condition 19).

6. The fan of blues is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (condition 7), so the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 5.

7. The person who's sport is biathlon has the fan of disco on its right (condition 2), so biathlon must be in position 3.

8. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the fan of house (condition 6), so the fan of house must be in position 5.

9. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (condition 8), so the person driving the skateboard must be in position 4.

10. The fan of classical is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (condition 10), so classical must be in position 6.

11. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle (condition 11), so it must be in position 3.

12. The fan of folk is in the middle (condition 13), so it must be in position 5.

13. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (condition 14), so volleyball must be in position 2 and skiing in position 4.

14. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person drinking cola (condition 20), so soccer must be in position 1.

15. The person driving the van is on the left of the person drinking 7up (condition 15), so the person drinking 7up must be in position 3.

16. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the van (condition 17), so the person driving the van must be in position 2.

17. The fan of classical is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer (condition 18), so the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 1.

18. The person driving the motorbike is in the middle (condition 19), so it must be in position 3.

19. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (condition 16), so tennis must be in position 2.

20. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis (condition 4), so parkour must be in position 4.

21. The fan of blues is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (condition 21), so the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 5.

Lv1-4x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on their sports. We know that the person playing basketball is on the far right (13), so we can place it in the last column. From points 2, 4, and 5, we know that the person playing rock, the person eating corn, and the person watching comedy movies are to the left of the basketball player. So, we can place the rock fan, the corn eater, and the comedy movie watcher in the first, second, and third columns, respectively, from the left.

2. From point 6, we know that the person eating lime is to the left of the person eating garlic. Since the garlic eater is not in the first three columns (as per the previous step), the lime eater must be in the fourth column.

3. From point 7, we know that the person playing basketball is the one eating orange. So, the orange eater must be in the last column.

4. From point 17, we know that the person eating cranberry is on the far left. So, the cranberry eater must be in the first column.

5. From point 18, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person eating cranberry. So, the superhero movie watcher must be in the second column.

6. From point 19, we know that the person eating apple is to the right of the fan of indie. Since the indie fan is not in the last three columns (as per the previous steps), the apple eater must be in the fifth column.

7. From point 14, we know that the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the person eating mango. Since the mango eater is not in the last three columns (as per the previous steps), the scientific movie watcher must be in the sixth column.

8. From point 11, we know that the fan of soul is to the left of the fan of electronic. Since the electronic fan is not in the first three columns (as per the previous steps), the soul fan must be in the seventh column.

9. From point 16, we know that the person playing tennis is to the right of the person playing cycling. Since the cyclist is not in the last three columns (as per the previous steps), the tennis player must be in the fifth column.

10. From point 10, we know that the person playing badminton is to the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the sports movie watcher is not in the first three columns (as per the previous steps), the badminton player must be in the fourth column.

11. From point 9, we know that the person watching sports movies is to the left of the person playing rugby. Since the rugby player is not in the first three columns (as per the previous steps), the sports movie watcher must be in the sixth column.

12. From point 8, we know that the fan of blues is to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the action movie watcher is not in the first three columns (as per the previous steps), the blues fan must be in the third column.

13. From point 15, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is the fan of soul. Since the soul fan is in the seventh column (as per the previous steps), the fantasy movie watcher must be in the fifth column.

Now, let's place the movie genres, music genres, and food:

|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Food | Cranberry | Superhero | Corn | Lime | Apple | Orange | Garlic |
| Movie-Genre | Fantasy | Action | Comedy | Scientific | Sports | Sports | Blues |
| Music-Genre | Soul | Blues | Rock | Electronic | Indie | Trance | House |
| Sport | Badminton | Basketball | Cycling | Tennis | Rowing | Rugby |  |

14. We still have an empty spot in the third column for the sport. From point 12, we know that the person watching action movies is to the right of the blues fan. Since the blues fan is in the third column, the action movie watcher must be in the fourth column. So, the sport in the third column must be rugby.

So, the final solution table is:

#############

Lv1-4x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the guinea-pig and rat owners relative to the bartender, so let's place them first. Since the guinea-pig owner is on the right of the bartender and the rat owner is on the left of the bartender, we can place the bartender in the middle (position 4). Then, we can place the guinea-pig owner to the right of the bartender (position 5) and the rat owner to the left of the bartender (position 3).

2. The accountant is on the right of the owner of the bird, so the bird owner must be to the left of the accountant. Since the bird owner is also to the left of the person watching crime movies, and the person watching crime movies is not the bartender (as the bartender is watching scientific movies), the accountant cannot be in position 4 (as the bartender is there). So, the accountant must be in position 6. The bird owner can be in position 2 (left of the accountant).

3. The owner of the bird is also to the left of the person watching crime movies, so the person watching crime movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the pilot is on the left of the person watching sports movies and the person watching sports movies is not the bartender (as the bartender is watching scientific movies), the person watching sports movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 either. So, the person watching crime movies must be in position 7.

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the owner of the hamster and on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the bartender is watching satire movies, the person watching satire movies is in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles and the owner of the hamster must be in positions 5 and 6 respectively.

5. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person watching crime movies, so the person watching crime movies is not in positions 1, 2, or 3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person watching crime movies, so the person watching crime movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. The only remaining position is 7. So, the person watching crime movies is in position 7.

6. The owner of the frog is on the far left, so the owner of the frog is in position 1.

7. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person watching crime movies, so the person watching crime movies must be in position 7. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person watching crime movies, so the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 2.

8. The photographer is on the right of the owner of the goat, so the owner of the goat is in position 2. The pilot is on the left of the person watching sports movies, so the person watching sports movies is in position 6. The only remaining position for the pilot is position 1.

9. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the project-manager, so the project-manager is in position 5.

10. The scientist is on the right of the person watching comedy movies, so the person watching comedy movies is in position 3. The only remaining position for the scientist is position 6.

11. The person watching mystery movies is on the far right, so the person watching mystery movies is in position 7.

12. The person watching scientific movies is the bartender, so that's already placed.

13. The person watching satire movies is in position 4.

Lv1-4x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person who's hobby is collecting on the far left (position 1).
2. Since the fan of classical is on the left of the owner of the goldfish, and the owner of the goldfish can't be in position 1 (because the hobby collector is there), place the owner of the goldfish in position 2. The fan of classical must be in position 3, as the person drinking mirinda is in the middle (position 6).
3. The owner of the goat is in the middle (position 5), as stated in rule 20.
4. The owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is skydiving (rule 14), so place the person who's hobby is skydiving in position 4.
5. The fan of trance is on the right of the owner of the bird (rule 14), so place the fan of trance in position 7.
6. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of r&b (rule 8), so place the fan of r&b in position 5.
7. The person who's hobby is traveling is the person drinking fanta (rule 16), so place the person drinking fanta in position 6.
8. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the fan of dubstep (rule 3), so place the person drinking 7up in position 1 and the fan of dubstep in position 2.
9. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking cola (rule 4), so place the person drinking cola in position 3 and the person drinking hot-chocolate in position 4.
10. The fan of techno is the person drinking cola (rule 6), so the person drinking cola is already placed in position 3.
11. The fan of metal is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (rule 2), so place the fan of metal in position 2.
12. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the dog (rule 12), so place the owner of the dog in position 6 and the owner of the turtle in position 7.
13. The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the fan of r&b (rule 21), so place the person who's hobby is singing in position 5.
14. The owner of the guinea-pig is the fan of classical (rule 19), so the person drinking milk (who is the video-games fan, rule 5) must be in position 1.
15. The person drinking soy-milk is not placed yet, but we know it's not in positions 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (because of the placed beverages).
16. The only remaining position is position 2. So, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2.

Final solution table:

Now, let's fill in the missing music-genres and pets:
17. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the fan of classical (rule 17), so the fan of rock must be in position 3.
18. The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing (rule 21), so the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 4. The fan of dubstep is in position 1, so the fan of techno must be in position 5.
19. The only remaining music-genre is trance, which is already placed in position 7.
20. The only remaining pet is soy-milk's pet, which is not a bird, dog, fish, goat, or turtle. So, it must be a goldfish, as it's the only remaining pet.

1. We know that there are 7 people, so each row represents a person.

2. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left, so we can place hiking in the first column.

3. From rule 17, the malaysian is on the left of the spanish, so we can place malaysian in the second column and spanish in the third column.

4. From rule 18, the argentine is on the left of the person drinking milk, so we can place argentine in the fourth column and milk in the fifth column (since milk is the hobby of the person drinking milk, as per rule 11).

5. From rule 19, the person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the thai, so we can place tennis in the sixth column and thai in the seventh column.

6. From rule 20, the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the brazilian, so we can place biathlon in the second row and brazilian in the third row.

7. From rule 21, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we know the sport of snowboarding is water (from rule 15), we can place mirinda in the fourth row and snowboarding (water) in the fifth row.

11. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is parkour, but we haven't placed parkour yet. Since parkour requires a lot of agility and filmmaking can be creative, let's place parkour in the third row (between argentine and brazilian) and filmmaking in the third column.

12. From rule 3, the brazilian is on the left of the thai, so the brazilian must be in the second row. Since biathlon is on the left of brazilian (rule 20), biathlon must be in the first row.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle, so we can place woodworking in the fifth column.

14. From rule 9, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, so we can place iced-tea in the sixth row. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (rules 5 and 6), we can place drawing in the seventh column.

15. From rule 4, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the brazilian, so we can place rowing in the fourth row.

16. From rule 2, the dutch is the person who's sport is climbing, so we can place dutch in the first row and climbing in the first column.

18. Since all the other categories have been filled, the remaining category, nationality, must be placed in the second, third, and seventh columns. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact order of nationalities in these columns.
