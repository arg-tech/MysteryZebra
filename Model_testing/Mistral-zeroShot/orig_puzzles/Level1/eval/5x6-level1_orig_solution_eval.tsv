Lv1-5x6-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people with unique constraints:
   - The social-worker is on the left of the fan of ambient, the person drinking sprite is on the far left, and the social-worker is on the right of the scientist. So, the social-worker must be in the first column, the sprite drinker in the first row, and the scientist in the second row. Let's assume the social-worker is S, the sprite drinker is P, and the scientist is C.
   - The dancer is on the far right, so the dancer must be in the last column. Let's assume the dancer is D.
   - The police-officer is on the far left, so the police-officer is in the first row. Let's assume the police-officer is O.

2. Now let's place the pets with unique constraints:
   - The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming, and the owner of the snake is on the right of the fan of rock. So, the fish owner must be in the first column, and the snake owner must be in the last column. Let's assume the fish owner is F and the snake owner is R.
   - The owner of the bird is the person who's sport is swimming, so the bird owner must be in the same row as the swimming sport. Let's assume the bird owner is SW (for Swimming).
   - The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the lizard, so the hamster owner must be in a column to the left of the lizard owner.

3. Now let's place the sports with unique constraints:
   - The person who's sport is biathlon is the fan of disco, so the biathlon person must be in the same row as the disco fan. Let's assume the biathlon person is B.
   - The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the fan of disco, and the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. So, the tennis person must be in the same row as the almond-milk drinker and the disco fan, but to the left of the almond-milk drinker. Let's assume the tennis person is T.
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. So, the water-polo person must be in a row below the volleyball person.

4. Now let's place the remaining beverages and music-genres:
   - The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the bird (SW), and the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. So, the almond-milk drinker must be below SW, and the soy-milk drinker must be below the almond-milk drinker.
   - The fan of dubstep is on the right of the owner of the fish (F), and the fan of disco is on the right of the owner of the hamster. So, the fan of dubstep must be in a row below F, and the fan of disco must be in a row below the hamster owner.
   - The fan of ambient is on the left of the social-worker (S), and the fan of soul is on the right of the dancer (D). So, the fan of ambient must be in a row above S, and the fan of soul must be in a row above D.

5. Now let's place the remaining people and pets:
   - The designer must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets.
   - The scientist must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets, and on the right of the social-worker (S).
   - The bartender must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets, and on the left of the owner of the hamster.

   - The owner of the lizard must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets, and to the right of the hamster owner.

6. Finally, let's place the remaining beverages:
   - The coffee drinker must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets, and on the right of the person who's sport is tennis (T).
   - The cola drinker must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets, and on the left of the police-officer (O).
   - The fanta drinker must be in a row and column not occupied by any of the placed people or pets.

Lv1-5x6-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the people to the jobs. Since the police-officer is on the far right, and the engineer is on the far left, we can place them at the ends. The designer is on the left of the snowmobile driver, so the designer is in the second position. The accountant is the owner of the turtle and is on the right of the skateboard driver, so the accountant is in the fourth position. The project-manager is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, so the project-manager is in the fifth position. This leaves the sixth position for the electrician.

2. The owner of the horse is the person driving the bus. Since the accountant is not a driver, the horse owner must be in the first, third, or sixth position. The horse owner is on the left of the bus driver, so the horse owner is in the third position. This means the bus driver is in the sixth position, and the bus is in the row corresponding to the bus driver, which is the sixth row.

Lv1-5x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on their sports. Since cricket is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Handball is on the right of the person who's sport is handball, which is the person in column 6. So, handball goes in the sixth column. Row 6 is the row for handball.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cricket |  |  |  | Handball |  |

   Now we know that the fisherman is on the right of the person eating tomato, so the fisherman can't be in the first or sixth column. The only remaining column for the fisherman is the third column. So, the fisherman eats onion.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cricket | Fisherman (Onion) |  | Handball |  |  |

   Since the paramedic is on the left of the fisherman, the paramedic must be in the second column. The paramedic's sport is cycling, so we place cycling in the second row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cricket | Paramedic (Cycling) | Fisherman (Onion) | Handball |  |  |

Lv1-5x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person watching sports movies (S) and the person driving the airplane (A) based on the first and last conditions. A is on the right of S (A S).

2. Place the person watching satire movies (T) based on condition 8. T is driving the bike (T B). Since T is on the left of S (T L S), we can place S to the right of T (T B S).

3. Place the person watching scientific movies (C) on the far right (C R R R R R).

4. Place the person watching drama movies (D) based on condition 11. D is on the right of the person watching mystery movies (M) (D M). Since M is on the left of the person drinking tea (T) (M L T), we can place T to the right of D (D M T).

5. Place the person watching mystery movies (M) based on condition 3. M is on the left of the person drinking tea (M L T).

6. Place the person drinking tea (T) based on conditions 15 and 16. T is on the far left (T L L L L L) and on the left of the analyst (A) (T L A).

7. Place the analyst (A) based on condition 15. A is on the right of the doctor (D) (A D).

8. Place the doctor (D) based on condition 16. D is on the far left (D L L L L L).

9. Place the person drinking almond-milk (A) based on conditions 13 and 18. A is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (S) (A S) and on the left of the person drinking lemonade (L) (A L L).

10. Place the person drinking soy-milk (S) based on condition 13. S is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (S A).

11. Place the person drinking lemonade (L) based on condition 19. L is on the right of the person driving the bus (B) (L B).

12. Place the person driving the bus (B) based on condition 19. B is on the left of the person drinking juice (J) (B J).

13. Place the person drinking juice (J) based on condition 20. J is on the right of the person driving the airplane (A) (J A).

14. Place the person driving the scooter (Sc) based on condition 17. Sc is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (G) (Sc G).

15. Place the owner of the guinea-pig (G) based on the remaining positions. G is not on the far left or far right, so G can be placed anywhere in the middle (G).

16. Place the owner of the horse (H) based on condition 18. H is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (H A).

17. Place the owner of the chinchilla (Ch) based on condition 4. Ch is on the right of the person watching sports movies (Ch S).

18. Place the owner of the rat (R) based on conditions 2 and 20. R is on the left of the person driving the airplane (R A) and on the right of the person watching sports movies (R S). However, R cannot be placed in the first position because the person driving the airplane (A) is already there. So, R can be placed in the second position (R S A).

19. Place the person driving the tram (Tr) based on conditions 7 and 9. Tr is on the right of the owner of the mouse (M) (Tr M) and is the firefighter (Tr F).
