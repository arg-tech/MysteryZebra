Lv1-1x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the engineer is on the far left, we can place the engineer in the first column (1). So, the first row will be filled with 'engineer'.

   |       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|
   | Job   | engineer|          |          |

2. Now, we know that the bartender is on the right of the librarian. Since the engineer is already on the leftmost position, the librarian cannot be in the first column. So, let's place the librarian in the second column (2).

   |       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|
   | Job   | engineer| librarian|          |

3. Now, the only remaining job is the bartender. Since the bartender is to the right of the librarian, the bartender must be in the third column (3).

   |       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
   |-------|---------|----------|----------|
   | Job   | engineer| librarian| bartender|

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the dancer is on the far left, so the dancer must be in the first column. Let's place the dancer in the first column, first row. So, the table looks like this:

   |       |   1    |   2    |      3       |
   |-------|--------|--------|-------------|
   | Job   | dancer |       |             |

2. Now, we know that the photographer is on the far right, so the photographer must be in the last column. Since the dancer is already in the first column, the only remaining job for the second column is the doctor. So, the table looks like this:

   |       |   1    |   2    |      3       |
   |-------|--------|--------|-------------|
   | Job   | dancer | doctor | photographer |

3. The table is now filled, and we have a valid solution. So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of baking is on the far left. So, the first row must have 'baking'.

2. Now, since the person with the hobby of video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading, we can place 'video-games' in the third row.

3. This leaves us with 'reading' for the second row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are three nationalities: French, Japanese, and Nigerian.

2. The Japanese is on the far right, so we can place the Japanese in the third column (column 3).

3. The Japanese is also on the right of the Nigerian. Since the Japanese is already in the rightmost column, the Nigerian must be in the second column (column 2).

4. Now, we are left with the French nationality. Since the Japanese and Nigerian are already placed, the French must be in the first column (column 1).

The final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking water is on the far right, so we can place it in the third column.

2. Since the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and the water is on the far right, the only possible position for sprite is in the first column.

3. This leaves the second column for the person drinking almond-milk.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are three different means of transport: boat, car, and snowmobile.

2. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the car cannot be in the first position (as there is no one to its left), so it must be either the second or third position.

3. The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the boat. This means that the car cannot be in the third position (as there is no one to its right), so it must be in the second position.

4. Now we know that the car is in the second position. Since the car is to the left of the boat, the boat must be in the first position.

5. The person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person driving the car, so it must be in the third position.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv1-1x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different movie genres: action, martial-arts, and thriller.

2. The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. This means that thriller must be in the first column. So, the first row should be filled with 'Thriller'.

3. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means that action must be in the second column. So, the second row should be filled with 'Action'.

4. Now, we are left with the third column. Since there are only three genres and we have filled two, the third column must contain 'Martial-arts'.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv1-1x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in the middle, we can fill the middle cell with 'traveling'. So, the table now looks like this:

   | Hobby   |         | traveling |         |

2. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. So, the hobby on the right of 'traveling' must be 'dancing'. The table now looks like this:

   |         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
   | Hobby   |         | traveling | dancing |

3. Now, we are left with the hobby for the first and third columns. Since there are only three hobbies (dancing, drawing, traveling), and we have already filled two of them, the remaining hobby, 'drawing', must be in the first and third columns. So, the final table is:

   |         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
   | Hobby   | drawing | traveling | dancing |

   However, since the order of the hobbies doesn't matter, we can rearrange the table if needed. Let's rearrange it so that the hobbies are in alphabetical order:

   |         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
   | Hobby   | drawing | traveling | dancing |

   So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three people watching different genres and the person watching disaster movies is in the middle, we can place the disaster movie genre in the second position. So, the table looks like this:

   | Movie-Genre   |        | Disaster |             |

2. Now, the person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. So, the comedy movie genre should be in the third position.

Lv1-1x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three nationalities: Italian, Spanish, and Turkish.

2. The Turkish is in the middle, so the arrangement must be: ______ (Turkish) ______

3. The Spanish is on the left of the Turkish, so the arrangement must be: Spanish ______ (Turkish) ______

4. Now we have two spots left to fill. Since there are only three nationalities, the Italian must be one of the remaining two. If the Italian were in the last spot, the arrangement would be: Spanish ______ Italian. But since the Turkish is in the middle, this is not possible.

5. Therefore, the Italian must be in the first spot. So the arrangement is: Italian Spanish ______ (Turkish)

6. The only nationality left is the Italian, so it must be in the last spot: Italian Spanish (Turkish) ______

So, the final solution table is:
