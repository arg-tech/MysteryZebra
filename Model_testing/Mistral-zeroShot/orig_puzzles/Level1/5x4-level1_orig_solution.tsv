Lv1-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person eating cabbage. Let's place the cabbage eater in the first column (Column 1) and the documentary watcher in the second column (Column 2).

2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is already placed in Column 2 (due to the documentary watcher being on their left), we'll place the chess player in Column 3.

3. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since the d&b fan is yet to be placed, we can't determine their position yet, but we know the writer is in Column 1.

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is in Column 2 and we can't place the guinea-pig owner to the left of them, we'll place the guinea-pig owner in Column 3.

5. The fan of classical is the person eating asparagus. Since we know the asparagus eater is the documentary watcher (from step 1), we can place the classical music fan in Column 2.

6. The fan of d&b is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla owner is in Column 2, we'll place the d&b fan in Column 1.

7. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the person eating asparagus. Since the asparagus eater is the documentary watcher (from step 1), we'll place the dubstep fan in Column 3.

8. The person eating carrot is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the card-games player is yet to be placed, we can't determine their position yet, but we know the carrot eater is in Column 1.

9. The person watching family movies is the person eating asparagus. Since the asparagus eater is the documentary watcher (from step 1), this condition is already satisfied.

10. The owner of the horse is the person watching epic movies. Since we haven't placed the epic movie watcher yet, we'll place them in Column 4.

11. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse owner is yet to be placed, we can't determine their position yet, but we know the card-games player is in Column 4.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

- Since the carrot eater is in Column 1 and the card-games player is in Column 4, we can place the mouse owner in Column 2 and the carrot eater in Column 3.

- The remaining food, hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, and pet can be placed randomly in the empty cells, as long as they are unique to each column.

Final solution table:

2. We know the number of beverages, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports, so we can fill in the column headers.

3. From rule 1, the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the sport is one of four, the person watching drama can't be in the first column. So, the person watching drama is in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's place it in column 3 for now. This means the person playing cricket is in column 1.

4. The fan of disco is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the person playing cricket is in column 1, the person playing handball must be in column 2. So, the fan of disco is in column 4.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right. Since the fan of disco is in column 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 5.

6. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 5, the person drinking 7up is in column 4 and the person drinking coffee is in column 3.

8. The fan of r&b is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching satire is in column 2, the person watching documentary is in column 1. So, the owner of the hamster (who is the fan of r&b according to rule 8) is in column 4.

9. The person watching spy movies is left open. Let's place it in column 2 for now.

10. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the hamster is in column 4, the person drinking fanta is in column 3.

11. The person playing parkour is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in column 3, the person playing parkour is in column 4.

12. The person playing skiing is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the hamster is in column 4, the person playing skiing is in column 5.

13. The person watching documentary is on the far left. Since the person watching spy is in column 2, the person watching documentary is in column 1.

14. The owner of the rat is left open. Let's place it in column 3 for now.

15. The person playing cricket is in column 1. The person playing handball is in column 2. The person playing parkour is in column 4. The person playing skiing is in column 5. The only sport left is cricket, so it must be in column 1.

16. The owner of the ferret is in column 3. The only beverage left is fanta, so it must be in column 3.

17. The only movie genre left is spy, so it must be in column 1.

18. The only music genre left is electronic, so it must be in column 2.

19. The only pet left is pony. Since the owner of the rat is in column 3, the owner of the pony must be in column 4.

Lv1-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 items in each category, so we can label them A, B, C, D for each category.

2. From point 11, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left, so Soymilk is A.

3. From point 10, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the far right, so Coffee is D.

4. Since Coffee is D, Cola must be C because it can't be A or B (as they are already taken).

5. From point 5, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left, so Jet-ski is A.

6. From point 6, the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking Cola, so Taxi is B.

7. From point 7, the Thai is on the far right, so Thai is D.

8. From point 9, the Indonesian is on the left of the person eating Garlic, so Indonesian is A.

9. From point 8, the person eating Raspberry is on the right of the Japanese, so Raspberry is C.

10. From point 4, we know the person driving the roller is on the right of the owner of the snake, so Roller is B.

11. From point 2, the person eating Raspberry is on the left of the person driving the roller, so the person driving the roller must be D. This means Roller is D and the owner of the snake is B.

12. From point 1, the owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the cat, so Goat is A and Cat is B.

13. From point 3, the person driving the roller is on the right of the owner of the snake, so the owner of the snake is C. But we already know it's B, so this is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Final solution table (with the error):

2. The gardener is on the far left (12), so they are in the 1st column.

3. The Canadian is on the far right (3), so they are in the 4th column. Since the dancer is already in the 4th column, the Canadian cannot be the musician (6) or the journalist (12), so they must be the teacher.

4. The owner of the ferret is the person eating potato (4) and is on the right of the person eating mango (5). Since the dancer and Canadian are on the rightmost columns, the person eating potato must be in the 2nd column, and the person eating mango must be in the 3rd column. The person eating potato is also not the gardener (12), so they must be the journalist. So, the journalist is in the 2nd column and eats potato, and the ferret is in the 1st row.

5. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (7). Since the journalist is in the 2nd column, the owner of the lizard must be in the 3rd or 4th column. But the dancer and Canadian are already in the 4th column, so the owner of the lizard must be in the 3rd column. The person who's hobby is collecting must be in the 1st or 2nd column, but the gardener is already in the 1st column, so the collector must be in the 2nd column. So, the collector is in the 2nd row, and the lizard is in the 3rd row.

6. The person eating pumpkin is the owner of the lizard (9). Since the lizard is in the 3rd row, the person eating pumpkin is also in the 3rd row.

7. The musician is on the far right (6), so they are in the 4th column. Since the dancer, Canadian, and journalist are already in the 4th column, the musician must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. But the gardener and collector are already in the 1st and 2nd columns, so the musician must be in the 3rd column.

8. The spanish is on the right of the turkish (14), so the spanish is in the 4th column and the turkish is in the 3rd column.

9. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the Australian (13). Since the Canadian is already in the 4th column, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. But the gardener, collector, and musician are already in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd columns, so the person who's hobby is skydiving must be the Australian.

Now we have all the placements:

2. From rule 9, we know that the Indonesian is on the far right, so Indonesian = 4. Since there are only 4 nationalities, the others must be in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's assume the order is Brazilian, Pakistani, and Thai for now.

3. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is driving the van, so Rugby = 4. Since there are only 4 sports, the others must be in positions 1, 2, and 3. Let's assume the order is Climbing, Cricket, and Snowboarding for now.

4. From rule 7, we know that the person driving the ship is the person who's sport is snowboarding, so Snowboarding = 3. This means Climbing = 1 and Cricket = 2.

5. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the Brazilian, so Climbing = 1 and Brazilian = 2. This means Indonesian = 4, Rugby = 3, and Pakistani = 1 or 2. Since the Indonesian is on the far right, Pakistani = 1.

6. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is watching animation movies, so Gardening = 1. This means Dancing = 2, Card-games = 3, and Skydiving = 4.

9. From rule 4, we know that the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person driving the ship, so Documentary = 3. This means Animation = 1 and Fantasy = 4.

10. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, so the order of sports is Rugby, Snowboarding, Climbing, Cricket. This means the order of nationalities is Brazilian, Pakistani, Indonesian, Thai.

11. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is snowboarding, so the order of hobbies is Gardening, Dancing, Card-games, Skydiving.

12. From rule 1, we know that the people have 4 different hobbies, so the order of movie genres is Animation, Documentary, Fantasy, Sports.

13. From rules 1 and 12, we know that the person watching animation movies is the person with hobby Gardening, so the person watching animation movies is in position 1. This means the person watching sports movies is in position 2, the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, and the person watching fantasy movies is in position 4.

14. From rules 1 and 10, we know that the person driving the van is the person with sport Rugby, so the person driving the van is in position 4. This means the person driving the bike is in position 1 (Pakistani), the person driving the ship is in position 3 (Snowboarding), and the person driving the car is in position 2 (unknown).

15. From rules 1 and 11, we know that the person driving the car is the person with hobby Card-games, so the person driving the car is in position 2.

1. We know that the person watching horror movies is on the right of the owner of the fish. Let's place the fish owner and the horror movie watcher for now. Let's assume the fish owner is in position 4 and the horror movie watcher is in position 3.

Lv1-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left, we can place Puzzles in the first column.

2. The person drinking coffee is on the far left, so Coffee must be in the first row.

3. The manager is the person who's sport is basketball, and the manager is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know Coffee is the manager and Lacrosse is in the third row, Basketball must be in the second row.

4. The person drinking cola is the nurse, so Cola goes in the second column, second row.

5. The person who's hobby is card-games is the person driving the jet-ski, and the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since we know Cola is driving the jet-ski, Card-games must be in the first column, third row.

6. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski, so Writing goes in the fourth column, third row.

7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike, so Hot-chocolate goes in the fourth column, fourth row.

8. The social-worker is on the left of the nurse, so Social-worker goes in the first column, second column.

9. The person who's sport is baseball is the person drinking coffee, so Baseball goes in the first row, first column.

10. The person who's sport is tennis is not specified yet, but we know it's not in the first or fourth row (since those are occupied by Baseball and Basketball). Let's place Tennis in the third row, fourth column for now.

11. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person driving the airplane (since the manager's sport is Basketball and the manager is not driving the airplane). Since we know Tennis is not in the third row, Lacrosse must be in the third row, second column.

12. The person who's hobby is skydiving is not specified yet. Since we know Tennis is not in the third row, Skydiving can't be in the third row either. Let's place Skydiving in the second row, third column for now.

13. The person who's job is a videographer is not specified yet. Since we know Tennis is not in the third row, the videographer can't be in the third row either. Let's place Videographer in the fourth row, second column for now.

14. The person who's sport is basketball is the manager, so we already know this.

15. The person who's sport is baseball is the person drinking coffee, so we already know this.

16. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left, so we already know this.

17. The person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is lacrosse, so we already know this.

18. The person driving the trike is the person drinking hot-chocolate, so we already know this.

19. The person driving the jet-ski is the person who's hobby is card-games, so we already know this.

20. The person driving the roller is not specified yet. Since we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the airplane, the person driving the roller must be on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. This means Roller must be in the first column, fifth row.

21. The person who's hobby is skydiving is not specified yet in a specific row. Since we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, Skydiving must be in the second column, fifth row.

22. The person who's job is a videographer is not specified yet in a specific column. Since we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, the videographer must be in the third column, fourth row.

23. The person who's sport is tennis is not specified yet in a specific column. Since we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, Tennis must be in the fourth column, third row.

Now, let's check the consistency of the table:
- All four beverages are unique and in the first column.
- All four hobbies are unique and in the first row.
- All four jobs are unique and in the fourth row.
- All four sports are unique and in the first three rows.
- All four means of transport are unique and in the fourth column.

The table is consistent, so the final solution is:

|             |        Coffee       |      Cola      |       Tennis       |        Hot-chocolate       |

| Transport   | Roller           | Jet-ski      | Trike           |               |

The hobbies, jobs, and sports are not filled in the table because they are not explicitly given in the puzzle. However, we know that the hobbies are Card-games, Puzzles, Skydiving, and Writing, the jobs are Manager, Nurse, Social-worker, and Videographer, and the sports are Baseball, Basketball, Lacrosse, and Tennis. The means of transport are Airplane, Jet-ski, Roller, and Trike."
Lv1-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people and their preferences are arranged in a row. Let's label the positions from left to right as P1, P2, P3, and P4.

2. We know that the person who's sport is cycling (C) is on the right of the person watching documentary movies (D). So, D cannot be in P4. Let's assume D is in P1.

3. The person who's sport is badminton (B) is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (G). So, G cannot be in P2. Let's assume G is in P3.

4. The person who's hobby is dancing (D) is on the far left. So, D is in P1.

5. The fan of electronic is on the right of the person drinking juice (J). So, J cannot be in P1. Let's assume J is in P4.

6. The person drinking water (W) is the fan of rock. So, W is the person in P2 (since rock is not in P1, P3, or P4).

7. The fan of metal is on the far right. So, metal is in P4.

8. The person who's sport is volleyball (V) is the person drinking juice. So, V is in P4.

9. The person watching family movies (F) is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. So, F cannot be in P1 or P2. Let's assume F is in P3.

10. The person who's hobby is collecting (C) is on the left of the person watching scientific movies (S). So, S cannot be in P4. Let's assume S is in P2.

11. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person drinking water. This is already solved in step 6.

12. The person who's sport is badminton is on the far left. This is already solved in step 3.

13. The person drinking 7up (U) is on the far right. Since U is not in P1, P2, P3, or P4, it must be in P4. But this conflicts with J and V, so U cannot be in P4. Therefore, U cannot be 7up.

14. Since U cannot be 7up, it must be one of the remaining beverages (juice, soy-milk, water). Let's assume U is soy-milk.

15. Now, the only beverage left for P1 is 7up.

16. The only movie-genre left for P2 is scientific.

17. The only music-genre left for P3 is techno.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the western movie fan is not the first person (since the writer is to their right). So, the western movie fan can be in any of the positions 2, 3, 4. Let's assume the western movie fan is in position 2.

2. The doctor is driving the subway, so the doctor must be in position 1 (since the subway driver must be in the first row).

3. The classical fan is to the left of the epic movie fan. Since the western movie fan is in position 2, the classical fan can be in position 1 or 3. If the classical fan was in position 1, the epic movie fan would have to be in position 4, but the western movie fan is in position 2, so the classical fan must be in position 3.

4. The accountant is driving the ship, so the accountant must be in position 4 (since the ship driver must be in the last row).

5. The paramedic is to the right of the scientific movie fan. Since the western movie fan is in position 2, the scientific movie fan can be in positions 1, 3, or 4. If the scientific movie fan was in position 1, the paramedic would have to be in position 2, but the doctor is the fan of r&b and the doctor is in position 1, so the scientific movie fan cannot be in position 1. If the scientific movie fan was in position 3, the paramedic would have to be in position 4, but the accountant is the accountant, so the scientific movie fan cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the scientific movie fan must be in position 4.

6. The writer is to the left of the doctor, so the writer must be in position 2.

7. The fan of r&b is the doctor, so the r&b fan is in position 1.

8. The fan of indie is the paramedic, so the indie fan is in position 4.

9. The owner of the frog is on the far left, so the frog owner is in position 1.

10. The fan of house is not the western movie fan (since the western movie fan is in position 2), not the classical fan (since the classical fan is in position 3), not the r&b fan (since the r&b fan is in position 1), and not the indie fan (since the indie fan is in position 4). The only remaining option is the epic movie fan, so the epic movie fan is a fan of house.

11. The fan of scientific movies is the paramedic, so the paramedic is a fan of scientific movies.

12. The fan of r&b is the doctor, so the doctor is a fan of r&b.

13. The fan of indie is the paramedic, so the paramedic is a fan of indie.

14. The fan of classical is to the left of the epic movie fan, who is a fan of house. The only remaining option for the classical fan is position 3.

15. The owner of the dog is a fan of indie (the paramedic), so the owner of the dog is in position 4.

16. The owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the van driver. Since the western movie fan is in position 2, the van driver cannot be in position 2. If the van driver was in position 1, the owner of the hedgehog would have to be in position 4, but the accountant is the accountant, so the van driver cannot be in position 1. If the van driver was in position 3, the owner of the hedgehog would have to be in position 2, but the writer is to the left of the doctor, so the van driver cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the van driver must be in position 4. This means the owner of the hedgehog is in position 3.
