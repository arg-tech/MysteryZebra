Lv1-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, two jobs, two movie genres, two nationalities, two pets, and two means of transport. So, each category will have one unique item on the left and one on the right.

2. The owner of the goat is on the far left, so the goat is on the left side. Let's place the goat in the Pet column on the left.

3. Since the accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller, and the goat is on the far left, the roller must be on the far right. Let's place the roller in the Transport column on the right.

4. Now, the accountant must be on the right of the roller, so the accountant cannot be in the first row (since the goat is on the left). Therefore, the accountant must be in the second row. Let's place the accountant in the Job column in the second row on the right.

5. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right, so mirinda must be in the second column of the second row (since the accountant is in the second row on the right). Let's place mirinda in the Beverage column in the second row, second column.

6. The french is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we already know the accountant and the person drinking mirinda, the only remaining person who can watch zombie movies is the first person. So, the french must be in the second row. However, we already placed the accountant and the person drinking mirinda in the second row. This contradicts the information that the french is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it stands.

Assuming the puzzle is corrected, the solution would be as follows:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |  mirinda   |  milk     |
| Job           |  journalist | accountant |
| Movie-Genre   |  zombie    |  thriller  |
| Nationality   |  malaysian |  french    |
| Pet           |  goat      |  ferret    |
| Transport     |            |  roller   |

However, without a corrected version of the puzzle, this is the best I can do."
Lv1-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, 2 pets, and 2 means of transport.

2. Let's assign variables to each category:
   - Beverage: A (7up) and B (water)
   - Hobby: C (camping) and D (filmmaking)
   - Movie-Genre: E (action) and F (crime)
   - Music-Genre: G (folk) and H (pop)
   - Pet: I (bird) and J (rat)
   - Transport: K (motorbike) and L (ship)

3. From the clues, we can make the following deductions:

   - A and B are in different rows (different beverages)
   - C and D are in different columns (different hobbies)
   - E and F are in different columns (different movie-genres)
   - G and H are in different columns (different music-genres)
   - I and J are in different rows (different pets)
   - K and L are in different rows (different means of transport)

4. Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking water is the fan of pop (H). So, H cannot be in the same column as B (water).

5. Clue 1 tells us that there are two different favorite beverages, so A cannot be in the same row as H (since H is already assigned).

6. Now, let's use the position clues:

   - Clue 1: The fan of pop (H) is on the right of the owner of the rat (J). This means J cannot be in the first column.

   - Clue 4: The person driving the motorbike (K) is on the left of the owner of the bird (I). This means I cannot be in the last column.

7. Now, let's use the hobby and movie-genre clues to further narrow down the possibilities:

   - Clue 3: The person watching action movies (E) is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (C). Since C cannot be in the last column (from Clue 4), E cannot be in the last row.

8. Now, let's place the remaining elements based on the information we have:

   - Since H (pop) is on the right of J (rat), and J cannot be in the first column, H must be in the second column.
   - Since E (action) is on the left of C (camping), and C cannot be in the last column, E must be in the first column.
   - Since I (bird) cannot be in the last column (from Clue 4), it must be in the first row.
   - Since K (motorbike) is on the left of I (bird), it must be in the second row.

9. Now, we have only one remaining element for each category, so we can place them:

   - Since A (7up) and B (water) are the only remaining beverages, A can be in the first row and B in the second row.
   - Since G (folk) and F (crime) are the only remaining movie-genres, F can be in the first column and G in the second column.
   - Since D (filmmaking) is the only remaining hobby, it can be in the second row.

10. Now, let's place the pets and the means of transport:

    - Since J (rat) cannot be in the first column (from Clue 1), it must be in the second column.
    - Since I (bird) is in the first row, J (rat) must be in the second row.
    - Since K (motorbike) is in the second row, L (ship) must be in the first row.

11. Here is the final solution table:

    |               |     1      |    2    |
    | Beverage      | 7up       | water   |

Lv1-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 different hobbies, 2 different movie-genres, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, and 2 different sports, we can place one of each in each row.

2. From the first condition, the cat owner cannot be on the same side as the person who bakes, so we can place the cat owner in the first column and the person who bakes in the second column.

3. From the second condition, the person watching martial-arts movies cannot be on the same side as the person eating pepper, so we can place the martial-arts person in the second row and the pepper eater in the first row.

4. From the third condition, the Egyptian cannot be on the same side as the person doing biathlon, so we can place the Egyptian in the first column and the biathlon person in the second column.

5. Now we have placed 3 people (cat owner, biathlon person, and martial-arts person) and 3 things (food, hobby, and nationality). We still have 3 more things to place (pepper, baking, and Egyptian nationality for the second row, and pet, movie-genre, and sport for both rows).

6. Since the Egyptian is not eating pepper, the pepper eater must be the Colombian. So, we place pepper in the first row, second column, and Colombian in the first row, first column.

7. The remaining food, hobby, and nationality for the second row must be the ones that are not already placed. So, we place baking in the second row, second column, and Egyptian in the second row, first column.

8. The pet for the first row is the remaining one, which is the guinea-pig. The movie-genre for the first row is also the remaining one, which is superhero. The sport for the first row is also the remaining one, which is parkour.

9. The pet for the second row is the remaining one, which is the cat. The movie-genre for the second row is also the remaining one, which is martial-arts (since the person watching martial-arts movies is already placed). The sport for the second row is also the remaining one, which is biathlon (since the person doing biathlon is already placed).

Lv1-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different people, so we can fill the table with 2 rows.

2. We know there are 2 different favorite beverages, so let's label the columns with the beverages: Juice (J) and Soy-Milk (SM).

3. We know there are 2 different hobbies, so let's label the rows with the hobbies: Cooking (C) and Skydiving (S).

4. From the clues, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, the correct order is S and C.

5. Now, let's fill the hobby columns with the correct order:

   |               |      1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      |              |            |
   | Hobby         | Skydiving    | Cooking    |

6. We know there are 2 different jobs, so let's label the columns with the jobs: Bartender (B) and Firefighter (F).

7. From the clues, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the left of the bartender. Since the hobby of the left person is skydiving, the bartender must be on the right. So, the correct order is F and B.

8. Now, let's fill the job columns with the correct order:

   |               |      1       |     2      |

   | Job           | Firefighter  | Bartender  |

9. We know there are 2 different music-genres, so let's label the columns with the genres: Gospel (G) and Indie (I).

10. From the clues, we know that the fan of gospel is on the far right. Since the job of the right person is bartender, the gospel fan must be in the rightmost column.

11. Now, let's fill the music-genre columns with the correct order:

    |               |      1       |     2      |
    | Beverage      | Juice        | Soy-Milk   |

    | Music-Genre   | Indie        | Gospel     |

12. We know there are 2 different pets, so let's label the columns with the pets: Ferret (F) and Snake (S).

13. From the clues, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the music-genre of the right person is gospel, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in the leftmost column. So, the correct order is S and F.

14. Now, let's fill the pet columns with the correct order:

    |               |      1       |     2      |

15. We know there are 2 different sports, so let's label the columns with the sports: Snowboarding (SB) and Volleyball (VB).

16. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left, the correct order is SB and VB.

Lv1-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different movie-genres, and 2 different nationalities, we can place one of each in the first column (let's say Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality from left to right).

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Pepper    |
   | Hobby         | Drawing      | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Dancer      | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Musical   |
   | Nationality   | Chinese     | Mexican   |
   | Sport         | ___________ | _________|

2. From rule 1, the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. So, the sport column for the second row (Rock-climbing) must be parkour, and the sport column for the row below it (Dressmaker) must be something else (let's say Baseball).

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Pepper    |
   | Hobby         | Drawing      | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Dancer      | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Musical   |
   | Nationality   | Chinese     | Mexican   |
   | Sport         | Parkour     | Baseball  |

3. From rule 2, the person eating asparagus is on the right of the mexican. Since we already placed the mexican in the second column, the person eating asparagus must be in the third column. But we already placed the Dancer (who is on the left of the person eating asparagus) in the first column. So, the person eating asparagus must be in the first row, and the Dancer must be in the third row.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Pepper    |
   | Hobby         | Drawing      | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Dancer      | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Musical   |
   | Nationality   | Chinese     | Mexican   |
   | Sport         | Parkour     | Baseball  |

   Now, the Dancer is in the third row, so the person eating asparagus must be in the second row. But we already placed the Dressmaker in the second row. So, the person eating asparagus must be in the first row, and the Dressmaker must be in the third row. This is a contradiction, as we cannot have the Dressmaker in the third row because the person eating asparagus (who is on the left of the Dressmaker) must be in the second row.

   There seems to be an inconsistency in the rules provided, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.

However, if we make an assumption that the rules are not strictly enforced (for example, two people can have the same hobby, job, etc.), then we can solve the puzzle by assuming that the Dressmaker and the person eating asparagus can share the first row.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Pepper    |
   | Hobby         | Drawing      | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Dancer      | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Musical   |
   | Nationality   | Chinese     | Mexican   |
   | Sport         | Parkour     | Baseball  |

   In this case, the Dancer is in the third row, and the person eating asparagus and the Dressmaker are in the first row. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person eating pepper, so the fourth column must be Musical and the fifth column must be Pepper. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so the sixth column must be Parkour. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the mexican, so the second column must be Mexican. The remaining columns can be filled arbitrarily, as long as the same food, hobby, job, movie-genre, nationality, and sport are not repeated within a row.

   Here is one possible solution:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Pepper    |
   | Hobby         | Drawing      | Rock-climbing|
   | Job           | Dancer      | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Musical   |
   | Nationality   | Chinese     | Mexican   |
   | Sport         | Parkour     | Baseball  |

   This solution assumes that the rules are not strictly enforced and that the Dressmaker and the person eating asparagus can share the first row. If the rules are strictly enforced, then the puzzle cannot be solved as stated."
Lv1-6x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two nationalities (Malaysian and Polish), so we can fill one of the nationality columns with 'Malaysian' and the other with 'Polish'. Let's assume the Malaysian is on the left, so the first nationality column is 'Malaysian' and the second is 'Polish'.

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Food          |            |           |

4. The person eating potato is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since the hobby of hiking is on the left and the person watching adventure movies is on the right, the food column on the left must be 'potato'.

   | Food          | potato   |           |

5. The person on the left (eating potato) has two different music-genres to choose from (electronic and hip-hop). Since the person on the right (watching adventure movies) is the manager, the person on the left cannot be the manager. So, the person on the left must prefer 'hip-hop'.

6. Now, we are left with the person on the right. This person has two different hobbies (chess and hiking), two different jobs (manager and mechanic), and two different movie-genres (adventure and horror). Since the person on the left is the manager and the person on the left of the Polish is hiking, the person on the right must be a mechanic. Also, since the person on the left prefers hip-hop, the person on the right must prefer 'electronic'.

| Pet           |            |             |

4. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since filmmaking is in the second row, the hobby of the person on the left must be something other than filmmaking. Since there are only two hobbies, cooking must be in the second row, first column.

| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Documentary |
| Food          | Cooking    | Pumpkin    |

| Pet           |            |             |

5. The police-officer is on the far right, so the job of the person on the left must be paramedic.

| Pet           |            |             |

6. Since there are only two movie-genres, animation must be in the first row, second column.

| Pet           |            |             |

7. The last remaining pet, chinchilla, can go in any empty cell. Let's place it in the second row, second column.

Lv1-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different favorite beverages, so we can write them down in the first column:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      |       |       |
| Food          |       |       |
| Hobby         |       |       |
| Job           |       |       |
| Music-Genre   |       |       |
| Sport         |       |       |

2. Since the fan of reggae is on the right of the designer, we can place the designer in the first row and the reggae fan in the second row. Let's place reggae in the second row, so the music-genre column looks like this:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      |       |       |
| Food          |       |       |
| Hobby         |       | Reggae|
| Job           | Designer|       |
| Music-Genre   |       | Techno|
| Sport         |       |       |

3. Now, the fan of techno is the person eating carrot. Since we already placed the reggae fan, the carrot eater must be in the first row. Let's place carrot in the first row, so the food column looks like this:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      | Carrot|       |
| Food          |       |       |
| Hobby         |       | Reggae|
| Job           | Designer|       |
| Music-Genre   | Techno |       |
| Sport         |       |       |

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person drinking fanta. Since we already placed the reggae fan and the carrot eater, the fanta drinker must be in the second row. Let's place puzzles in the second row, so the hobby column looks like this:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      | Carrot|       |
| Food          | Asparagus|       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles|       |
| Job           | Designer|       |
| Music-Genre   | Techno |       |
| Sport         |       |       |

5. The person who's sport is handball is the person eating asparagus. Since we already placed the carrot eater and the fanta drinker, the asparagus eater must be in the first row. Let's place handball in the first row, so the sport column looks like this:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      | Carrot|       |
| Food          | Asparagus|       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles|       |
| Job           | Designer|       |
| Music-Genre   | Techno |       |
| Sport         | Handball|       |

6. The last job is the social-worker. Since the person with puzzles as a hobby is already placed, the social-worker must be in the second row. Let's place social-worker in the second row, so the job column looks like this:

|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      | Carrot|       |
| Food          | Asparagus|       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles|       |
| Job           | Designer| Social-worker|
| Music-Genre   | Techno |       |
| Sport         | Handball|       |

7. Now, we have filled all the columns except the juice column. Since there are two different types of food, the remaining food must be juice. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Fanta  | Juice |
| Beverage      | Carrot| Juice |
| Food          | Asparagus|       |
| Hobby         | Puzzles|       |
| Job           | Designer| Social-worker|
| Music-Genre   | Techno |       |
| Sport         | Handball|       |
#############"
Lv1-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, 2 nationalities, and 2 pets. So, each category will have one item on the left and one on the right.

2. The chef is on the far left (row 1, column 1). Let's place 'chef' in the first row, first column.

3. Since the chef is on the left, the job of the person on the right must be the other job, which is social-worker. So, let's place 'social-worker' in the first row, second column.

4. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk. Since we already placed the chef and social-worker, the only remaining option for mystery movies is the second row, first column. Let's place 'mystery' there. The person watching funk music must be on the right, so let's place 'funk' in the second row, second column.

5. The nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since we already placed the chef and social-worker, the only remaining option for the nationality of the person on the left is Italian. So, let's place 'Italian' in the first row, third column. The nigerian must be on the right, so let's place 'Nigerian' in the second row, third column.

6. The person with the chinchilla is to the left of the chef. Since we already placed the chef, the only remaining option for the pet on the right is mouse. So, let's place 'chinchilla' in the first row, fourth column. The person with the mouse must be on the left of the person with the chinchilla, which is the social-worker. So, let's place 'mouse' in the second row, fourth column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|  chef     | social-worker | mystery  | funk      | Italian | chinchilla |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
|  #########|               |          |           |         |            |
|           |  social-worker|          |           |         |            |
|           |              |  mystery |           |         |            |
|           |              |         |  funk     |         |            |
|           |              |         |          |  Italian | chinchilla  |
|           |              |         |          |         |            |
#############
```

The beverage and the pet are still missing. Since we have placed all other categories, we can fill in the beverages and pets based on the given information that there are 2 different beverages and 2 different pets. Let's place '7up' in the first row, fifth column and 'milk' in the second row, fifth column. Let's place 'mouse' in the first row, sixth column and 'chinchilla' in the second row, sixth column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|  chef     | social-worker | mystery  | funk      | Italian | 7up       |
|-----------|---------------|----------|-----------|---------|------------|
|  #########|               |          |           |         |            |
|           |  social-worker|          |           |         |            |
|           |              |  mystery |           |         |            |
|           |              |         |  funk     |         |            |
|           |              |         |          |  Italian | 7up         |
|  chef     |              |         |          |         |  mouse      |
