Lv1-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching sports movies is to the right of the fan of pop. So, let's place the sports fan in the last column (Column 5).

2. Since the fan of pop is to the right of the fan of jazz, and the sports fan is to the right of the fan of pop, we can place the fan of jazz in the fourth column (Column 4).

3. The fan of soul is on the far left, so it goes in the first column (Column 1).

4. The person watching disaster movies is in the middle, so it goes in the third column (Column 3).

5. The person watching musical movies is on the far left, but we already placed the fan of soul there. So, let's place the musical fan in the second column (Column 2).

6. Now, the fan of dubstep must be to the right of the fan of soul, but not in the last column because the sports fan is there. So, it goes in the fourth column (Column 4).

7. Finally, the only place left for the indie fan is the first column (Column 1).

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Soul    |   Indie   |   Disaster   |   Dubstep    |   Sports    |
|----------|----------|-------------|-------------|------------|

Lv1-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This means that soy-milk cannot be in the last column (column 5) because sprite is in the last row (row 5). So, soy-milk can only be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of indie. Since indie cannot be in the first column (column 1) because almond-milk is in the middle (row 3), indie can only be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. This means almond-milk can only be in columns 1, 2, or 4.

3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta cannot be in the last column (column 5) because almond-milk is in the middle (row 3), fanta can only be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. This means almond-milk can only be in columns 1 or 4.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is in the middle (row 3). So, almond-milk must be in column 3.

5. Now we know that almond-milk is in column 3 and row 3. This means almond-milk drinker is listening to rock (since rock is in row 5 and column 3 is occupied by almond-milk).

6. Since the fan of rock is the person drinking sprite, sprite must be in the last row (row 5).

7. The person drinking coffee is the fan of metal. Since metal cannot be in the first row (row 1) because coffee is in the middle (row 3), metal can only be in rows 2, 4, or 5. Since metal cannot be in row 5 (because sprite is there), and it cannot be in row 4 (because almond-milk is in the middle of that row), metal must be in row 2.

8. The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in row 2, r&b can only be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Since r&b cannot be in column 5 (because sprite is there), and it cannot be in column 3 (because almond-milk is there), r&b must be in column 4.

9. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since soy-milk is in column 2, fanta must be in column 1.

10. The only beverage left is Fanta, which goes in the first row (row 1).

So, the final solution table is:

2. The person with the hobby of reading is to the left of the nurse. So, the reading person must be in the first position (column 1).

   |         |     1     |       2       |    3    |    4    |     5     |

3. The social-worker is to the right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman can't be in the last position (column 5) due to the paramedic being there, the fisherman must be in the fourth position (column 4).

   |         |     1     |       2       |    3    |    4    |     5     |

4. The person with the hobby of baking is to the left of the person with the hobby of reading. Since reading is in the first position, baking must be in the sixth position (column 6).

6. The writer is to the right of the person with the hobby of baking. Since baking is in the sixth position, writer must be in the fifth position (column 5). But we already placed Sudoku there. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the hobby ""Sudoku"" and ""Writer"" are the same hobby, the puzzle can be solved:

   |         |     1     |       2       |    3    |    4    |     5     |     6    |

7. The paramedic is on the far right. Since the last position (column 6) is already filled with Baking, the paramedic can't be placed. This is another contradiction, indicating that there is an error in the puzzle.

In conclusion, there seems to be an inconsistency in the given puzzle, and it cannot be solved as stated."

   - Sport: [Badminton, Baseball, Cricket, Volleyball, Handball]
   - Transport: [Car, Helicopter, Quad-bike, Roller, Skateboard]

2. The person driving the car is on the far right, so it must be in the fifth column. Since the roller is in the third column, the order of sports becomes:
   - Sport: [Badminton, Baseball, Cricket, Volleyball, Handball]
   - Transport: [Car, Helicopter, Quad-bike, Roller, Skateboard]

3. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the roller, so it must be in the second column. Since the car is in the fifth column, the order of sports becomes:
   - Sport: [Badminton, Baseball, Quad-bike, Volleyball, Handball]
   - Transport: [Car, Quad-bike, Helicopter, Roller, Skateboard]

4. The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's sport is cricket. So, cricket must be in the second column. Let's rearrange the sports based on this information:
   - Sport: [Badminton, Baseball, Cricket, Volleyball, Handball]
   - Transport: [Car, Cricket, Helicopter, Roller, Skateboard]

5. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. So, volleyball must be in the fourth column and baseball in the third column. Let's rearrange the sports based on this information:

   - Transport: [Skateboard, Car, Cricket, Baseball, Helicopter]

7. Now we have the correct order of sports. To find the correct order of transport, we can simply follow the order of sports:

Lv1-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the water-polo player is on the left of the teacher, so we can place the teacher in the 2nd, 4th, or 5th position, and the water-polo player in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place the teacher in the 4th position for now. This means the water-polo player is in the 5th position.

2. The person who plays rugby is on the right of the person who plays soccer. Since the soccer player can't be in the 5th position (because the water-polo player is there), the soccer player can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. Let's place the soccer player in the 1st position for now. This means the rugby player is in the 3rd position.

3. The water-polo player is on the right of the tennis player. Since the water-polo player is in the 5th position, the tennis player can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th position. Let's place the tennis player in the 2nd position for now.

4. The teacher is on the left of the rugby player. Since the teacher is in the 4th position and the rugby player is in the 3rd position, this condition is satisfied.

5. The rugby player is on the right of the soccer player. Since the rugby player is in the 3rd position and the soccer player is in the 1st position, this condition is satisfied.

6. The chef is on the right of the engineer. Since we haven't placed any jobs in the 1st and 2nd positions yet, we can't satisfy this condition yet. Let's place the engineer in the 1st position for now. This means the chef is in the 3rd position.

7. The person who plays ice-hockey is on the right of the scientist. Since we haven't placed any jobs in the 4th and 5th positions yet, we can't satisfy this condition yet. Let's place the scientist in the 4th position for now. This means the ice-hockey player is in the 5th position.

At this point, we have satisfied all the conditions except for the chef and the scientist being on the right of the engineer and the ice-hockey player, respectively. However, we can't place the engineer and the scientist in the 1st and 4th positions because the chef and the ice-hockey player haven't been placed yet.

Let's try placing the soccer player in the 2nd position instead of the 1st position. This means the rugby player is in the 4th position, the water-polo player is in the 5th position, and the soccer player is in the 2nd position.

Now, we can place the engineer in the 1st position, the chef in the 3rd position, the scientist in the 4th position, and the ice-hockey player in the 5th position. This satisfies all the conditions.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of house is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Let's place the fan of house in the first column and the person who's hobby is camping in the second column. So, the first two columns are filled as follows:

   | Hobby         | House | Camping |
   | Music-Genre   |      |         |

2. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks goes in the third column.

   | Hobby         | House | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   |      |         |             |

3. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right. Since we already have three hobbies filled, dancing must be in the fifth column.

   | Hobby         | House | Camping | Magic-tricks | Dancing |
   | Music-Genre   |      |         |             |         |

4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left. Since we already have four hobbies filled, photography must be in the first column.

   | Hobby         | Photography | Camping | Magic-tricks | Dancing |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         |             |         |

5. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical must be on the left of the fan of rock, and we already have the fan of classical in the first column, the fan of rock must be in the second column.

   | Hobby         | Photography | Classical (Woodworking) | Camping | Magic-tricks | Dancing |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock       |                       |         |             |         |

6. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie must be in the third column, the music-genre for the person who's hobby is photography is indie.

   | Hobby         | Photography (Photography) | Classical (Woodworking) | Indie (Photography) | Camping | Magic-tricks | Dancing |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock               |                       |                     |         |             |         |

7. The only remaining hobby is dancing, and it's already in the fifth column. The only remaining music-genre is blues, so the person who's hobby is dancing must be a fan of blues.

   | Hobby         | Photography (Photography) | Classical (Woodworking) | Indie (Photography) | Blues (Dancing) | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock               |                       |                     |              |         |             |

8. We have filled all the hobbies and music-genres, so the final solution table is:

   | Hobby         | Photography | Classical (Woodworking) | Indie (Photography) | Blues (Dancing) | House | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock       |                       |                     |              |      |         |             |

   But since the hobbies and music-genres are repeated, we can rearrange the table to avoid repetition:

   | Hobby         | Photography | Woodworking | Indie | Dancing | House | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock       | Classical  |      | Blues   |      |         |             |

   So, the final solution table is:

   | Hobby         | Photography | Woodworking | Indie | Dancing | House | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock       | Classical  |      | Blues   | House | Camping | Magic-tricks |

Lv1-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the fish is on the left of the Argentine. So, the possible positions for the Argentine and the Fish are:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Fish | Argentine | ... | ... | ... |

   Since there are 5 nationalities, the others must be in the remaining positions. So, the Nationalities are:
   - 2: British (since the Goldfish is to the left of the British)
   - 3: Italian (since the Italian is to the left of the Goldfish)
   - 4: American (since the owner of the Frog is the American and the American is on the left of the owner of the Dog)
   - 5: Nigerian (since there's no other nationality left)

2. Now we know the Nationalities, we can find the Pets. The Goldfish is in the middle, so it's in position 3.
   - 1: Fish (already known)
   - 2: Dog (since the owner of the Dog is on the left of the American)
   - 3: Goldfish (already known)
   - 4: Frog (since the American is the owner of the Frog)
   - 5: Rat (since there's no other pet left)

The final solution table is:

  |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|---|
  | Nationality | Fish | Argentine | Goldfish | American | Nigerian |
  | Pet        | Dog  | Fish     | Goldfish | Frog     | Rat      |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Nationality | Fish | Argentine | Goldfish | American | Nigerian |
| Pet        | Dog  | Fish     | Goldfish | Frog     | Rat      |
