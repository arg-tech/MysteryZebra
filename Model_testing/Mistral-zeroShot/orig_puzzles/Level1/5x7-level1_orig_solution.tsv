Lv1-5x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's place the people with unique conditions:
   - The person eating kiwi is on the far left (position 1)
   - The Australian is on the far left (position 1, since the kiwi eater is already there) and the sport of cricket is on the far left (position 3, since the kiwi eater is in position 1). So, cricket is the sport of the Australian.
   - The nigerian is in the middle (position 4)
   - The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the nurse (position 5, since the nurse is on the right of the fan of classical, which we'll place later). So, volleyball is in position 5.
   - The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (let's place swimming in position 6 for now). So, climbing is in position 7. Since the banana eater is on the right of the designer, the banana eater must be in position 8 (designer is in position 2, as we'll see later). So, climbing is the sport of the banana eater.

2. Now, let's place the people with more conditions:
   - The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is in position 6, pumpkin is in position 8.
   - The person eating corn is in the middle (position 3).
   - The manager is on the left of the dancer. Since the dancer is the fan of soul (we'll place soul later), the manager is on the left of soul (position 2).
   - The fan of disco is the pilot. Since the pilot must be on the right of someone (condition 18), and the only empty position on the right is position 7, disco must be in position 6.
   - The fan of ambient is on the right of the chinese. Since the chinese is in position 5 (nurse is on the right of the chinese), ambient must be in position 4.
   - The fan of indie is on the left of the indonesian. Since the indonesian is in position 7 (reggae is on the left of the indonesian, we'll place reggae later), indie must be in position 6.
   - The fan of soul is the dancer. Since the dancer is in position 2, soul is in position 1.
   - The fan of reggae is on the left of the indonesian. Since indie is in position 6 and indie is on the left of the indonesian, reggae must be in position 5.
   - The fan of classical is on the right of the nurse. Since the nurse is in position 5, classical must be in position 6.
   - The Egyptian is on the right of the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep is in position 6, the Egyptian must be in position 7.

3. Now, let's place the remaining people:
   - The person eating watermelon is the musician (condition 21). Since the musician is on the right of the Egyptian (condition 15), the watermelon eater is in position 7.
   - The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the Australian (condition 14). Since the Australian is in position 1, the grapefruit eater is in position 2.
   - The designer is on the left of the banana eater (condition 7). Since the banana eater is in position 8, the designer is in position 7.
   - The coach is the only job left. Since the coach must be on the right of someone, the only available position on the right is position 6.
