Lv1-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the security-guard is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with the jobs: `######### | Journalist | Security-Guard | Teacher ###########`

2. The teacher is watching time-travel movies, so the middle column can be filled with `######### | Journalist | Security-Guard | Time-Travel ###########`

3. Since the person driving the snowmobile is in the middle, the middle row must have `Snowmobile`. But we already know the middle row is `Security-Guard`, so the snowmobile cannot be in the middle. Therefore, the snowmobile must be in the first or the third row.

4. The person driving the scooter is the teacher, so the third row must have `Scooter`. But the teacher is already in the middle, so the scooter must be in the first row. Thus, the first row is `Scooter | ########### | ###########`.

5. The fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the teacher is watching time-travel movies, the person watching thriller movies must be in the second column. So, the second row must have `Thriller` and the second column must have `Techno`. Thus, the second row is `######### | Techno | ###########`.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right. Since the fan of techno is in the second column, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the third column. But the third column already has `Teacher` and `Time-Travel`, so iced-tea cannot be in the third column. Therefore, iced-tea must be in the first column. Thus, the first row is `Scooter | Iced-Tea | ###########`.

7. The fan of ambient is on the far right. Since iced-tea is in the first column, the fan of ambient must be in the third column. But the third column already has `Teacher` and `Time-Travel`, so ambient cannot be in the third column. Therefore, there is a contradiction with this condition.

So, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle as stated. The condition about the fan of ambient being on the far right cannot be satisfied with the other conditions.

Here is the table up to the point where we found the contradiction:

  | Beverage      | Almond-Milk | Iced-Tea   | Juice      |
  | Job           |            |            |           |
  | Movie-Genre   |            | Thriller   |           |
  | Music-Genre   |            | Techno     |           |
  | Transport     | Scooter     |           | Snowmobile |

The positions for the job, the remaining movie-genre, and the remaining music-genre are still unknown due to the contradiction."
Lv1-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and pets. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. From point 1, we know that the lizard owner is on the left of the musical movie watcher, so they must be in the first and second columns respectively. Since the entrepreneur is the lizard owner (point 7), he must be in the first column. So, let's assign him job 1 (entrepreneur) in the first row.

3. The entrepreneur is argentine (point 4), so the argentine must be in the first column. Since the nationalities are unique, we can assign the second and third columns to french and russian respectively.

4. The person watching horror movies is the fan of disco (point 3), so the disco fan must be in the first row. Since the disco fan is argentine (point 4), the horror movie watcher cannot be the entrepreneur (already assigned in the first row). Therefore, the horror movie watcher must be in the second or third row. Let's assume he is in the second row for now. So, we can assign the second row to horror movies and the third row to musical movies.

5. The fan of electronic is on the far right (point 2), so he must be in the third column. Since the music genres are unique, we can assign the first and second columns to disco and metal respectively.

6. The owner of the bird is in the middle (point 5), so he must be in the second row. Since the nationalities are unique, the bird owner cannot be the argentine (already assigned in the first row), so he must be french or russian. Let's assume he is french for now. So, we can assign the second column to the bird owner (freelancer) and the third column to the paramedic (who is on the left of the freelancer, point 8).

7. Now, the only remaining nationality is russian, so it must be in the third column. Since the russian cannot be the horror movie watcher (already assigned in the second row), he must be the paramedic (who is in the third column).

8. The only remaining job is paramedic, so it must be in the third row. Since the paramedic is russian (point 9), the musical movie watcher must be the freelancer (who is in the second row).

9. The only remaining music genre is metal, so it must be in the second column. Since the metal fan cannot be the disco fan (already assigned in the first row), he must be the entrepreneur (who is in the first row).

10. The only remaining movie genre is thriller, so it must be in the third row. Since the thriller fan cannot be the horror movie watcher (already assigned in the second row), he must be the paramedic (who is in the third row).

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Job           | entrepreneur | freelancer| paramedic |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |    thriller|
| Music-Genre   |              |   metal   | electronic |
| Nationality   |              |   french  |     russian|
| Pet           |              |           |     lizard |
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv1-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis, and the American can't be on the far left (because the person drinking 7up is), the American can only be in the second position. Let's place the American in the second row, second column (A2).

2. Since the American is on the right of the fan of electronic, the fan of electronic must be in the first column. Let's place the fan of electronic in the first row, first column (B1).

3. Since the American is on the right of the person driving the helicopter, the person driving the helicopter must be in the second column. Let's place the person driving the helicopter in the second row, third column (A3).

4. Since the person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking milk, the person drinking milk must be in the first column. Let's place the person drinking milk in the first row, second column (B2).

5. Since the person drinking 7up is on the far left, it must be in the first row, first column (B1).

6. Since the Italian is on the left of the fan of punk, the fan of punk must be in the second column. Let's place the fan of punk in the second row, first column (A1).

7. Since the person who's sport is climbing is the person driving the taxi, and the American is on the right of the person driving the taxi, the person driving the taxi must be in the third column. The only sport left for the person in the second row is swimming, so let's place the person driving the taxi in the second row, third column (B3).

8. The only sport left for the person in the third row is tennis, so let's place the person playing tennis in the third row, first column (C1).

9. The only music genre left for the person in the second column is blues, so let's place the person listening to blues in the second row, second column (B2).

10. The only nationality left for the person in the third column is Malaysian, so let's place the Malaysian in the third row, third column (C3).

11. The only means of transport left is the trike, so let's place the person riding the trike in the first row, third column (B3).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column will have unique values.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is not on the far left (due to condition 6), the hobby of the person on the far left must be reading. Let's place 'reading' in the first column, first row.

3. The person with the hobby of puzzles cannot be on the far right (due to condition 1), so the hobby of the person on the far right must be chess or sport. Since the person with the hobby of chess is also the one who does skateboarding (due to condition 3), the hobby of the person on the far right must be sport. Let's place 'sport' in the third column, third row.

4. Now, the hobby of the person in the middle must be puzzles. Let's place 'puzzles' in the second column, first row.

5. Now, let's place the jobs. Since the librarian is on the far left (due to condition 6), we can place 'librarian' in the first column, second row. The scientist is on the far right (due to condition 4), so we can place 'scientist' in the third column, second row. The remaining job must be 'journalist', so we can place it in the second column, third row.

6. Now, let's place the music-genres. Since the fan of house is on the left of the owner of the rabbit (due to condition 5), and the owner of the rabbit prefers electronic (due to condition 2), the fan of house must be in the first column, first or third row. Since the person with the hobby of reading is on the left of the person who's sport is golf (due to condition 8), the fan of house cannot be in the first row. So, the fan of house must be in the third row, first or second column. However, since the fan of house is not on the far left (due to condition 6), it must be in the second column, third row. Let's place 'house' there. The fan of d&b must be in the first row, first or third column, but since the person with the hobby of reading is on the left of the person who's sport is golf (due to condition 8), the fan of d&b cannot be in the first column. So, the fan of d&b must be in the third column, first row. Let's place 'd&b' there. The fan of electronic must be in the second column, first row. Let's place 'electronic' there.

7. Now, let's place the pets. Since the owner of the snake is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (due to condition 1), and the hobby of the person on the far right is sport (as we determined earlier), the owner of the snake must be in the third column, second row. Since the owner of the rabbit is the fan of electronic (due to condition 2), the owner of the rabbit must be in the second column, first row. The remaining pet must be a pony, so it can be placed in the first column, third row.

8. Finally, let's place the sports. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is chess (due to condition 3), the sport of skateboarding can be placed in the third row, second column. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left (due to condition 7), the sport of snowboarding can be placed in the first column, third row. The remaining sport must be golf, so it can be placed in the second column, third row.

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Hobby         | reading     | puzzles   |     chess     |
| Job           | librarian  | scientist |     journalist |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        | electronic |     house      |
| Pet           | pony       | rabbit    |     snake      |
| Sport         | snowboarding| skateboarding| golf          |

Lv1-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the scientist is on the right of the hiker, and the lawyer is on the right of the software-developer, we can place the hiker, lawyer, and software-developer in the first, second, and third positions respectively in one row.

2. The dutch is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, so the sudoku player cannot be in the first or third position. Therefore, the sudoku player must be in the second position, which means the dutch is in the third position.

3. The brazilian is the person driving the jet-ski, so the jet-ski driver must be the brazilian. Since the brazilian is not in the first or third position, the jet-ski driver (brazilian) must be in the second position. This means the hobby of the first position is hiking, the nationality is dutch, and the transport is jet-ski.

4. The person eating cherry is in the middle, so the cherry eater is in the second position. This means the food of the first and third positions are blueberry and either cabbage or nothing (if the third position is empty).

5. The lawyer is in the first position, so the job of the third position is either scientist or software-developer. Since the software-developer is the motorbike driver, the third position cannot be software-developer. Therefore, the third position is the scientist.

6. The only remaining food for the third position is cabbage, so the third position is cabbage.

7. The only remaining job for the first position is scientist.

8. The only remaining transport for the first position is car, and the only remaining transport for the third position is motorbike.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |         1          |   2    |     3     |
| Food          |   blueberry        | cherry |  cabbage  |
| Hobby         |   hiking          | sudoku |  ######## |
| Job           |   scientist       | lawyer |  software-developer |
| Nationality   |   dutch           | brazilian|  american |
| Transport     |   car            | jet-ski | motorbike |

Lv1-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Brazilian is eating avocado, we can place the avocado in the second column and the Brazilian in the second row. Let's place them in position (2,2).

2. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in position (2,2), the person drinking coffee should be in position (2,3).

3. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle. Since there are only three positions, the lemonade should be in position (1,2).

4. The person eating nectarine is the person driving the skateboard. Since the nectarine is in position (1,2), the skateboard should be in the hands of the person in position (1,2).

5. The Egyptian is the person drinking soy-milk. Since there are only three beverages, the soy-milk should be in position (3, _). But we know that the Egyptian is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the Brazilian is in position (2,2) and the person drinking coffee is in position (2,3), the only position left for the Egyptian is (3,1).

6. The person driving the subway is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the Egyptian is the owner of the pony, the subway should be in the hands of the person in position (2, _). But we know that the person drinking coffee is in position (2,3), so the subway should be in position (2,1).

7. The person eating potato is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the Egyptian is the owner of the pony and is in position (3,1), the only position left for the potato is (3,3).

Lv1-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Brazilian is a fan of metal, so let's place the metal fan in the Nationality column. Since the fan of metal can't be on the far left (due to condition 5), the metal fan must be in the middle or the far right. If the metal fan were in the middle, the conditions 8 and 6 would conflict, so the metal fan must be on the far right. Let's place the metal fan in the Nationality column at position 3 (Malaysian and Chinese are left, Brazilian is on the right).

2. Since the metal fan is on the far right, the banana eater must be on the far left or the middle. If the banana eater were on the far left, the conditions 1 and 3 would conflict, so the banana eater must be in the middle. Let's place the banana eater in the Food column at position 2 (Lime and Nectarine are left, Banana is in the middle).

3. Now we know the banana eater is in the middle, so the card-games hobby must be on the far right. Since the entrepreneur is on the left of the fan of disco (condition 4), the entrepreneur can't be on the far right. Therefore, the entrepreneur must be on the far left. Let's place the entrepreneur in the Job column at position 1 (Coach and Designer are left, Entrepreneur is on the far left).

4. Now we know the entrepreneur is on the far left, so the card-games hobby must be on the far right. Let's place the card-games hobby in the Hobby column at position 3.

5. Since the entrepreneur is on the far left, the fan of disco must be on the far right. Let's place the fan of disco in the Music-Genre column at position 3 (Disco, Metal, R&B from left to right).

6. Now we know the fan of disco is on the far right, so the filmmaking hobby must be in the middle. Let's place the filmmaking hobby in the Hobby column at position 2.

7. Since the fan of disco is on the far right, the coach must be on the left of the fan of disco (condition 9). Since the entrepreneur is on the far left, the coach must be on the middle. Let's place the coach in the Job column at position 2.

8. Now we know the coach is in the middle, so the remaining job (Designer) must be on the far left. Let's place the designer in the Job column at position 1.

9. Since the designer is on the far left, the remaining food (Nectarine) must be on the far right. Let's place the nectarine in the Food column at position 3.

Lv1-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of animation is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Let's put it in the first row as well, since we don't have any other constraints for this cell yet.

   |       | musical    | r&b        |            | van       |

2. The Colombian watches comedy movies, so we can place them in the second row and second column.

   |       | musical    | r&b        |            | van       |

3. The fan of indie is in the middle, so it should be in the third row. Since it's also on the left of the person driving the roller, the roller must be in the fourth column of the third row.
