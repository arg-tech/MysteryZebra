Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is on the far left, we can fill the first column with 'bartender'.

|       | bartender |       2        |     3     |      4       |   5   |   6    |
| Job   |           |                |           |              |       |        |

2. The lawyer is on the right of the nurse, so the nurse cannot be in the last column. Also, the lawyer cannot be in the first column because the lawyer is on the right of the nurse and the nurse is already in the second column. So, the lawyer can only be in the third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's assume the lawyer is in the third column for now.

|       | bartender | nurse      | lawyer     |      4       |   5   |   6    |
| Job   |           |            |            |              |       |        |

3. The security-guard is on the left of the architect, so the architect cannot be in the first column. The architect can be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Let's assume the architect is in the sixth column for now.

|       | bartender | nurse      | lawyer     |   architect |   5   |   6    |
| Job   |           |            |            |             |       |        |

4. Now, the nurse is on the right of the videographer. The nurse is in the second column, so the videographer can only be in the first column.

|       | bartender | nurse      | lawyer     | architect   | videographer |   6    |
| Job   |           |            |            |             |             |        |

5. We have filled all the jobs except for the fifth column. Since there are only 5 jobs and we have filled 4, the fifth column must contain the remaining job, which is 'security-guard'.

|       | bartender | nurse      | lawyer     | architect   | security-guard |   6    |
| Job   |           |            |            |             |             |        |

6. Now, we have filled all the jobs. Let's check the conditions again:
- The lawyer is on the far right, and he is in the third column. Check.
- The lawyer is on the right of the nurse, and he is to the right of the nurse. Check.
- The nurse is on the right of the videographer, and she is to the right of the videographer. Check.
- The security-guard is on the left of the architect, and the security-guard is to the left of the architect. Check.
- The bartender is on the far left, and the bartender is in the first column. Check.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| bartender | nurse      | lawyer     | architect   | security-guard |

1. We know that gardening is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column.

   | Gardening |   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, we can place camping in the second column from the right.

   | Gardening |   | Camping |   |   |   |   |

3. Now, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping, so we can place filmmaking in the third column from the right.

   | Gardening |   | Camping | Film Making |   |   |   |

4. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, so we can place writing in the second column.

   | Gardening | Writing | Camping | Film Making |   |   |   |

5. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku, so we can place drawing in the first column.

   | Drawing | Gardening | Writing | Camping | Film Making |   |   |

6. Finally, the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing, so we can place sudoku in the second column.

   | Drawing | Sudoku | Gardening | Writing | Camping | Film Making |   |

7. Now, we have filled all the hobbies, so we can put '#############' around the table to indicate the final solution.

Lv1-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that cycling is on the far left (row 1, column 1).

2. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the far right, skateboarding must be in the last column (column 6).

3. Now, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, weightlifting must be in the column to the left of skateboarding (column 5).

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since skiing is to the left of baseball (rule 3), and we know the positions of skateboarding and weightlifting, lacrosse must be in the column to the left of skiing (column 4).

5. Finally, the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we know the positions of skateboarding, weightlifting, lacrosse, and cycling, baseball must be in the first column (column 1).

6. The remaining sport, cycling, is already placed in the first row (column 1).

7. Now, let's place the sports in the rows. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left, baseball must be in the first row.

8. The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left, so cycling must be in the first row. This means that baseball and cycling must switch places, so baseball is in row 2 and cycling is in row 1.

9. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of baseball, so skiing must be in row 3.

10. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of skiing, so lacrosse must be in row 4.

11. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting, so skateboarding must be in row 5.

12. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of skateboarding, so weightlifting must be in row 6.

Lv1-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies, and the person watching scientific movies is on the far left, we can place 'Scientific' in the first column and 'Spy' in the second column. Let's fill the time-travel movies in the third column, as it must be to the right of 'Spy' and 'Romance'.

2. Now, the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching scientific movies, so 'Crime' goes in the fourth column. Since 'Zombie' is to the right of 'Crime', it goes in the fifth column.

3. The person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies, so 'Romance' goes in the sixth column.

4. Finally, the only genre left is 'Zombie', which was placed in the fifth column.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv1-1x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the lizard is on the far left (5) and the owner of the mouse is to its right (4), we can place the lizard in the first position and the mouse in the second position.

2. The owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the mouse (1), so the turtle cannot be in the first two positions. Let's assume the turtle is in the third position.

3. The owner of the dog is on the far right (2), so the dog must be in the sixth position.

4. The owner of the bird is to the left of the owner of the ferret (3), so the bird cannot be in the first, second, or sixth positions. Let's assume the bird is in the fourth position.

5. The owner of the ferret cannot be in the first position (since the bird is to its right), second position (since the mouse is to its left), or sixth position (since the dog is to its right). So, the ferret must be in the fifth position.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Lizard   | Mouse | Turtle |   Bird  |   Ferret |   Dog   |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv1-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching superhero movies is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column (1).

2. Since the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies, and the superhero movie is on the far left, the horror movie must be in the second column (2).

3. Now, the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person watching romance movies. So, the romance movie must be in the third column (3).

4. The person watching martial-arts movies is to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since we have placed horror, adventure, and romance, the only available positions for martial-arts are the fourth (4) and sixth (6) columns. However, since the person watching horror is on the right of the person watching adventure, martial-arts cannot be in the sixth column (6), so it must be in the fourth column (4).

5. Now, the person watching comedy movies must be in the fifth column (5), as it is to the right of the person watching martial-arts and to the right of the person watching adventure (which is already on the right of comedy according to point 5 of the puzzle).

6. Finally, the only remaining genre is romance, which must be in the third column (3), as it is to the right of horror (2) and to the left of adventure (1).

The final solution table is:

Lv1-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the lizard is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 6).

2. The ferret is to the left of the hedgehog, so the ferret cannot be in the last column (since the lizard is there). The hedgehog cannot be in the first column because the owner of the ferret must be to its left. So, let's place the hedgehog in the second column. This means the ferret must be in the first column.

3. The owner of the lizard is to the right of the owner of the fish. Since the lizard is in the last column, the fish cannot be in the last column either. The fish cannot be in the first column because the turtle is to the left of the fish, and the turtle cannot be in the second column because the hedgehog is there. So, let's place the fish in the third column. This means the turtle must be in the second-to-last column (column 5).

4. The owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the fish. This condition is already satisfied because we placed the turtle in the second-to-last column and the fish in the third column.

5. The owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the hedgehog is in the second column, the chinchilla must be in the fourth column.

Now, let's put the pets in their respective columns:

|       |   1    |    2     |     3      |   4    |  5   |   6    |

Lv1-1x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the salsa fan is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 6).

2. The gospel fan is to the left of the classical fan. Since we already have the salsa fan on the right, the classical fan must be in the first column (column 1). So, we can place gospel in the second column (column 2).

3. The indie fan is to the right of the jazz fan. Since we have the classical fan in the first column and the salsa fan in the last column, the jazz fan must be in the second last column (column 5). So, we can place indie in the third column (column 3).

4. The r&b fan is to the left of the gospel fan, so it must be in the first four columns. Since we have already placed classical, salsa, and indie, the only available spot for r&b in the first four columns is the fourth column (column 4).

5. Now, we have placed all the fans. Here is the final solution table:

3. The person with the hobby of singing is to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games. Since we already have two hobbies in the first two columns, the hobby of singing must be in the third column: `[Chess | Video-games | Singing]`.

4. The person with the hobby of puzzles is to the left of the person with the hobby of baking. Since we have three hobbies in the first three columns, the hobby of puzzles must be in the fourth column: `[Chess | Video-games | Singing | Puzzles]`.

5. The person with the hobby of drawing is to the right of the person with the hobby of baking. Since we have four hobbies in the first four columns, the hobby of drawing must be in the fifth column: `[Chess | Video-games | Singing | Puzzles | Drawing]`.
