Lv1-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the favorite beverages, foods, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and sports. We also have the relationships between them.

2. Let's start with the people's nationalities. Since there are three nationalities, we can place them in the first three columns from left to right (German, Russian, Spanish).

3. The paramedic is on the right of the Spanish, so the paramedic must be in the third column. Let's assume the paramedic is Spanish (which is incorrect, but we'll see why later). This means the paramedic is in the third row, and the Spanish is in the first row.

4. The person watching sports movies is the paramedic, so the first row must be sports. However, this contradicts our assumption that the paramedic is Spanish, as the first row is already occupied. So, the paramedic cannot be Spanish.

5. Let's try placing the paramedic in the second row. This means the first row is the sport of basketball (since the German is on the right of the person who plays basketball). The second row is the paramedic, and the third row is the Spanish.

6. The person watching sports movies is the paramedic, so the second row must be sports. This means the first row is basketball, the second row is paramedic (watching sports), and the third row is the Spanish.

7. The paramedic is on the right of the fan of ambient. Since the paramedic is in the second row, the fan of ambient must be in the third row. This means the third row cannot be Spanish (as we already placed the Spanish in the third row). So, the fan of ambient must be the German.

8. The fan of blues is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the German is the fan of ambient, the person drinking almond-milk must be in the second row. This means the second row cannot be the paramedic (as we already placed the paramedic in the second row). So, the person drinking almond-milk must be the entrepreneur.

9. The person who's sport is badminton is the person watching scientific movies. Since the first row is basketball and the second row is the entrepreneur (drinking almond-milk), the third row must be badminton and scientific movies.

10. The person eating peas is the person drinking tea. Since the German is the fan of ambient and the entrepreneur is drinking almond-milk, the first row must be peas and tea.

11. The person eating orange is on the right of the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in the first row and the third row is badminton and scientific movies, the second row must be orange.

12. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the second row is the entrepreneur (drinking almond-milk) and the third row is badminton and scientific movies, the first row must be fantasy movies.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |       Fantasy   |      Sports     |     Badminton   |
| Beverage      |              Tea |              Almond-milk |              Lemonade |
| Food          |              Orange |              Peas |              Spinach |
| Job           |              Doctor |              Paramedic |              Entrepreneur |
| Movie-Genre   |              Fantasy |              Sports |              Scientific |
| Music-Genre   |              Ambient |              Blues |              D&B |
| Nationality   |              German |              Spanish |              Russian |
| Sport         |              Basketball |              Badminton |              Climbing |

The final table has the correct order of nationalities, but the paramedic is incorrectly placed as Spanish. However, the given conditions do not provide a unique solution for the paramedic's nationality."
Lv1-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Italian is in the middle, we can place the nationalities in the first, middle, and last positions. Let's assume the nationalities are in the order: Italian (3), Egyptian (1), Nigerian (2).

2. The person who's hobby is traveling is the person who's sport is badminton. Since badminton is on the far right (7), the hobby of traveling must be in the first, second, or third row. As traveling is not in the first row (hobbies), it must be in the second row. So, the hobbies are in the order: hiking (1), traveling (2), photography (3).

3. The person driving the tram is in the middle. As the nationalities are already placed, the person driving the tram must be in the second row. Since the tram is a means of transport, it must be in the last column. So, the transport is in the order: skateboard (1), tram (3), van (2).

4. The person who's hobby is photography is the owner of the pony. As photography is in the second row (4), the pony owner must be in the third column. So, the pets are in the order: cat (1), hamster (2), pony (3).

5. The chef is on the far left. As the nationalities are already placed, the chef must be in the first row. So, the jobs are in the order: chef (1), journalist (2), teacher (3).

6. The nigerian is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. As the nationalities and sports are already placed, the nigerian must be in the first row. So, the nationalities are indeed in the correct order.

7. The person who's sport is tennis is on the far right. As sports are already placed, the person watching western movies must be in the second column. So, the movie-genres are in the order: mystery (1), scientific (2), western (3).

8. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person watching western movies. As hobbies and movie-genres are already placed, the photographer must be in the first column.

9. The journalist is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. As the journalist is already placed, the person watching mystery movies must be in the third column.

10. The teacher is the owner of the cat. As jobs and pets are already placed, the teacher must be in the third row.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | photography | hiking    | traveling  |

Lv1-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows.

2. We know the favorite beverages, food, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, and transport. We can fill in the first column with these details.

3. From point 1, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is not drinking almond-milk (since the snowmobile driver is on the left of the almond-milk drinker). So, the snowmobile driver can be either 7up or mirinda. Let's assume the snowmobile driver is drinking 7up. This means the almond-milk drinker is on the right of the snowmobile driver, and the mirinda drinker is on the far right.

4. The superhero movie watcher is on the far left (point 2), and the superhero movie watcher is drinking mirinda (point 6). So, the mirinda drinker is on the far left.

5. The spy movie watcher is on the right of the 7up drinker (point 3), and the 7up drinker cannot be the snowmobile driver (as decided in step 3). So, the 7up drinker must be the person in the middle. This means the spy movie watcher is on the far right.

6. The broccoli eater is on the far right (point 5), and the lime eater's owner is on the left of the broccoli eater (point 8). So, the lime eater is on the left, and the broccoli eater is on the far right.

7. The dressmaker is on the right of the pakistani (point 7). Since the superhero movie watcher is on the far left and the dressmaker is not the lime eater (as the lime eater is on the left), the dressmaker must be the person in the middle. This means the pakistani is on the far left.

8. The owner of the horse is on the right of the dressmaker (point 9), and the freelancer is the owner of the horse (point 10). So, the freelancer is on the far right.

9. Now we know the positions of the superhero movie watcher, the spy movie watcher, the broccoli eater, the pakistani, and the freelancer. The only remaining person is the person driving the trike. Since the trike driver cannot be the snowmobile driver (as decided in step 3), the trike driver must be the person in the middle.

10. The only remaining detail is the pet of the person in the middle. Since the person in the middle is not the superhero movie watcher (as the superhero movie watcher is drinking mirinda and the person in the middle is not the freelancer, as the freelancer is the horse owner), the person in the middle must be the zucchini eater. So, the zucchini eater is the person driving the trike.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | mirinda   |  7up        | almond-milk |

Lv1-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport). Each person has one preference in each category.

2. From the clues, we can start by placing the people in the following order:
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far left (8), so let's place them in the first column. They drink coffee (5).
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is the person drinking coffee, so they must be doing skateboarding (3, since they are in the middle).
   - The person who's hobby is chess is driving the boat (9), so they are in the second column. Since the cola drinker is to their right (2), the cola drinker must be in the third column.
   - The cola drinker is doing snowboarding (1), so the person watching satire movies is in the second column.
   - The person who's sport is weightlifting is driving the jet-ski (7).
   - The person eating avocado is in the middle (6), but not next to the person watching drama movies (4), so they must be in the first column.
   - The owner of the goat is watching drama movies (4), so they are in the third column.
   - The person eating corn is on the left of the person eating avocado (10), so they are in the second column.
   - The person who's sport is weightlifting is not next to the person eating corn (11), so they must be in the third column.

Now, let's fill in the remaining categories:

- The person eating corn is not a bird owner (since the goat owner is next to them), so they must have a dog.
- The person eating avocado is not a dog owner (since the person eating corn is to their right), so they must have a goat.
- The person driving the tram is not a snowboarder (since they are not watching satire movies), not a skateboarder (since they are not a card-games player), and not a weightlifter (since they are not driving the jet-ski), so they are in the first column and must be doing some other sport.
- The person driving the jet-ski is not a drama watcher (since they are not a goat owner), not a romance watcher (since they are not a cola drinker), and not a satire watcher (since they are not a snowboarder), so they must be watching a drama movie.
- The person driving the boat is not a drama watcher (since they are not a goat owner), not a satire watcher (since they are not a snowboarder), and not a romance watcher (since they are not a cola drinker), so they must be watching a romance movie.
- The person watching satire movies is not a drama watcher (since they are not a goat owner), not a romance watcher (since they are not a cola drinker), and not a card-games player (since they are not a coffee drinker), so they must be watching a satire movie.

Final solution table:

Lv1-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A, B, and C from left to right.

2. From point 7, we know that the horse owner is in the middle, so A cannot have a horse, B has a horse, and C doesn't have a horse (Horse: B).

3. From point 8, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the owner of the lizard. Since A doesn't have a horse, A must have a lizard (Lizard: A). So, C cannot have a lizard, and B has neither a horse nor a lizard (Card-games: A).

4. From point 12, the fan of pop is on the far left. Since A has a lizard, A cannot be the fan of pop. So, B is the fan of pop (Pop: B).

5. From point 4, we know that the fan of pop eats avocado. So, A cannot eat avocado, C eats avocado (Avocado: C).

6. From point 5, we know that the fan of disco is on the left of the person eating onion. Since C eats avocado, B cannot eat onion. So, A eats onion (Onion: A).

7. From point 9, the person eating onion is the french and the person eating onion is the person who's sport is baseball. Since A eats onion, A is French and plays baseball (Baseball: A, French: A).

8. From point 10, the person eating onion is the person who's sport is baseball. So, A plays baseball.

9. From point 11, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right. Since B has a lizard and plays pop, B cannot watch martial-arts movies. So, C watches martial-arts movies (Martial-arts: C).

10. From point 6, the fan of disco is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since C watches martial-arts, C cannot do weightlifting. So, B does weightlifting (Weightlifting: B).

11. From point 1, we know there are 3 different nationalities. Since A is French, B cannot be British or Nigerian. C must be either British or Nigerian. Since C watches martial-arts and does weightlifting, C cannot be British (British: not C). So, C is Nigerian (Nationality: C - Nigerian).

12. From point 3, we know that the nigerian is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since C is Nigerian, C does magic-tricks (Magic-tricks: C).

13. From point 2, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right. Since C does magic-tricks, C cannot fish. So, A fishes (Fishing: A).

14. From point 1, we know there are 3 different movie-genres. Since A fishes, A cannot watch martial-arts or spy movies. B watches martial-arts, so B cannot watch spy movies. C watches spy movies (Spy: C, Crime: A, Martial-arts: B).

15. From point 4, we know that the fan of pop is the person eating avocado. Since B eats pop and plays weightlifting, B cannot eat avocado. So, C eats avocado (Avocado: C).

16. From point 5, we know that the fan of disco is on the left of the person eating onion. Since A eats onion, A cannot be the fan of disco. So, B is the fan of disco (Disco: B).

17. From point 3, we know that the nigerian is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since C is Nigerian, C does magic-tricks.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |       1       |     2      |      3       |
| Food          | Onion        | Avocado   | Broccoli    |

| Pet           | Horse       | Lizard    | Not given  |
| Sport         | Baseball    | Weightlifting| Not given  |

The table is not complete because points 6 and 13 mention the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person who fishes, but we don't know their specific nationalities, hobbies, foods, or pets."
Lv1-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the goat owner, the weightlifter, and the person eating watermelon, so we can place them in the table. Let's place the goat owner on the far right (column 3), the weightlifter in the middle (column 2), and the watermelon eater to the left of the goat owner (column 1).

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      |          |            |                 |
   | Food          | watermelon|            |   grapefruit     |
   | Job           |          | project-manager| teacher         |
   | Music-Genre   |          |            |                 |

   | Sport         |          | weightlifting| baseball        |
   | Transport     |          |            | motorbike       |

2. From rule 4, we know that the electronic music fan is to the right of the motorbike driver. Since the motorbike driver is the chef (rule 6), the electronic music fan must be in column 2 or 3. But the electronic music fan can't be in column 3 because the watermelon eater is there (rule 3). So, the electronic music fan is in column 2.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      |          | electronic | mirinda         |

   | Music-Genre   | gospel   |            | hip-hop         |
   | Pet           |          | goat       | goldfish        |
   | Sport         |          | weightlifting| baseball        |
   | Transport     |          | motorbike  | trike           |

3. From rule 5, we know that the hip-hop fan is to the left of the juice drinker. Since the juice drinker is on the far right (rule 11), the hip-hop fan must be in column 1.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      | juice    | electronic | mirinda         |
   | Food          | watermelon|            | grapefruit      |

   | Transport     | motorbike|            | trike           |

4. From rule 9, we know that the teacher is to the left of the mirinda drinker. Since the teacher is in column 2 (from the previous step), the mirinda drinker must be in column 3.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      | juice    | electronic | iced-tea       |

   | Sport         | baseball | weightlifting| biathlon        |
   | Transport     | motorbike|            | trike           |

5. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the trike is to the left of the baseball player. Since the baseball player is in column 3 (from the previous step), the trike driver must be in column 1 or 2. But the trike driver can't be in column 1 because the hip-hop fan is there (rule 5). So, the trike driver is in column 2.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      | juice    | trike      | iced-tea       |
   | Food          | watermelon|            | grapefruit      |
   | Job           | teacher  | driver     | project-manager |

   | Transport     | motorbike|            |                |

6. Since there are only 3 types of transport and we have filled 2 of them, the remaining transport (iced-tea drinker) must be driving the motorbike.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      | juice    | trike      | iced-tea       |
   | Food          | watermelon|            | grapefruit      |

   | Sport         | baseball | weightlifting| biathlon        |
   | Transport     | motorbike|            |                |

7. From rule 7, we know that the person eating spinach is the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish owner is in column 3 (from the previous step), the spinach eater must be in column 1 or 2. But the spinach eater can't be in column 1 because the watermelon eater is there (rule 3). So, the spinach eater is in column 2.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |
   | Beverage      | juice    | spinach    | iced-tea       |
   | Food          | watermelon|            | grapefruit      |
   | Job           | teacher  | driver     | project-manager |
   | Music-Genre   | gospel   |            | hip-hop         |
   | Pet           | bird     | goat       | goldfish        |
   | Sport         | baseball | weightlifting| biathlon        |
   | Transport     | motorbike|            |                |

8. From rule 8, we know that the teacher is also the person eating spinach. This confirms our previous placement of the teacher and the spinach eater.

   |               |    1     |     2      |        3        |

Lv1-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport, Transport) and 3 people, so each variable has 2 possible values.

2. Let's start with Nationality. Since the Egyptian is in the middle, the other two nationalities must be on the ends. Let's assume the British is on the far right and the Japanese is on the far left.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |

3. Now let's place the people according to their nationalities in the other categories. Since the Egyptian is in the middle, the person watching time-travel movies must be on the right of the Egyptian, so Time-Travel is in the 3rd row and 2nd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | Time-Travel | Scientific   |

4. The person watching scientific movies is in the middle, so Scientific is in the 2nd row and 2nd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | Scientific | Time-Travel |

5. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the Egyptian, so 7up is in the 1st row and 2nd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | 7up       | Scientific  |
   | Beverage     | Juice      | 7up       | Lemonade   |

6. The person drinking lemonade is on the far right, so Lemonade is in the 3rd row and 3rd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | 7up       | Scientific  |
   | Beverage     | Juice      | 7up       | Lemonade   |
   |             |            |           |            |

7. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the Egyptian is driving the subway, the person doing sudoku is in the 3rd column. Since the person doing sudoku can't be in the 1st row (because the hobby of the person in the 1st row is magic-tricks), the hobby of the person in the 1st row must be magic-tricks. So, Magic-Tricks is in the 1st row and 1st column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | 7up       | Scientific  |
   | Beverage     | Juice      | 7up       | Lemonade   |
   | Hobby        | Magic-Tricks| Sudoku    |            |
   |             |            |           |            |

8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left, so the person doing puzzles must be in the 1st column. Since the person doing puzzles can't be in the 3rd row (because the hobby of the person in the 3rd row is sudoku), the hobby of the person in the 3rd row must be puzzles. So, Puzzles is in the 3rd row and 3rd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |

   |             |            |           |            |

9. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the person driving the roller must be doing climbing. Since the British is on the right of the person driving the roller, the sport of the British must be tennis. So, Tennis is in the 1st row and 3rd column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |

   |             |            |           |            |

10. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, so the person doing golf must be on the far right. So, Golf is in the 3rd row and 1st column.

   |               |      1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Nationality   | British     | Egyptian   | Japanese    |

11. The owner of the turtle is the person who's sport is golf, so Turtle is in the 3rd row and 1st column. But we already placed something there (Golf). This means Golf and Turtle are the same person, so Golf is the owner of the turtle.

   |               | Fanta |      |      |

   | Transport     | Airplane|     | Roller  |

2. The Indonesian is on the left of the person driving the airplane, so the Indonesian is in the second column. Let's assume the Indonesian's favorite beverage is Sprite, food is Broccoli, hobby is Skydiving, movie-genre is Zombie, nationality is Indonesian, sport is Skateboarding, and transport is Roller.

   |               | Fanta | Sprite|      |

   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea    | Soy-Milk   | Sprite     |

2. From point 11, we know that the owner of the bird is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. So, the bird must be in column 3, and the iced-tea must be in column 2.

   | Beverage      | Iced-Tea    | Soy-Milk   | Sprite     |

Lv1-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 unknowns (Beverage, Food, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, and Sport) and 11 clues. This means we have more clues than unknowns, which should help us solve the puzzle.

2. From clue 11, we know that the firefighter is not cycling, so the firefighter must be either sailing or volleyball. Let's assume the firefighter is sailing for now (we'll check later if this assumption is correct).

3. From clue 1, we know that the three beverages are juice, lemonade, and water. From clue 2, the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking water. So, the possible order for beverages could be: water, juice, lemonade or juice, water, lemonade. Let's try both and see which one fits the other clues.

   - If the order is water, juice, lemonade:
     - From clue 6, the designer is drinking lemonade, so the designer must be in the third position.
     - From clue 8, the person eating pear is the police-officer, so the pear must be in the second position (since the designer is in the third position).
     - From clue 9, the person eating papaya is on the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the pear (police-officer) is in the second position, the papaya must be in the fourth position.
     - From clue 1, the three foods are apricot, papaya, and pear. Since the pear and papaya are already placed, the apricot must be in the first position.
     - From clue 4, the owner of the lizard is the french. Since the designer is in the third position (drinking lemonade), the french must be in the first position (since the french is on the left of the malaysian, and the malaysian can't be in the first position because the first position is already taken). This means the french is the designer (drinking lemonade), which contradicts our assumption that the designer is in the third position. So, the order can't be water, juice, lemonade.

   - If the order is juice, water, lemonade:
     - From clue 6, the designer is drinking lemonade, so the designer must be in the third position.
     - From clue 8, the person eating pear is the police-officer, so the pear must be in the second position.
     - From clue 9, the person eating papaya is on the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the pear (police-officer) is in the second position, the papaya must be in the fourth position.
     - From clue 1, the three foods are apricot, papaya, and pear. Since the pear and papaya are already placed, the apricot must be in the first position.
     - From clue 4, the owner of the lizard is the french. Since the designer is in the third position (drinking lemonade), the french can't be in the first position (since the french is on the left of the malaysian, and the malaysian can't be in the third position because the designer is there). So, the french must be in the second position (since the french is on the left of the malaysian, and the malaysian can't be in the first position because the apricot is there). This means the french is eating pear (police-officer).
     - From clue 10, the malaysian is on the right of the french. Since the french is eating pear (police-officer), the malaysian must be in the fifth position.
     - From clue 7, the person watching disaster movies is in the middle. Since the french (eating pear) is in the second position and the malaysian is in the fifth position, the person watching disaster movies must be in the third position (drinking lemonade, which is the designer).
     - From clue 5, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the designer. Since the designer is in the third position (drinking lemonade), the rabbit owner must be in the first position (eating apricot).
     - From clue 1, the three pets are frog, lizard, and rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is in the first position (eating apricot), the lizard owner (french) is in the second position (eating pear), and the frog owner is the remaining position (eating papaya).
     - From clue 3, the person drinking water is on the right of the french. Since the french is in the second position (eating pear), the person drinking water must be in the fourth position.
     - From clue 11, the person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is sailing (from our initial assumption), the cyclist must be in the fifth position (since the malaysian is in the sixth position).

The final solution table is:

|               |        Apricot       |       Pear      |     Lemonade     |
| Beverage      |                Water  |                |          Sailing  |

| Job           |                Designer  |                Police-Officer |          Firefighter |

| Sport         |                |                |          Cycling |

However, we didn't use clue 2 (the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking water) in this solution. This means our solution is not complete, and there might be other valid solutions that satisfy all the clues. But this is one possible solution based on the given clues."
