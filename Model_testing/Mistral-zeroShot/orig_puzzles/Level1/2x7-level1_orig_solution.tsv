Lv1-2x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The argentine (photographer) is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column. Let's put them in position 1.
2. The paramedic is Mexican, so we can place them in the second column. Since the paramedic is on the left of the Chinese, the Chinese must be in the third column. So, we can place the Mexican (paramedic) in position 2 and the Chinese in position 3.
3. The mechanic is in the middle, so we can place them in position 4. Since the Chinese is on the left of the mechanic, the positions 1, 2, and 3 are filled.
4. The canadian is on the right of the nigerian, so the nigerian must be in the fifth column. Since the canadian is on the left of the australian, the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are filled. So, we can place the nigerian in position 5.
5. The electrician is on the right of the nigerian, so the electrician must be in the sixth column.
6. The social-worker is on the right of the videographer, so the videographer must be in the seventh column. Since the videographer is on the right of the Australian, the positions 6 and 7 are filled. So, we can place the Australian in position 6.
7. The only job left is entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is not mentioned to be on the left or right of any nationality, we can place them in any of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Let's place the entrepreneur in position 4 (mechanic's position).

Now, let's put the jobs in the table:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |       6       |      7       |
| Job           | Argentine   | Mexican  | Chinese     | Mechanic | Nigerian   | Electrician  | Australian   |
| Nationality   | Photographer| Paramedic|             |         |            |              | Videographer |

Since we didn't specify the order of the jobs within the nationalities, the table is not completely filled. However, the nationalities and the positions of the jobs relative to each other are correct.

Lv1-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of punk is in the middle, we know that the positions are: punk (3), rock (7), soul (1), d&b (6), funk (4), pop (5), and the remaining two (cucumber, eggplant, raspberry, watermelon) are in positions 1, 2, 4, and 6.

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan of punk is eating nectarine, so nectarine is in position 3.

3. From rule 2, the person eating raspberry is on the left of the fan of soul, so raspberry is in position 2.

4. From rule 3, the fan of rock is on the far right, so rock is in position 7.

5. From rule 4, the person eating cucumber is on the right of the fan of funk, so cucumber is in position 4.

6. From rule 5, the person eating nectarine is on the right of the fan of pop, so pop is in position 5.

7. From rule 6, the person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating watermelon, so watermelon is in position 6.

8. From rule 9, the fan of soul is on the left of the person eating eggplant, so eggplant is in position 1.

9. From rule 8, the fan of punk is on the right of the person eating peach, so peach is in position 2.

10. From rule 10, the person eating nectarine is on the left of the fan of d&b, but we already know the positions of nectarine and d&b, so this rule doesn't provide any new information.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |     1     |    2     |   3   |     4     |     5     |     6      |    7     |

Lv1-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating onion, we can place the cucumber on the first column and the onion on the second column. Let's place cucumber in column 1 and onion in column 2.

2. The person eating onion is the bartender, so we know the bartender is in the second column.

3. The person eating onion is on the left of the writer, so the writer must be in a column to the right of the bartender (column 3, 4, 5, or 6).

4. The freelancer is on the left of the person eating spinach, so the freelancer must be in a column to the left of column 7 (columns 1, 2, 3, or 4). Let's place the freelancer in column 1 for now.

5. The mechanic is on the right of the freelancer, so the mechanic must be in a column to the right of column 1 (columns 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6). Let's place the mechanic in column 2 for now.

6. The freelancer is on the left of the mechanic, but we already placed the freelancer in column 1 and the mechanic in column 2. This contradicts the rule, so we need to adjust our placement of the freelancer and mechanic. Let's place the mechanic in column 1 and the freelancer in column 2.

7. The freelancer is on the right of the photographer, but we already placed the freelancer in column 2 and the photographer is the person eating pepper, which we haven't placed yet. We know the photographer is in the middle, so the photographer must be in column 4. This means the person eating pepper is in column 3.

8. The mechanic is in column 1, so the person eating spinach must be in column 7, as the freelancer is on the left of the person eating spinach.

9. The person eating lemon is on the right of the bartender, so the person eating lemon is in column 5 or 6. Since the photographer is in the middle, the person eating lemon can't be in column 5. So, the person eating lemon is in column 6.

10. The person eating corn is on the right of the person eating pepper, so the person eating corn is in column 5.

11. We have placed all the jobs and foods, so the final solution table is:

```

Lv1-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the fan of r&b in the first column (since it's on the far left).
2. Place the Egyptian in the second column, as the nigerian is on its right.
3. Place the nigerian in the third column, as the fan of indie (Indonesian) is on its right.
4. Place the Indonesian in the fourth column, as it is the fan of indie.
5. Place the fan of indie (Indonesian) on the left of the fan of folk (Thai), so the Thai goes in the fifth column.
6. Since the argentine is on the right of the fan of metal (Australian), and the Australian is in the first row, the Argentine must be in the second row.
7. Since the fan of metal is on the left of the fan of disco, and the Argentine is on its right, the fan of metal must be in the third row. So, the fan of metal is Australian.
8. Since the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of r&b, and the fan of r&b is in the first column, the fan of rock must be in the second row.
9. Since the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of r&b and the Egyptian is on its left, the fan of rock must be in the third column.
10. Since the fan of jazz is not placed yet, it must be one of the remaining three spots. Let's assume it's in the sixth column for now.
11. Since the fan of jazz is not on the left of the fan of metal (Australian), it cannot be in the fifth column.
12. Since the fan of jazz is not on the left of the fan of disco, it cannot be in the fourth column.
13. Since the fan of jazz is not on the left of the fan of rock, it cannot be in the second column.
14. So, the fan of jazz must be in the first column, leaving the seventh column for the fan of jazz.
15. Since the fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of folk (Thai), the fan of jazz must be in the first row.
16. Since the fan of jazz is in the first row, the fan of folk must be in the second row.
17. Since the fan of folk is the Thai, the fan of jazz must be in the seventh column.
18. Since the fan of metal is the Australian, the fan of rock must be in the third row.
19. Since the fan of rock is in the third row, the fan of jazz must be in the first row.
20. Since the fan of jazz is in the first row, the fan of folk must be in the second row.

9. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since coffee is in position 4 and soy-milk is in position 5, this condition is already satisfied.

Now, we have filled all the positions for both beverages and transport. The final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage    |   1    |     2      |  3  |    4     |    5    |   6   |      7      |

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv1-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, each watching a different movie genre and using a different means of transport. Let's label the people A to G, where A is the person on the far left and G is the person on the far right.

2. From point 1, we know that A watches satire movies and is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. So, A cannot drive the jet-ski, and the person driving the jet-ski is either B or C. Let's assume the jet-ski driver is B for now. Then, A watches satire movies.

3. From point 2, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since B is watching satire movies, the person watching drama movies must be A or C. If A was watching drama movies, then C would have to watch martial-arts movies, which would place C in the middle (point 8). But that would mean A is driving the boat (point 7), which contradicts our assumption that B is driving the jet-ski. So, C must be watching drama movies, and A is watching animation movies (since A is not watching drama or satire).

4. Now, the person watching martial-arts movies is in the middle (point 8), so it must be D.

5. From point 3, we know that C is watching drama movies, and A is watching animation movies. Since A is not the person driving the boat (point 7), the person driving the boat must be E. So, E watches crime movies.

6. From point 4, we know that D watches martial-arts movies, and D is in the middle. So, the person on the left of D must be B (since B is not the person driving the jet-ski), and the person on the right of D must be F. B watches time-travel movies (point 3), and F watches animation movies (since F is not A and F is not the person driving the boat).

7. From point 6, we know that F watches animation movies, so the person on the left of F must be G. G watches crime movies (since G is not E and G is not the person driving the boat).

8. Now, the only remaining person is B, who is driving the jet-ski. The person on the left of B must be watching satire movies (point 1), and the person on the right of B must be watching something other than martial-arts movies (since D is in the middle), time-travel movies (since F is watching animation movies), or crime movies (since G is watching crime movies). Since crime movies have already been assigned to E and G, the only remaining option is that the person on the right of B watches animation movies. But that would mean A is watching animation movies twice, which is a contradiction.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated."

1. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is on the right of the person driving the roller, and the person driving the quad-bike is the person with the hobby of dancing (which is on the far left), we can place the person with the hobby of puzzles on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person driving the train is in the middle, the person driving the helicopter must be on the right of the person driving the train, which means it must be in the fourth position. The person with the hobby of rock-climbing is in the middle, so it must be in the fifth position.
