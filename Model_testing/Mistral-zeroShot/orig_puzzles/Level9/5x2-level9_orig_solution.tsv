Lv9-5x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 types of food, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, and 2 sports, we can assign each category a unique number from 1 to 5. Let's assign them as follows:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Plum      |
   | Job           | Bartender    | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Epic      |
   | Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B       |
   | Sport         | Basketball   | Skateboard|

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of R&B is the dressmaker. So, we can fill in the Job column:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Plum      |
   | Job           | Dressmaker   | Bartender |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Epic      |
   | Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B       |
   | Sport         | Basketball   | Skateboard|

3. From point 2, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. So, we can swap the positions of Basketball and Skateboarding:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Plum      |
   | Job           | Dressmaker   | Bartender |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Epic      |
   | Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B       |
   | Sport         | Skateboard   | Basketball |

4. From point 3, we know that the person eating asparagus and the fan of country have different parity positions. Since the positions of Asparagus and Country are already fixed, the only way to satisfy this condition is to swap the positions of Plum and Epic:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Plum      |
   | Job           | Dressmaker   | Bartender |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Epic      |
   | Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B       |
   | Sport         | Skateboard   | Basketball |
   |               | 1            | 2         |

5. From point 4, we know that the fan of country is in an even position. Since the positions of Asparagus and Country are already fixed, the only even position left is the Job column. So, the bartender must be in the even position:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Food          | Asparagus    | Plum      |
   | Job           | Bartender    | Dressmaker |
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Epic      |
   | Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B       |
   | Sport         | Skateboard   | Basketball |
   |               | 1            | 2         |

6. From point 5, we know that the dressmaker is not to the right of the bartender. Since the positions of Bartender and Dressmaker are already fixed, this condition is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, two different foods, two different music genres, two different nationalities, and two different pets. So, we can fill the first row with 'Beverage', 'Food', 'Music-Genre', 'Nationality', and 'Pet'.

2. From point 1, we know there are two different beverages. Let's label them as Beverage_1 and Beverage_2. Since one of them is sprite, Beverage_1 can't be sprite. So, Beverage_1 = water and Beverage_2 = sprite.

3. Similarly, from point 2, we know there are two different foods. Let's label them as Food_1 and Food_2. Since one of them is cucumber, Food_1 can't be cucumber. So, Food_1 = mango and Food_2 = cucumber.

4. From point 3, we know there are two different music genres. Let's label them as Music_1 and Music_2. Since one of them is jazz, Music_1 can't be jazz. So, Music_1 = reggae and Music_2 = jazz.

5. From point 4, we know there are two different nationalities. Let's label them as Nationality_1 and Nationality_2. Since one of them is colombian, Nationality_1 can't be colombian. So, Nationality_1 = malaysian and Nationality_2 = colombian.

6. From point 5, we know the colombian and the person drinking sprite have different parity positions. Since we already know the nationality and the beverage of the colombian, we can deduce that the person drinking sprite is in an odd position. So, the person drinking Beverage_2 (which is sprite) is in an odd position.

7. From point 6, we know the person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating mango. Since the positions are odd and even, the person eating cucumber (Food_2) must be in an even position, and the person eating mango (Food_1) must be in an odd position.

8. From point 7, we know the fan reggae is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, the fan reggae (Music_1) must be in an even position.

9. From point 8, we know the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the fan jazz (Music_2). Since the fan reggae (Music_1) is in an even position, the fan jazz (Music_2) must be in an odd position. Since the person drinking sprite is in an odd position, the owner of the mouse (Pet) must be in an even position.

Now, let's fill the table with the final solution:

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | water    | sprite   |
| Food          | mango    | cucumber |
| Music-Genre   | reggae   | jazz     |
| Nationality   | malaysian| colombian |
| Pet           | goldfish | mouse    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | water    | sprite   |

| Music-Genre   | reggae   | jazz     |
| Nationality   | malaysian| colombian |

Lv9-5x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two positions for each category, we can start by filling in one position for each category. Let's fill the first row with the given information:

|               |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage      | juice   | soy-milk |
| Job           | analyst | pilot  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b    | pop   |
| Pet           | mouse  | rat   |
| Transport     | bus    | taxi  |

2. Now let's analyze the conditions:

3. The analyst is not to the right of the owner of the mouse, so the analyst cannot be in position 2. So, the analyst is in position 1.

4. The fan of pop and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions. Since the analyst is in position 1 (an odd position), the fan of pop or the person driving the taxi must be in position 2 (an even position). Let's assume the fan of pop is in position 2 for now.

5. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the analyst, so the taxi driver is in position 2. This means the fan of pop is not the fan of pop, so the fan of pop is in position 1.

6. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the analyst (who drinks juice) is on the left of the mouse owner, the soy-milk drinker must be on the right of the mouse owner. But the only position on the right of the mouse owner is the position of the taxi driver, who drinks bus. So, the soy-milk drinker must be the owner of the rat.

7. The person driving the bus is not the fan of pop (since the fan of pop is the taxi driver), so the person driving the bus must be the fan of d&b.

8. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the soy-milk drinker is the owner of the rat, the person drinking juice must be to the left of the rat owner. But the only position to the left of the rat owner is the position of the analyst. So, the analyst must be drinking juice.

9. Now let's check the conditions again to make sure they are all satisfied:

- The analyst is not to the right of the owner of the mouse: The analyst is in position 1, and the mouse owner is in position 2.
- The fan pop and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions: The fan of pop is in position 1 (odd) and the taxi driver is in position 2 (even).
- The person driving the taxi is on the right of the analyst: The taxi driver is in position 2, and the analyst is in position 1.
- The fan pop is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice: The fan of pop is in position 1, and the analyst (who drinks juice) is in position 2.
- The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse: The soy-milk drinker is the owner of the rat (position 2), and the mouse owner is in position 1.

The conditions are all satisfied, so the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage      | juice   | soy-milk |
| Job           | analyst | pilot  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b    | pop   |
| Pet           | mouse  | rat   |
| Transport     | bus    | taxi  |

Lv9-5x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. There are two types of food, two music-genres, two nationalities, two sports, and two types of transport. So, we can fill the first row with 'corn' and 'peach', the second row with 'blues' and 'trance', the third row with 'brazilian' and 'colombian', the fourth row with 'handball' and 'rowing', and the fifth row with 'roller' and 'trike'.

2. Now let's analyze the parity positions##9. Parity positions mean that if we number the rows and columns from 1, the elements in the same parity positions (either both odd or both even) will have the same value. Since there are two of each, we can assume that the elements in positions 1 and 2 will have the same value.

3. The person driving the roller and the colombian have the same parity positions##9. Since we know the positions 1 and 2 for the colombian, the person driving the roller must be in positions 3 and 4.

4. The brazilian and the person eating corn have the same parity positions##9. Since we know the positions 1 and 2 for the brazilian, the person eating corn must be in positions 3 and 4 as well. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the person driving the roller is in positions 3 and 4. So, the brazilian and the person eating corn cannot be in positions 3 and 4.

5. The colombian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is handball##5. Since the colombian is in positions 1 and 2, the person playing handball must be in positions 3 and 4. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the person driving the roller is in positions 3 and 4. So, the person playing handball cannot be in positions 3 and 4.

6. The person who's sport is handball and the fan blues have the same parity positions##9. Since the person playing handball cannot be in positions 3 and 4, the fan of blues must be in positions 1 and 2. But this contradicts the previous conclusion that the person driving the roller is in positions 1 and 2. So, the fan of blues cannot be in positions 1 and 2.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and it's not possible to find a valid solution for the puzzle as it stands.

However, if we were to make an assumption to resolve the contradiction, for example, if we assume that the ""parity positions##9"" rule is not applicable to the nationality, we could solve the puzzle as follows:

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | corn     | peach    |
| Music-Genre   | blues    | trance   |
| Nationality   | brazilian| colombian |
| Sport         | handball  | rowing   |
| Transport     | roller   | trike    |

This solution assumes that the ""parity positions##9"" rule is not applicable to the nationality. Please note that this is an assumption to make the puzzle solvable and might not be the intended solution."
Lv9-5x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the people have 2 different hobbies (fishing and photography), we can assign hobby 1 to fishing and hobby 2 to photography.

2. Similarly, since they prefer 2 different movie-genres (comedy and drama), we can assign movie-genre 1 to comedy and movie-genre 2 to drama.

3. There are 2 different nationalities (argentine and indian), so we can assign nationality 1 to argentine and nationality 2 to indian.

4. There are 2 different pets (goldfish and rat), so we can assign pet 1 to goldfish and pet 2 to rat.

5. There are 2 different means of transport (quad-bike and tram), so we can assign transport 1 to quad-bike and transport 2 to tram.

Now let's use the given clues:

1. The person who's hobby is photography and the person watching comedy movies have different parity positions. Since there are only 2 positions for each category, the person with hobby 2 (photography) cannot be in an even position, so hobby 1 (fishing) must be in an even position. The person watching comedy movies (movie-genre 1) must be in an odd position.

2. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since there are only 2 positions for each category, the person with pet 2 (rat) cannot be in the first position, so the person driving the tram (transport 2) must be in the first position. The person with pet 1 (goldfish) must be in the second position.

3. The person watching comedy movies is in an even position. Since the person driving the tram is already in the first position (an even position), the person watching comedy movies (movie-genre 1) must be in the second position.

4. The argentine is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the tram (argentine) is in the first position, the argentine cannot be in the second position. So, the argentine must be in the first position, and the person driving the quad-bike (transport 1) must be in the second position.

Now we have the following:

|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         | Fishing     | Photography|
| Movie-Genre   | Drama      | Comedy    |
| Nationality   | Argentine  | Indian    |
| Pet           | Goldfish   | Rat       |
| Transport     | Quad-bike  | Tram      |

However, we still need to confirm the parity of the hobby positions. Since the person with hobby 1 (fishing) is in an even position, and the person with hobby 2 (photography) is in an odd position, they must have different parity positions as stated in the puzzle.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 movie genres, 2 music genres, 2 nationalities, and 2 sports. So, each category will have one row in the table.

2. Since there are 5 categories and 10 positions in total, each category will occupy 2 positions.

3. Let's assign the categories to the positions:
   - Beverage: 1-2
   - Movie-Genre: 3-4
   - Music-Genre: 5-6
   - Nationality: 7-8
   - Sport: 9-10

4. Now let's use the clues:

   a) The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. This means Sport (9) is to the left of Beverage (1 or 2). Since there are only 2 positions for Sport, it must be in position 9, and Beverage is in position 1 or 2. Let's say Beverage is in position 1 (Cola) and the other Beverage is in position 2 (Sprite).

   b) The person drinking cola and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions. Since Cola is in position 1 (odd) and Scientific is in position 3 (odd), Movie-Genre must be in position 4 (even). The other Movie-Genre is in position 5 (odd).

   c) The australian is somewhere to the left of the fan d&b. This means Nationality (7) is to the left of Music-Genre (5). Since there are only 2 positions for Nationality, it must be in position 7, and Music-Genre is in position 6 (Salsa). The other Music-Genre is in position 5 (d&b).

   d) Now we have filled all the categories except for the second Beverage. Since there are only 2 Beverages and they are already in positions 1 and 2, the second Beverage must be in the remaining position 2 (Sprite).

5. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      | Cola       | Sprite   |
   | Movie-Genre   |            | Family   |
   | Music-Genre   |            | d&b      |
   | Nationality   | Australian  | Canadian |
   | Sport         |            | Lacrosse |

   We can't be 100% sure about the positions of Movie-Genre and Sport, but we know they are in positions 3, 4, 8, and 9. So, the final solution table with the positions of Movie-Genre and Sport is:

   |               |     1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      | Cola       | Sprite   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Family     | Scientific|
   | Music-Genre   | d&b        | Salsa    |
   | Nationality   | Australian  | Canadian |
   | Sport         | Lacrosse   | Skiing   |

   However, since the exact positions of Movie-Genre and Sport are not specified in the puzzle, we can't be certain about their exact positions. So, the final solution table with the exact positions is:

   |               |     1      |    2     |
   | Beverage      | Cola       | Sprite   |

   | Music-Genre   | d&b        | Salsa    |
   | Nationality   | Australian  | Canadian |

   | Hobby         | filmmaking | magic-tricks |

2. Since the people have 2 different jobs, we can fill in the jobs:

   | Hobby         | filmmaking | magic-tricks |

5. Now let's apply the parity positions rules:

   - The entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions. Since they are in the same row (both are odd positions), the person who's sport is swimming must be in the even position (2). So, the person who's sport is climbing must be in the odd position (1).

   | Sport         | climbing   | swimming    |

   - The fan metal is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing##8. Since the fan metal is in the first column (1) and the person who's sport is climbing is in the first row (1), the fan salsa must be in the second row (2).

   - The person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions##9. Since they are in the same column (2), the person driving the bus must be in the even position (2).

   Since the person who prefers basketball is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies (1), the person watching sports movies cannot be in position 1. So, the sports movie genre must be in position 2.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          |             |                    |

   | Sport         | Basketball |                    |

2. The person who prefers rowing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions (9). Since we don't know the position of the cucumber eater yet, we can't determine the position of the rower yet. Let's assume the cucumber eater is in position 1 for now.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Cucumber  |                    |
   | Hobby         |             | Chess or Hiking    |
   | Job           | Software-Developer | Firefighter or Software-Developer |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports     | Zombie or Sports   |
   | Sport         | Basketball | Rowing or Basketball |

   Since the cucumber eater is in position 1, the rower must be in position 2. But we don't know the hobby of the person in position 2 yet, so we can't determine the hobby of the rower.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber (3). Since the cucumber eater is in position 1, the chess player must be in position 2.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Cucumber  | Chess            |
   | Hobby         |             | Chess            |
   | Job           | Software-Developer | Firefighter or Software-Developer |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports     | Zombie or Sports   |
   | Sport         | Basketball | Rowing or Basketball |

   Now we know that the hobby of the person in position 2 is chess. Since the software developer is the basketball player (4), the firefighter must be the rower.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Cucumber  | Chess            |
   | Hobby         |             | Chess            |
   | Job           | Software-Developer | Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports     | Zombie or Sports   |
   | Sport         | Basketball | Rowing           |

4. The remaining options for the movie genre of the person in position 1 are zombie or sports. Since the person in position 2 prefers chess, the person in position 1 cannot prefer sports (1), so the movie genre of the person in position 1 must be zombie.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Cucumber  | Chess            |
   | Hobby         | Hiking    | Chess            |
   | Job           | Software-Developer | Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Zombie    | Sports or Zombie  |
   | Sport         | Basketball | Rowing           |

   Now we have filled all the cells except for the food of the person in position 1. Since the person in position 2 prefers chess, the person in position 1 cannot prefer cucumber (2), so the food of the person in position 1 must be pumpkin.

   |               |      1      |         2          |
   | Food          | Pumpkin   | Chess            |
   | Hobby         | Hiking    | Chess            |
   | Job           | Software-Developer | Firefighter      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Zombie    | Sports           |
   | Sport         | Basketball | Rowing           |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two positions for each category, we can label the positions 1 and 2. Let's assume that the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1. Then, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

2. The person watching thriller movies is on the far right, so they must be in position 2.

3. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Since we know the positions of the beverage, movie-genre, and one sport, we can place the sailor in position 1 or 2. Let's place them in position 1 for now. This means the cucumber eater is in position 2.

4. The person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of the beverage, movie-genre, sport (sailing), and one transport, we can place the scooter driver in position 1 (same position as sailor) or position 2. Let's place them in position 2 for now. This means the basketball player is in position 1.

5. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller. Since we know the positions of the beverage, movie-genre, sport (basketball), and one transport (scooter), we can place the roller driver in position 1.

Now, let's check the consistency of our placement:
- The person eating cherry is left over, so it must be in position 2 (since position 1 is occupied by the roller driver).
- The food category is consistent.
- The sport category is consistent.
- The beverage category is consistent.
- The movie-genre category is consistent.
- The transport category is consistent.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond-milk |
| Food          | roller   | cherry      |
| Movie-Genre   | thriller  | adventure   |
| Sport         | basketball| sailing     |
| Transport     | scooter  | roller     |"
Lv9-5x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Turkish cannot be to the right of the person eating radish, so they can't be in column 2. This means the Turkish must be in column 1.

2. The security-guard is in an even position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the security-guard must be in position 2.

3. The person driving the airplane and the owner of the dog have different parity positions. Since the Turkish (who drives the airplane) is in position 1 (odd), the dog owner must be in position 2 (even). Let's say the dog owner is the mechanic (since there are only two jobs).

4. The person eating radish is on the far left. Since the Turkish and the dog owner are already placed, the only one left to eat radish is the person in position 1, and they must be eating peach (since radish was not eaten by the Turkish or the dog owner).

5. Now we know the person in position 1 eats peach, is Turkish, and drives the airplane. The person in position 2 is a security-guard, owns a dog, and eats radish.

6. The nationality and pet of the person in position 1 and 2 are not specified yet. Since there are only two nationalities (Dutch and Turkish), the person in position 2 must be Dutch. Since there are only two pets (cat and dog), the person in position 1 must have a cat as a pet.

7. The transport is the last to be determined. Since the Turkish drives the airplane, the person in position 2 must use the bus.

Final solution table:
