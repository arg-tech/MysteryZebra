Lv9-2x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the quad-bike and lime have different parity positions. Let's assume lime is in an even position (1, 3, 5, or 7) and quad-bike is in an odd position (2, 4, 6).

2. From rule 2, the quad-bike is not to the right of lime. So, quad-bike can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the jet-ski is to the left of garlic. So, garlic can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 4, the tram is either to the left or right of the bus. Let's assume the tram is to the right of the bus (position 6 or 7).

5. From rule 5, the jet-ski is to the right of the bus. So, bus can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

6. From rule 6, the ship is between the boat and peas. Since the bus is not to the right of the jet-ski (rule 5), the boat can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the peas must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

7. From rule 7, the boat is between the jet-ski and the ship. Since the bus is not to the right of the jet-ski (rule 5) and the boat is not to the right of the peas (since peas are to the right of the boat), the boat must be in position 2. So, the jet-ski is in position 1 and the ship is in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the ship and peach have different parity positions. Since the ship is in position 3, peach can only be in positions 1, 5, or 7.

9. From rule 9, the artichoke is on the left or right of the lime. Since lime is in an even position (let's say position 2), artichoke can be in position 1 or 3.

10. From rule 10, the lime is to the right of the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is in position 1, lime can only be in position 3. So, artichoke is in position 1.

11. From rule 11, the lime is not to the right of the ship. So, lime is in position 3.

12. From rule 12, the quad-bike and garlic have different parity positions. Since the quad-bike is in position 1, garlic can only be in position 5 or 7.

13. From rule 13, the pear is not to the right of the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is in position 1, pear can only be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7.

14. From rule 14, the ship is to the left of the roller. So, the roller can only be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

15. From rule 15, the bus is to the left of the jet-ski. So, the jet-ski can only be in positions 1 or 2.

16. From rule 16, the carrot is not to the right of the peach. Since the peach is in position 3, carrot can only be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7.

17. From rule 17, the ship is not to the right of the garlic. Since the ship is in position 3, garlic can only be in position 1.

18. From rule 18, the jet-ski is not to the right of the peach. Since the jet-ski is in position 1, peach can only be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6.

19. From rule 19, the artichoke is not to the left of the lime. Since the artichoke is in position 1, lime can only be in position 3.

20. From rule 20, the bus is the person eating artichoke. So, the bus is in position 2.

21. From rule 21, the jet-ski is to the left of the peach. Since the jet-ski is in position 1, peach can only be in position 2.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|             |     1     |  2   |     3     |    4    |   5   |   6    |   7    |

Lv9-2x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Since the analyst is not the person who's sport is golf (rule 4), and the golf player is to the left of the analyst (rule 3), we can place the golf player in the first or second position. Let's assume the golf player is in the first position.

2. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour (rule 6). Since the videographer is the person who's sport is parkour (rule 5), the cyclist must be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6.

3. The software-developer is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is volleyball (rule 8). Since the golf player is in the first position, the mechanic must be in the third position. The software-developer cannot be in the second position (because of rule 14), so the software-developer must be in the fourth position. This means the volleyball player must be in the sixth position.

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball (rule 9). Since the volleyball player is in the sixth position, the lacrosse player can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7.

5. The dressmaker is somewhere to the right of the lawyer (rule 10), so the lawyer must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the golf player is in the first position, the lawyer cannot be in the first position. So, the lawyer is either in the second or third position.

6. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball (rule 16). Since the baseball player is not the first position (because the golf player is there), the baseball player can be in positions 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7.

7. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (rule 18). Since the lacrosse player can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7, the baseball player cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 4. So, the baseball player is either in the fifth or seventh position.

8. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the analyst (rule 17). Since the analyst is not the first position (because the golf player is there), the dressmaker cannot be in the first position. The dressmaker is also to the right of the person who's sport is cycling (rule 15), so the dressmaker cannot be in the second position (because the cyclist is there). So, the dressmaker is either in the third, fourth, or sixth position.

9. The person who's sport is cycling is not to the right of the person who's sport is parkour (rule 13), so the cyclist cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the cyclist is either in the second or fourth position.

10. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere between the person who's sport is volleyball and the videographer (rule 11). Since the volleyball player is in the sixth position and the videographer is the person who's sport is parkour (rule 5), the cyclist must be in the fourth position.

11. The software-developer is not to the right of the lawyer (rule 14), so the lawyer must be in the second position. This means the analyst is in the third position.

12. The person who's sport is baseball is not the first position (because the golf player is there), so the baseball player is in the seventh position.

13. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not in the first position (because the golf player is there), so the lacrosse player is in the fifth position.

14. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling (rule 15), so the dressmaker is in the second position.

15. The only remaining position for the dancer is the first position, and the only remaining position for the mechanic is the third position.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|  Golf      |  Cycling |  Software-developer |  Volleyball |  Lacrosse  |  Dancer    |  Mechanic  |
#############
|  Baseball  |         |                    |            |            |            |           |

2. The person with the hobby of filmmaking is in an even position. Since the first position is occupied by pineapple, the filmmaker must be in position 2 or 4. However, since the person eating pineapple is to the left of the filmmaker, the filmmaker cannot be in position 2. So, the filmmaker is in position 4.

   |         |     1     |    2    |     3      |     4      |   5    |      6       |     7      |

6. The person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person eating apple. Since the filmmaker is in position 4 and we don't have an apple yet, we can't confirm the position of the camping person yet.

7. The person eating pepper is not to the left of the person eating pineapple. Since we have already placed them, this condition is satisfied.

8. The person with the hobby of magic-tricks is not to the left of the person with the hobby of hiking. Since we know the positions of both, this condition is satisfied.

9. The person eating apple is not to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we don't have an apple yet, we can't confirm this condition yet.

10. The person eating cranberry is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Let's place them in positions 5 and 6, with cranberry in position 5.

   |         |     1     |    2    |     3     |     4      |   5     |     6      |     7      |

11. The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since we don't have a grapefruit yet, we can't confirm this condition yet.

12. The person who's hobby is skydiving and the person eating apple have different parity positions. Since we don't have an apple yet, we can't confirm this condition yet.

13. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we know the positions of both, this condition is satisfied.

14. The person eating grapefruit is not to the left of the person eating apple. Since we don't have a grapefruit yet, we can't confirm this condition yet.

15. The person who's hobby is camping and the person eating pineapple have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of both, this condition is satisfied.

20. The person eating apple must be to the right of the person who's hobby is camping (not yet placed) and to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving (not yet placed). Since the person who's hobby is camping can't be in position 1 (odd position), the apple must be in position 3.

   |         |     1     |    2    |     3     |     4      |   5     |     6      |     7      |

Lv9-2x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the sports and music genres to the positions based on the given clues.

1. The person who's sport is biathlon is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the fan trance. Let's place biathlon in position 3, ice-hockey in position 5, and trance in position 7.

2. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since biathlon is already in position 3, sailing cannot be in position 1 or 3. Let's place sailing in position 6.

3. The fan jazz is on the left or right of the fan metal. Since metal is in position 7 (sailing is in position 6), jazz cannot be in position 1 or 7. Let's place jazz in position 2.

4. The fan reggae is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since handball cannot be in position 7 (reggae cannot be to its right), let's place handball in position 4.

5. The fan reggae is not the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is in position 3, reggae cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 7. Let's place reggae in position 8.

6. The fan metal is somewhere between the fan house and the fan jazz. Since jazz is in position 2 and metal is in position 7, house must be in position 1 or 3. Let's place house in position 1.

7. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the fan trance and the fan metal. Since trance is in position 7 and ice-hockey is in position 5, the only remaining position for ice-hockey is position 6.

8. The fan metal is the person who's sport is sailing. This contradicts our previous placement of sailing in position 6 and metal in position 7. There seems to be an error in this clue.

9. The fan blues is on the far right. Since all other genres have been placed, blues must be in position 5.

10. The person who's sport is golf is not the fan trance. Since trance is in position 7, golf cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's place golf in position 8.

11. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the right of the fan reggae. Since reggae is in position 8, rugby can only be in position 7.

12. The person who's sport is handball and the fan blues have the same parity positions. Since handball is in position 4 and blues is in position 5, they have the same parity (both are odd). Let's place the remaining even-numbered genres (house, indie, and jazz) in positions 2, 4, and 6, respectively.

13. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the left of the fan house. Since house is in position 1, volleyball cannot be in position 2. Let's place volleyball in position 3.

14. The fan indie is not to the left of the fan metal. Since metal is in position 7 and indie is not in position 1, it must be in position 5.

15. The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the fan reggae. Since reggae is in position 8 and rugby is in position 7, this condition is satisfied.

16. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the left of the fan indie. Since indie is in position 5 and ice-hockey is in position 6, this condition is not satisfied. There seems to be an error in this clue.

17. The fan trance is not to the left of the fan reggae. Since reggae is in position 8 and trance is in position 7, this condition is satisfied.

18. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the fan indie. Since indie is in position 5 and ice-hockey is in position 6, this condition is not satisfied. There seems to be an error in this clue.

19. The fan trance is not to the left of the fan reggae. Since reggae is in position 8 and trance is in position 7, this condition is satisfied.

20. The fan metal and the person who's sport is biathlon have the same parity positions. Since biathlon is in position 3 and metal is in position 7 (both are odd), this condition is not satisfied. There seems to be an error in this clue.

21. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the fan indie and the fan metal. Since indie is in position 5 and metal is in position 7, ice-hockey must be in position 6. However, this contradicts our previous placement of ice-hockey in position 6. There seems to be an error in this clue.

22. The person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the fan metal. Since metal is in position 7 and rugby is in position 7, this condition is not satisfied. There seems to be an error in this clue.

23. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the fan indie. Since indie is in position 5 and ice-hockey is in position 6, this condition is not satisfied. There seems to be an error in this clue.

Lv9-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions with odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, and 7, and the positions with even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8, we can determine the parity of each position.

2. From rule 14, the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person drinking sprite, so fanta must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since it can't be in position 3 (rule 22), it must be in position 1. So, sprite is in position 3 or 5.

3. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is hiking is in the middle, so hiking is in position 4. This means puzzles are in position 2, 6, or 7 (not position 4 due to rule 8).

4. From rule 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in an even position (rule 6), juice can't be in position 2, 4, or 6. So, juice is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But it can't be in position 1 (rule 22), so it must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

5. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since chess is not to the left of hiking (rule 10), filmmaking can't be in position 2. So, filmmaking is in position 1, 4, 6, or 7. But it can't be in position 1 (rule 19 and 22), so it must be in position 4, 6, or 7.

6. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is board-games is not the person drinking tea. So, tea can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since fanta is in position 1 and board-games can't be in position 3 due to rule 12). So, tea is in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But it can't be in position 4 (rule 3), so it must be in position 2, 6, or 7.

7. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the right of the person drinking tea. So, filmmaking can't be in position 6 or 7. So, filmmaking is in position 4.

8. From rule 12, the person drinking tea and the person who's hobby is board-games have the same parity positions. Since tea is in position 2, board-games must be in position 6 or 7 (not position 2 due to rule 12).

9. From rule 17, the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. So, cooking can't be in position 6 or 7. So, cooking is in position 2, 4, or 5. But it can't be in position 4 (rule 3), so it must be in position 2 or 5.

10. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since filmmaking is in position 4, chess must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But it can't be in position 1 (rule 19 and 22), so it must be in position 3 or 5.

11. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since hiking is in position 4, chess must be in position 3.

12. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the right of the person drinking tea. Since tea is in position 2, filmmaking can't be in position 7. So, filmmaking is in position 4.

13. From rule 20, the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since board-games is in position 6, cooking must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But it can't be in position 3 (rule 11), so it must be in position 2.

14. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since chess is in position 3, filmmaking can't be in position 2. So, filmmaking is in position 4.

15. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is cooking and the person drinking water have the same parity positions. Since cooking is in position 2, water must be in position 6 or 7 (not position 2 due to rule 5).

16. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is board-games and the person drinking water have different parity positions. Since board-games is in position 6, water must be in position 5.

17. From rule 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 5, juice can't be in position 1, 3, or 7. So, juice is in position 2, 4, or 6. But it can't be in position 6 (rule 4), so it must be in position 2 or 4.

18. From rule 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 5, juice can't be in position 1. So, juice is in position 4.

19. From rule 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 5, juice must be in position 3.

20. From rule 2, the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 1, sprite must be in position 3.

21. From rule 16, the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 5, juice can't be in position 7. So, juice is in position 3.

22. From rule 7, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta is in position 1, sprite must be in position 3 or 5. But it can't be in position 5 (rule 22), so it must be in position 3.

23. From rule 9, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person drinking water. Since sprite is in position 3 and water is in position 5, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage   | fanta | sprite | tea | juice | water | cooking | board-games | hiking | puzzles | filmmaking | singing |
|-----------|-------|--------|------|-------|-------|---------|------------|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| Hobby      |       |        |      |       |       |          |             |         |         |             |         |

#############

Note that the hobbies are not filled in because they are not explicitly determined by the given rules. However, we know that the hobby of the person drinking fanta must be different from board-games, and the hobby of the person drinking water must be different from board-games and singing. The rest of the hobbies can be filled in based on the given rules, but there are multiple possible solutions for the hobbies."
Lv9-2x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person drinking sprite, and the person drinking sprite is rowing (which is sport 3), we can place 7up in position 1 or 2, and sprite in position 5 or 6. Let's place 7up in position 1 and sprite in position 5.

2. Now, we know that the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is not in the first 5 positions (as sprite is in position 5), mirinda can only be in position 6. So, tea must be in position 7.

3. Now we know that the person who's sport is rowing is the person drinking sprite, so rowing is sport 3.

4. The person drinking sprite is to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since sprite is in position 5, skateboarding can only be in position 4 or 6. But position 6 is not possible because of rule 6 (the person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the person drinking cola, and cola is not in the first 5 positions). So, skateboarding is in position 4.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an odd position. Since we have filled positions 1, 4, 5, and 7, the only odd position left is position 3. So, snowboarding is in position 3.

6. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the person drinking cola. Since cola is not in the first 5 positions, skiing can only be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. But position 6 is not possible because of rule 7 (the person drinking tea and the person who's sport is skiing have the same parity positions, and we know tea is in position 7). So, skiing is in position 2.

7. The person drinking coffee is to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. So, coffee can only be in positions 1 or 2. But position 1 is not possible because of rule 11 (the person drinking coffee is to the left of the person drinking fanta, and fanta is not in the first 5 positions). So, coffee is in position 2.

8. The person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking coffee. So, fanta is in position 3.

9. The person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. So, soccer is in position 6 or 7. But position 7 is not possible because of rule 9 (the person who's sport is soccer is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing). So, soccer is in position 6.

10. The person who's sport is tennis is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 3, tennis can only be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is not possible because of rule 13 (the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the left of the person who's sport is tennis). So, tennis is in position 2.

11. The person drinking cola is not in the first 5 positions. So, cola is in position 6.

12. The person who's sport is rugby is not mentioned yet. Since there are 7 sports and we have filled 6, rugby must be in position 7.

13. The person who's sport is skateboarding is to the right of the person drinking coffee. So, skateboarding is in position 4.

14. The person who's sport is tennis is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 3, tennis is in position 2. But this contradicts our previous placement of tennis. So, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

Here is the table with the solution up to the contradiction:

| Beverage   | 7up   | fanta | coffee | cola   | tea     | sprite  | skateboarding |
|-----------|-------|-------|--------|--------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Sport      | rowing| tennis| skiing | soccer  | snowboarding| rugby   | skateboarding  |

The contradiction is that tennis is placed in position 2 twice, once as the person's favorite beverage and once as the person's sport. This puzzle seems to have an inconsistency."
Lv9-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the scientist and the fan jazz have different parity positions. This means they can't be in the same even or odd position. Let's assume the scientist is in an even position (1, 3, 5, or 7) and the fan jazz is in an odd position (2, 4, 6).

2. From rule 2, the paramedic is to the left of the fan jazz. So, the paramedic can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the fan blues is on the left of the coach. Since the paramedic is to the left of the fan jazz, the coach can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

4. From rule 4, the mechanic is between the scientist and the fan house. Since the scientist is in an even position and the fan house can't be to the right of the mechanic (rule 17), the mechanic must be in an odd position. So, the mechanic can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7, but not the same position as the scientist (rule 1). Let's say the mechanic is in position 1.

5. From rule 5, the fan soul is to the left of the fan salsa. So, the fan salsa can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

6. From rule 6, the fan salsa is to the right of the chef. Since the mechanic is in position 1, the chef can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. So, the chef can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

7. From rule 7, the fan country is to the left of the fan soul. So, the fan soul can't be in position 6, and the fan country can't be in position 2. So, the fan soul is in position 4 and the fan country is in position 2.

8. From rule 8, the fan salsa is to the right of the chef. Since the fan soul is in position 4, the fan salsa can only be in position 6.

9. From rule 9, the fan jazz is to the left of the chef. Since the fan country is in position 2, the chef can't be in position 6. So, the chef is in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the chef is not to the right of the doctor. Since the chef is in position 4, the doctor can't be in position 6. So, the doctor is in position 2.

11. From rule 11, the fan hip-hop is between the fan country and the writer. Since the fan country is in position 2 and the writer can't be to the left of the paramedic (rule 13), the writer can only be in position 6.

12. From rule 12, the fan soul is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 2 and the fan soul is in position 4, the fan soul is to the right of the doctor.

13. From rule 13, the writer is not to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in position 1 and the writer is in position 6, the paramedic is to the left of the writer.

14. From rule 14, the scientist is on the left or right of the fan jazz. Since the fan jazz is in position 3 and the mechanic is in position 1, the scientist can't be in position 1. So, the scientist is in position 5.

15. From rule 15, the fan jazz is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 4, the fan jazz is in position 6.

16. From rule 16, the fan jazz and the mechanic have the same parity positions. Since the mechanic is in position 1 and the fan jazz is in position 6, they have different parity positions, which is a contradiction. This means our initial assumption about the scientist's position was incorrect. Let's try again.

Assuming the scientist is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the paramedic can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

3. From rule 3, the fan blues is on the left of the coach. Since the paramedic is in position 2, the coach can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

4. From rule 4, the mechanic is between the scientist and the fan house. Since the scientist is in an odd position and the fan house can't be to the right of the mechanic (rule 17), the mechanic must be in an even position. So, the mechanic can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. But since the mechanic can't be in the same position as the paramedic (rule 1), the mechanic can't be in position 2. So, the mechanic is in position 4 or 6.

5. From rule 5, the fan soul is to the left of the fan salsa. So, the fan salsa can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

6. From rule 6, the fan salsa is to the right of the chef. Since the mechanic is in position 4, the chef can't be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the chef can be in positions 1 or 3.

7. From rule 7, the fan country is to the left of the fan soul. So, the fan soul can't be in position 1, and the fan country can't be in position 3. So, the fan soul is in position 3 and the fan country is in position 1.

8. From rule 8, the fan salsa is to the right of the chef. Since the fan soul is in position 3, the fan salsa can only be in position 5.

9. From rule 9, the fan jazz is to the left of the chef. Since the fan country is in position 1, the chef can't be in position 3. So, the chef is in position 5.

10. From rule 10, the chef is not to the right of the doctor. Since the chef is in position 5, the doctor can't be in position 7. So, the doctor is in position 3.

11. From rule 11, the fan hip-hop is between the fan country and the writer. Since the fan country is in position 1 and the writer can't be to the left of the paramedic (rule 13), the writer can only be in position 7.

12. From rule 12, the fan soul is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 3 and the fan soul is in position 3, the fan soul is to the left of the doctor.

13. From rule 13, the writer is not to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in position 2 and the writer is in position 7, the paramedic is to the left of the writer.

14. From rule 14, the scientist is on the left or right of the fan jazz. Since the fan jazz is in position 6 and the mechanic is in position 4, the scientist can't be in position 4. So, the scientist is in position 2 or 6. But since the scientist can't be in the same position as the paramedic (rule 1), the scientist can't be in position 2. So, the scientist is in position 6.

15. From rule 15, the fan jazz is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 4, the fan jazz is in position 2.

16. From rule 16, the fan jazz and the mechanic have the same parity positions. Since the mechanic is in position 4 and the fan jazz is in position 2, they have the same parity positions.

17. From rule 17, the fan house is not to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in position 4, the fan house can't be in position 6. So, the fan house is in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |   2   |    3     |     4     |   5    |  6   |   7    |

Lv9-2x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the fans of music genres. Since the fan jazz is the person drinking iced-tea, let's place iced-tea in position 1 and jazz in position 2.

2. The fan house is to the left of the fan funk, so let's place house in position 3 and funk in position 4.

3. The fan soul is the person drinking sprite, so we know that sprite is in position 5. Since the fan soul is between the fan house and the fan funk (position 3-4 and 5), the only possible positions for the remaining genres are punk (6), rock (7), reggae (8), and punk (9).

4. The fan punk is between the fan house and the fan soul, so punk must be in position 6 and rock in position 7.

5. The fan reggae is to the right of the fan jazz, so reggae must be in position 8.

6. The fan reggae is to the right of the fan jazz, and the fan punk is to the left of the fan reggae, so the fan soul (Sprite) must be in position 9.

7. Now we know the positions of all music genres, so we can place the beverages. The fan soul is drinking sprite, so sprite is in position 5.

8. The person drinking iced-tea is the fan jazz, so iced-tea is in position 1.

9. The fan house is to the left of the fan funk, so house is in position 3.

10. The fan funk is in position 4, so the remaining beverages are hot-chocolate, juice, lemonade, tea, and mirinda.

11. The person drinking sprite (fan soul) is between the person drinking iced-tea (fan jazz) and the person drinking sprite, so the person drinking tea must be in position 2.

12. The person drinking tea and the fan jazz have different parity positions, so the person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 (iced-tea is already there). Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 3 (house is already in position 3, so tea must be in position 4).

13. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite (fan soul), so juice must be in position 6 or 7. Since the fan punk is between the fan house and the fan soul, juice cannot be in position 7 (it would be between punk and rock). Therefore, juice must be in position 6.

14. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice, so lemonade must be in position 7.

15. The person drinking mirinda is not to the left of the fan jazz, so mirinda must be in position 8 or 9. Since the fan reggae is to the right of the fan jazz, mirinda cannot be in position 8 (it would be between reggae and soul). Therefore, mirinda must be in position 9.

16. The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person drinking juice, so hot-chocolate must be in position 2 or 3. Since the person drinking tea is already in position 4, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

17. The final table is:

Lv9-2x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the librarian is in the middle (position 4), we know the food and jobs for positions 4, 5, and 6. The librarian eats watermelon, so the people in positions 5 and 6 are the pilot and the person eating the food in position 7.

2. The librarian is on the right of the pilot, so the pilot is in position 6.

3. Now we know the jobs for positions 4, 5, and 6. Let's fill in the foods for these positions:
   - Position 4: Watermelon (librarian)
   - Position 5: Let's assume it's Pineapple for now (we'll check later if it's valid)
   - Position 6: Pilot

4. The person eating raspberry and the coach have the same parity positions##9. Since the raspberry eater is in an odd position (rule 12), the coach must be in an even position. The only even position left is position 2. So, the coach eats cucumber.

5. The chef is on the right of the coach, so the chef is in position 3. The chef cannot eat cucumber (rule 13), so the chef eats blueberry.

6. The freelancer is on the left of the person eating mango (rule 3). The only available position for the freelancer is position 1. So, the freelancer eats lime.

7. The person eating mango is somewhere to the right of the person eating pineapple (rule 17). Since the only available position for mango is position 5, pineapple must be in position 1.

8. The architect is on the left or right of the person eating pineapple (rule 9). The only available position for the architect is position 2 (since the architect is not the raspberry eater, rule 11). So, the architect eats pineapple.

9. The analyst is on the right of the freelancer (rule 16). The only available position for the analyst is position 7.

10. The person eating cucumber is somewhere between the coach and the person eating raspberry (rule 10). Since the raspberry eater is in position 2 and the cucumber eater cannot be to the left of the chef (rule 13), the cucumber eater must be in position 3.

11. Now we have filled all the positions. Let's check the foods:
   - Position 1: Freelancer (Lime)
   - Position 2: Coach (Cucumber)
   - Position 3: Chef (Blueberry)
   - Position 4: Librarian (Watermelon)
   - Position 5: Mango
   - Position 6: Pilot
   - Position 7: Analyst

The final solution table is:

Lv9-2x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the first position, 7 being the last).

2. From rule 17, we know that the person watching adventure movies is in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume it's in position 4 for now.

3. From rule 18, the Italian is to the left of the Egyptian, so they are in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume the Italian is in position 1.

4. From rule 5, the Italian and the person watching adventure movies have the same parity positions, so the person watching adventure movies is in position 4 or 6. But we already placed them in position 4, so they must be in position 6.

5. From rule 12, the person watching adventure movies is to the right of the Thai. Since the Thai can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), the Thai must be in position 2.

6. From rule 16, the person watching adventure movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the Russian. Since the Thai is in position 2, the Russian can't be in position 3 (because the Italian is there), so the Russian must be in position 5.

7. From rule 19, the Russian is to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the Russian is in position 5, the person watching documentary movies can't be in position 6 (because the person watching adventure movies is there), so the person watching documentary movies must be in position 7.

8. From rule 14, the Russian is not to the right of the Malay. Since the Malay can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), the Malay must be in position 3.

9. From rule 22, the Chinese is to the left of the Malay, so the Chinese is in position 2.

10. From rule 13, the person watching adventure movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the Russian. Since the Russian is in position 5 and the person watching adventure movies is in position 6, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 4.

11. From rule 7, the person watching action movies is between the person watching satire movies and the Malay. Since the Malay is in position 3, the person watching satire movies can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), so the person watching satire movies must be in position 2. This means the person watching action movies is in position 5.

12. From rule 8, the person watching action movies is to the left of the Malay, so the person watching action movies is in position 4. This means the person watching satire movies is in position 2 and the Malay is in position 3.

13. From rule 2, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 and the Malay is in position 3, the person watching martial-arts movies can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), so the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 5.

14. From rule 11, the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, so the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 and the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 5.

15. From rule 15, the person watching martial-arts movies is not the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), the Brazilian must be in position 6.

16. From rule 23, the Brazilian is not to the right of the Thai, so the Thai is in position 2 and the Brazilian is in position 6.

17. From rule 1, the Malaysian and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions. Since the Malaysian is in position 3 and the person watching documentary movies is in position 7, they must have opposite parity, so the person watching documentary movies is in position 6.

18. From rule 21, the Russian and the person watching musical movies have different parity positions. Since the Russian is in position 5, the person watching musical movies must be in position 1 or 3. But the Italian is in position 1, so the person watching musical movies must be in position 3.

19. From rule 3, the person watching satire movies is not the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian can't be in position 1 (because the Italian is there), the Egyptian must be in position 2.

20. From rule 10, the person watching martial-arts movies is not the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 5.

21. From rule 6, the person watching satire movies is not to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching satire movies is in position 2 and the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 5, the person watching satire movies is in position 2 and the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 5.

22. From rule 1, the Malaysian and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions. Since the Malaysian is in position 3 and the person watching documentary movies is in position 6, they must have opposite parity, so the person watching documentary movies is in position 4 and the Malaysian is in position 3.

23. From rule 4, the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in position 2 and the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 5, the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1, 2, or 3.

43. From rule 5, the Italian and the person watching adventure movies have the same parity positions. Since the Italian is in position 1 and the person watching adventure movies is in position 4, they have opposite parity, which is a contradiction. However, since the positions are numbered from 1 to 7, the only way to make the Italian and the person watching adventure movies have the same parity positions is if they swap positions, so the Italian is in position 4 and the person watching adventure movies is in position 1.

44. With the Italian and the person watching adventure movies swapped, all the conditions are still satisfied. The final solution table is:
