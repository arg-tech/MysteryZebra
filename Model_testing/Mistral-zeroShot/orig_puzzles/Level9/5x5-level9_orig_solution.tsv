Note: The music-genre for position 3 is not explicitly given in the clues, but since the person eating apricot is in position 3, we can infer that the music-genre for position 3 is soul (as the person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the fan soul, and the fan soul is in position 1, 2, or 4, so it cannot be in position 3).

The final solution table with the missing music-genre filled in:

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |      4       |        5        |

| Transport     | boat       | motorbike | train     | skateboard   |                 |

The table is not complete as we don't have the job for position 4 and the music-genre for position 1. However, we can deduce that the fan of folk must prefer techno as their music-genre since they are in the same parity position (odd) and the fan of techno is not the owner of the mouse (odd position) or the owner of the rat (odd position). So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the firefighter and the British have the same parity positions. Since there are 5 positions, the firefighter and the British must be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the firefighter is in position 1 and the British is in position 3 (odd positions).

2. From rule 2, the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the Egyptian. Since the British is in position 3 and the firefighter is in position 1, the Egyptian must be in position 2.

3. From rule 3, the Mexican is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the British is in position 3 and the Egyptian is in position 2, the skiing person must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the skiing person is in position 4.

4. From rule 4, the nurse is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. So, the nurse must be in position 2 or 3. Since the Egyptian is in position 2, the nurse must be in position 3.

5. From rule 5, the person eating onion is on the right of the British. So, the onion eater must be in position 5.

6. From rule 6, the dressmaker is between the Thai and the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is in position 2 and the nurse is in position 3, the dressmaker must be in position 1 or 4. But the firefighter is already in position 1, so the dressmaker must be in position 4.

7. From rule 7, the nurse is on the right of the firefighter. But we already placed the nurse in position 3 and the firefighter in position 1. This is a contradiction, so the firefighter must be in position 3 and the nurse in position 1.

8. From rule 8, the owner of the mouse is the person eating pomegranate. Since the onion eater is in position 5, the mouse owner must be in position 2.

9. From rule 9, the owner of the lizard is between the owner of the rat and the person eating avocado. Since the mouse owner is in position 2, the avocado eater must be in position 4 or 5. But the onion eater is in position 5, so the avocado eater must be in position 4. The rat owner must be to the left of the avocado eater and to the right of the mouse owner, so the rat owner must be in position 3.

10. From rule 10, the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion. But we already placed the onion eater in position 5 and the skiing person in position 4. This is a contradiction, so the skiing person must be in position 5 and the onion eater in position 4.

11. From rule 11, the owner of the mouse and the British have the same parity positions. But we already placed the British in position 3 and the mouse owner in position 2. This is a contradiction, so the British must be in position 2 and the mouse owner in position 4.

12. From rule 12, the Mexican and the person eating onion have the same parity positions. But we already placed the onion eater in position 4 and the Mexican must be to the right of the skiing person, who is in position 5. So, the Mexican must be in position 3.

13. From rule 13, the nurse is on the left of the owner of the bird. But we already placed the nurse in position 1 and the mouse owner in position 4. Since the mouse owner is the owner of the bird, this is a contradiction. Let's assume the nurse is in position 3 instead.

14. From rule 14, the owner of the dog is on the right of the freelancer. Since the mouse owner is the owner of the bird and the nurse is in position 3, the freelancer must be in position 1 or 5. But the firefighter is already in position 1, so the freelancer must be in position 5.

15. From rule 15, the owner of the mouse is not the Mexican. But we already placed the Mexican in position 3 and the mouse owner in position 4. This is a contradiction, so the Mexican must be in position 5.

16. From rule 16, the owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian. But we already placed the Egyptian in position 2 and the nurse in position 3. Since the nurse is the owner of the bird, this is a contradiction. Let's assume the Egyptian is in position 4 instead.

17. From rule 17, the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. But we already placed the Egyptian in position 4 and the rugby person must be to the left of the owner of the bird. So, the rugby person must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But the firefighter is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 4, and the nurse is in position 3. So, the rugby person must be in position 2.

18. From rule 18, the person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird. But we already placed the rugby person in position 2 and the nurse is the owner of the bird in position 3. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the rugby person is in position 1 instead.

19. From rule 19, the nurse is on the left or right of the freelancer. But we already placed the nurse in position 1 and the freelancer in position 5. So, the nurse must be in position 5 and the freelancer in position 1.

20. From rule 20, the Thai is not to the left of the person eating peach. Since the Egyptian is in position 4, the peach eater must be in position 5. Since the nurse is in position 5, the Thai must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But the firefighter is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 4, and the rugby player is in position 2. So, the Thai must be in position 3.

21. From rule 21, the freelancer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby. But we already placed the freelancer in position 1 and the rugby player in position 2. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the freelancer is in position 5 instead.

22. From rule 22, the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the freelancer is in position 5 and the dog owner must be to the right of the freelancer, the cycling person must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But the firefighter is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 4, and the rugby player is in position 2. So, the cycling person must be in position 3.

23. From rule 23, the British is not the dressmaker. But we already placed the British in position 2 and the dressmaker in position 4. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the British is in position 4 instead.

24. From rule 24, the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. But we already placed the cycling person in position 3 and the dog owner must be to the right of the cycling person. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the cycling person is in position 5 instead.

25. From rule 25, the Egyptian is the person who's sport is lacrosse. But we already placed the Egyptian in position 4. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the Egyptian is the person who's sport is rugby instead.

26. From rule 26, the person eating avocado is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the cycling person is in position 5 and the dog owner must be to the right of the cycling person, the avocado eater must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But the firefighter is in position 1, the Egyptian is in position 4 (or 2 if the Egyptian is the rugby player), and the nurse is in position 3. So, the avocado eater must be in position 1.

27. From rule 27, the person who's sport is cycling is on the far left. But we already placed the cycling person in position 5. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the cycling person is in position 1 instead.

28. From rule 28, the nurse is not the British. But we already placed the nurse in position 1 and the British in position 4. This is a contradiction. Let's assume the nurse is in position 3 instead.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv9-5x5-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign variables to each category and each person. For example, let's use B1, B2, B3, B4, B5 for the beverages, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5 for the jobs, P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 for the pets, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 for the sports, and T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 for the transports.

2. Let's start with the positions. From the given clues, we can deduce the following:
   - Even positions: J2, J4 (Entrepreneur is in an even position)
   - Odd positions: J1, J3, J5 (All other jobs are in odd positions)
   - Leftmost: T3 (Scooter is on the far left)
   - Rightmost: T5 (Taxi is somewhere to the right of climbing, so it's not the rightmost)
   - Second from right: T4 (Snowmobile is not to the left of T5, so T4 is second from right)
   - Third from right: T2 (Sport of climbing is somewhere to the right of T1, so T2 is third from right)
   - Fourth from right: T1 (Bus and parkour have the same parity positions, so T1 is fourth from right)

3. Now let's assign the sports:
   - S4: Surfing (Person drinking milk is the person doing surfing)
   - S3: Climbing (Person doing climbing is somewhere to the right of T1, so S3 is above S4)
   - S2: Cricket (Owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of S5, so S5 is not cricket, S2 is cricket)
   - S1: Baseball (Person doing baseball is not to the left of S4, so S1 is above S4)
   - S5: Parkour (Bus and parkour have the same parity positions, so S5 is above T1)

4. Now let's assign the jobs:
   - J4: Entrepreneur (Entrepreneur is in an even position, so J4 is the entrepreneur)
   - J3: Fisherman (Entrepreneur is not to the left of the fisherman, so J3 is the fisherman)
   - J2: Paramedic (Paramedic is not the person drinking fanta, so J2 is the paramedic)
   - J1: Doctor (Doctor is not to the left of the owner of the rat, so J1 is the doctor)
   - J5: Chef (Chef and the person who's sport is cricket have different parity positions, so J5 is the chef)

5. Now let's assign the pets:
   - P5: Hamster (Person doing surfing is the owner of the hamster)
   - P4: Turtle (Owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of S5, so P4 is the turtle)
   - P3: Rat (Owner of the rat is to the left of the doctor, so P3 is the rat)
   - P2: Goldfish (Goldfish is not to the right of the person driving the scooter, so P2 is the goldfish)
   - P1: Mouse (Mouse is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish, so P1 is the mouse)

6. Finally, let's assign the beverages:
   - B5: Milk (Person drinking milk is the person doing surfing, so B5 is milk)
   - B4: Almond-milk (Person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions, so B4 is almond-milk)
   - B3: Water (Scooter and water have the same parity positions, so B3 is water)
   - B2: Fanta (Person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse, so B2 is fanta)
   - B1: Mirinda (Mirinda is on the right of the person drinking water and not to the left of the paramedic, so B1 is mirinda)

Therefore, the person watching scientific movies is in position 3.

Step 15: The owner of the fish is not the person who's sport is volleyball (16), so the owner of the fish cannot be in position 2. The owner of the fish is not the Indonesian (5), so the owner of the fish cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the owner of the fish is in position 1, 3, or 4. However, the owner of the fish cannot be in position 4 because the Indonesian is in position 5, and they cannot be to the right of the owner of the fish. Therefore, the owner of the fish is in position 1 or 3. Since the person watching scientific movies is in position 3, the owner of the fish is in position 1.

Step 16: The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left (12), so the person who's sport is volleyball is in position 1. Therefore, the owner of the fish is in position 3.

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the leftmost position and 5 being the rightmost position).

2. From the given clues, we can deduce the following:

   - The person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 5 (clue 18).
   - The person watching horror movies must be in an odd position (clue 20).
   - The person eating grapes cannot be in position 5 (clue 3).
   - The person driving the roller cannot be in position 1 (clue 24).
   - The person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 1 (clue 22).
   - The person eating kiwi must be in an even position (clue 20).

3. Now, let's assign the categories to some positions based on the given clues:

   - The person watching horror movies must be in an odd position. Since the person eating kiwi is in an even position (2 or 4), the horror movies person must be in position 3.
   - The person eating grapes cannot be in position 5, so the person eating grapes must be in position 1, 2, or 4. However, the person eating grapes cannot be to the right of the person eating kiwi (clue 3), so the person eating grapes must be in position 1.
   - The person driving the roller cannot be in position 1 (clue 24), so the person driving the roller must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person driving the roller is between the person eating avocado and the person eating grapes (clue 4), the person driving the roller must be in position 3.
   - The person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 1 (clue 22), so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person watching mystery movies is the person who's sport is biathlon (clue 23), the person watching mystery movies must be in position 5.
   - The person eating kiwi must be in an even position (clue 20), so the person eating kiwi must be in position 2 or 4. However, the person eating kiwi cannot be to the right of the person eating pear (clue 16), so the person eating kiwi must be in position 2.
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 5 (clue 17), so the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person watching sports movies (clue 17), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 or 2.

4. Now, let's assign the remaining categories:

   - The person watching sports movies cannot be in position 1 (clue 30), so the person watching sports movies must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the person watching sports movies is to the right of the person watching crime movies (clue 8) and to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies (clue 12), the person watching sports movies must be in position 4.
   - The person watching crime movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the person watching crime movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies (clue 8), the person watching crime movies must be in position 2.
   - The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3 or 4. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is to the right of the person watching crime movies (clue 12) and to the left of the person watching sports movies (clue 12), the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3.

5. Now, let's assign the remaining beverages:

   - The person drinking lemonade and the person driving the roller have different parity positions (clue 29), so the person driving the roller must be in an even position (3 or 5), and the person drinking lemonade must be in an odd position (1 or 3). Since the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the person driving the boat (clue 6), the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.
   - The person driving the boat and the person drinking lemonade have the same parity positions (clue 6), so the person driving the boat must be in position 1.
   - The person drinking juice must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person drinking juice is to the left of the person driving the jet-ski (clue 26) and the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton (clue 27), the person drinking juice must be in position 2.
   - The person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1 (clue 28), so the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton (clue 27) and the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 28), the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4.

   - The person eating garlic cannot be in position 1 (clue 25), so the person eating garlic must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Since the person eating garlic is not the person watching sports movies (clue 30), the person eating garlic must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, the person eating garlic cannot be to the left of the person eating pear (clue 25), so the person eating garlic must be in position 3.
   - The person eating kiwi is in position 2 (already determined).
   - The person eating grapes is in position 1 (already determined).

7. The person watching crime movies is in position 2, the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person watching sports movies is in position 4, and the person watching horror movies is in position 3.

9. The person who's sport is biathlon is the person watching mystery movies (clue 23), the person who's sport is badminton is in position 5 (already determined), the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 (since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton), but the person who's sport is sailing cannot be to the left of the person driving the quad-bike (clue 31), so the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 4.

10. The person who's sport is rugby must be in position 5 (since the person watching sports movies is in position 4 and the person watching rugby is to the right of the person drinking juice, which is in position 2).

11. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies (clue 19), but the person watching sports movies is in position 4, so the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 3.

1. First, let's list all the variables and their possible positions (1-5).

2. Let's assign the variables to the positions based on the given information. We'll start with the nationalities since they have a specific position (1, 3, 5 are odd, and 2, 4 are even).

9. The person watching spy movies is not the fan electronic (6), so the spy movie watcher must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the russian and the person watching spy movies have the same parity positions (9), the spy movie watcher must be in position 1 or 3. However, the spy movie watcher is not to the right of the person driving the skateboard (1), so the spy movie watcher must be in position 3.

   |               |    1    |    2     |      3      |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | Skateboard|   Motorbike|   Jet-ski   |   Jet-ski  |   Roller  |

10. The person watching spy movies is in an even position (4), which is a contradiction since we already placed the spy movie watcher in position 3. This means that the spy movie watcher must be in position 4 instead.

    |               |    1    |    2     |      3      |      4      |     5      |

    |               |    1    |    2     |      3      |      4      |     5      |

Lv9-5x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, the skateboard and motorbike have the same parity positions. Since there are 5 positions, one of them must be in the far left or far right. Let's assume the skateboard is in the far left (position 1) and the motorbike is in an odd position (position 3, 5).

2. From rule 9, the chinchilla owner is to the left of the American. Since the American can't be in position 1 (skateboard), the American must be in position 2.

3. From rule 2, the American is between the chinchilla owner and the Indian. So, the Indian must be in position 4 or 5.

4. From rule 15, the person drinking coffee is the freelancer. Since there are only 5 beverages, the freelancer can't be in position 1 (almond-milk) or position 5 (sprite). So, the freelancer must be in position 2 (coffee) or position 3 (cola). But from rule 16, the Dutch and the person driving the bike have the same parity positions, and the Dutch can't be in position 1 (skateboard), so the freelancer can't be in position 3 (motorbike). Therefore, the freelancer is in position 2 (coffee), and the Dutch is in position 4 (cola).

5. From rule 19, the Dutch is to the right of the freelancer. Since the Dutch is in position 4, the freelancer can't be in position 1 (almond-milk) or position 5 (sprite). So, the freelancer is in position 2 (coffee), and the Dutch is in position 4 (cola).

6. From rule 18, the owner of the dog is on the far right. Since the American, Indian, Dutch, and Freelancer are all accounted for, the owner of the dog must be in position 5.

7. From rule 11, the architect is to the right of the chinchilla owner (American). So, the architect is in position 3 or 5. But from rule 13, the architect is to the right of the doctor. Since the Dutch is in position 4, the doctor can't be in position 5. So, the architect is in position 3.

8. From rule 17, the mechanic is to the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 4, the mechanic is in position 5.

9. From rule 10, the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the Dutch is in position 4 (not the bike), the person drinking sprite can't be in position 1 (skateboard). So, the person drinking sprite is in position 2 (almond-milk), and the person driving the bike is in position 3 (coffee).

10. From rule 20, the mechanic is to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the mechanic is in position 5, the person driving the scooter is in position 4.

11. From rule 21, the Egyptian is to the right of the person drinking cola (Dutch). Since the Dutch is in position 4, the Egyptian is in position 5.

12. From rule 24, the person driving the scooter is not the person drinking juice. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 4, the person drinking juice can't be in position 1 (almond-milk), 2 (coffee), 3 (bike), or 5 (Egyptian). So, the person drinking juice is in position 4 (juice).

13. From rule 14, the Indian is to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 4, the Indian is in position 5.

14. From rule 23, the Indian is the owner of the lizard.

15. From rule 22, the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the van have the same parity positions. Since the almond-milk drinker is in position 2 and the van driver can't be in position 1 (skateboard), the van driver is in position 4 (juice).

16. From rule 16, the person driving the bike and the Dutch have the same parity positions. Since the Dutch is in position 4, the person driving the bike is in position 2 (almond-milk).

17. From rule 25, the owner of the bird and the Egyptian have different parity positions. Since the Egyptian is in position 5, the owner of the bird is in position 3 (coffee).

18. From rule 4, the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 4 (juice).

The final solution table is:
