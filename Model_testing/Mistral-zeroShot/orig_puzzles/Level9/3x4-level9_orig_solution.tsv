Lv9-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in an even position. Since there are 4 people, the positions are 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since cooking can't be in position 4 (odd), it must be in position 2 or 4. But from rule 1, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since skydiving can't be in position 1 (it would violate rule 3 if the fan d&b was to the left of the police-officer), skydiving must be in position 3. So, cooking must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 2, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening can't be in position 4 (it would violate rule 11), gardening must be in position 2 or 3. If gardening is in position 2, then cooking must be in position 1, and skydiving in position 3. If gardening is in position 3, then cooking must be in position 2, and skydiving in position 1. Let's assume gardening is in position 3 for now.

2. Now, let's place the jobs. From rule 7, the analyst is the fan country. Since the positions are even, the analyst can only be in position 2 or 4. But from rule 13, the fan rock and the firefighter have the same parity positions. Since the fan rock can't be the police-officer (rule 8), it must be the firefighter. So, the firefighter is in position 1 or 3. But from rule 10, the person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the firefighter. So, the firefighter must be in position 3. This means the analyst is in position 2.

3. Now, let's place the music-genres. From rule 9, the fan d&b is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since photography can't be in position 1 (it would violate rule 10), photography must be in position 2 or 4. But from rule 11, the person who's hobby is gardening is not to the left of the person who's hobby is photography. So, photography must be in position 4. This means the fan d&b is in position 3.

4. Now, let's place the remaining hobbies and music-genres. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the fan rock (firefighter). So, gardening must be in position 4. This means the hobby in position 1 is skydiving, the hobby in position 2 is cooking, and the hobby in position 3 is gardening. From rule 3, the fan rock is not to the right of the fan d&b. So, the fan d&b must be in position 2, and the fan rock in position 1 (firefighter).

5. Finally, from rule 12, the fan d&b is between the person who's hobby is photography and the chef. Since photography is in position 4 and the fan d&b is in position 2, the chef must be in position 3.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Cooking  | Skydiving | Gardening | Photography |
|   Analyst  |   Firefighter | Police-Officer |   D&B     |
|   Rock     |   Country  |   Techno   |   Chef     |
#############
```

This solution satisfies all the given rules."
Lv9-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the sports. Since the person who plays rugby is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking milk (rule 8), we can place rugby in the second position. Let's place cycling in the first position, tennis in the third position, and swimming in the fourth position.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |

2. Now let's place the beverages. Since the person drinking 7up is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 6), 7up can't be in the first column. Also, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the fan indie (rule 9), so 7up can't be in the first or second column. So, 7up can only be in the third or fourth column. But since the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person drinking tea (rule 5), 7up can't be in the fourth column. So, 7up must be in the third column. Let's place 7up in the third row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage |  |  | 7up |  |

3. Now, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person drinking milk (rule 2), so iced-tea can't be in the fourth column. Also, the person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person drinking tea (rule 10), so iced-tea can't be in the second column. So, iced-tea can only be in the first or third column. But since the person drinking 7up is on the right of the fan indie (rule 9), and indie is not to the left of the person drinking tea (rule 14), the person drinking tea can't be in the first column. So, iced-tea must be in the first column and tea must be in the third column. Let's place iced-tea in the first row and tea in the third row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea |  | 7up | Tea |

4. Now, the fan jazz is somewhere to the right of the fan r&b (rule 4), so jazz can't be in the first or second row. Also, the fan jazz is not to the left of the person drinking tea (rule 14), so jazz can't be in the third column. So, jazz can only be in the fourth column. Let's place jazz in the fourth row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea |  | 7up | Tea |
   | Music-Genre |  |  |  | Jazz |

5. The fan r&b is on the left of the fan jazz (rule 13), so r&b can only be in the first, second, or third column. But since the fan r&b is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling (rule 12), r&b can't be in the third column. Also, the fan r&b is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (rule 11), so r&b can't be in the fourth column. So, r&b can only be in the second column. Let's place r&b in the second row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea |  | 7up | Tea |
   | Music-Genre |  | R&B |  | Jazz |

6. The person who's sport is d&b has the same parity positions as the person who plays rugby (rule 3). Since rugby is in the second position, d&b must be in an even position. But since d&b is not to the left of the person who's sport is tennis (rule 11), d&b can't be in the first or second column. So, d&b can only be in the fourth column. Let's place d&b in the fourth row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea |  | 7up | Tea |
   | Music-Genre |  | R&B |  | Jazz |
   | Sport |  |  |  | D&B |

7. The person drinking milk is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 2), so milk can't be in the fourth column. Also, milk can't be in the first column because the person drinking 7up is on the right of the fan indie (rule 9), and indie is not to the left of the person drinking tea (rule 14). So, milk can only be in the second or third column. But since the person who's sport is rugby and the fan d&b have the same parity positions (rule 3), and d&b is in the fourth row, milk can't be in the fourth column. So, milk can only be in the second column. Let's place milk in the second row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea | Milk | 7up | Tea |
   | Music-Genre |  | R&B |  | Jazz |
   | Sport |  |  |  | D&B |

8. The person drinking indie is not to the left of the person drinking tea (rule 14), so indie can't be in the first or third column. Also, indie is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 6), so indie can't be in the second column. So, indie can only be in the fourth column. Let's place indie in the fourth row.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Cycling | Rugby | Tennis | Swimming |
   | Beverage | Iced-tea | Milk | 7up | Tea |
   | Music-Genre |  | R&B |  | Jazz |
   | Sport |  |  |  | D&B |
   | Music-Genre |  |  | Indie |  |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Egyptian is drawing, so Drawing must be in the Egyptian's row. Let's place Drawing in the 3rd row (Egyptian's row) for now.

2. The Egyptian is to the left of the Fisherman. Since the Egyptian is in the 3rd row, the Fisherman must be in the 4th row or to the right of the 3rd row.

3. The Egyptian is between the Italian and the Guinea-Pig owner. Since the Egyptian is in the 3rd row, the Italian must be in the 2nd row, and the Guinea-Pig owner must be in the 4th row or to the right of the 3rd row.

4. The Dutch is to the left of the Chinese. Since the Italian is in the 2nd row, the Chinese must be in the 1st row.

5. The owner of the Mouse is not to the right of the Drawer (Egyptian). Since the Egyptian is in the 3rd row, the Mouse cannot be in the 4th row. So, the Mouse must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd row.

6. The owner of the Mouse is to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the 2nd row, the Mouse cannot be in the 1st row (as it would be to the right of the Italian). So, the Mouse must be in the 3rd row.

7. The owner of the Guinea-Pig is to the right of the Video-Games person. Since the Video-Games person cannot be in the 1st row (as it would violate rule 5), the Guinea-Pig owner must be in the 4th row.

8. The Video-Games person and the Chinese have different parity positions. Since the Chinese is in the 1st row, the Video-Games person cannot be in the 1st row either (as 1 and odd numbers have the same parity). So, the Video-Games person must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th row.

9. The owner of the Bird is between the Chinese and the owner of the Turtle. Since the Chinese is in the 1st row and the Turtle owner is in the 4th row, the Bird must be in the 2nd row.

10. The Fisherman is not the Chinese (rule 11). Since the Chinese is in the 1st row, the Fisherman cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th row (as it would violate rule 2 or 10). So, the Fisherman must be in the 3rd row.

Now, let's place the remaining information:

- Nationalities: Chinese (1st row), Dutch (left of Chinese, so 2nd row), Egyptian (3rd row, hobby is Drawing), Italian (2nd row, to the right of Egyptian and to the left of Mouse), Guinea-Pig owner (4th row), Video-Games person (not in the 1st row, so 2nd, 3rd, or 4th row, but not 3rd as it's Egyptian's hobby, so it must be in the 4th row), Mouse (3rd row), Bird (2nd row), Turtle owner (4th row)

- Hobbies: Drawing (Egyptian's hobby, so 3rd row), Fishing (3rd row), Hiking (not in the 1st row, so 2nd, 3rd, or 4th row, but not 3rd as it's Fisherman's hobby, not 4th as it's Guinea-Pig owner's hobby, so it must be in the 2nd row), Video-Games (4th row), Hiking (2nd row), and the last hobby, which is not in the 1st row (as it would violate rule 5), so it must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th row, but not 2nd as it's Hiking's hobby, not 4th as it's Video-Games' hobby, so it must be in the 3rd row.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, the person drinking coffee and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions. Since there are 4 people and an odd number, one person must be in an even position and the other in an odd position. Let's assume coffee is in an even position (1 or 4) and dancing is in an odd position (2 or 3).

2. From point 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person who's hobby is chess have different parity positions. Since we know the position of coffee and dancing, we can deduce that chess must be in an even position (1 or 4) and ice-hockey in an odd position (2 or 3).

3. From point 3, the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. So, camping must be in position 2 or 4, and chess in position 1 or 3.

4. From point 4, the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. Since we know the position of chess, we can deduce that 7up must be in position 2 or 3.

5. From point 5, the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, rowing must be in position 1 and ice-hockey in position 3.

6. From point 6, the person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since we know the position of rowing and ice-hockey, sailing can only be in position 2.

7. From point 7, the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking 7up. So, water must be in position 1.

8. From point 8, the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, camping is in position 3.

9. From point 9, the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we know the position of camping (3), coffee can only be in position 1 or 2. But from point 1, coffee is in an even position, so it must be in position 2.

10. From point 10, the person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's sport is rowing and the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we know the positions of rowing (1) and camping (3), dancing must be in position 4.

11. From point 11, the person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know the positions of rowing (1), camping (3), and coffee (2), lacrosse can only be in position 4.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person driving the skateboard (let's say it's hot-chocolate) in the first column since the hot-chocolate drinker cannot be to the right of the skateboard driver (Rule 4).

2. The person drinking juice cannot be in the same position as the person eating apricot (Rule 2), so the apricot eater cannot be in the first column (since the skateboard driver is in the first column). Let's place the apricot eater in the second column.

3. The person driving the van is the person drinking lemonade (Rule 3), so we place the van driver (lemonade drinker) in the third column.

4. The person drinking tea cannot be to the right of the person driving the subway (Rule 1), so the subway driver cannot be in the last column. Also, the subway driver cannot be in the first column because the skateboard driver is there (Rule 4). So, the subway driver goes in the second column.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van (Rule 5), so the hot-chocolate drinker goes in the first column.

6. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person eating blueberry (Rule 7), so the blueberry eater goes in the fourth column.

7. The person eating cabbage and the person drinking hot-chocolate have different parity positions (Rule 6), so the cabbage eater cannot be in the same column as the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in the first column, the cabbage eater goes in the third column.

8. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter (Rule 11), so the helicopter driver cannot be in the first or last column. Since the skateboard driver is in the first column and the subway driver is in the second column, the helicopter driver goes in the third column. This means the radish eater goes in the fourth column.

9. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person drinking juice (Rule 8), so the subway driver is in the second column and the juice drinker is in the third column.

10. The person driving the van is on the far left or far right (Rule 10), but we already placed the van driver in the third column. So, the van driver is on the far right.

Now, let's place the food and beverages in their respective columns:

| Beverage    |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   |          |               |            |            |

1. Hot-chocolate (Beverage) in the first column
2. Skateboard (Transport) in the first column
3. Lemonade (Beverage) in the third column
4. Subway (Transport) in the second column

Now, let's place the remaining food:

| Beverage    |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   | Skateboard| Subway       | Van        | Helicopter |

The parity positions for the apricot eater and the tea drinker are the same (Rule 9), so the tea drinker goes in the second column.

| Beverage    |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   | Skateboard| Subway       | Van        | Helicopter |

The juice drinker is to the left of the blueberry eater (Rule 7), so the juice drinker goes in the third column.

| Beverage    |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

The lemonade drinker is to the left of the hot-chocolate drinker (Rule 5), so the lemonade drinker goes in the first column.

Lv9-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the boat is to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Let's place the boat driver in the last position (position 4).

2. Since the person driving the boat is not to the left of the gardener (from rule 6), the gardener cannot be in position 4. So, the gardener must be in one of the first three positions.

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. So, card-games must be in the first two positions. Let's place card-games in position 1.

4. Now, the gardener must be in position 2.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the boat driver is the traveler, the quad-bike must be to the left of the boat driver (position 3). The person who's sport is basketball cannot be in position 4 (because the boat driver is there), so basketball must be in position 1 or 2. If it were in position 1, the quad-bike would be in position 3, but then there would be no room for the gardener (who is in position 2). So, basketball must be in position 2.

6. Now, the quad-bike is in position 3.

7. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's sport is swimming have the same parity positions. Since we have already placed an odd numbered hobby (card-games) in position 1 and an even numbered hobby (gardening) in position 2, the hobby of rock-climbing must be in an odd position and the sport of swimming in an even position. The only even position left is position 4. So, swimming is in position 4.

8. The only hobby left is traveling, which must be in position 1 (since the boat driver is already in position 4).

9. The person who's sport is soccer cannot be to the left of the gardener (from rule 4), so soccer must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since basketball is in position 2, soccer cannot be in position 2. If soccer were in position 4, the gardener would be in position 3, but then the quad-bike would be to the right of the basketball player (from rule 3), which is not allowed. So, soccer must be in position 3.

Lv9-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D, where A is the first person, B is the second, C is the third, and D is the fourth.

2. From the given clues, we can start by placing the person who's hobby is baking (B) and the person who's hobby is writing (W) based on clues 5 and 10. Since W cannot be to the left of B, we can place W to the right of B. Let's say B = Baking and W = Writing, so B > W.

3. Now, we can place the person who's hobby is card-games (C) and the person who's hobby is cooking (K) based on clues 2 and 4. Since C cannot be to the left of K (cricket), we can place C to the right of K. Let's say K = Cooking and C = Card-games, so K > C.

4. We can place the person who's hobby is baking (B) and the person who's hobby is writing (W) based on clue 10. Since W can be to the left or right of B, we have two possibilities: BW or WB.

5. We can place the person who's hobby is cooking (K) and the person who's hobby is baking (B) based on clue 6. Since the person drinking juice (J) is somewhere between B and K, we have three possibilities: BKJ or JBK.

6. We can place the person who's hobby is card-games (C) based on clue 2. Since C cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is cricket (Cr), we can place C to the right of Cr. However, we don't know the position of Cr yet.

7. We can place the person who's sport is handball (H) based on clue 9. Since H is on the far left, we can place H as the first person (A).

8. We can place the person who's sport is badminton (Bd) based on clue 11. Since Bd is between H and C, we can place Bd as the second person (B).

9. Now, we can place the person who's sport is cricket (Cr). Since Cr cannot be to the left of C (card-games), Cr must be either the third person (C) or the fourth person (D). However, since Cr cannot be to the left of W (writing), Cr cannot be D. So, Cr = C.

10. We can place the person who's sport is soccer (S) based on clues 1, 3, and 12. Since S is not to the left of W and not to the right of B, S must be the fourth person (D).

11. We can place the person who drinks iced-tea (It) based on clue 8. Since It and Bd have the same parity positions, It cannot be A, C, or D. So, It = B.

12. We can place the person who drinks juice (J) based on clue 6. Since J is between B (It) and K, J = C.

13. We can place the person who drinks milk (M) based on the remaining positions. Since M cannot be A (handball), M cannot be C (juice), M cannot be D (soccer), so M = K.

The final solution table is:

|            |    1     |     2     |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage   | Handball | Iced-tea | Juice     | Milk     |
| Hobby      |         |          | Cooking   | Baking   |
| Sport      | Badminton| Soccer    |           |          |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the order of the hobbies and sports within the same parity position (clue 8). So, the final solution table with all possible arrangements within the same parity position is:

Lv9-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of electronic music is not to the left of the fan of gospel music. So, the possible positions for electronic are 2, 3, or 4, and gospel can be 1.

2. From rule 2, the nigerian is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the mexican is on the far left (rule 6), the jet-ski driver cannot be mexican. So, the jet-ski driver can be nigerian, polish, or turkish, and the nigerian cannot be to their right. This means the nigerian can only be in position 1.

3. From rule 3, the nigerian is between the polish and the fan of techno. Since the nigerian is in position 1, the polish and the fan of techno must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. The fan of techno cannot be in position 4 because the person driving the quad-bike must be in an even position (rule 10), and position 4 is odd. So, the fan of techno can be in position 2 or 3, and the polish can be in position 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 4, the fan of techno is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the jet-ski driver is nigerian (rule 2), the quad-bike driver cannot be nigerian. So, the quad-bike driver can be polish or turkish. If the quad-bike driver was polish, the fan of techno would have to be in position 3, but then the nigerian would be to the right of the fan of techno (rule 5), which contradicts rule 2. Therefore, the quad-bike driver must be turkish, and the fan of techno is in position 2.

5. From rule 6, the mexican is on the far left, so the music genre in position 1 is not disco, electronic, or gospel (since they are all to the right of the mexican). The only remaining genre for position 1 is techno, but this would mean the nigerian is to the right of the fan of techno (rule 2), which contradicts rule 3. This means the mexican cannot be on the far left, and the table must be rearranged.

6. Let's rearrange the table so that the mexican is not on the far left. We can swap the positions of the mexican and the fan of techno (making the mexican the fan of techno and the fan of techno the mexican). Now, the table looks like this:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | Techno  |            |           | Disco   |
| Nationality   | Mexican |            |           | Nigerian|
| Transport     |       |            |           |         |

7. From rule 7, the fan of electronic is on the left of the fan of disco. Since the fan of techno is now in position 1, the fan of electronic can be in position 2, and the fan of disco can be in position 3 or 4.

8. From rule 8, the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the polish. Since the polish is now the fan of techno in position 1, the person driving the train can be in position 2, 3, or 4.

9. From rule 9, the fan of electronic is not to the right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of electronic is in position 2 and the fan of disco is in position 3 or 4, this rule is satisfied.

10. From rule 10, the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position. Since the jet-ski driver is nigerian (rule 2), the only even positions left are 2 and 4. However, if the jet-ski driver was in position 4, the fan of techno would be to the right of the nigerian (rule 3), which contradicts rule 2. Therefore, the jet-ski driver must be in position 2.

11. From rule 11, the fan of electronic is not to the right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of electronic is in position 2 and the fan of disco is in position 3, this rule is satisfied.

12. From rule 12, the person driving the skateboard and the fan of techno have the same parity positions. Since the fan of techno is in position 2, the person driving the skateboard can be in position 2 or 4. However, if the skateboard driver was in position 4, the person driving the train would be to the right of the skateboard driver (rule 8), which contradicts rule 10 (since the jet-ski driver is in position 2). Therefore, the skateboard driver must be in position 2, and the person driving the train must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the remaining transport and nationality:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | Techno  | Electronic | Disco    | Skateboard|
| Nationality   | Mexican | Nigerian  | Polish   | Turkish  |
| Transport     | Train  | Jet-ski   |          | Skateboard|

13. From rule 13, the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the polish and the fan of techno. Since the polish is in position 1 and the fan of techno is in position 2, the only position left for the quad-bike driver is position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |     2      |     3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | Techno  | Electronic | Disco    | Skateboard|
| Nationality   | Mexican | Nigerian  | Polish   | Turkish  |
| Transport     | Train  | Jet-ski   | Quad-bike| Skateboard|

Lv9-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of dubstep is not the first person (position 1) because the fan of ambient is to its right. So, the fan of dubstep is either in position 2, 3, 4.

2. From rule 2, the British cannot be in position 1 because the British cannot be to the left of itself. So, the British is either in position 2, 3, or 4.

3. From rule 3, the person eating cherry is not to the left of the Spanish. Since the British cannot be in position 1, the Spanish cannot be in position 1 either. So, the Spanish is either in position 2, 3, or 4.

4. From rule 4, the person eating cherry is to the right of the person eating radish. Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1, the person eating radish cannot be in position 1 either. So, the person eating radish is either in position 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 5, the fan of ambient is not Japanese. So, the Japanese cannot be in position 1.

6. From rule 6, the Spanish and the fan of ambient have different parity positions. Since the Spanish and the person eating cherry have the same parity (both are odd if the Spanish is in position 2 or 4, both are even if the Spanish is in position 3), the fan of ambient must be in an even position (2 or 4).

7. From rule 7, the person eating watermelon is not to the left of the Spanish. Since the Spanish cannot be in position 1, the person eating watermelon cannot be in position 1 either. So, the person eating watermelon is either in position 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 8, the person eating watermelon and the British have different parity positions. Since the Spanish and the fan of ambient have the same parity, the British must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 4).

9. From rule 9, the fan of jazz is on the left of the person eating apricot. Since the British is in an odd position and the person eating watermelon is not to the left of the Spanish, the person eating apricot must be in position 1. So, the fan of jazz is in position 2.

10. From rule 10, the Spanish and the fan of dubstep have different parity positions. Since the Spanish is in an odd position and the fan of ambient is in an even position, the fan of dubstep must be in an odd position (3 or 4).

11. From rule 11, the person eating radish is between the fan of ambient and the person eating apricot. Since the fan of ambient is in position 2 and the person eating apricot is in position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 3.

12. From rule 12, the Japanese is to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is in position 2, the Japanese must be in position 1.

13. From rule 13, the British is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since the person eating watermelon is in position 3 and the Japanese is in position 1, the British can only be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |     4     |
| Food          | Japanese   | Ambient | Radish   | British   |
| Music-Genre   |            |         |          |           |
| Nationality   |            |         |          |           |

Now, let's fill in the missing information from rules 1, 6, and 10:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |     4     |
| Food          | Japanese   | Ambient | Radish   | British   |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep    |         |          | Jazz      |
| Nationality   | British    |         |          |           |

Since the Spanish and the fan of dubstep have different parity positions, the fan of dubstep must be in position 3. So, the music genre for the Spanish is blues.
