Lv9-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating corn is on the far left or far right, and we know the positions of some other elements, we can deduce that the person eating corn must be in position 1 or 3.

2. The fan of jazz is to the right of the person watching western movies. Since we know the position of the person watching western movies (either 1 or 3), we can deduce that the fan of jazz must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies. Since the person eating pumpkin can't be in position 1 (as the person eating corn is there), and the person watching spy movies can't be in position 3 (as the fan of jazz is there), the person eating watermelon must be in position 2.

4. The fan of pop is not to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person with the hobby of card-games can't be in position 1 (as the person eating corn is there), the fan of pop can't be in position 2 (as the person eating watermelon is there). So, the person with the hobby of card-games and the fan of pop must be in positions 3 and 1, respectively.

5. The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 2, the person watching time-travel movies can't be in position 1. So, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 3.

6. The accountant is the fan of jazz. Since we know the position of the fan of jazz (position 2), the accountant must be in position 2.

7. The person who's hobby is dancing is the engineer. Since we know the hobby of the engineer (dancing), we know that the engineer must be in a position where dancing is listed. The only available position is 1, as the person eating corn can't be the engineer (as per rule 9). So, the engineer is in position 1, and the hobby of the person in position 3 is dancing.

8. The person who's hobby is card-games is in position 3, and the fan of pop is in position 1.

9. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the pilot. Since the engineer (who dances) is in position 1, the pilot must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person eating watermelon is in position 2, the pilot must be in position 3.

10. The person watching western movies and the person eating corn have different parity positions. Since the person eating corn is in position 1 (odd) and the person watching western movies is in position 3 (odd), the person eating corn must be watching western movies.

11. The only food left for the person in position 2 is pumpkin.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different sports, we can place them in the first row, one in each column. Let's assume the order is Badminton (B), Basketball (C), and Rugby (R) from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the person who's sport is badminton (B) is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball (C). So, the possible order is BCR.

3. Now, let's place the jobs in the second row. Since there are 3 different jobs, each job must be in one of the columns. If we place the jobs in the order Photographer (P), Scientist (S), and Videographer (V) from left to right, we can check the positions of the sports and the rule 4, 8, and 10. If the person drinking hot-chocolate (H) is not to the right of the videographer (V), then the person drinking hot-chocolate (H) must be in the first or third column. But if H is in the first column, it violates rule 8 (the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the fan r&b), and if H is in the third column, it violates rule 10 (the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the photographer). So, H cannot be in the first or third column. Therefore, H must be in the second column. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate (H) is a scientist (S).

4. Now, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate (S) is a scientist. From rule 2, the owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking hot-chocolate have different parity positions. Since the scientist is in an even position (second column), the guinea-pig owner must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first column. So, the owner of the guinea-pig is the photographer (P).

5. Now, we know the photographer (P) is the owner of the guinea-pig. From rule 5, the fan r&b is not to the right of the photographer (P). So, the fan r&b must be in the third column.

6. Now, we know the fan r&b is in the third column. From rule 8, the person drinking hot-chocolate (S) is on the right of the fan r&b. So, the order is SBR.

7. Now, we know the order of the jobs is SBP. From rule 11, the fan r&b is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S). So, the fan r&b is in the second column.

8. Now, we know the fan r&b is in the second column. From rule 9, the fan r&b and the owner of the dog have different parity positions. Since the fan r&b is in an even position (second column), the owner of the dog must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the first column. So, the owner of the dog is the photographer (P).

9. Now, we know the owner of the dog is the photographer (P). From rule 13, the owner of the dog is on the far left. So, the order of the jobs is PBD.

10. Now, we know the order of the jobs is PBD. From rule 14, the person drinking hot-chocolate (S) is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby (R). So, the order of the sports is not BCR but BCR.

11. Now, we know the order of the sports is BCR. From rule 6, the person drinking milk (M) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (R). So, the order of the sports is BRM.

12. Now, we know the order of the sports is BRM. From rule 12, the fan techno is not to the right of the person who's sport is badminton (B). So, the fan techno must be in the second or third column. But if the fan techno is in the second column, it violates rule 3 (the fan techno is not to the right of the person drinking milk). So, the fan techno must be in the third column.

13. Now, we know the fan techno is in the third column. From rule 11, the fan r&b is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S). But we already placed the fan r&b in the second column. So, the fan r&b is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S).

14. Now, we know the fan r&b is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S). From rule 11, the fan r&b is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S). But we already placed the fan r&b in the second column. So, the fan r&b is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (S). This is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given rules.

The final solution table would be:

  |               |     1     |      2       |       3       |

Lv9-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 nationalities, the Indonesian cannot be in the first or third position. So, the Indonesian is either in position 2 or 4. If the Indonesian is in position 2, then the person eating pineapple must be in position 1 or 3. But since there are only 3 types of food, the person eating pineapple cannot be in position 1 (as it would mean the Indonesian is in position 1, which is not possible). So, the Indonesian is in position 4, and the person eating pineapple is in position 3.

2. The person eating garlic cannot be in the first position (as it would mean the owner of the rat is in the first position, but the fan of jazz is to the left of the owner of the rat, and there are only 3 positions). So, the person eating garlic is in position 2 or 4. But since the Indonesian is in position 4, the person eating garlic is in position 2.

3. The fan of jazz is in position 1 (as it is to the left of the owner of the rat, and the owner of the rat is in position 4).

4. The owner of the goldfish cannot be in the first or third position (as it would mean the owner of the rat is in the second position, but the fan of jazz is to the left of the owner of the rat, and the person eating garlic is to the left of the owner of the goldfish, and there are only 3 positions). So, the owner of the goldfish is in position 2 or 4. But since the person eating garlic is in position 2, the owner of the goldfish is in position 4.

5. The owner of the cat cannot be in the first position (as it would mean the person eating kiwi is in the first position, but the owner of the cat is to the left of the person eating kiwi, and there are only 3 positions). So, the owner of the cat is in position 2 or 4. But since the owner of the goldfish is in position 4, the owner of the cat is in position 2.

6. The person eating kiwi is in position 1 (as it is to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish, and the owner of the goldfish is in position 4).

7. The person who's sport is sailing is in position 3 (as it is to the left of the person eating kiwi, and the person eating kiwi is in position 1).

8. The owner of the rat is in position 4 (as it is to the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing, and the person who's sport is sailing is in position 3).

9. The person who's sport is lacrosse is in position 2 (as it is not to the right of the owner of the rat, and the owner of the rat is in position 4).

10. The fan of country is in position 3 (as it is to the right of the brazilian, and the brazilian is in the first position).

11. The brazilian is in position 1 (as it is not to the right of the fan of country, and the fan of country is in position 3).

Lv9-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 unique positions (3 rows and 2 people per row). Since we have 5 restrictions about the position of the person drinking lemonade, let's start by placing the lemonade drinker.

2. The lemonade drinker cannot be in the rightmost position (position 3) because of rule 1.1. Also, the lemonade drinker cannot be in position 2 because of rule 4. So, the lemonade drinker must be in position 1.

3. Now, the person drinking cola must be in position 2 or 3. If the cola drinker is in position 2, then the lemonade drinker and the cola drinker have the same parity positions (rule 5), which contradicts rule 3.3. Therefore, the cola drinker must be in position 3.

4. The person drinking milk is left, so it must be in position 1 or 2. If it's in position 1, then the lemonade drinker and the milk drinker have the same parity positions (since they are in the same row), which contradicts rule 3.3. So, the milk drinker is in position 2.

5. Now we know the beverages. Let's place the hobbies. The person with the hobby of sudoku cannot be in position 1 because of rule 8. So, it must be in position 2 or 3. If it's in position 2, then the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 1 (rule 8). But this would place the sudoku hobby to the left of the photography hobby, which contradicts rule 8. So, the sudoku hobby is in position 3. The person with the hobby of photography must be in position 1.

6. The person with the hobby of board-games cannot be in position 3 because of rule 4. So, it must be in position 1 or 2. If it's in position 1, then the person with the hobby of sudoku is to the right of the person with the hobby of board-games, which contradicts rule 2. So, the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2.

7. The person with the hobby of sudoku is to the right of the person with the hobby of photography (rule 2), so the person with the hobby of photography must be in position 1 and the person with the hobby of sudoku must be in position 3.

8. The person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, so the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2. This means the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3.

9. The person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, so the person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2. The person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3. This means the person with the hobby of photography is to the left of the person with the hobby of board-games, so the person with the hobby of board-games is not to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku, which satisfies rule 9.

10. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, and the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3. This means the person with the hobby of board-games is not the software-developer (since the software-developer must be to the left of the person with the hobby of lemonade, and the person with the hobby of board-games is to the right of the person with the hobby of lemonade). So, the software-developer is in position 1.

11. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, and the software-developer is in position 1. This means the person with the hobby of board-games is not the fisherman (since the fisherman is to the left of the person with the hobby of lemonade, and the person with the hobby of board-games is to the right of the person with the hobby of lemonade). So, the fisherman is in position 2.

12. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, and the fisherman is in position 2. This means the person with the hobby of board-games is not the nurse (since the nurse is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the person with the hobby of board-games is to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku). So, the nurse is in position 3.

13. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, and the fisherman is in position 2. The nurse is in position 3. This means the person with the hobby of board-games is not the cyclist (since the cyclist is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the person with the hobby of board-games is to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku). So, the cyclist is in position 1.

14. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, and the nurse is in position 3. This means the cyclist is not the parkour player (since the parkour player is not to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the cyclist is to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku). So, the parkour player is in position 2.

15. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, the nurse is in position 3, and the cyclist is in position 2. This means the parkour player is not the soccer player (since the soccer player is to the right of the cyclist, and the parkour player is to the left of the cyclist). So, the soccer player is in position 3.

16. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, the nurse is in position 3, the cyclist is in position 2, and the parkour player is in position 2. This means the soccer player is not the spy (since the spy has different parity positions with the cyclist, and the soccer player and the cyclist have the same parity positions). So, the spy is in position 1.

17. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, the nurse is in position 3, the cyclist is in position 2, the parkour player is in position 2, and the spy is in position 1. This means the soccer player is not the musical (since the musical has different parity positions with the cyclist, and the soccer player and the cyclist have the same parity positions). So, the musical is in position 3.

18. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, the nurse is in position 3, the cyclist is in position 2, the parkour player is in position 2, the spy is in position 1, and the musical is in position 3. This means the soccer player is not the fisherman (since the fisherman is to the left of the person with the hobby of lemonade, and the soccer player is to the right of the person with the hobby of lemonade). So, the fisherman is the person drinking milk.

19. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is drinking milk, the nurse is in position 3, the cyclist is in position 2, the parkour player is in position 2, the spy is in position 1, and the musical is in position 3. This means the soccer player is the person drinking cola.

20. The person with the hobby of board-games is in position 2, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 1, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3, the software-developer is in position 1, the fisherman is drinking milk, the nurse is in position 3, the cyclist is in position 2, the parkour player is in position 2, the spy is in position 1, the soccer player is drinking cola, and the musical is in position 3. This means the person drinking lemonade is the person with the hobby of superhero movies (since the person with the hobby of superhero movies is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the person with the hobby of sudoku is in position 3).

2. The Canadian owns the horse, so let's place the Canadian in position 2 (since the horse owner is to the right of the Canadian).

3. The Colombian is to the right of the horse owner. So, the Colombian can only be in position 3.

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the writer. Since the Colombian (who is the writer) is in position 3, the guinea-pig owner can be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the guinea-pig owner in position 1 (to avoid conflicts with the next clues).

5. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is in position 3, the motorbike driver can only be in position 2 or 3. Let's place the motorbike driver in position 3 (to avoid conflicts with the next clues).

6. The Canadian is not to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the motorbike driver is in position 3 and the Canadian is in position 2, the trike driver must be in position 1.

7. The gardener is on the right of the writer. Since the writer is in position 3 and the gardener is in position 1, the gardener must be in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is not yet placed, let's place the drawing person in position 3 (to avoid conflicts with the next clues).

10. Now we can place the software-developer. Since the drawing person is in position 3 and the software-developer is to the right of the drawing person, the software-developer can only be in position 2 or 3.

1. Since there are 3 people and an odd number of them have hiking as a hobby, let's assume the hiker is in position 1, 2, or 3. If the hiker is in position 1, then the police-officer cannot be in position 2 because of rule 1 (different parity positions). So, the hiker must be in position 2 or 3. If the hiker is in position 3, then the police-officer must be in position 1 (rule 3). But this would mean the hiker is to the right of the ship driver (rule 4), which is not possible since there are only 3 positions. Therefore, the hiker must be in position 2.

2. The singer is the police-officer (rule 9), so the singer cannot be in position 1 or 3 (rule 2). The singer must be in position 2.

3. The teacher cannot be in position 1 or 3 (rule 11), so the teacher is in position 2.

4. The person drinking tea must be in position 1 (rule 5).

5. The person drinking water cannot be in position 1 or 3 (rules 2, 8, and 10), so the person drinking water is in position 3.

6. The person driving the car cannot be in position 1 or 3 (rules 2, 8, and 10), so the person driving the car is in position 2.

1. Since there are 3 people and 3 options for each category, we can assign a number from 1 to 3 to each person for each category. Let's start with the nationalities:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Malaysian    | M |  |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 1, the Malaysian is not drinking tea, so we can assign tea to any of the other two people. Let's assign tea to person 2 for now:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T |  |
   | Malaysian    | M | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 4, the Mexican is not drinking hot-chocolate, so we can assign hot-chocolate to person 1:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T |  |
   | Malaysian    | H | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 9, the person who's sport is basketball is on the far left. Since we have already assigned hot-chocolate and tea to the first two people, the only option left for the first person is basketball:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T |  |
   | Malaysian    | B | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 8, the engineer is on the far left. Since the first person is the engineer, the first person is also the Malaysian:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T |  |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 5, the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the person drinking tea must be in position 2:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T |  |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 3, the police-officer is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we don't know the position of the person playing ice-hockey yet, we can't place the police-officer yet.

   From rule 7, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the nurse. Since we don't know the position of the nurse yet, we can't place the person with the hobby of board-games yet.

   From rule 6, the pakistani is not the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we don't know the position of the person with the hobby of cooking yet, we can't place the Pakistani yet.

   From rule 10, the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is card-games have different parity positions. Since the person playing basketball is in position 1 (odd), the person with the hobby of card-games must be in an even position. However, we don't know which even position yet.

   From rule 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking tea is in position 2 (even), the person playing ice-hockey must also be in an even position. However, we don't know which even position yet.

   At this point, we don't have enough information to place the police-officer, the person with the hobby of board-games, the Pakistani, and the person with the hobby of card-games. We also don't know the position of the person playing ice-hockey and the person with the hobby of cooking.

   Let's continue with the remaining information:

   From rule 10, the person who's sport is basketball and the person who's hobby is card-games have different parity positions. Since the person playing basketball is in position 1 (odd), the person with the hobby of card-games must be in an even position. Let's try position 2 for the person with the hobby of card-games:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | M |

   From rule 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking tea is in position 2 (even), the person playing ice-hockey must also be in an even position. Let's try position 4 for the person playing ice-hockey:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | I |

   From rule 3, the police-officer is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person playing ice-hockey is in position 4, the police-officer must be in position 5:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | I |
   | Police-Officer|   |   | O |

   From rule 7, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the nurse. Since the police-officer is in position 5, the nurse must be in position 4:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T |  |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | I |
   | Police-Officer|   |   | O |
   | Nurse        |   |   | B |

   From rule 6, the pakistani is not the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person with the hobby of cooking must be in an odd position, and the only odd position left is position 1, the Pakistani must be in position 3:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T | P |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | I |
   | Police-Officer|   |   | O |
   | Nurse        |   |   | B |

   From rule 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking tea is in position 2 (even), the person playing ice-hockey must also be in an even position. However, we already placed the person playing ice-hockey in position 4, which is an even position. This contradicts rule 2. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle.

   The final solution table should look like this, but with the position of the person playing ice-hockey and the person with the hobby of cooking still unknown:

   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---| T | C |
   | Malaysian    | E | T | P |
   | Mexican      |   | M |  |
   | Pakistani    |   |   | I |
   | Police-Officer|   |   | O |
   | Nurse        |   |   | B |

   However, the positions of the person playing ice-hockey and the person with the hobby of cooking cannot be determined with the given information."
Lv9-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 hobbies and 3 transport options, we can assign hobby to rows 1, 2, and 3, and transport to columns A, B, and C. Since the helicopter driver and the board-games person have different parity positions, we can assign them to positions that are not the same parity (odd and even). Let's assign board-games to position 1 (odd) and helicopter to column B (odd).

2. The dog owner cannot be to the left of the Colombian. Since the Colombian is on the far left or far right (rule 8), the dog cannot be in the first or last row. So, the dog can be in rows 2 or 3. Let's assign the dog to row 2.

3. The hedgehog owner and the board-games person have different parity positions. Since we already assigned the board-games person to an odd position, the hedgehog owner must be in an even position. Since the dog is in row 2, the hedgehog can be in row 1 or 3. Let's assign the hedgehog to row 3.

4. The person who's hobby is card-games is the person driving the helicopter (rule 4). So, card-games goes to row 1 and helicopter to column B.

5. The person driving the trike and the Nigerian have different parity positions (rule 5). Since the Nigerian is not in the first or last row (rule 8), the trike driver must be in an odd position. Since the helicopter driver is in an odd position (row 1), the trike driver must be in row 3.

6. The fan country is not the person driving the helicopter (rule 4). Since the fan country cannot be in the first or last row (rule 8), it must be in row 2. So, country goes to row 2.

7. The fan soul and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions (rule 10). Since the trike driver is in an odd position (row 3), the fan soul must be in an even position. Since the Colombian is in an even position (rule 8), the fan soul can be in row 1 or 2. Let's assign soul to row 1.

8. The fan dubstep is on the left or right of the Colombian (rule 11). Since the Colombian is in an even position (row 2), the fan dubstep can be in row 1 or 3. Let's assign dubstep to row 3.

9. The person driving the quad-bike is not the fan country (rule 6). Since the fan country is in row 2, the quad-bike driver must be in row 1 or 3. Since the fan dubstep is in row 3, the quad-bike driver must be in row 1.

10. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse (rule 7). Since the dog and the hedgehog are already assigned, the only remaining pet is the mouse. Since the Colombian is in an even position (row 2), the mouse owner can be in row 1 or 2. Let's assign gardening to row 1 and the mouse to row 2.

The final solution table is:

|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Card-games| Board-games |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | Country    | Dubstep     |
| Nationality   |           | Colombian  |            |
| Pet           |           |           | Mouse       |
| Transport     | Quad-bike | Helicopter | Trike       |

Since we didn't assign the nationality for the third person, we can't determine their nationality based on the given rules. So, the nationality column remains blank."
Lv9-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 beverages, 3 movie-genres, 3 nationalities, 3 pets, and 3 transports, we can arrange them in a 3x5 grid.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies. So, we can place milk in a position to the right of western movies. Let's place milk in the third column (Column 3).

3. From rule 2, the german and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions. Since there are 3 nationalities, they must be in the same row. Let's place German in the first row (Row 1) and horse in the second row (Row 2).

4. From rule 3, the Chinese and the owner of the pony have the same parity positions. Since they are not in the same row as the German and the horse (due to rule 2), they must be in the second row (Row 2) or the third row (Row 3). Let's place Chinese in the second row (Row 2) and pony in the third row (Row 3).

5. From rule 4, the person driving the bike is not to the right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is in the second row (Row 2), the bike cannot be in the third column (Column 3) or any column to the right of it. So, bike must be in Column 1 or Column 2.

6. From rule 5, the person watching crime movies is not to the right of the British. Since the British cannot be in the third column (Column 3) due to rule 8, the crime movies cannot be in the third row (Row 3) or any row below it. So, crime movies must be in the first two rows (Row 1 or Row 2).

7. From rule 6, the person watching western movies is not the person drinking iced-tea. Since the iced-tea cannot be in the third column (Column 3) due to rule 8, the western movies cannot be in the third row (Row 3) or any row below it. So, western movies must be in the first two rows (Row 1 or Row 2).

8. From rule 7, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is in the second row (Row 2), the goldfish must be in the third row (Row 3) or any row below it.

9. From rule 8, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since milk is in the third column (Column 3), the iced-tea must be in the fourth column (Column 4) or any column to the right of it.

10. From rule 9, the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the bike is in Column 1 or Column 2, the subway must be in Column 4 or any column to the left of it.

11. From rule 10, the person drinking milk is not German (due to rule 10). So, milk cannot be in Row 1.

12. From rule 11, the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish is in the third row (Row 3) or any row below it, crime movies can be in the first two rows (Row 1 or Row 2). If crime movies are in Row 1, the goldfish must be in Row 2 or Row 3. If crime movies are in Row 2, the goldfish must be in Row 3.

13. From rule 12, if crime movies are in Row 1, the goldfish cannot be in Row 3 (because the person watching crime movies would be to the right of the goldfish, violating rule 11). So, crime movies must be in Row 2.

14. From rule 13, if crime movies are in Row 2, the goldfish must be in Row 3.

15. From rule 12, if crime movies are in Row 2, the person watching western movies must be in Row 1 (because the person watching crime movies is to the left or right of the goldfish, and the goldfish is in Row 3).

16. From rule 15, if crime movies are in Row 2, the person drinking iced-tea must be in Row 4 (because the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking milk, and milk is in Column 3).

17. From rule 16, if crime movies are in Row 2, the person drinking milk must be in Column 1 (because the person drinking iced-tea is in Column 4, and the person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea).

18. From rule 17, if crime movies are in Row 2, the person watching western movies must be in Column 2 (because the person drinking milk is in Column 1).

19. From rule 18, if crime movies are in Row 2, the nationalities must be arranged as follows: British, Chinese, German.

20. From rule 19, if crime movies are in Row 2, the pets must be arranged as follows: Goldfish, Horse, Pony.

21. From rule 19, if crime movies are in Row 2, the transports must be arranged as follows: Bike, Subway, Jet-ski.

22. From rule 19, if crime movies are in Row 2, the beverages must be arranged as follows: Milk, Iced-tea, Mirinda.

So, if crime movies are in Row 2, the final solution table is:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage      | Milk    | Iced-tea| Mirinda  |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Western  |         |         |
| Nationality   | British | Chinese  | German   |         |
| Pet           | Goldfish| Horse    | Pony     |         |
| Transport     | Bike    | Subway   | Jet-ski  |         |

However, we need to check if this arrangement satisfies all the rules. Let's check:

- Rule 1: There are 3 different favourite beverages: iced-tea, milk, mirinda
- Rule 2: The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies (which is true)
- Rule 3: The german and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions (which is true)
- Rule 4: The chinese and the owner of the pony have the same parity positions (which is true)
- Rule 5: The person driving the bike is not to the right of the chinese (which is true)
- Rule 6: The person watching crime movies is not to the right of the british (which is true)
- Rule 7: The person watching western movies is not the person drinking iced-tea (which is true)
- Rule 8: The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking milk (which is true)
- Rule 9: The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the subway (which is true)
- Rule 10: The german is not the person drinking milk (which is true)
- Rule 11: The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (which is true)

Since all the rules are satisfied, if crime movies are in Row 2, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage      | Milk    | Iced-tea| Mirinda  |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Western  |         |         |
| Nationality   | British | Chinese  | German   |         |
| Pet           | Goldfish| Horse    | Pony     |         |
| Transport     | Bike    | Subway   | Jet-ski  |         |
#############

Now, let's check if there is another arrangement that satisfies all the rules. If crime movies are in Row 1, the nationalities, pets, and transports must be arranged differently. However, after trying all possible arrangements, I couldn't find another arrangement that satisfies all the rules. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage      | Milk    | Iced-tea| Mirinda  |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Western  |         |         |
| Nationality   | British | Chinese  | German   |         |
| Pet           | Goldfish| Horse    | Pony     |         |
| Transport     | Bike    | Subway   | Jet-ski  |         |

Lv9-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nurse to the left of the musician (5) and the owner of the ferret to the left of the nurse (4). This leaves us with the electrician and the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog (1), the owner of the hedgehog must be the electrician, and the owner of the rat is the musician.

2. The person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person playing basketball (2). Since the nurse is to the left of the musician (5), the musician cannot be watching superhero movies. So, the electrician is watching superhero movies, and the musician is playing basketball.

3. The person watching mystery movies and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions (3). Since the electrician is watching superhero movies, the cyclist must be the musician (as we placed the electrician, musician, and nurse already). So, the musician is watching mystery movies.

4. The person eating cabbage is not to the right of the person watching superhero movies (7). Since the electrician is watching superhero movies, the person eating cabbage cannot be to the right of the electrician. So, the person eating cabbage is either the nurse or the musician. But the nurse cannot eat cabbage because the owner of the ferret is to the left of the nurse (4), and the owner of the ferret eats peas (which we will place later). So, the musician is eating cabbage.

5. The person eating papaya is not to the left of the electrician (9). Since the electrician is watching superhero movies, the person eating papaya cannot be to the left of the electrician. So, the person eating papaya is either the nurse or the musician. But the musician is eating cabbage, so the nurse must be eating papaya.

6. The person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person eating papaya (10). So, the electrician is watching time-travel movies.

7. The person playing baseball is on the far right (11). Since the electrician is watching time-travel movies, the person playing baseball must be the musician (as we placed the electrician, musician, and nurse already).

8. The nurse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cycling (8). Since the musician is cycling, the nurse must be to the right of the musician.

9. The owner of the hedgehog is the musician (1). Since the musician is playing basketball, the owner of the hedgehog is playing baseball.

10. The owner of the rat is the electrician (1). Since the electrician is watching superhero movies, the owner of the rat is not eating cabbage (4). So, the owner of the rat eats peas.

11. The only food left for the nurse is cabbage (as the musician is eating cabbage and the electrician is eating peas).

Final solution table:

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Food          | Electrician | Musician   | Nurse     |
| Job           | Electrician | Musician   | Nurse     |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel | Superhero  | Mystery   |
| Pet           | Ferret     | Hedgehog   | Rat       |
