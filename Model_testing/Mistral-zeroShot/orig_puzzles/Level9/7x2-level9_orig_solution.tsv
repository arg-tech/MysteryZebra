Lv9-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different nationalities (dutch and german), we can place them in the first and second columns respectively. Let's assume the nationality in the first column is Dutch and the second column is German.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      |            |           |
   | Food          |            |           |
   | Hobby         |            |           |
   | Job           |            |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |           |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

2. Since there are two different favourite beverages (lemonade, soy-milk), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Beverage column. Let's assume the first row is Lemonade and the second row is Soy-Milk.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          |            |           |
   | Hobby         |            |           |
   | Job           |            |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |           |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

3. Since there are two different types of food (garlic, radish), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Food column. Let's assume the first row is Garlic and the second row is Radish.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         |            |           |

   | Movie-Genre   |            |           |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

4. Since there are two different hobbies (baking, puzzles), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Hobby column. Let's assume the first row is Baking and the second row is Puzzles.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           |            |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |           |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

5. Since there are two different jobs (architect, firefighter), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Job column. Let's assume the first row is Architect and the second row is Firefighter.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Architect | Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   |            |           |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

6. Since there are two different movie-genres (family, superhero), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Movie-Genre column. Since the person watching superhero movies is on the far left, we place Superhero in the first row and Family in the second row.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Architect | Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   |            |           |

7. Since there are two different music-genres (dubstep, reggae), we can place them in the first and second rows of the Music-Genre column. Since the fan reggae is not to the left of the firefighter, the only possible position for Reggae is the second row. Dubstep can then be placed in the first row.

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Architect | Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep   | Reggae    |

8. The condition ""the person drinking lemonade and the german have the same parity positions##9"" means that if we number the rows and columns from 1 to 6, the sum of the row and column numbers for the Lemonade and German must be even. The only possible position for Lemonade that satisfies this condition is the first row (1+1=2, which is even). Since the German is in the second column (2), the Dutch must be in the first column (1).

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Architect | Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep   | Reggae    |

9. The condition ""the firefighter and the dutch have different parity positions##9"" is already satisfied since the Dutch is in the first column (1) and the Firefighter is in the second column (2).

10. The condition ""the person eating radish is not to the right of the fan reggae##8"" is already satisfied since the Radish is in the second row (2) and the Reggae is in the third row (3).

11. The condition ""the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the fan dubstep##5"" is already satisfied since Baking is in the first row (1) and Dubstep is in the first column (1).

So, the final solution table is:

   |               | Dutch      | German     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
   | Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Architect | Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Family    |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep   | Reggae    |

And we can wrap it with '#############' as follows:

#############
|               | Dutch      | German     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade  | Soy-Milk  |
| Food          | Garlic    | Radish    |
| Hobby         | Baking    | Puzzles   |

Lv9-7x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Polish is not to the right of the lawyer, so they can't be in positions 2, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, or 1 from left to right. This means they must be in position 2, 1, or 2 from right to left.

2. The person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since there are only two types of beverages, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1. So, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2.

3. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile, so they must be in position 2.

4. The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the cat has only two owners (as there are only two pets), one of them must have the cat and the other must not. Let's assume the person eating cabbage has the cat. Then, the person eating cabbage must be in position 1.

5. The Polish is the person drinking iced-tea, so they must be in position 1 (as the Polish can't be to the right of the lawyer and the only remaining position is 1).

6. The person watching spy movies and the person eating cabbage have the same parity positions. Since the person eating cabbage is in position 1, the person watching spy movies must also be in an odd position (1 or 3). However, the lawyer is in an odd position (1 or 3), so the person watching spy movies can't be the lawyer. Therefore, the person watching spy movies must be in position 3.

7. The person eating avocado is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 3 and the person eating avocado is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

8. The only remaining position for the lawyer is position 3.

9. The person watching scientific movies must be in position 1 (as the Polish is in position 1 and the Polish watches spy movies, the person watching scientific movies must be in the other position).

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea   | almond-milk |

Lv9-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 6, the architect and the person who plays golf have different parity positions. Since there are only two positions for each item, the architect must be in an odd position, and the person who plays golf must be in an even position.

2. From rule 7, the architect is not to the right of the person eating strawberry. Since the architect is in an odd position (as determined in step 1), the person eating strawberry must be in an even position.

3. From rule 4, the person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating strawberry. So, the person eating papaya must be in an odd position (one position to the right of the person eating strawberry).

4. Now we know the positions of the architect, the person eating strawberry, and the person eating papaya. Let's fill in the other positions with the remaining items. Since the architect is in an odd position, the person with the hobby of puzzles (also in an odd position) must be to the left of the architect. So, the hobby of puzzles is in position 1. The person watching family movies (also in an odd position) must be to the right of the person with the hobby of puzzles, so the movie genre is in position 3.

5. The person with the job of a police officer (even position) cannot be to the left of the person with the hobby of puzzles (odd position), so the job of a police officer is in position 2.

6. The person keeping a hedgehog (even position) cannot be to the left of the person driving the train (odd position), so the pet is in position 5. The person keeping a turtle (odd position) cannot be to the right of the person driving the ship (even position), so the pet is in position 6.

7. The person playing volleyball (even position) cannot be to the left of the person driving the ship (even position), so the sport is in position 4. The person playing golf (odd position) must be to the right of the person driving the train (odd position), so the sport is in position 7.

8. The person eating papaya (odd position) is to the right of the person eating strawberry (even position), so the food is in positions 2 and 6. Since papaya is in an odd position, it must be in position 6, and strawberry must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1      |       2        |
| Food          |   Puzzles  |   Strawberry  |

Lv9-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the pilot is in an odd position and there are 6 positions, the pilot must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the pilot is in position 1 (we'll check the other possibilities later).

2. The person eating garlic must be in position 2 or 6 (since the ferret owner is in an even position, and the garlic eater cannot be to the right of the ferret owner due to rule 2).

3. The person watching mystery movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (since the German is in position 2, and the mystery watcher must be to the left of the German due to rule 3). Let's assume the mystery watcher is in position 1.

4. The owner of the ferret must be in an even position (since the ferret owner and the soy milk drinker have the same parity positions due to rule 4). The only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. Since the garlic eater cannot be in position 6 (due to rule 2), the ferret owner must be in position 4.

5. The owner of the fish must be to the left of the reggae fan (due to rule 5). The only positions left for the fish owner are 1 and 2. Since the mystery watcher is in position 1, the fish owner must be in position 2.

6. Now, the only remaining positions for the reggae fan are 3 and 5. Since the pilot is in position 1 (assumption from step 1), the reggae fan must be in position 5.

7. The only remaining positions for the German are 3 and 6. Since the mystery watcher is in position 1 and the reggae fan is in position 5, the German must be in position 6.

8. The only remaining positions for the soy milk drinker are 3 and 4. Since the ferret owner is in position 4, the soy milk drinker must be in position 3.

9. The only remaining positions for the garlic eater are 2 and 6. Since the fish owner is in position 2, the garlic eater must be in position 6.

10. The only remaining positions for the apple eater are 1, 3, and 5. Since the mystery watcher is in position 1, the apple eater must be in position 3 (as the pilot was already placed in position 1).

11. The only remaining positions for the techno listener are 2 and 4. Since the garlic eater is in position 6, the techno listener must be in position 4.

12. The only remaining position for the Chinese is 5 (since the German is in position 6).

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Pilot    | 1     |
|  Apple     | 3     |

The pilot is indeed in an odd position (1). The other assumptions made in the steps above were correct, so the rest of the rules are also satisfied."
Lv9-7x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items in each row, and we have 7 clues. This means one item (either a beverage, food, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, or transport) is not mentioned in the clues and can be placed anywhere. Let's call this item X.

2. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different music-genres, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, 2 different sports, and 2 different transports, we can fill in the table with these items, leaving one spot for X.

3. From clue 1, the two beverages cannot be in the same column. So, let's place Cola in the first column and Sprite in the second column.

4. From clue 2, the two foods cannot be in the same row. So, let's place Onion in the first row and Potato in the second row.

5. From clue 3, the Canadian cannot be in the same column as the person drinking Cola. Since Cola is in the first column, the Canadian cannot be in the first column.

6. From clue 4, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person drinking Cola. Since Cola is in the first row, the skateboard must be in the first column of the first row.

7. From clue 5, the owner of the mouse and the person eating onion have different parity positions (odd or even). Since the skateboard is in the first column (odd position), the onion cannot be in the first column. So, let's place Onion in the second column of the second row (even position).

8. From clue 6, the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the Canadian. Since the Canadian cannot be in the first column, the pony can be in the first column or the third column. However, the skateboard is already in the first column, so the pony must be in the third column.

9. From clue 7, the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person eating onion. Since Onion is in the second column of the second row, the hip-hop fan must be in the third column of a row to the right of the second row.

10. From clue 2, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left. Since the skateboard is already in the far left, the snowboarding must be in the first row.

Now, let's fill in the remaining items:

- The nationality of the person in the first row, second column must be Canadian, as the Canadian cannot be in the first column.
- The pet of the person in the first row, second column must be X, as all other pets are placed.
- The music-genre of the person in the first row, second column must be Disco, as Hip-hop is placed in the third column of a row to the right of the second row.
- The sport of the person in the second row, second column must be Sailing, as Snowboarding is in the first row.
- The transport of the person in the second row, second column must be X, as all other transports are placed.

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | Cola        | Sprite   |
| Food          | Onion       | Potato   |
| Music-Genre   | Disco       | Hip-hop  |

| Sport         | Snowboarding| Sailing   |
| Transport     | Skateboard  | X        |

Where X is the missing item that was not mentioned in the clues."
Lv9-7x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two jobs, let's assign them to the rows. Let's say the electrician is in row 1 and the firefighter is in row 2.

2. Similarly, since there are only two favorite beverages, let's assign them to the columns. Let's say Fanta is in column 1 and Sprite is in column 2.

3. Since there are only two movie-genres, let's assign them to the next available rows below the jobs. Let's say Disaster is in row 3 and Horror is in row 4.

4. Since there are only two music-genres, let's assign them to the next available columns. Let's say Gospel is in column 3 and Rock is in column 4.

5. Since there are only two nationalities, let's assign them to the next available rows below the movie-genres. Let's say Colombian is in row 5 and Japanese is in row 6.

6. Since there are only two pets, let's assign them to the next available columns. Let's say Hedgehog is in column 5 and Snake is in column 6.

7. Now let's solve the clues:

   - The electrician is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the jobs are already assigned, the only possible position for the tennis player is row 2. So, the electrician must be in row 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the electrician is to the right of the tennis player, the electrician must be in row 4 or 6. But the electrician can't be in row 6 because the Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the snake (which is in row 6), so the electrician must be in row 4.

   - The person drinking sprite and the person watching horror movies have the same parity positions. Since the Sprite is in column 2 and Horror is in row 4, they have the same parity (both are in even positions). So, the person drinking Fanta must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is row 1.

   - The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in row 2 and the electrician (who watches Disaster) is in row 4, the Disaster watcher must be in row 5 or 6. But since the Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the snake (which is in row 6), the Disaster watcher must be in row 5.

   - The owner of the hedgehog is not the fan of Rock. Since the Rock fan must be in an odd position (as the Fanta drinker is), and the only odd position left is row 1, the hedgehog owner must be in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the Disaster watcher is in row 5, the hedgehog owner can't be in row 5. So, the hedgehog owner must be in row 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the snake (which is in row 6), the hedgehog owner must be in row 2 or 4. But since the person watching disaster movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions, the hedgehog owner must be in an even position. So, the hedgehog owner must be in row 4.

   - The person watching disaster movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions. Since the Disaster watcher is in row 5 and the hedgehog owner is in row 4, they have the same parity (both are in even positions).

8. Now we have the positions filled:

   |               |      1      |      2      |
   | Beverage      | Fanta      | Sprite     |
   | Job           | Electrician| Firefighter|
   | Movie-Genre   | Disaster   | Horror     |
   | Music-Genre   | Gospel     | Rock       |
   | Nationality   | Colombian  | Japanese   |
   | Pet           | Hedgehog   | Snake      |
   | Sport         | Tennis     | Basketball  |

Lv9-7x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different items in each category, so we can fill in the table with 6 unique items. Let's label them A-F for now.

|               |    1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | A       | B          |
| Food          | C       | D          |
| Hobby         | E       | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G       | H          |

| Pet           | K       | L          |
| Sport         | M       | N          |

2. From point 1, we know that the owner of the hamster (L) is on the left of the person eating peas (D). So, K and D are in positions 1 and 2 respectively in the Food column.

3. The person drinking soy-milk (B) and the person who's hobby is video-games (F) have the same parity positions. Since they are both unique items, they must be in the same row (even or odd positions). Since B is in the Beverage column, F must be in the Hobby column.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games (F) is not to the right of the person eating peas (D). So, F cannot be in position 2. Therefore, F must be in position 1, and B must be in position 2.

5. The dutch (J) is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (A). Since A is in the Beverage column, J cannot be in position 1. So, J must be in position 2 or 3. But J cannot be in position 3 because the Dutch is not the pet owner (K). So, J must be in position 2.

6. The person drinking soy-milk (B) is the person watching zombie movies (H). So, B and H must be in the same row. Since B is in the Beverage column, H must be in the Movie-Genre column.

7. Now we know that B and H are in the same row, and F and B have the same parity positions. Since F is in the Hobby column, the other items in the same row must be in the Nationality, Pet, and Sport columns. Since J (Dutch) is in position 2, the Pet and Sport must be in positions 1 and 3. But the pet owner (K) cannot be in position 1 because the owner of the hamster (L) is in position 1. So, K must be in position 3.

8. The person who's hobby is video-games (F) and the person who's sport is handball (N) have different parity positions. Since F is in position 1, N must be in position 2 or 3. But N cannot be in position 2 because the Dutch (J) is in that position. So, N must be in position 3.

9. Now we know that F, K, and N are in the same row. The only available position for the remaining item (M, Sport) is position 1.

10. The only remaining items are for the Food, Movie-Genre, and Nationality columns. Since the Dutch (J) is in position 2, the Food must be in position 1. The Movie-Genre can be either mystery (G) or zombie (H), but since B (soy-milk) is watching zombie movies (H), mystery (G) must be the remaining genre. The Nationality can be either canadian (I) or any other nationality (not J).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different sports (basketball and climbing), we can place them in the first two rows of the Sport column. Let's place basketball in the first row and climbing in the second row.

   |               |     1      |     2      |

   | Sport         | Basketball  | Climbing   |

2. Since there are 2 different hobbies (card-games and filmmaking), we can place them in the first two rows of the Hobby column. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat (not yet placed), we can place filmmaking in the first row and card-games in the second row.

   | Sport         | Basketball  | Climbing   |

3. Since there are 2 different movie-genres (crime and superhero), we can place them in the first two rows of the Movie-Genre column. Since the fan of punk and the person watching superhero movies have different parity positions (meaning they can't be in the same row), we can place crime in the first row and superhero in the second row.

6. Since there are 2 different types of food (cabbage and kale), we can place them in the first two rows of the Food column. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is not the person eating cabbage, we can place kale in the first row and cabbage in the second row.

Lv9-7x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From condition 1, we know that the person watching family movies and the fan of punk have different parity positions. This means they can't be in the same position (even or odd). Let's label the positions as E (even) and O (odd).

2. From condition 2, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. This means the mirinda and tennis positions are E and O respectively. Let's say mirinda is in position 1 (E) and tennis is in position 2 (O).

3. From condition 3, the person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating cranberry. Since we know the positions of mirinda and tennis, the only possible positions for cranberry and pepper are 1 and 2 respectively (as 3 and 5 are not valid due to condition 1). So, cranberry is in position 2 (O) and pepper is in position 1 (E).

4. From condition 4, the American and the owner of the goldfish have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of mirinda, tennis, cranberry, and pepper, the only possible positions for American and goldfish are 3 and 4 (as 5 and 6 are not valid due to condition 1). The American can't be in position 3 because it would violate condition 5 (the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the fan of country, and the only position left for the fan of country is position 3). So, the American is in position 4 (O) and the goldfish is in position 3 (E).

5. From condition 5, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the fan of country. Since we know the positions of mirinda, tennis, cranberry, pepper, American, and goldfish, the only possible positions for country and hedgehog are 5 and 6 (as 1, 2, 3, and 4 are not valid due to condition 1). So, the fan of country is in position 5 (O) and the owner of the hedgehog is in position 6 (E).

The final solution table is:

|               |     1      |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |
| Beverage      |  mirinda   |  cranberry|         |         |  country  |  hedgehog |

| Pet           |         |  goldfish|         |         |  hedgehog |         |
| Sport         |         |         |         |  tennis  |  rowing   |         |

The solution assumes that the conditions are mutually exclusive and that the parity positions are consistent with the given conditions."
