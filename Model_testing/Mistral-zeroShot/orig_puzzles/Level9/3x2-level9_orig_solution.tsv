Lv9-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different movie-genres: epic and superhero. Let's assign them to the columns, say, column 1 for epic and column 2 for superhero.

2. We have 2 different nationalities: Australian and Malaysian. Let's assign them to the rows, say, row 1 for Australian and row 2 for Malaysian.

3. Now, let's consider the positions of the people driving the roller and the Malaysian. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the Malaysian, the Malaysian must be in position 1 (left) and the person driving the roller must be in position 2 (right). So, our table looks like this:

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Superhero  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Malaysian  |
   | Transport     |         |           |

4. Now, let's consider the people watching epic movies and the person driving the jet-ski. They have the same parity positions. This means that if we number the positions (1, 2), the person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies must be in positions with the same last digit (1 or 2). Since the Malaysian is already in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 1. So, our table looks like this:

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Superhero  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Malaysian  |
   | Transport     | Jet-ski  |           |

5. Now, we only have one empty cell left. Since there are 2 different means of transport: jet-ski and roller, the person watching superhero movies must be driving the roller. So, our final table is:

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Superhero  |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Malaysian  |
   | Transport     | Jet-ski  | Roller    |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-3x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, two different movie genres, and two different pets. So, we can fill in the first row, second row, and third row with unique items from each category. Let's start with the beverages: Hot-chocolate and Tea.

   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Tea  |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |      |
   | Pet           |               |      |

2. Now, let's fill in the movie genres. Since there are two different genres, they must be Martial-arts and Sports.

   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Tea  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts  | Sports|
   | Pet           |               |      |

3. The owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions##9. This means that if we number the rows from 1 to 2, the owner of the dog and the martial-arts viewer should be in the same position modulo 9. Since the martial-arts viewer is on the far left (row 1), the dog owner must also be in row 1. So, the pet in row 2 must be the dog.

   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Tea  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts  | Sports|
   | Pet           | Dog           |      |

4. The person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions##9. This means that the person drinking tea must be in row 2. Since there's only one position left in row 2, the pet in row 2 must be the hamster.

   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Tea  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts  | Sports|
   | Pet           | Dog           | Hamster|

Lv9-3x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 different hobbies, and 2 different pets, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |    1     |   2    |
   | Beverage   | milk    | soy-milk |
   | Hobby      | hiking  | sudoku  |
   | Pet        | ferret  | frog    |

   Now let's apply the clues:

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person drinking milk. This means that hiking cannot be in position 1 and milk cannot be in position 2. So, the current table is incorrect. Let's try rearranging:

   |            |    1     |   2    |
   | Beverage   | milk    | soy-milk |
   | Hobby      | sudoku  | hiking  |
   | Pet        | ferret  | frog    |

3. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. This means that frog cannot be in position 2. So, the current table is incorrect. Let's try rearranging:

   |            |    1     |   2    |
   | Beverage   | milk    | soy-milk |
   | Hobby      | hiking  | sudoku  |
   | Pet        | frog    | ferret  |

4. Now let's apply clue 1: There are 2 different favourite beverages, and the people have 2 different hobbies. The people have parity positions##9, which means that the positions of the same parity (either both odd or both even) should have the same beverage. In our table, position 1 and position 2 have different beverages, which is incorrect. Let's try rearranging:

   |            |    1     |   2    |
   | Beverage   | soy-milk| milk   |
   | Hobby      | hiking  | sudoku |

Lv9-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages (cola, milk), 2 different movie-genres (martial-arts, romance), and 2 different pets (frog, turtle), we can fill in the first row of the table with the beverages, the second row with the movie-genres, and the third row with the pets.

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      |                  |          |
   | Movie-Genre   |                  |          |
   | Pet           |                  |          |

2. From point 1, we have 6 variables (2 for beverages, 2 for movie-genres, and 2 for pets) and only 4 positions in the table. This means that some variables will have to be repeated in the table.

3. From point 2 of the puzzle, we know that the person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions (meaning they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions). Since there are only 4 positions, this means that one of the positions must be empty (to ensure both can't be in the same position). Let's assume the empty position is the first one.

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            |          |
   | Movie-Genre   |                  |          |
   | Pet           |                  |          |

4. From point 3, we know that the person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies can't be in the first position. Let's place the person watching romance movies in the second position (since it's an even position).

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            | Romance  |
   | Movie-Genre   |                  |          |
   | Pet           |                  |          |

5. From point 4, we know that the person drinking cola can't be in the second position (since it's the position of the person watching romance movies). The only remaining even position is the fourth one. So, the person drinking cola is in the fourth position.

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            | Romance  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts     |          |
   | Pet           |                  |          |

6. From point 2 of the puzzle, we know that the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking cola is in the fourth position and the only remaining position is the third one, the person drinking milk must be in the third position.

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            | Romance  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts     |   Turtle |
   | Pet           |                  |          |

7. From point 6, we know that the owner of the frog must be in the fifth and final position.

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            | Romance  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts     |   Turtle |
   | Pet           | Frog             |          |

8. Now we have filled all the positions with the given conditions. The final solution table is:

   |               |       Cola       |   Milk    |
   | Beverage      | Empty            | Romance  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts     |   Turtle |
   | Pet           | Frog             |          |

Lv9-3x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (card-games and writing), we can place one in row 1, column 1 and the other in row 2, column 1. Let's place writing in row 1, column 1 and card-games in row 2, column 1.

2. Similarly, since there are two different movie-genres (animation and mystery), we can place one in row 1, column 2 and the other in row 2, column 2. Since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, the person watching animation must be on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, let's place animation in row 1, column 2 and mystery in row 2, column 2.

3. Since there are two different types of sport (cycling and ice-hockey), we can place one in row 1, column 3 and the other in row 2, column 3. The people have 2 different hobbies with different parity positions, which means that the person who's hobby is writing and the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in the same row or column. Since writing is in row 1, column 1, the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in row 1. So, let's place cycling in row 1, column 3 and ice-hockey in row 2, column 3.

The final solution table is:

```
| Hobby         | Writing | Card-games |

Lv9-3x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food (raspberry and tomato), and two types of nationalities (French and Turkish), we can assign one food to each nationality. Let's say Raspberry for French and Tomato for Turkish.

2. Since there are two types of sports (Badminton and Skiing), and we know that the person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions (meaning they are in the same row or column), we can assign Badminton to the person eating raspberry. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      Raspberry   |   Tomato    |
   | Food          |   Badminton     |            |

   | Sport         |                |            |

3. Now we know that the Turkish is on the right of the person eating raspberry. Since the nationalities are in different columns, the Turkish must be in the second column (Tomato column). So, the table looks like this:

   |               |      Raspberry   |   Tomato    |
   | Food          |   Badminton     |   Tomato    |
   | Nationality   |   French        |   Turkish   |
   | Sport         |                |   Skiing    |

4. Since the person eating raspberry plays Badminton, and there are only two sports (Badminton and Skiing), the person eating tomato must play Skiing. So, the final table is:

   |               |      Raspberry   |   Tomato    |
   | Food          |   Badminton     |   Tomato    |

Lv9-3x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (camping, magic-tricks) and two different music-genres (classical, r&b), we can fill in the first row as follows:

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Hobby         | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical| R&B          |

2. Since there are two different pets (frog, rabbit), we can fill in the third row:

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Hobby         | Camping | Magic-tricks |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical| R&B          |
   | Pet           | Frog    | Rabbit       |

3. Now let's consider the second condition: the person who's hobby is camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions. Since the hobby of camping is in position 1 and the pet of rabbit is in position 3, we can't directly compare their positions. However, we can check the parity (odd or even) of the row numbers where their hobbies and pets are. In this case, the hobby of camping is in row 1 (odd) and the pet of rabbit is in row 3 (odd). So, the condition is not satisfied.

   This means that the hobby of camping should be in position 2 and the pet of rabbit should be in position 1. Let's swap them:

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Hobby         | Magic-tricks | Camping |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical| R&B          |
   | Pet           | Rabbit    | Frog       |

4. Now let's consider the third condition: the owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical. In our current table, the pet of frog is in position 2 and the music-genre of classical is in position 1. So, the condition is satisfied.

   Therefore, the final solution table is:

   |               |    1    |      2       |

Lv9-3x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different music genres (Country and Metal), we can fill the first row with either 'Country' in column 1 and 'Metal' in column 2, or vice versa. Let's assume 'Country' in column 1 and 'Metal' in column 2 for now.

2. Similarly, since there are two different sports (Baseball and Ice-Hockey), we can fill the second row with either 'Baseball' in column 1 and 'Ice-Hockey' in column 2, or vice versa. Let's assume 'Baseball' in column 1 and 'Ice-Hockey' in column 2 for now.

3. Now, let's analyze the positions based on the clues:

   - Clue 1: The fan of Country music and the person who plays Baseball have the same parity positions. Since we have Country in position 1 and Baseball in position 1, they are in the same position, which satisfies this condition.

   - Clue 2: The fan of Metal is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we don't know the position of the scooter yet, we can't verify this condition. Let's fill the third row with 'Scooter' in column 1 and 'Snowmobile' in column 2 for now.

   - Clue 3: The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person who plays Baseball. Since we have Baseball in position 1 and Scooter in position 3, and there are only two positions left (2 and 3), the Scooter must be in position 3, and the Snowmobile must be in position 2.

   - Now, we need to check Clue 2 again: The fan of Metal is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since we have Metal in position 2 and Scooter in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

1. Since there are two types of food (lime and spinach), and they must be in different positions, we can fill the first column as follows:
   |               |       Spinach      |     Lime     |

2. Similarly, there are two movie genres (time-travel and zombie), so we can fill the second row:
   | Food          | Spinach          |     Lime     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Time-travel      |     Zombie   |

3. Now, let's consider the parity positions. Parity is an integer that is either 0 or 1, and it's used to determine whether a number is even or odd. In this case, it seems that the person watching time-travel movies and the person who's sport is lacrosse have different parity positions. Since there are only two positions left for these two (one for the movie genre and one for the sport), they must have opposite parities. Let's assume that Time-travel has an even position and Lacrosse has an odd position.

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right, so it must be in the second column (Lime). This means that Time-travel must be in the first column (Spinach).
   |               |       Spinach      |     Lime     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Time-travel      |     Zombie   |

5. Now, we know that Time-travel is in the first column and Spinach is in the second column. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating lime, so the final arrangement is:

1. We have 2 different movie-genres: mystery and romance. Let's assign them to the columns, with mystery in column 1 and romance in column 2.

2. We have 2 different nationalities: American and Colombian. Let's assign them to the rows, with American in row 1 and Colombian in row 2.

3. Now, let's consider the condition that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres. Since we have only 2 movie-genres, this condition is already satisfied.

4. Next, let's consider the condition that the people use 2 different means of transport. Since we have only 2 means of transport, let's assign them to the transport column. Let's say bus in row 1 and quad-bike in row 2.

5. Now, let's consider the condition that the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the bus. This means that the person watching romance movies (in column 2) should be in row 1 or row 2, but not in row 1 (because the bus is in row 1). So, the person watching romance movies is in row 2.

6. Now, let's consider the condition that the American and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions. The positions are determined by the row number (1 for American and 2 for the person watching romance movies). Since they have different parity (1 is odd and 2 is even), they cannot be in the same column. This means that the American cannot be watching romance movies. So, the American is watching mystery movies.

7. Now, we know that the American is in row 1 and watching mystery movies, so the transport in row 1 must be a quad-bike (since the American is not driving the bus).

8. Finally, the Colombian is in row 2 and watching romance movies.
