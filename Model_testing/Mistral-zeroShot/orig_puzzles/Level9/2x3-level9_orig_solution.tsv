Lv9-2x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, we know that the owner of the rabbit is to the right of the owner of the horse. Let's assume the horse is on the left (position 1) or the right (position 3).

   | Nationality   |   1    |    2    |    3     |
   | Pet           |    H   |         |    R     | (Horse on the left, Rabbit on the right)

2. From point 1, we know that the owner of the rabbit is not on the left of the owner of the horse. So, the horse cannot be on the left (position 1).

   | Nationality   |   2    |    3    |    1     |
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |         | (Horse on the right, Rabbit on the left)

3. From point 2, we know that the Mexican is not to the left of the German. Since the horse is on the right, the German must be on the left.

   | Nationality   |   2    |    G    |    3     |
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |         | (German on the left, Horse on the right, Rabbit in the middle)

4. From point 4, we know that the owner of the hamster and the German have the same parity positions. Since the German is on the left, the hamster must also be on the left.

   | Nationality   |   2    |    G    |    H     |
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |    P     | (Hamster on the left, German in the middle, Horse on the right, Rabbit in the middle)

5. From point 5, we know that the owner of the hamster is not to the left of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is on the right, the hamster cannot be on the left.

   | Nationality   |   3    |    G    |    H     |
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |    P     | (Hamster on the right, German in the middle, Horse on the right, Rabbit in the middle)

6. From point 6, we know that the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the Egyptian. Since the German is in the middle, the Egyptian must be on the right.

   | Nationality   |   3    |    G    |    H     | E
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |    P     |

7. Now we have placed all nationalities, and the pets are also placed according to the given conditions. So, the final solution is:

   | Nationality   |   3    |    G    |    H     | E
   | Pet           |    H   |    R    |    P     |

Lv9-2x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of cooking is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with 'cooking'.

|             |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby       | cooking |         |           |
| Transport   |         |         |           |

2. The person driving the airplane and the person who's hobby is hiking have different parity positions##9. This means that the airplane cannot be in position 9 (middle) because cooking (position 9) is already filled. So, the airplane can be either 1 or 3. Let's assume the airplane is in position 1 for now.

|             |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby       | cooking |         |           |
| Transport   | airplane|         |           |

3. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike##5. Since the airplane is in position 1 and we can't have dancing to the left of it, dancing must be in position 3.

|             |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby       | cooking |         | dancing   |
| Transport   | airplane|         | quad-bike |

4. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship##2. This means that the quad-bike cannot be in position 1 (since the airplane is there) or position 3 (since dancing is there). So, the quad-bike must be in position 2.

|             |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Hobby       | cooking | quad-bike| dancing   |
| Transport   | airplane|         | ship      |

5. Now, all the hobbies and transports are filled, so the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person eating carrot (let's say in position 1) as they are the owner of the guinea-pig (from rule 4).

   |        |     1     |    2     |     3      |
   | Food   | Carrot   |          |            |
   | Pet    | Guinea-pig|          |            |

2. Since the person eating carrot is in position 1, the person eating cucumber (let's say in position 3) cannot be to the left of the owner of the horse (from rule 1). So, the owner of the horse must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The person eating cucumber is between the owner of the fish and the person eating carrot (from rule 2). Since the person eating carrot is in position 1, the person eating cucumber must be in position 2.

   |        |     1     |    2     |     3      |
   | Food   | Carrot   | Cucumber |            |
   | Pet    | Guinea-pig| Fish     |            |

4. The owner of the horse is not to the right of the person eating carrot (from rule 3). So, the owner of the horse must be in position 2.

   |        |     1     |    2     |     3      |
   | Food   | Carrot   | Cucumber | Horse     |
   | Pet    | Guinea-pig| Fish     | Horse     |

5. The person eating cucumber and the owner of the fish have the same parity positions (from rule 5). Since the person eating cucumber is in an even position (2), the owner of the fish must also be in an even position (1 or 2). But we already have the fish owner in position 2, so the fish owner must be in position 1.

   |        |     1     |    2     |     3      |
   | Food   | Carrot   | Cucumber | Horse     |
   | Pet    | Guinea-pig| Fish     | Horse     |

6. Now, we have filled all the positions with the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

   ```#############

   | Food   | Carrot   | Cucumber | Horse     |
   | Pet    | Guinea-pig| Fish     | Horse     |

   The person eating blueberry is not mentioned in the rules, so it can be any of the three positions."
Lv9-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 3 people and 3 movie genres, so each person watches a different genre. Similarly, we have 3 pets, so each person owns a different pet.

2. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching romance movies. This means the lizard cannot be in the last position (position 3) because the person watching romance movies must be on the right of the lizard owner.

3. The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog. This means the frog cannot be in the first position (position 1) because the person watching documentary movies must be on the right of the frog owner.

4. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right. This means there are only two possible positions for documentary movies: position 1 or position 3.

5. The person watching documentary movies and the owner of the lizard have the same parity positions. Since documentary movies can be in position 1 or 3, the lizard can only be in position 2 (to ensure the parity is the same).

Now, let's put the information together:

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Western | Romance |
| Pet           | Lizard | Frog | Mouse |

Since the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching romance movies, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3. Therefore, the movie genres are:

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Western | Romance |

And the pets are:

|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |
| Pet           | Lizard | Frog | Mouse |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |    2    |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Western | Romance |

Lv9-2x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is the same person throughout (rule 1), we can fill that position with 'water'.

2. Now we know that the person drinking water is in position 3. So, we can fill positions 1 and 2 with the remaining beverages, cola and tea. Let's assume cola is in position 1 and tea is in position 2.

3. The person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking cola (rule 2). So, our current arrangement is correct.

4. The person drinking water and the fan of country have the same parity positions (rule 3). Since water is in position 3, the fan of country should also be in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3). But since we already placed the fan of country (tea) in position 2, this rule is violated. Let's swap cola and tea to make the fan of country an odd-numbered position. So, our new arrangement is:

   | Beverage |    1    |   2   |    3    |
   |---------|---------|-------|---------|
   | Music-Genre |         |       |         |
   |         |         | country | water   |

5. The person drinking water is on the left of the fan of metal (rule 4). In our current arrangement, water is in position 3 and metal is not yet defined. So, this rule cannot be checked yet.

6. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water (rule 5). In our current arrangement, water is in position 3 and hip-hop is not yet defined. So, this rule cannot be checked yet.

Since we have filled all the positions with valid information from the rules, and none of the rules are violated, our final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage |    1    |   2   |    3    |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| Music-Genre |         | country | water   |
#############

Now we just need to fill the missing Music-Genre for positions 1 and 2. Since the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the person drinking water (rule 5), and the fan of metal is not yet defined, we can place hip-hop in position 2 and metal in position 1.

Final solution:

#############
| Beverage |    1    |   2   |    3    |
|---------|---------|-------|---------|
| Music-Genre | metal  | country | water   |

Lv9-2x3-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Chinese cannot be in the first position (position 1) because the nationality to their right is Nigerian, and there are only 3 nationalities. So, the Chinese must be in position 2 or 3.

2. The person who prefers surfing is between skateboarding and the French. Since the French cannot be in the first position, the surfing person must be in position 2 or 3. If the surfing person is in position 2, then skateboarding must be in position 1 (to the left of the surfing person), and the French in position 3. However, this contradicts rule 1 because the Chinese cannot be in position 3. So, the surfing person must be in position 3, which means skateboarding is in position 1 and the French in position 2.

3. The Chinese and the person who prefers parkour have different parity positions. Parity refers to whether a number is even or odd. In this case, positions 1, 2, and 3 are odd numbers, so the Chinese and the parkour person cannot be in the same position. Since the Chinese is in position 2, the parkour person must be in position 1 (to the left of the Chinese).

4. The person who prefers surfing is not to the left of the person who prefers surfing. This rule is already satisfied because the surfing person is in position 3, and there is no one to their left who prefers surfing.

5. Now we know the nationalities and sports:
   - Position 1: Parkour (Chinese)
   - Position 2: Skateboarding (French)
   - Position 3: Surfing (Nigerian)

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs and three nationalities, so each cell in the table will contain one job and one nationality.

2. The Japanese is on the left of the entrepreneur, so the Nationality column for job 1 cannot be Japanese, and the Nationality column for job 2 must be Japanese.

3. The pilot is not to the left of the Brazilian. This means the Nationality column for job 1 cannot be Brazilian, and the Nationality column for job 3 must be Brazilian.

4. The pilot and the Brazilian have different parity positions. This means either the pilot is in an odd position (1, 3) and the Brazilian is in an even position (2), or vice versa. Since the pilot is on the far left or far right (rule 4), the pilot must be in position 1 or 3. If the pilot is in position 1, then the Brazilian must be in position 2. In this case, the parity rule is satisfied because 1 (pilot) is odd and 2 (Brazilian) is even. So, the Nationality column for job 1 is Brazilian, and the Nationality column for job 2 is Japanese.

5. The Job column for position 3 is the pilot, so the Job column for position 1 must be something other than pilot. The only job left is engineer, so the Job column for position 1 is engineer.

6. The Job column for position 2 is the entrepreneur, as the Job column for position 1 is engineer and the Nationality column for position 1 is Brazilian (which is not Japanese, so the entrepreneur cannot be in position 1).

7. The only nationality left is Pakistani, so the Nationality column for position 3 is Pakistani.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-2x3-8	"Let's break down the given conditions and try to find a solution:

1. We know that there are three types of food (kale, lemon, pear) and three jobs (dancer, designer, journalist).

2. The journalist eats lemon (J1L1).

3. The journalist is not to the right of the dancer, so they cannot be in positions 2 or 3 (J1L1, J3L3 are not possible). This means the journalist must be in position 1, and the dancer must be in either position 2 or 3.

4. The dancer and the person eating kale have the same parity positions. Since the journalist is in position 1 (an odd position), the dancer must be in an even position (D2 or D3). If the dancer were in position 2, the person eating kale would have to be in position 3 (K3), but then the journalist would be to the right of the dancer, which contradicts condition 2. So, the dancer must be in position 3 (D3), and the person eating kale must be in position 2 (K2).

5. The person eating pear is between the journalist and the dancer. Since the journalist is in position 1 and the dancer is in position 3, the person eating pear must be in position 2 (P2).

6. The person eating kale and the dancer have the same parity positions. This condition is already satisfied since we have determined that the dancer is in position 3 (even) and the person eating kale is in position 2 (even).

7. The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the designer. Since we don't know the position of the designer yet, we can't confirm this condition. However, since the person eating kale is in position 2, it doesn't matter where the designer is placed.

Now let's put the final solution table:

```

| Food   |     Lemon   |   Pear   |  Kale  |

Since we cannot confirm the position of the designer, the table above is the best possible solution based on the given conditions."
Lv9-2x3-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fisherman is not to the left of the doctor, so the Fisherman cannot be in the first column (1).
2. The person drinking sprite and the fisherman have different parity positions. Parity is odd or even, and since the Fisherman is not in the first column, the Sprite drinker cannot be in the first column either (as both would have the same parity if they were in the same column). So, neither the Fisherman nor the Sprite drinker is in the first or second column.
3. The doctor is between the fisherman and the person drinking milk. Since the Fisherman is not in the first column, the Doctor cannot be in the first column either. Also, the Doctor cannot be in the third column because then the Doctor would be to the right of the person drinking milk, which contradicts the condition. So, the Doctor must be in the second column.
4. Now we know the Doctor is in the second column, so the Fisherman must be in the third column (as the Doctor is between the Fisherman and the Milk drinker).
5. Since the Sprite drinker cannot be in the first or second column, the Sprite drinker must be in the first column.
6. The only beverage left for the second column is Milk.

Final solution:

```

Lv9-2x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of punk is a paramedic, so we can place the paramedic in the first column (1) and the punk genre in the first row (1).

   |-------|------|-------|-------|

2. Since the fan of punk is a paramedic, the fan of soul cannot be in the first column (1) because the fan of punk is to the left of the fan of soul. So, we can place the fan of soul in the second column (2).

   | Job   | 1    | 2    |   3   |

   |-------|------|------|-----|
   | Music | punk |     | indie|

4. The coach and the fan of indie have the same parity positions##9. This means that if we number the positions from left to right (1, 2, 3), the coach and the fan of indie must be in positions that add up to 9. The only possible positions for the coach are 1 and 3, but since the fan of indie is already in position 3, the coach must be in position 1.

   | Job   | 1    | 2    | 3   |

   |-------|------|------|-----|
   | Music | punk | soul | indie|

6. To find the jobs, we know that the paramedic is a fan of punk, so the job in the first row (1) is paramedic. The coach is in the third column (3), so the job in the third row is coach. The only job left is writer, so it must be in the second row (2).
