Lv9-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the owner of the rat cannot be in positions 4, 3, or 2 (since the owner of the ferret would be in position 1). So, the rat can only be in position 1, 5, or 6.

2. From rule 2, the owner of the rat is to the right of the Brazilian, so the rat cannot be in position 1. So, the rat can only be in positions 5 or 6.

3. From rule 3, the Chinese is on the left or right of the German. Since the Chinese cannot be in position 1 (because the rat is there), the Chinese can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. But if the Chinese were in position 6, the German would have to be in position 5, which contradicts rule 9 (German and ferret have different parity positions). So, the Chinese cannot be in position 6.

4. Now, the Chinese can only be in positions 2 or 4. If the Chinese were in position 2, the German would have to be in position 1, which also contradicts rule 9 (German and ferret have different parity positions). So, the Chinese must be in position 4.

5. Now we know the Chinese is in position 4. From rule 7, the Chinese is between the Brazilian and the owner of the guinea-pig. So, the Brazilian can only be in position 1, and the guinea-pig owner can only be in position 3.

6. From rule 6, the hamster owner is to the left of the Chinese. So, the hamster owner can only be in position 2.

7. From rule 5, the Mexican is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. So, the Mexican can only be in position 5 or 6. But if the Mexican were in position 6, the rat would have to be in position 5, which contradicts rule 8 (rat and Chinese have the same parity positions). So, the Mexican must be in position 5.

8. Now we know the Mexican is in position 5. From rule 4, the guinea-pig owner is in position 3. So, the ferret owner must be in position 1.

9. From rule 9, the German and the ferret have different parity positions. Since the ferret is in position 1, the German must be in position 2.

10. Finally, from rule 8, the rat and the Chinese have the same parity positions. Since the Chinese is in position 4, the rat must be in position 6.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-2x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left or far right, let's assume that dancing is either in position 1 or 4.

2. If dancing is in position 1, then coffee and traveling must be in positions 2 and 3 respectively (since they have the same parity positions and coffee is to the right of almond-milk). This leaves position 4 for tea, but then dancing is to the right of tea, which contradicts rule 4. So, dancing cannot be in position 1.

3. Now, let's assume that dancing is in position 4. Then, tea must be in position 1 (since it's on the far left or far right), coffee in position 2, and traveling in position 3 (since they have the same parity positions). This leaves position 4 for almond-milk and position 2 for cola. But this arrangement violates rule 3, as drawing is not to the right of sudoku.

4. Let's try another arrangement for dancing: dancing in position 2. This means tea is in position 1, coffee in position 3, and traveling in position 4. This leaves position 2 for almond-milk and position 4 for cola. This arrangement satisfies all the rules.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |    1    |    2    |      3      |     4     |

Lv9-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, the person drinking cola is on the far left, so cola must be in position 1.
2. From rule 3, the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking fanta, so fanta must be in position 2.
3. From rule 5, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta, so coffee must be in position 3.
4. From rule 6, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating artichoke, so artichoke must be in position 4.
5. From rule 7, the person eating artichoke is not to the left of the person eating avocado. Since artichoke is in position 4, avocado cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, avocado must be in position 4. But this contradicts rule 4, as artichoke and avocado cannot be in the same position. However, we can swap artichoke and avocado, making artichoke position 3 and avocado position 4.
6. From rule 8, the person drinking cola and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions. Since cola is in position 1 (odd), avocado must be in an odd position as well (position 3). But this contradicts our previous placement of avocado in position 4. However, we can swap cola and avocado, making cola position 3 and avocado position 1.
7. From rule 9, the person drinking cola and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions. Now, both cola and avocado have the correct parity.
8. From rule 2, the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. So, artichoke must be in position 4.
9. From rule 1, the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person eating mango. Since fanta is in position 2, mango can be in position 1, 3, or 4. But since artichoke is in position 4, mango cannot be in position 4. So, mango must be in position 1 or 3. However, if mango were in position 1, it would be to the left of the person drinking cola (avocado), which contradicts rule 5. So, mango must be in position 3.

The final solution table is:

2. The fan of indie is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of hip-hop (dressmaker) is in the first position, the fan of reggae must be in the second position (2). Now we can fill in the second row and second column:

   |               |         1          |       2        |   3    |     4      |

3. The fan of indie is somewhere to the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in the first position, the fan of indie must be in the third position (3). Now we can fill in the third row and third column:

   |               |         1          |       2        |   3    |     4      |

4. The fan of trance is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since we don't know the position of the security-guard yet, we can't fill in the fourth column yet. However, we know that the fan of trance has the same parity position as the software-developer. This means they are either both in even positions (2 and 4) or both in odd positions (1 and 3).

5. The fan of indie is on the left of the coach. Since the fan of indie is in the third position, the coach must be in the fourth position (4). Now we can fill in the fourth row and fourth column:

6. The security-guard is on the left or right of the coach. Since the coach is in the fourth position, the security-guard must be in the second or third position. However, we know that the fan of trance has the same parity position as the security-guard. If the security-guard was in the second position, the fan of trance would be in the fourth position, which would violate the parity rule. Therefore, the security-guard must be in the third position. Now we can fill in the third row:

7. Now we know that the security-guard is in the third position, and the fan of trance has the same parity position as the security-guard. Since the security-guard is in an odd position (3), the fan of trance must be in the first position (1). Now we can fill in the first row:

   |               |         1          |       2        |   3    |     4      |

8. Finally, we know that the software-developer and the fan of trance have the same parity positions. Since the software-developer is in the first position (1), the software-developer must be the fan of trance. Now we can fill in the first row:

Lv9-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the fans and pets in such a way that no two fans are adjacent (to avoid violating rules 2, 3, 7, and 9). So, we can place the fans in columns 1, 3, 4, and 6, and the pets in rows 2, 3, 4, and 5.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | Cat | Dog | Hedgehog | Pony |

2. From rule 4, the owner of the dog is to the left of the fan country. Since the fans are in columns 1, 3, 4, and 6, the dog must be in row 3.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | Cat | Dog | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        |   |   | Dog |   |   |

3. From rule 6, the fan classical is not the owner of the dog. So, the fan classical cannot be in column 3. Let's place it in column 1.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre | Classical |   | Dog | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        |   |   | Dog |   |   |

4. From rule 3, the owner of the dog and the fan classical have different parity positions. Since the fan classical is in position 1 and the dog is in position 3 (which is an odd position), the fan classical's position must be even. So, the fan classical is in position 2.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---| Classical | Dog | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        |   |   | Dog |   |   |

5. From rule 7, the fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan classical. So, the fan hip-hop is in position 1.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---| Classical | Dog | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        | Hip-hop |   | Dog |   |   |

6. From rule 2, the owner of the cat and the fan blues have different parity positions. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 1 (an odd position), the fan blues must be in an even position. The only even position left is position 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---| Classical | Dog | Blues | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        | Hip-hop |   | Dog | Cat |   |

7. From rule 8, the owner of the cat is on the right of the fan blues. So, the cat must be in position 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---| Classical | Dog | Blues | Cat | Hedgehog | Pony |
   | Pet        | Hip-hop |   | Dog | Cat |   |   |

8. From rule 5, the owner of the cat is on the left of the fan hip-hop. This is already satisfied as the cat is in position 4 and the fan hip-hop is in position 1.

9. From rule 6, the fan classical is not the owner of the dog. This is already satisfied as the fan classical is in position 2 and the dog is in position 3.

10. From rule 4, the owner of the dog is to the left of the fan country. This is already satisfied as the dog is in position 3 and the country fans are in positions 1, 3, 4, and 6.

11. From rule 1, the fan country is not the owner of the hedgehog. Since the fans are in positions 1, 3, 4, and 6, the hedgehog must be in position 5.

12. From rule 9, the owner of the pony is not the fan hip-hop. This is already satisfied as the fan hip-hop is in position 1 and the ponies are in positions 2, 3, 4, and 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the documentary person is on the far left (since we can always swap positions if needed).

2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. So, scientific movies are in the second position, and superhero movies are in the fourth position.

3. The indian is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. So, the indian is in the third position.

4. The American and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions. Since scientific movies are in the second position (even), the American must be in an even position as well. This means the American cannot be in the first position (since documentary is on the far left), so the American is in the fourth position.

5. The person watching superhero movies and the American have different parity positions. Since the American is in the fourth position (even), the superhero person must be in the first position (odd).

6. The indian is not to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the indian is in the third position, animation movies must be in the fifth position.

7. The thai is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. So, the thai is in the fourth position.

8. The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the thai. Since the thai is in the fourth position, documentary movies must be in the first position (as we assumed earlier).

9. We have already placed all the nationalities, so there's no need to check this condition.

Final solution:

```

Since we assumed the documentary person is on the far left, we can swap the positions of the American and the Documentary person to get the final solution:

```

Lv9-2x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the chef is to the right of the entrepreneur (1), and there are only 4 positions, the chef cannot be in position 1. So, the chef must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

2. The owner of the ferret and the librarian have the same parity positions (9). This means they cannot be in the same position, and one of them must be in an even position, and the other in an odd position. Since the chef is the owner of the pony (3), the chef cannot be in an even position (1 or 2). So, the chef must be in position 4, and the librarian must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. The librarian is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla (4). This means the librarian cannot be in position 4. So, the librarian must be in position 1 or 2.

4. The owner of the ferret is to the left of the photographer (5). Since the librarian is in position 1 or 2, the owner of the ferret cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.

5. The owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the ferret (6). Since the chef is the owner of the pony and is in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3, and the owner of the pony must be in position 2.

6. Now we know the positions of the chef, the owner of the ferret, and the owner of the pony. The only pet left is the chinchilla. Since the librarian is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (4), the librarian must be in position 1.

Lv9-2x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the sports are lacrosse, sailing, soccer, and skateboarding, and the music genres are funk, hip-hop, punk, and salsa. We'll use the numbers 1 (lacrosse), 2 (sailing), 3 (soccer), 4 (skateboarding) for the sports and F (funk), H (hip-hop), P (punk), S (salsa) for the music genres.

2. From the first rule, we know that the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the person who's sport is sailing. So, H cannot be in position 2.

3. From the second rule, the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is sailing and the person who's sport is skateboarding. So, 3 must be between 2 and 4.

4. From the third rule, the person who's sport is soccer and the fan of salsa have different parity positions. Since 3 is even (between 2 and 4), the fan of salsa must be odd, which means it cannot be F (funk) or S (salsa) in position 1, 2, or 4. So, S cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. From the fourth rule, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. So, 4 must be to the left of 1.

6. From the fifth rule, the fan of salsa is not to the right of the fan of punk. Since S cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, and H is not in position 2, S cannot be in position 3 either, so S must be in position 4.

7. From the sixth rule, the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the fan of punk. Since H cannot be in position 2, H must be in position 1.

8. From the seventh rule, the fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of funk. Since S is in position 4, F must be in position 3.

9. Now we know the positions of all the music genres, and since the sports are between the music genres, we can place the sports. The fan of soccer is between sailing and skateboarding, so it must be in position 3. Sailing is to the left of soccer, so it must be in position 2. Skateboarding is to the left of lacrosse, so it must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:

2. From rule 2, the owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit. So, the rabbit cannot be in position 4. Let's place the rabbit in position 2 (swapping it with the hamster), and the hamster in position 3 (swapping it with filmmaking). Now, the fish is in position 1 and the rabbit is in position 2.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the mouse. So, the mouse cannot be in position 1 (left of the rabbit). Let's place the mouse in position 4.

4. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already placed the rabbit (gardening) in position 2, let's place woodworking in position 1.

5. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the fish. Since we already placed the fish in position 1, the gardener cannot be in position 1. Let's place the gardener in position 3 (swapping it with filmmaking). Now, the rabbit is in position 2, woodworking in position 1, and filmmaking in position 3.

7. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is woodworking and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions. Since woodworking is in position 1 and the rabbit is in position 2, they have the same parity (both are odd positions). So, the pet of the person who's hobby is woodworking cannot be the fish (position 1 is odd, and fish is an even numbered position). Let's place the mouse (an even numbered pet) in position 1 (swapping it with woodworking). Now, the woodworker is in position 3 and the mouse is in position 1.

8. Now, we have only one pet left, the hamster. Since the hamster is in an odd position (rule 7), it cannot be in position 1 (the mouse is already there). Let's place the hamster in position 2 (swapping it with the rabbit). Now, the rabbit is in position 3 and the hamster is in position 2.

9. Finally, we have only one hobby left, singing. Since singing is to the right of gardening (rule 6), it cannot be in position 3 (gardening is already there). Let's place singing in position 4.

The final solution table is:

  |         |      1      |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Hobby   | singing    |   hamster |   gardening|   filmmaking|
| Pet     |   mouse    |   rabbit  |   fish     |   hamster |

Lv9-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the trike is not to the left of the person eating broccoli, the broccoli cannot be in the first column. So, broccoli can only be in columns 2, 3, or 4.

2. The person eating watermelon and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions. Since watermelon is in the far right (6th position), trike must be in an even position (2nd or 4th).

3. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram. Since the tram cannot be in the first column (because broccoli is not there), the tram can only be in columns 2, 3, or 4. If the tram is in the 1st or 3rd column, the snowmobile must be in the 2nd or 4th column, which violates rule 5 (papaya is between snowmobile and trike). So, the tram must be in the 4th column.

4. The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is in the 3rd or 4th column (from rule 3), pepper can only be in the 1st or 2nd column.

5. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike. Since the snowmobile is in the 3rd or 4th column and the trike is in the 2nd or 4th column (from rule 2), papaya can only be in the 1st column.

6. Now we know the positions of all the food items. The person driving the car must be in the remaining position, which is the 5th column (since watermelon is in the 6th column).

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |   1    |     2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food        | Papaya | Pepper    | Snowmobile | Watermelon |
| Transport   | Car   |           |          |           |
