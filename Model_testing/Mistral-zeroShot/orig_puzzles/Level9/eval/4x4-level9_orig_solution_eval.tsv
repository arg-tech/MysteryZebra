Lv9-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities in the Nationality column. Since the Canadian is not to the right of the person driving the van, we can place the Canadian in the 1st, 3rd, or 4th position (not the 2nd position). Let's place the Canadian in the 1st position (1). Now, the person driving the van must be Argentine, Dutch, or Chinese (2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions). Let's place the van driver in the 4th position (4). This means the person driving the scooter must be in the 2nd position (2). The Dutch must be in the 3rd position (3) because they are between the person driving the boat (not specified yet) and the Canadian (1).

2. Now, let's place the music genres. Since the fan dubstep is not the Argentine (14), it must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions. Let's place it in the 2nd position (2). The fan folk must be in the 1st position (1) because it is to the right of the fan dubstep (14). The fan soul must be in the 3rd position (3) because the Canadian is to the right of the fan soul (9). The fan trance must be in the 4th position (4) because the Dutch and the fan trance have different parity positions (15).

3. Now, let's place the food. Since the person eating carrot is to the left of the Argentine (4), the carrot eater must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd positions. Let's place the carrot eater in the 1st position (1). The person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the argentine (8), so it must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th positions. Let's place the cauliflower eater in the 2nd position (2). The person eating lime is to the left of the person eating cauliflower (11), so the lime eater must be in the 1st position (1). This means the person eating pumpkin must be in the 4th position (4).

4. Finally, let's place the transport. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person driving the van (5), the bus driver must be in the 2nd position (2). The person driving the boat is not specified yet, so it can be in any position. The person driving the van is in the 4th position (4).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all the items are in different positions, we can start by placing the items in the first row (Food, Movie-Genre, Pet, Transport) in any order. Let's assume the order is Food, Pet, Movie-Genre, Transport for now.

2. From rule 1, the person eating watermelon and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity positions. Since the positions are numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, an odd position is occupied by watermelon or guinea-pig. Let's place watermelon in position 1 (odd) and guinea-pig in position 3 (odd).

3. The owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position (rule 4), so the pet row must be in the order: Guinea-pig, Horse, Mouse, Bird.

4. From rule 2, the person driving the motorbike is the owner of the guinea-pig. So, Motorbike must be in position 3.

5. From rule 3, the person eating pear is not the person driving the skateboard. Since we know the motorbike driver is the guinea-pig owner, the skateboard cannot be in position 3. Let's place the skateboard in position 2 (even).

6. From rule 6, the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since we know the guinea-pig is in position 3 and the skateboard is in position 2, the mouse cannot be in position 4. Let's place the mouse in position 1 (even).

7. From rule 7, the person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right. Since we know the mouse is in position 1, the satire movies cannot be in position 1. Let's place satire movies in position 4 (odd).

8. From rule 8, the person eating watermelon is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since we know the nectarine is in position 1, the watermelon must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the watermelon and guinea-pig have the same parity (rule 1), and the guinea-pig is in position 3, the watermelon cannot be in position 3. So, the watermelon must be in position 2.

9. From rule 9, the person driving the boat is the owner of the horse. Since we know the guinea-pig is in position 3 and the watermelon is in position 2, the horse must be in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the person driving the boat is on the far right. Since we know the horse is in position 4, the transport must be in the order: Boat, Jet-ski, Motorbike, Skateboard.

11. From rule 11, the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since we know the motorbike is in position 3 and the skateboard is in position 2, the jet-ski cannot be in position 4. Let's place the jet-ski in position 1.

12. From rule 12, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since we know the satire movies are in position 4, the disaster movies must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the skateboard have the same parity (rule 14), and we know the skateboard is in position 2, the disaster movies cannot be in position 2. So, the disaster movies must be in position 1.

13. From rule 13, the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person eating pear. Since we know the skateboard is in position 2 and the pear is not in position 1 (rule 5), the pear cannot be in position 3. So, the pear must be in position 4.

14. From rule 14, the person driving the skateboard and the person watching disaster movies have the same parity. Since we know the skateboard is in position 2 and the disaster movies are in position 1, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 3.

15. From rule 15, the person driving the jet-ski is between the person eating watermelon and the person eating nectarine. Since we know the watermelon is in position 2 and the nectarine is in position 1, the jet-ski must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Colombian is on the far left or far right, they cannot be in positions 2 or 4. So, they must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Colombian is in position 1 for now.

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the person drinking fanta. So, the volleyball player cannot be in position 1 (since the Colombian is drinking fanta). Therefore, the volleyball player must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

3. The owner of the ferret is between the person who's sport is climbing and the person drinking mirinda. Since the Colombian is in position 1 and they are not climbing, the ferret owner cannot be in position 1. So, the ferret owner must be in position 2, 3, or 4. The person who's sport is climbing is to the left of the person drinking mirinda, so the person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But we already have the Colombian in position 1, so the person drinking mirinda cannot be in position 1. So, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2 or 3.

4. The owner of the dog is to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person drinking mirinda is not the person who's sport is climbing, the owner of the dog cannot be in position 2 (since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2). So, the owner of the dog must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

5. The japanese is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Colombian is in position 1 and they are not Japanese, the Japanese cannot be in position 1. So, the Japanese must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the chinese. Since the Colombian is in position 1 and they are not Chinese, the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But we already have the person drinking mirinda in position 2, so the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 2. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 1 or 3.

7. The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the japanese. Since the Japanese cannot be in position 1, the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 2 (since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2). So, the person drinking sprite must be in position 3 or 4.

8. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 2, the person who's sport is climbing cannot be in position 3. So, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1 or 4. But we already have the Colombian in position 1, so the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 4.

9. The owner of the rat is between the japanese and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Japanese cannot be in position 1, the owner of the rat cannot be in position 2 (since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2). So, the owner of the rat must be in position 3 or 4. But we already have the person drinking sprite in position 3, so the owner of the rat must be in position 4.

10. The japanese is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1, the Japanese cannot be in position 2 (since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2). So, the Japanese must be in position 3.

11. The russian is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 4, the Russian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the Russian must be in position 4.

12. The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person drinking sprite. This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle. However, based on the given information, we can still fill in the table as follows:

| Beverage      | fanta  | mirinda | sprite | hot-chocolate |

Lv9-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Let's place them in the last two columns and the superhero movies in the column to their left.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      |   |   |   |   |
| Movie-Genre|   | Superhero |   |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

2. From rule 2, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since we already placed the superhero movies to the right of the lemonade, the comedy movies must be in the first two columns. Let's place comedy in the first column and crime in the second.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Comedy | Crime |   |   |
| Movie-Genre|   | Superhero |   |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

3. From rule 3, the person drinking fanta and the police-officer have different parity positions. Since we have two even positions (1 and 2) and two odd positions (3 and 4), the police-officer must be in position 3 or 4. Let's place the police-officer in position 3 for now.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Comedy | Crime | Police-Officer |   |
| Movie-Genre|   | Superhero |   |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

4. From rule 4, the manager is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the police-officer is in position 3, the manager can't be in position 4. So, the manager must be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the manager in position 1 for now.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Manager | Crime | Police-Officer |   |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Superhero |   |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

5. From rule 5, the manager is not the person watching comedy movies. So, the manager can't be in position 1. Therefore, the manager must be in position 2, and the designer (who drinks fanta, as per rule 13) must be in position 1.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Designer | Crime | Police-Officer |   |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Superhero |   |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

6. From rule 6, the designer and the person watching crime movies have the same parity positions. Since the designer is in position 1, the person watching crime movies must also be in an even position. The only even position left is position 2. So, the person watching crime movies is the librarian.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Designer | Librarian | Police-Officer |   |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Crime | Superhero |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

7. From rule 7, the designer is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the person drinking lemonade. Since the designer is in position 1 and the person drinking lemonade is in position 4, the owner of the horse must be in position 2 or 3. However, the owner of the horse can't be in position 2 because the librarian is there. So, the owner of the horse is in position 3.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Designer | Librarian | Owner of Horse | Person drinking Lemonade |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Crime | Superhero |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

8. From rule 8, the police-officer is not to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in position 3, the police-officer can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the police-officer is in position 4.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Designer | Librarian | Owner of Horse | Police-Officer |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Crime | Superhero |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

9. From rule 9, the person drinking almond-milk is not the person watching crime movies. Since the librarian is watching crime movies, the person drinking almond-milk can't be in position 2. So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1.

| Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
|----------|---|---|---|---|
| Job      | Designer (Almond-Milk) | Librarian (Crime) | Owner of Horse (Superhero) | Police-Officer (Fanta) |
| Movie-Genre| Comedy | Crime | Superhero |   |
| Pet      |   |   |   |   |

10. From rule 10, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in position 2, the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 3 or 4. So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1. But we already placed the designer drinking almond-milk in position 1. This is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in rule 10.

11-18. Rules 11-18 don't provide any new information that can help us fill the table further.

The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency, and it's not possible to fill the table completely based on the given rules."	{'beverage': ['1', '2', '3', '4'], 'job': ['designer (almond-milk)', 'librarian (crime)', 'owner of horse (superhero)', 'police-officer (fanta)'], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', 'crime', 'superhero', ''], 'pet': ['', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv9-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the parity positions of the person eating broccoli and the nurse are different, we can assign them to odd and even positions. Let's say Broccoli is in position 1 (odd) and the nurse is in position 2 (even).

2. The bartender is to the left of the person eating broccoli, so the bartender must be in position 0.

3. The person eating grapefruit and the person who's sport is baseball have different parity positions, so let's assign baseball to an odd position (3) and grapefruit to an even position (4).

4. The pilot is to the left of the person who's sport is cricket, so the pilot must be in position 0 or 1. Since the pilot is not the owner of the mouse (from rule 9), the pilot can't be in position 1 (where the nurse is). So, the pilot is in position 0.

5. The person eating nectarine is not to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, so nectarine can't be in position 0, 1, or 2. So, nectarine is in position 3 (the only remaining position). This means the sport of cricket is also in position 3 (from rule 11).

6. The owner of the goat and the bartender have different parity positions, so the goat can't be in position 0 (where the bartender is). So, the goat is in position 2.

7. The nurse is not to the left of the owner of the goat, so the nurse can't be in position 0 or 1. So, the nurse is in position 4.

8. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket, so snowboarding is in position 4.

9. The owner of the fish is on the left of the person eating garlic, so the owner of the fish is in position 0 or 1. Since the owner of the fish is not to the left of the person who's sport is baseball (from rule 12), the owner of the fish can't be in position 0. So, the owner of the fish is in position 1.

10. The owner of the hamster is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and the person who's sport is baseball. Since the mouse is in position 4 and the baseball is in position 3, the hamster can be in positions 2 or 3. Since the pilot is in position 0 and the goat is in position 2, the hamster can't be in position 2. So, the hamster is in position 3.

   | coffee  |   |   |   |   |
   | fanta   |   |   |   |   |
   | milk    |   |   |   |   |
   | soy-milk|   |   |   |   |

   Since the person drinking fanta and the person eating lemon have different parity positions, let's assign an odd number to fanta and an even number to lemon. Let's assign 1 to fanta and 2 to lemon.

2. Now we can assign the numbers to the foods. Since the person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the person eating milk (#5), the cauliflower cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, let's assign it to position 3 or 4. Let's assign it to position 3 for now.

   Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the fan soul (#7), the soy-milk cannot be in position 4. So, let's assign it to position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies (#10), it cannot be in position 4. So, let's assign it to position 1 or 2. Let's assign it to position 1 for now.

Lv9-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is rowing is in an even position, they can be in positions 2, 4. Let's place them in position 4 (rowing).

2. The person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. So, the person eating radish can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 1 (because the person eating radish must be to their right), the person eating radish can't be in position 1 either. So, the person eating radish must be in position 3. Let's place the person who's hobby is photography in position 1.

3. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. So, the person driving the roller can only be in positions 1, 2. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in position 1, the person driving the roller must be in position 2. Let's place the person driving the helicopter in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles and the person driving the helicopter have the same parity positions (9). Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 3, the person who's hobby is puzzles can only be in position 6 or 8. However, the person who's hobby is puzzles can't be in position 8 because the person driving the roller is in position 2 and they must be on opposite sides (left and right). So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 6.

5. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish is in position 3 and the person driving the helicopter is in position 3, this condition is not applicable. Let's ignore this condition for now.

6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not the person driving the trike. So, the person driving the trike can only be the person who's sport is one of the remaining three (avocado, cucumber, lemon).

7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. However, the person who's hobby is skydiving can't be in position 1 because the person eating radish is in position 3 and they must be on opposite sides (left and right). So, the person who's hobby is skydiving can only be in position 2 or 3. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving can't be in position 3 (because the person eating radish is there), the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2. Let's place the person who's sport is water-polo in position 1.

8. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is in position 2, the person who's hobby is photography can only be in positions 1 or 3. However, the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 1 because the person eating radish is in position 3 and they must be on opposite sides (left and right). So, the person who's hobby is photography must be in position 3.

9. The person who's hobby is gardening and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions (9). Since the person who's sport is rowing is in position 4, the person who's hobby is gardening can't be in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is gardening can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, the person who's hobby is gardening can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person who's hobby is gardening can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the person who's hobby is gardening can't be in position 1 (because the person eating radish is there), the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 3.

10. The person eating avocado and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions (9). Since the person who's sport is rowing is in position 4, the person eating avocado can't be in position 4. So, the person eating avocado can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, the person eating avocado can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person eating avocado can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the person eating avocado can't be in position 1 (because the person who's hobby is photography is there), the person eating avocado must be in position 2.

11. The person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the trike is not the person who's sport is weightlifting (already placed in position 4), the person driving the trike can only be the person who's hobby is one of the remaining three (gardening, photography, skydiving). However, the person who's hobby is photography is already driving the roller, and the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2. So, the person driving the trike must be the person who's hobby is gardening.

12. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 3, the person who's sport is weightlifting can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting can only be in positions 4 or 6. However, the person who's sport is weightlifting can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 4.

13. The person eating radish is not to the left of the person eating lemon. Since the person eating radish is in position 3, the person eating lemon can't be in position 1. So, the person eating lemon can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, the person eating lemon can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person eating lemon must be in position 4.

14. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating cucumber can't be in position 1 (because the person who's hobby is photography is there), the person eating cucumber can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, the person eating cucumber can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person eating cucumber can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 4 (because the person who's sport is weightlifting is there), the person who's sport is skateboarding can only be in positions 2 or 3. However, the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 2 because the person eating avocado is there. So, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 3.

15. The person eating cucumber is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 4, the person eating cucumber can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the person eating cucumber must be in position 6.

16. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the right of the person eating lemon. Since the person eating lemon is in position 4, the person who's sport is water-polo can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the person who's sport is water-polo can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, the person who's sport is water-polo can't be in position 4 (because the person who's sport is rowing is there). So, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 1.

17. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 1 (because the person who's hobby is photography is there), the person driving the jet-ski can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 6 because the person who's hobby is puzzles is there. So, the person driving the jet-ski can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 3 (because the person eating radish is there), and the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 4 (because the person who's sport is rowing is there). So, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 2.

18. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 4, the person driving the roller can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. However, the person driving the roller can't be in position 1 (because the person who's hobby is photography is there), and the person driving the roller can't be in position 3 (because the person eating radish is there). So, the person driving the roller must be in position 2.

Lv9-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the Russian is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the person eating orange is in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the Russian is to the left of the person eating grapefruit (point 2), the Russian can't be in position 4. So, the Russian is either in position 1 or 2, and the person eating orange is in position 3 or 4.

2. From point 3, the parity (odd or even) of the positions of the Russian and the martial-arts movie watcher are different. Since the Russian is in position 1 or 2, the martial-arts movie watcher can't be in position 1 (as it would make both even), so the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2, 3, or 4.

3. From point 4, the Italian is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2, the Italian can't be in position 1. So, the Italian is in position 3 or 4.

4. From point 5, the person eating avocado is the person who surfs. So, the person eating avocado is in position 1 or 3 (since the sports movie watcher is on the far right, position 4).

5. From point 6, the Egyptian is somewhere between the Russian and the person eating peas. Since the Russian is in position 1 or 2 and the person eating peas can't be in position 1 (as the avocado eater is there), the Egyptian can't be in position 2. So, the Egyptian is in position 3 or 4.

6. From point 7, the Russian is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2, the Russian can't be in position 1 (as it would be on the left). So, the Russian is in position 3, and the person watching zombie movies is in position 4.

7. From point 8, the Italian is not to the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the sports movie watcher is on the far right, the Italian can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the Italian is in position 3 or 4.

8. From point 9, the person watching sports movies is in an even position. Since the sports movie watcher is on the far right, they are in position 4.

9. From point 10, the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the Pakistani. Since the person watching zombie movies is in position 4, the Pakistani can't be in position 3 or 4. So, the Pakistani is in position 1 or 2.

10. From point 11, the person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person eating avocado. Since the avocado eater is in position 1, the handball player is in position 2 or 3.

11. From point 12, the martial-arts movie watcher is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2, the snowboarder is in position 1, 3, or 4. But we know the snowboarder can't be in position 4 (as the person watching zombie movies is there), and the handball player is in position 2. So, the snowboarder is in position 1.

12. From point 13, the Italian and the person who's sport is sailing have different parity positions. Since the Italian is in an even position (4) and the handball player is in an odd position (2), the sailor must be in an odd position (1 or 3). But we know the snowboarder is in position 1, so the sailor is in position 3.

13. From point 14, the person eating peas is in position 1 or 2. Since the snowboarder is in position 1, the person eating peas must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

2. Now, let's place the person who's hobby is filmmaking according to rule 2. They must be between the owner of the chinchilla (position 4) and the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person who's sport is climbing can't be in position 1 (rule 8), they must be in position 3. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking goes in position 2.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is rugby. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 8), it must be in position 2, 5, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person eating asparagus can't be in position 1 (rule 4), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 7, so rugby can't be in position 2. If it's in position 5, then the owner of the rat can't be in position 4 (rule 15), so it must be in position 6. This would violate rule 14, so rugby can't be in position 5. If it's in position 6, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 7 (rule 6), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so rugby can't be in position 6. Therefore, rugby must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person eating asparagus. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 4), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's sport is climbing can't be in position 3 (rule 2), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 8, so asparagus can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 6), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 3, so asparagus can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 5 (rule 9), so it must be in position 4. This would violate rule 8, so asparagus can't be in position 6. Therefore, asparagus must be in position 5.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 9), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's sport is climbing can't be in position 3 (rule 2), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 9, so skateboarding can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 6), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's sport is climbing can't be in position 5 (rule 2), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 6. Therefore, skateboarding must be in position 1.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is climbing. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 2), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 2, so climbing can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 6), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so climbing can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's sport is rugby can't be in position 3 (rule 7), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so climbing can't be in position 6. Therefore, climbing must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is volleyball. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 6), it must be in position 2, 4, or 5. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 5, so volleyball can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is rugby can't be in position 5 (rule 5), so it must be in position 6. This would violate rule 3, so volleyball can't be in position 4. If it's in position 5, then the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 6 (rule 3), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 5, so volleyball can't be in position 5. Therefore, volleyball must be in position 6.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is photography. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 8), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 8, so photography can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 8), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so photography can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's sport is skateboarding can't be in position 7 (rule 8), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so photography can't be in position 6. Therefore, photography must be in position 5.

Now, let's place the person eating plum. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 11), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 1 (rule 11), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 11), so it must be in position 6. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 5 (rule 11), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 6.

Now, let's place the owner of the cat. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 17), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 1 (rule 17), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 9, so cat can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 9), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 17, so cat can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 9), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 17, so cat can't be in position 6.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 9), it must be in position 2, 3, 5, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 1 (rule 9), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 2. If it's in position 3, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 9), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 3. If it's in position 5, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 6 (rule 9), so it must be in position 6. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 5. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 9), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so skateboarding can't be in position 6. Therefore, skateboarding must be in position 4.

Now, let's place the person who's sport is volleyball. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 6), it must be in position 2, 4, or 5. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 1 (rule 6), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 3, so volleyball can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is climbing can't be in position 5 (rule 6), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so volleyball can't be in position 4. If it's in position 5, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 6 (rule 6), so it must be in position 6. This would violate rule 3, so volleyball can't be in position 5. Therefore, volleyball must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is card-games. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 3), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 3, so card-games can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 3), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so card-games can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 3), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so card-games can't be in position 6. Therefore, card-games must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 3), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 2, so filmmaking can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 2), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so filmmaking can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 2), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so filmmaking can't be in position 6. Therefore, filmmaking must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is photography. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 3), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is card-games can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so it must be in position 1. This would violate rule 8, so photography can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 8), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 3, so photography can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 7 (rule 8), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 3, so photography can't be in position 6. Therefore, photography must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is plum. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 11), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 1 (rule 11), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 11), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 11), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 8, so plum can't be in position 6. Therefore, plum must be in position 3.

Now, let's place the person who's hobby is lizard. Since it can't be in position 1 (rule 16), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. If it's in position 2, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 1 (rule 16), so it must be in position 3. This would violate rule 14, so lizard can't be in position 2. If it's in position 4, then the person who's sport is volleyball can't be in position 5 (rule 16), so it must be in position 5. This would violate rule 14, so lizard can't be in position 4. If it's in position 6, then the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 7 (rule 16), so it must be in position 7. This would violate rule 14, so lizard can't be in position 6. Therefore, lizard must be in position 5.

Lv9-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the skateboard driver is not to the left of the cherry eater. Let's place the cherry eater in position 1, so the skateboard driver can't be in position 1 or 2.

2. From rule 2, the hamster owner is to the right of the photographer. Since the cherry eater is in position 1, the photographer can't be in position 1, so the photographer must be in position 2, 3, 4. The hamster owner can't be in position 1 either, so the hamster owner is in position 2, 3, 4.

3. From rule 3, the person eating potato is the videographer. So, the videographer is in position 3 (since the cherry eater is in position 1 and the photographer is in position 2).

4. From rule 4, the librarian is not the person eating grapefruit. So, the librarian can't be in position 1, 3, or 4 (since the cherry eater, videographer, and grapefruit eater are already placed). The librarian must be in position 2.

5. From rule 5, the grapefruit eater is not to the right of the security-guard. Since the librarian is in position 2, the security-guard can't be in position 3 or 4. The security-guard must be in position 1.

6. From rule 6, the grapefruit eater is on the left or right of the turtle owner. Since the librarian is in position 2 and the security-guard is in position 1, the turtle owner can't be in position 1 or 2. The turtle owner must be in position 3 or 4.

7. From rule 7, the person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the skateboard driver is not in position 1 or 2, the motorbike driver can't be in position 1 either. The motorbike driver must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 8, the security-guard and the mouse owner have the same parity positions. Since the security-guard is in position 1, the mouse owner must also be in position 1 or 3 (odd positions).

9. From rule 9, the grapefruit eater is not the scooter driver. Since the grapefruit eater is not in position 1, 2, or 4 (as we've placed the other people), the scooter driver must be in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the turtle owner is not the skateboard driver. Since the turtle owner is not in position 1 or 2, the skateboard driver must be in position 4.

11. From rule 11, the security-guard is to the left of the videographer. Since the security-guard is in position 1 and the videographer is in position 3, the skateboard driver (who is the security-guard's left) must be in position 2.

12. From rule 12, the librarian is not to the right of the skateboard driver. Since the librarian is in position 2, the skateboard driver (who is the librarian's left) must be in position 1.

13. From rule 13, the mouse owner is on the left or right of the cherry eater. Since the mouse owner is in position 1 and the cherry eater is in position 3, the hamster owner (who is the mouse owner's right) must be in position 4.

14. From rule 14, the photographer is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the videographer is in position 3 and the librarian is in position 2, the photographer must be in position 4 (since the photographer can't be to the left of the librarian).

15. From rule 15, the grapefruit eater is to the left of the skateboard driver. Since the skateboard driver is in position 1, the grapefruit eater must be in position 2.

Now, let's place the pets, jobs, and food:

| Transport   |          |                | Motorbike    | Ship         |

Since we don't have specific information about the pets, we can't fill in those spots. However, we know their positions.
