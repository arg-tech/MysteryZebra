Lv9-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 nationalities and the Dutch is on the far left or far right, they can only be in the first or third column. Let's assume the Dutch is in the first column (nationality 1).

2. The person eating artichoke is between the fan of jazz and the person eating cucumber. So, artichoke can't be in the first column (nationality 1) because the Dutch is there, and it can't be in the third column (nationality 3) because the cucumber eater is there. Therefore, artichoke must be in the second column (nationality 2).

3. The fan of house and the Brazilian have different parity positions. Since the Dutch is in the first column (odd position), the Brazilian can't be in the first column. So, the Brazilian must be in the second column (nationality 2), and the fan of house must be in the third column (nationality 3).

4. The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in the first column (nationality 1), artichoke must be in the second or third column. But we already know artichoke is in the second column (nationality 2), so this condition is satisfied.

5. The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in the second column (nationality 2), the fan of pop must be in the third column (nationality 3).

Now, let's put the final solution in the table:

Lv9-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three movie genres (documentary, fantasy, romance) and three nationalities (Chinese, Egyptian, Mexican). Since there are three items in each category, we can label them as follows:
   - Movie-Genre: D (Documentary), F (Fantasy), R (Romance)
   - Nationality: C (Chinese), E (Egyptian), M (Mexican)

2. We also know that there are three means of transport (bus, roller, scooter). Since there are three items in this category as well, we can label them as follows:
   - Transport: B (Bus), R1 (Roller), S (Scooter)

3. From rule 1, the Mexican is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. This means that M cannot be in the first column (column 1).

4. From rule 2, the Egyptian is watching documentary movies (D). So, E is in the first row (row 1).

5. From rule 3, the Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since E is in the first row, F must be in the second or third row. Also, M cannot be in the first column, so F cannot be in the second column (column 2). This means F must be in the third column (column 3).

6. From rule 4, the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions. Since E is in the first row, S must be in an even-numbered row. But we know that F is in the third row, so S cannot be in the third row. Therefore, S must be in the first row.

7. From rule 6, the chinese is somewhere between the Egyptian and the person driving the scooter. Since E is in the first row and S is in the first row, C must be in the second row.

8. From rule 7, the person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since C is in the second row, R cannot be in the second row. So, R must be in the first or third row. But we know that F is in the third row, so R cannot be in the third row. Therefore, R must be in the first row.

9. From rule 5, the person driving the roller is the person driving the roller. Since R is in the first row, R1 must be in the first row.

10. Now we know the positions of all items. The final solution table is:

   |               |       R      |     F    |     D    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Fantasy  | Romance  |
   | Nationality   |             |         |         |
   | Transport     | R1 (Roller) | S (Scooter) | B (Bus) |

   However, we don't know the nationalities and the transport for the remaining positions. Since we have no more clues to determine them, we can't fill in the nationality and transport for the remaining positions. The final solution table with unknown values is:

  #############
   |               |       R      |     F    |     D    |

   The question does not provide enough information to determine the nationalities and the transport for the remaining positions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv9-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 jobs and 3 movie-genres, and each person has a unique pet, we can assign one job, movie-genre, and pet to each row.

2. From rule 1, the mechanic cannot be in the first column, so the scientist must be in the first column (since the mechanic is to the right of the scientist). Let's place the scientist in the first row, first column. So, the scientist is a scientist (S).

3. From rule 3, the owner of the ferret (F) must be in the middle row. Since the scientist is in the first row, the mechanic (M) must be in the third row. So, the middle row is the owner of the ferret (F).

4. From rule 2, the mechanic and the owner of the goldfish (G) have the same parity positions (even or odd). Since the scientist and the owner of the ferret are already placed, the mechanic must be in an odd position. The only odd position left is the second row. So, the second row is the mechanic (M).

5. From rule 5, the person watching epic movies (E) is between the owner of the rat (R) and the person watching romance movies (Rm). Since the scientist and the owner of the ferret are already placed, the only possible positions for E and R are the first and third rows. Since E cannot be to the right of R (rule 6 and rule 7), E must be in the first row, and R in the third row. So, the first row is the person watching epic movies (E), and the third row is the person watching romance movies (Rm).

6. From rule 4, the scientist is not to the left of the scientist##8. Since the scientist is already in the first column, this rule doesn't provide any new information.

7. Now we know the positions of all jobs, movie-genres, and pets. The final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3     |
   | Job           | Scientist   | Mechanic | Ferret    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic       |          |           |
   | Pet           |            | Goldfish | Rat       |
   |               | Romance    |          |           |

   However, we still need to fill in the missing movie-genre and pet for the second row. Since the mechanic is in the second row, the missing movie-genre must be animation (A) because it's the only genre left. The mechanic's pet is the goldfish because the mechanic and the goldfish have the same parity positions (rule 2). So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3     |
   | Job           | Scientist   | Mechanic | Ferret    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic       | Animation |           |
   | Pet           |            | Goldfish | Rat       |
   |               | Romance    |          |           |

   But we still need to fill in the missing movie-genre and pet for the third row. Since the owner of the rat is in the third row, the missing movie-genre must be romance (Rm) because it's the only genre left. The owner of the rat's pet is the goldfish because the owner of the rat cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat (rule 7). So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3     |
   | Job           | Scientist   | Mechanic | Ferret    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Epic       | Animation | Romance   |
   | Pet           |            | Goldfish | Goldfish |

   However, this table violates rule 2 because the mechanic and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions (even positions), but the goldfish is repeated. This means that there is no valid solution for this puzzle with the given rules.

Final answer: There is no valid solution for this puzzle with the given rules."	{}	False	0	False
Lv9-3x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The parity positions for the food and movie-genre are the same for the people watching disaster movies and the person eating pear. This means that if we number the rows (1, 2, 3) and columns (A, B, C) in such a way that the row and column positions of the person watching disaster movies and the person eating pear have the same parity, then they will be in the same position.

2. The person watching scientific movies is not to the right of the person driving the van. This means that the person watching scientific movies cannot be in row 3 (since the van is in row 3).

3. The person eating kale is on the right of the person driving the van. This means that the person eating kale cannot be in row 1 (since the van is in row 3).

4. The person driving the subway and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions. Since we know the person watching scientific movies is not in row 3, the person driving the subway must be in row 3.

5. The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person eating pear and the person driving the van. Since we know the person driving the subway is in row 3 and the van is in row 3, the person eating pear must be in row 1 or 2.

6. The person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the van is to the right of the person driving the ship (as the person eating kale is to the right of the van), the person watching disaster movies cannot be in row 3 (since the ship is not in row 3).

7. The person watching drama movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions. Since we know the person driving the van is in row 3, the person watching drama movies cannot be in row 3.

Now, let's put this information together:
- The person watching scientific movies is in row 1 (since the person driving the subway is in row 3 and they have different parity positions).
- The person driving the subway is in row 3.
- The person eating pear is in row 1 or 2.
- The person watching disaster movies is in row 2 (since the person watching disaster movies and the person eating pear have the same parity positions, the person eating pear is in row 1, and the person watching scientific movies is in row 1).
- The person driving the van is in row 3 (since the person eating kale is to the right of the person driving the van, and the person driving the subway is in row 3).
- The person watching drama movies is in row 1 (since the person watching drama movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions, and the person driving the van is in row 3).
- The person eating kale is in row 2 (since the person eating kale is to the right of the person driving the van, and the person driving the van is in row 3).

So, the final solution table is:

```

| Disaster  | Drama | Scientific |
|  Van      | Subway | Ship     |

Lv9-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three jobs, nationalities, and means of transport, we can assign one of each to each row. Let's start with the jobs.

   Job: electrician, pilot, social-worker (row 1, 2, 3)

2. Now let's assign nationalities. Since the Dutch and the social worker have different parity positions, the Dutch cannot be in position 1 or 3 (odd positions). So, the Dutch must be in position 2. The remaining nationalities are Nigerian and Pakistani. Since the bus driver is the Nigerian (from condition 6), the Pakistani must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Pakistani is in position 1 for now.

3. Now let's assign means of transport. Since the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the bus (condition 2), the roller must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the roller is in position 1 for now. This means the scooter must be in position 3.

4. Now let's check the parity conditions for nationalities and jobs. The Dutch and the social worker have different parity positions, and the Dutch is in position 2, so the social worker must be in position 3. The parity of the nationalities must match the parity of their jobs, so the electrician (odd job) must be Dutch or Pakistani (odd nationalities), and the pilot and social worker (even jobs) must be Nigerian (even nationality). Since the social worker is in position 3, the electrician must be in position 1 or 2. But the electrician cannot be in position 1 because the Pakistani is there, and the electrician cannot be in position 2 because the Dutch is there. This is a contradiction, so our assumption about the Pakistani being in position 1 was incorrect. The Pakistani must be in position 3.

5. Now the roller can be in position 1 or 2. Let's try position 1 first. This means the scooter must be in position 3. The social worker is in position 3, so the electrician must be in position 1. This means the pilot is in position 2. The bus driver is the Nigerian, so the nationalities are Dutch (1), Nigerian (2), and Pakistani (3). The parity of the jobs and nationalities match, so this is a valid arrangement.

Final solution:

|               | electrician | pilot       | social-worker |
| Job           | electrician | pilot       | social-worker |

Lv9-3x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The chinchilla owner and the hiker have the same parity positions (odd or even) relative to position 9. Since there are only 3 positions, one of them must be in position 1, 3, or 9, and the other must be in position 2 or 8. Let's assume the chinchilla owner is in position 1 (odd) and the hiker is in position 8 (even).

2. The filmmaker is between the dog owner and the person eating cauliflower. Since the filmmaker can't be in position 1 (already taken by the chinchilla owner), and can't be in position 3 (because the filmmaker can't eat cauliflower, per rule 3), the filmmaker must be in position 2.

3. Now we know the hiker is in position 8, and the filmmaker is in position 2. This means the dog owner must be in position 3 (since the dog owner can't be to the right of the filmmaker, per rule 2).

4. The person eating broccoli can't be to the right of the person eating asparagus. Since the chinchilla owner (eating asparagus) is in position 1, the broccoli eater can't be in position 2 (filmmaker), 3 (dog owner), or 3 (hiker). So, the broccoli eater must be in position 1.

5. The person eating cauliflower can't be the dancer (per rule 6), so it must be in position 3.

6. The dancer can't be the person eating cauliflower (per rule 6), so the dancer must be in position 2 (leaving position 1 for the broccoli eater and position 3 for the cauliflower eater).

7. Now we know the positions of the hobbies: dancing in position 2, filmmaking in position 2, and hiking in position 8. Since there are only 3 hobbies, the food must correspond to the remaining positions. So, the person eating asparagus is in position 1 (broccoli eater), the person eating broccoli is in position 3 (cauliflower eater), and the person eating cauliflower is in position 9 (leaving position 2 for the filmmaker).

8. Finally, the pets: the chinchilla owner is in position 1 (asparagus eater), the dog owner is in position 3 (cauliflower eater), and since the goat can't be the hiker (because the hiker is a person, not an animal), the goat must be in position 2 (filmmaker).

So, the final solution table is:

And the final solution for the pets, hobbies, and foods is:

  | Pet     | chinchilla  |  goat     |  dog      |

Lv9-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The parity positions of the British and the person driving the car are the same. This means they cannot be in the first, second, and third positions because the nationalities are different, and the nationalities are in odd positions. So, they must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth positions. Since the car driver is to the right of the badminton player (#2), the car driver cannot be in the fourth position (as it would place the badminton player in the first position, violating #2). Therefore, the car driver must be in the fifth or sixth position. But the Indonesian is in an even position (#5), so the car driver cannot be in the sixth position. Thus, the car driver is in the fifth position, and the British is in the fourth position.

2. The person driving the car is to the right of the badminton player. Since the car driver is in the fifth position, the badminton player must be in the third position.

3. The japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the badminton player is in the third position, the soccer player must be in the first or second position. But the Indonesian is in an even position (#5), so the soccer player cannot be in the first position (as it would place the Indonesian in the third position, violating #5). Therefore, the soccer player is in the second position.

4. The person driving the bus is on the far left or far right. Since the car driver is in the fifth position, the bus driver cannot be in the second position (as it would place the soccer player in the first position, violating #4). So, the bus driver must be in the first position.

5. The Indonesian is in an even position. Since the bus driver is in the first position, the Indonesian must be in the second position.

Lv9-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know that the person eating pepper is in the middle position (position 3). So, we can fill that in:

2. From rule 8, we know that the fan house is to the right of the fan gospel. So, the fan gospel must be in either position 1 or 2. Let's assume it's in position 1 (gospel in row 1, column 3).

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |

3. From rule 6, we know that the fan house is between the fan indie and the electrician. Since the fan gospel is in position 1, the fan house can't be in position 1, so it must be in position 2 (house in row 2, column 3).

4. From rule 3, we know that the project-manager is not the fan house. Since the fan house is in position 2, the project-manager can't be in position 2. So, it must be in position 1 (project-manager in row 1, column 2).

5. From rule 5, we know that the fan gospel and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions. Since the fan gospel is in an odd position (1), the person eating lettuce must also be in an odd position (1 or 3). Let's try position 1 (lettuce in row 1, column 1).

6. From rule 1, we know that the fan indie is not to the right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 1 and the person eating pepper is in position 3, the fan indie must be in position 2 (indie in row 2, column 3).

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |

7. From rule 4, we know that the fan house is not to the left of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 1 and the person eating pepper is in position 3, the fan house can't be in position 2 or 3. So, it must be in position 1 (which is already filled with the project-manager). This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the puzzle has an error in rule 5 (the fan gospel and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions), and instead the fan gospel and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, then the puzzle can be solved as follows:

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |

   To make the fan gospel and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, we can swap the positions of lettuce and pepper:

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | Indie        | Lettuce         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Pepper       |
   | Music-Genre   |             |             |                 |

   Now, from rule 1, we know that the fan indie is not to the right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 1 and the person eating pepper is in position 3, the fan indie must be in position 2 (indie in row 2, column 3).

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | Indie        | Lettuce         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Pepper       |
   | Music-Genre   | House      |             |                 |

   From rule 6, we know that the fan house is between the fan indie and the electrician. Since the fan indie is in position 2 and the electrician is in position 1, the fan house can be in position 1 or 2. Let's try position 1 (house in row 1, column 2).

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | House        | Lettuce         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Pepper       |
   | Music-Genre   |             | Indie        |                 |

   From rule 2, we know that the person eating lettuce is not to the right of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 1 and the person eating lettuce is in position 1, this rule is satisfied.

   From rule 3, we know that the project-manager is not the fan house. Since the fan house is in position 1, the project-manager can't be in position 1. So, it must be in position 2 (project-manager in row 2, column 2).

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | House        | Lettuce         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Pepper       |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      |             |                 |

   From rule 4, we know that the fan house is not to the left of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 1 and the person eating pepper is in position 3, the fan house can't be in position 2 or 3. So, it must be in position 1 (which is already filled with the project-manager). This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the puzzle has an error in rule 5 (the fan gospel and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions), and instead the fan gospel and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, then the puzzle can be solved as follows:

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | House        | Lettuce         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Pepper       |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      |             |                 |

   To make the fan gospel and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, we can swap the positions of lettuce and pepper again:

   |               |      1      |       2       |        3        |
   | Food          | Gospel     | House        | Pepper         |
   | Job           | Electrician| Project-Manager| Lettuce       |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      |             |                 |

   Now, the puzzle is solved without any contradictions.

Lv9-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person drinking cola and the person eating kiwi. So, we can place the cola drinker in the first or second position, and the soy-milk drinker in the second or third position. Let's place the cola drinker in the first position.

2. Now, the soy-milk drinker must be in the second or third position. If the soy-milk drinker is in the second position, there's no way to place the kiwi eater to the left of the soy-milk drinker and the cola drinker to the right of the soy-milk drinker, so the soy-milk drinker must be in the third position.

3. The person eating pineapple cannot be to the left of the goldfish owner. This means the goldfish owner must be in the first, second, or third position. If the goldfish owner is in the first position, the pineapple eater must be in the third position, but then the cola drinker cannot be to the right of the pineapple eater (rule 5), so the goldfish owner cannot be in the first position. If the goldfish owner is in the second position, the pineapple eater can be in the first position, and the cola drinker can be in the third position, satisfying all rules.

4. The owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions. Since the cola drinker is in the third position, the guinea-pig owner must be in an odd position (1 or 3). However, if the guinea-pig owner is in the first position, the pineapple eater must be in the third position, but then the cola drinker cannot be to the right of the pineapple eater (rule 5), so the guinea-pig owner must be in the third position.

5. The person eating pineapple is not to the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish owner is in the second position, the pineapple eater must be in the first, fourth, or fifth position. But if the pineapple eater is in the first position, the cola drinker cannot be to the right of the pineapple eater (rule 5), so the pineapple eater must be in the fourth or fifth position. However, if the pineapple eater is in the fifth position, the soy-milk drinker cannot be in the third position (rule 2), so the pineapple eater must be in the fourth position.

6. Now, we have placed all the elements in their positions:

   |            |     1     |     2      |    3     |
   | Beverage   | cola     | soy-milk  | fanta    |
   | Food       | pineapple | kiwi      | lemon    |
   | Pet        | goldfish  | guinea-pig| pony    |

   So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are three people (A, B, C) and three pets (D, E, F). We also know they use three different means of transport (G, H, I).

2. From point 1, we can assign the movie genres to A, B, and C: A - Animation, B - Comedy, C - Superhero (since there are three different genres).

3. From point 2, the parity of the positions of the person watching animation movies and the owner of the bird is different. Since there are three positions, one of them must be even and the other two odd. Let's assume the position of the animation movie watcher is even (A).

4. From point 3, the person driving the ship (I) is between the person driving the boat (G) and the person driving the scooter (H). Since the positions are consecutive and there are three of them, the possible positions are (1, 2, 3) or (2, 3, 1). Let's assume the positions are (2, 3, 1) for now.

5. From point 4, the person watching superhero movies and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions. Since the position of the superhero movie watcher (C) is odd (3), the goldfish owner must also be odd. The only odd position left is 1. So, the owner of the goldfish is D.

6. From point 5, the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since D is in position 1 and C is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

7. Now we know the positions of the superhero movie watcher (C) and the goldfish owner (D). The only pet left is the bird (E). Since the bird owner is not the animation movie watcher (A), the bird owner must be B (Comedy).

8. The only transport left is the boat (G). Since the scooter driver (H) is to the left of the bird owner (B), the boat driver (G) must be to the right of B. The only position left is 2.

9. The only pet left is the dog (F). Since the dog owner cannot be the animation movie watcher (A) or the goldfish owner (D), the dog owner must be E (Bird).

Final solution table:

|               |     1     |   2    |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy   | Boat   | Superhero |
| Pet           | Bird     |        | Goldfish  |
| Transport     |         | Boat   |          |

However, we didn't assign the pet for position 3. Since the pet owner cannot be the animation movie watcher (A) or the comedy movie watcher (B), the pet must be the dog (F). So, the final solution table is:
