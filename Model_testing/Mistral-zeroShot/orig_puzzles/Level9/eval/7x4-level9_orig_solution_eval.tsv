Lv9-7x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions (1 being the first row, 2 being the second row, and so on).

1. The indian and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions. Since there are 6 people and 6 positions, the indian and the rat owner must be in positions with the same remainder when divided by 2 (either both odd or both even). Let's assume the indian is in position 1 (odd) and the rat owner is in position 3 (odd).

2. The fan electronic is in an even position (4).

3. The indonesian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (5). Since the rat owner is in position 3, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the guinea-pig owner is in position 2 (even).

4. The fan jazz is not the indonesian (not in position 2 or 3).

5. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere between the brazilian and the fan metal (5, 6, or 7). Since the brazilian cannot be in position 1 (because the indian is there), the brazilian must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the brazilian is in position 2. This means the lemonade drinker must be in position 3, 5, or 7.

6. The fan metal and the brazilian have different parity positions. The brazilian is in position 2 (even), so the fan metal must be in position 1 (odd).

7. The person eating tomato and the project-manager have the same parity positions. Since the brazilian is in position 2 (even), the tomato eater and the project-manager must be in even positions. Let's assume the project-manager is in position 4 (even). This means the tomato eater is in position 6 (even).

8. The indonesian and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions. Since the indonesian is in position 3 (odd), the watermelon eater must be in position 1, 4, or 5 (even).

9. The person eating raspberry and the paramedic have the same parity positions. Since the tomato eater is in position 6 (even), the raspberry eater and the paramedic must be in odd positions. Let's assume the paramedic is in position 3 (odd). This means the raspberry eater is in position 5 (odd).

10. The coach and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since the tomato eater is in position 6 (even), the coach must be in position 5 (odd).

11. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the left of the person eating watermelon. Since the watermelon eater is in position 1, the skier cannot be in position 2.

12. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the lemonade drinker is in position 3, the goldfish owner must be in position 1, 4, or 5. Let's assume the goldfish owner is in position 1.

13. The project-manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the project-manager is in position 4, the fanta drinker must be in position 5 or 6.

14. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the lemonade drinker is in position 3 and the skier is not in position 2, the skier must be in position 5 or 6.

15. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the fan metal. Since the fan metal is in position 1, the surfer can be in position 2, 4, or 6.

16. The person who's sport is rugby and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions. Since the watermelon eater is in position 1 (odd), the rugby player cannot be in position 1 (odd).

17. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the fan jazz. Since the skier is in position 5 or 6, the fan jazz must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

18. The person eating tomato is in an odd position. Since the tomato eater is in position 6, the positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 must be filled.

19. The person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person eating tomato. Since the watermelon eater is in position 1 and the tomato eater is in position 6, the watermelon eater cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

20. The owner of the hamster is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the fanta drinker is in position 5 or 6, the hamster owner cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3.

21. The project-manager is in an odd position. Since the project-manager is in position 4, the positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 must be filled.

22. The person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the left of the fan disco. Since the skateboarder is in position 5 or 6, the fan disco must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

23. The person eating peas is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the lemonade drinker is in position 3, the peas eater must be in position 1 or 2.

24. The thai is not to the left of the indonesian. Since the indonesian is in position 3, the thai cannot be in position 1 or 2.

25. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas. Since the peas eater is in position 1 or 2, the rat owner must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

26. The paramedic and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions. Since the paramedic is in position 3 (odd) and the watermelon eater is in position 1 (odd), they have the same parity. This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in this clue.

27. The owner of the hamster and the fan disco have the same parity positions. Since the hamster owner is in position 1, 4, or 5, and the fan disco is in position 2, 3, or 4, they have the same parity if the hamster owner is in position 1 or 4 and the fan disco is in position 3.

28. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since the skier is in position 5 or 6, the tomato eater must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

29. The person eating tomato and the person drinking hot-chocolate have the same parity positions. Since the tomato eater is in position 6 (even), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5 (even).

30. The paramedic is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the paramedic is in position 3, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

At this point, we have filled 5 positions (1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). The positions 5 and 7 are still open. Since the skier is in position 5 or 6, the skier cannot be in position 7 (because the lemonade drinker is there). So, the skier must be in position 5. This means the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are filled.

Now, we have the following table:

|               |        1        |     2      |    3     |      4      |    5     |    6     |

| Sport         | rugby         | skateboarding| skiing    | surfing   |         |         |

The positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 are filled. The positions 5 and 7 are still open. Since the skier is in position 5, the positions 7 must be filled with the fan jazz.

So, the final solution table is:

   - The person who prefers funk music is not the person who prefers basketball.
   - The person who prefers rugby is not to the right of the Japanese.
   - The librarian is not to the left of the Japanese.

3. Now, let's start filling in the table based on the deduced relationships:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

4. We can start with the nationalities since we know the Mexican is in position 2. Let's place the Mexican in position 2:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

   | Pet           |               |             |            |               |

5. Since the Mexican is not Dutch, the Dutch cannot be in position 2. Let's place the Dutch in position 1:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

6. The person who prefers basketball cannot be in position 1 (since the Dutch is the coach and they have the same parity positions). Let's place the person who prefers basketball in position 3:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

7. The person who prefers basketball cannot be the firefighter (since the firefighter is to the right of Pony and the person who prefers basketball is not to the right of the person who prefers funk). Let's place the firefighter in position 4:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

8. The person who prefers basketball cannot be the librarian (since the librarian is not to the left of the Japanese and the person who prefers basketball is not to the right of the person who prefers funk). Let's place the librarian in position 2:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

9. The person who prefers basketball cannot be the social worker (since the social worker is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike and the person who prefers basketball is not to the right of the person who prefers funk). Let's place the social worker in position 3:

   |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

10. The person who prefers basketball cannot be the coach (since the coach and the person who prefers basketball have the same parity positions). Let's place the coach in position 1:

    |               |       1       |      2      |     3      |       4       |

Lv9-7x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 items in each category, the parity of the positions for the same item should be the same (either all even or all odd). Since the scientist and the person eating nectarine have different parity positions, neither can be in position 1, 3, or 4. So, the person eating nectarine must be in position 2, and the scientist must be in position 3 or 4.

2. The fan of funk is on the far right, so it must be in position 4.

3. The person eating cauliflower is in an even position (since it's not in position 1, 3, or 4 due to the previous points). So, it must be in position 2 or 4.

4. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since funk is in position 4, handball must be in position 3. So, horror is in position 5.

5. The fan of jazz is on the far left, so it must be in position 1.

6. The person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cauliflower have the same parity positions. Since cauliflower is in position 2, rowing must be in position 6.

7. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since handball is in position 3 and horror in position 5, time-travel must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since it's not in position 1 (due to jazz being there), it must be in position 2 or 3.

8. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the person eating spinach. Since cauliflower is in position 2, spinach can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume spinach is in position 1.

9. The police-officer is not to the left of the person eating corn. Since corn can't be in position 1 (due to spinach), it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. Since it can't be in position 6 (due to rowing), it must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But it can't be in position 2 (due to cauliflower), so it must be in position 4.

10. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking can't be in position 1 (due to jazz) or position 4 (due to police-officer), it must be in position 2 or 3. If it's in position 2, reading must be in position 3. If it's in position 3, reading must be in position 4. But reading can't be in position 4 (due to the scientist), so woodworking must be in position 2, and reading in position 3.

11. The person drinking coffee is on the far left. Since funk is in position 4, coffee must be in position 1.

12. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since coffee is in position 1, mirinda can be in position 2 or 3.

13. The person eating corn is somewhere between the person eating spinach and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since spinach is in position 1, corn can't be in position 2 (due to cauliflower) or position 4 (due to police-officer). So, corn must be in position 3.

14. The person watching epic movies is in an odd position. Since funk is in position 4, epic can't be in position 4. So, epic must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since it can't be in position 1 (due to coffee) or position 5 (due to horror), it must be in position 3.

15. The person who's sport is rowing is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since rowing is in position 6 and mirinda can't be in position 4 (due to the police-officer), mirinda must be in position 2.

16. The person watching epic movies is between the person who's sport is golf and the person watching comedy movies. Since epic is in position 3, golf must be in position 1, and comedy in position 5.

17. The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since funk is in position 4, basketball can't be in position 4. So, basketball must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since it can't be in position 1 (due to coffee) or position 2 (due to cauliflower), it must be in position 3. So, salsa must be in position 4.

18. The person who's hobby is reading is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the fan of funk. Since reading is in position 3 and funk is in position 4, cooking must be in position 1.

19. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the right of the analyst. Since analyst can't be in position 1 (due to spinach) or position 4 (due to the police-officer), it must be in position 2 or 3. But it can't be in position 2 (due to cauliflower), so it must be in position 3. So, the analyst must be in position 1.

20. The fan of salsa and the person who's hobby is cooking have the same parity positions. Since salsa is in position 4 and cooking is in position 1, they have the same parity (both are odd).

21. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the fan of jazz. Since woodworking is in position 2 and jazz is in position 1, this condition is satisfied.

22. The person eating nectarine is not to the left of the person eating corn. Since nectarine can't be in position 1 (due to spinach) or position 2 (due to cauliflower), it must be in position 3 or 4. But it can't be in position 4 (due to the police-officer), so it must be in position 3.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Beverage      | coffee | fanta | hot-chocolate | mirinda |
| Food          | cauliflower | corn | nectarine | spinach |
| Hobby         | cooking | puzzles | reading | woodworking |

| Movie-Genre   | comedy | epic | horror | time-travel |
| Music-Genre   | funk | indie | jazz | salsa |
| Sport         | basketball | golf | handball | rowing |

The final solution is:

#############

Lv9-7x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From clue 10, the Egyptian is on the far left, so we can place them in position 1.

2. From clue 19, the person driving the helicopter is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since there are only 4 beverages, the helicopter driver must be drinking one of the remaining three: hot-chocolate, lemonade, or milk. Let's assume the helicopter driver is drinking hot-chocolate (position 3). This means the almond-milk drinker is in position 2.

3. From clue 18, the fan hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan soul. Since we know the positions of almond-milk and hot-chocolate, the only possible positions for hip-hop and soul are 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume hip-hop is in position 1 and soul is in position 2.

4. From clue 16, the fan hip-hop is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Since we know the position of the fan hip-hop, the frog owner must be in position 4.

5. From clue 17, the person driving the trike is not to the right of the fan hip-hop. Since we know the position of the fan hip-hop and the frog owner, the trike driver must be in position 5.

6. From clue 6, the person eating grapefruit is between the Turkish and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we know the positions of the Turkish (clue 10) and the hot-chocolate drinker (clue 2), the grapefruit eater must be in position 4.

7. From clue 11, the fan r&b is not to the left of the person driving the car. Since we know the position of the car driver (clue 5), the fan r&b is not in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the fan r&b must be in position 3.

8. From clue 13, the fan r&b is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we know the position of the fan r&b (clue 7), the rabbit owner and the filmmaker must be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the rabbit owner is in position 1 and the filmmaker is in position 6.

9. From clue 12, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner (clue 8), the baker must be in position 2.

10. From clue 14, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since we know the position of the baker (clue 9), the snake owner must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the snake owner is in position 3.

11. From clue 15, the owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we know the position of the snake owner (clue 10), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 4 or 5. But we already know the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3 (clue 2), so this clue is a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

12. From clue 1, there are 4 different favourite beverages, but we have only accounted for 3 (almond-milk, hot-chocolate, and lemonade). This means the remaining beverage, milk, must be the drink of the Mexican (clue 21).

13. From clue 4, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since we know the positions of the Egyptian (clue 1), the hot-chocolate drinker (clue 2), the grapefruit eater (clue 6), and the lemonade drinker (this step), the pumpkin eater must be in position 5.

14. From clue 9, the person drinking lemonade is not the owner of the rabbit. Since we know the position of the lemonade drinker (this step), the rabbit owner must be in position 1 or 2. But we already know the rabbit owner is in position 1 (clue 8), so this clue is a repetition of clue 8.

15. From clue 8, the person driving the trike and the owner of the frog have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the trike driver (clue 5) and the frog owner (clue 4), this clue doesn't provide new information.

16. From clue 20, the owner of the snake and the person who's hobby is filmmaking have the same parity positions. Since we know the position of the snake owner (clue 10) and the filmmaker (clue 8), this clue doesn't provide new information.

17. From clue 22, the owner of the snake and the person eating cranberry have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the snake owner (clue 10) and the cranberry eater (not determined yet), this clue doesn't provide new information.

The puzzle seems to have some inconsistencies, but based on the given clues, here's the solution table I could construct:

|               |     1      |       2       |     3      |      4      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| lemonade     | hot-chocolate| milk       |
| Food          | grapefruit | pumpkin     | cranberry  | lime       |
| Hobby         | baking    | card-games  | filmmaking  | gardening   |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop   | r&b         | soul       | techno     |
| Nationality   | egyptian  |             |            | mexican    |
| Pet           | cat       | rabbit      | snake      | frog       |
| Transport     |           |             | taxi       | helicopter |

However, the positions for the food, hobby, music-genre, nationality, pet, and transport other than those mentioned are not determined due to inconsistencies in the clues."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'lemonade', 'hot-chocolate', 'milk'], 'food': ['grapefruit', 'pumpkin', 'cranberry', 'lime'], 'hobby': ['baking', 'card-games', 'filmmaking', 'gardening'], 'music-genre': ['hip-hop', 'r&b', 'soul', 'techno'], 'nationality': ['egyptian', '', '', 'mexican'], 'pet': ['cat', 'rabbit', 'snake', 'frog'], 'transport': ['', '', 'taxi', 'helicopter']}	True	5	False

2. From rule 15, the fan disco is not to the left of the person drinking water. So, the fan disco cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, 4. From rule 18, the software-developer is the fan disco, so the software-developer is in position 2.

3. From rule 14, the software-developer is between the person drinking water and the person eating raspberry. So, the person drinking water is in position 1 and the person eating raspberry is in position 4.

4. From rule 26, the person drinking water and the dutch have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the dutch must be in position 3 (odd position) or position 4 (even position). But from rule 6, the malaysian is on the far right, so the dutch cannot be in position 4. Therefore, the dutch is in position 3.

5. From rule 20, the australian is the person eating broccoli. So, the australian is in position 1.

6. From rule 21, the person who's hobby is board-games is not the australian. So, the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 2, 3, or 4.

7. From rule 11, the person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the cat. So, the person eating grapefruit is not in position 1 (since the australian is the person eating broccoli and the cat owner is on the far left).

Since the accountant is in position 1, the person eating grapefruit cannot be in position 2 (since the board-games person is in position 4). So, the person eating grapefruit is in position 3.

8. From rule 13, the person drinking iced-tea is not the person eating grapefruit. So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1, 2, or 4. But from rule 6, the owner of the horse is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person eating grapefruit is in position 3 and the board-games person is in position 4, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1.

Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1 and the malaysian is in position 4, the fan punk is in position 3.

13. From rule 22, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the designer. Since the designer is in position 3, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1, 2, or 4. But from rule 3, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the pakistani. Since the pakistani is in position 4, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1 or 2. But from rule 23, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the software-developer (magic-tricks) is in position 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 1.

14. From rule 9, the dutch is not to the right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in position 2, the dutch is in position 1, 3, or 4. But from rule 26, the person drinking water and the dutch have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the dutch cannot be in position 1. So, the dutch is in position 3 or 4. But from rule 2, the mechanic is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the software-developer (magic-tricks) is in position 2, the mechanic must be in position 4. So, the dutch is in position 3.

15. From rule 2, the mechanic is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the software-developer (magic-tricks) is in position 2, the mechanic is in position 4.

16. From rule 12, the person eating broccoli is on the left or right of the pakistani. Since the malaysian is in position 4 and the fan punk is in position 3, the person eating broccoli is in position 1 or 2. But from rule 11, the person eating broccoli is not the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in position 1, the person eating broccoli is in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-7x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From the given clues, we can start filling in some information:
   - The brazilian (B) is watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B).
   - The fan blues (Blues) is the indian (Indian).
   - The person driving the motorbike (Motorbike) is the australian (Australian).
   - The person eating onion (Onion) is in an odd position (4 positions).
   - The person driving the tram (Tram) is on the right of the brazilian (B).

3. From clues 3, 5, and 23, we can deduce that B cannot be in position 1 (leftmost) or position 4 (rightmost). So, B must be in position 2 or 3.

4. From clue 29, we know that the person watching western movies (Western) is not to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B). Since B cannot be in position 1, Western cannot be in position 2. So, Western must be in position 3 or 4.

5. From clue 19, we know that the person drinking almond-milk (Almond) is to the right of the person drinking cola (Cola). Since Western cannot be in position 2, Cola cannot be in position 1. So, Cola must be in position 2 or 3.

6. From clue 15, we know that the person drinking soy-milk (Soy) is on the right of the mechanic (Mechanic). Since Cola cannot be in position 1, Soy cannot be in position 2. So, Soy must be in position 3 or 4.

7. From clue 18, we know that the mechanic (Mechanic) is not driving the train (Train). So, Mechanic cannot be in position 1 (leftmost) or position 4 (rightmost).

8. From clue 21, we know that the person eating onion (Onion) is not to the left of the mechanic (Mechanic). So, Onion cannot be in position 1 or 2.

9. From clue 22, we know that Onion is in an odd position. So, Onion must be in position 3.

10. Now we know that Onion is in position 3, so Cola must be in position 2 and Almond in position 1 (leftmost).

11. Since Soy cannot be in position 1 or 4, Soy must be in position 2. But this would mean Cola and Soy are in the same position, which is not possible. So, our assumption about Soy being in position 2 is incorrect. Soy must be in position 4 (rightmost).

12. Now we know that Almond is in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 1 for the beverage that has different parity positions with the doctor (Doctor). Since the odd numbers are 1, 3, and 5, and the even numbers are 0, 2, 4, the beverage that has different parity with Doctor must be hot-chocolate (Hot-Chocolate). So, Doctor is in position 5.

13. Now we know that Doctor is in position 5, so the scientist (Scientist) must be in position 6 (to the right of Doctor).

14. From clue 28, we know that the doctor (Doctor) is on the left of the scientist (Scientist). So, Doctor cannot be in position 6. This means our assumption about Doctor being in position 5 is incorrect. Doctor must be in position 4 (right of Soy).

16. From clue 16, we know that the doctor (Doctor) is not to the right of the scientist (Scientist). So, our assumption about Doctor being in position 4 is correct.

17. Now we know that Doctor is in position 4, Scientist in position 5, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 6 for the fan of techno (Techno).

18. From clue 14, we know that the fan techno (Techno) is not to the right of the doctor (Doctor). So, Techno cannot be in position 6. This means our assumption about Techno being in position 6 is incorrect. Techno must be in position 5 (to the right of Scientist).

19. Now we know that Techno is in position 5, Scientist in position 6, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 1 for the fan of dubstep (Dubstep).

20. From clue 12, we know that the brazilian (B) is not the fan of r&b (R&B). So, R&B cannot be in position 2 (to the left of B).

21. From clue 6, we know that the brazilian (B) is not to the left of the fan blues (Blues). So, B cannot be in position 1.

22. From clue 9, we know that B is watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B). Since B cannot be in position 1, Time-Travel_B cannot be in position 2. So, Time-Travel_B must be in position 3 or 4.

23. From clue 25, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate (Hot-Chocolate) and the doctor (Doctor) have different parity positions. Since Doctor is in position 4 (even), Hot-Chocolate must be in position 5 (odd).

24. Now we know that Hot-Chocolate is in position 5, Techno in position 6, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 2 for the fan of r&b (R&B).

25. From clue 13, we know that the person watching adventure movies (Adventure) is not the librarian (Librarian). So, Adventure cannot be in position 6 (to the right of Scientist).

26. From clue 11, we know that the fan blues (Blues) is the indian (Indian). Since Indian is not the brazilian (B), Blues cannot be in position 3 (to the left of B).

27. From clue 26, we know that Blues cannot be in position 3. So, Blues must be in position 4 (to the right of Soy).

28. Now we know that Blues is in position 4, R&B in position 2, Techno in position 6, Hot-Chocolate in position 5, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 1 for the fan of dubstep (Dubstep).

29. From clue 10, we know that the person driving the train (Train) is on the left of the person eating peas (Peas). So, Train cannot be in position 4 (right of Soy).

32. From clue 29, we know that Time-Travel_B cannot be in position 6. So, Time-Travel_B must be in position 5 (to the right of Hot-Chocolate).

33. Now we know that Time-Travel_B is in position 5, Dubstep in position 1, Train in position 3, Peas in position 4, Blues in position 4, R&B in position 2, Techno in position 6, Hot-Chocolate in position 5, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4.

34. From clue 8, we know that the person eating onion (Onion) is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk (Almond) and the person drinking soy-milk (Soy). But we already know the positions of Almond, Onion, and Soy. So, this clue does not provide any new information.

35. From clue 7, we know that the person eating apricot (Apricot) is somewhere between the fan techno (Techno) and the person eating onion (Onion). But we already know the positions of Techno and Onion. So, this clue does not provide any new information.

36. From clue 28, we know that the doctor (Doctor) is on the left of the scientist (Scientist). So, Doctor cannot be in position 6 (to the right of Techno).

37. From clue 14, we know that the fan techno (Techno) is not to the right of the doctor (Doctor). So, our assumption about Techno being in position 6 is incorrect. Techno must be in position 5 (to the right of Hot-Chocolate).

38. Now we know that Techno is in position 5, Scientist in position 6, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Onion in position 3, and Soy in position 4. This leaves position 1 for the fan of dubstep (Dubstep).

39. From clue 2, we know that the fan dubstep (Dubstep) is not to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B). So, Dubstep cannot be in position 5 (to the left of Techno).

40. From clue 20, we know that the person watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B) is not to the right of the fan dubstep (Dubstep). So, Time-Travel_B cannot be in position 6 (to the right of Techno).

44. From clue 26, we know that the brazilian (B) is the person watching time-travel movies (Time-Travel_B). Since B cannot be in position 1, Time-Travel_B cannot be in position 2. So, Time-Travel_B must be in position 3 or 4.

45. From clue 21, we know that the person eating onion (Onion) is not to the left of the mechanic (Mechanic). So, Onion cannot be in position 2.

46. From clue 44, we know that Time-Travel_B cannot be in position 2. So, Onion must be in position 2.

47. Now we know that Onion is in position 2, R&B in position 1, Dubstep in position 6, Techno in position 5, Scientist in position 6, Almond in position 1, Cola in position 2, Soy in position 4, and Time-Travel_B in position 3.
