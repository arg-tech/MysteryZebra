Lv9-3x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the food, hobbies, and music-genres to the columns and rows.

1. We know that there are 7 different types of food, hobbies, and music-genres, so we can assign each of them to a unique row and column.

Now let's start solving the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Let's assign hiking to column 7 and rock-climbing to column 6.
2. The person who's hobby is writing is not to the left of the fan dubstep. Since we know that rock-climbing is to the left of hiking, writing cannot be in columns 1-6. So, writing must be in column 7 or 8.
3. The person eating blueberry is the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is in column 7 or 8, blueberry must be in row 7.
4. The person eating eggplant is somewhere between the person eating blueberry and the person eating zucchini. Since blueberry is in row 7, eggplant must be in row 6 or 7.
5. The fan punk is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is in column 7, punk cannot be in columns 1-6. So, punk must be in column 8.
6. The fan punk is the person eating cauliflower. Since punk is in column 8, cauliflower must be in row 8.
7. The person who's hobby is photography and the fan hip-hop have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of photography (column 1 or 7) and hip-hop (column 2 or 6), we can deduce that they cannot be in the same column.
8. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the fan disco. Since we know that rock-climbing is in column 6 and writing is in column 7, cooking cannot be in columns 1-5. So, cooking must be in column 6 or 8.
9. The person eating eggplant is somewhere between the person eating blueberry and the person eating zucchini. Since blueberry is in row 7 and we know that eggplant is in row 6 or 7, zucchini must be in row 8.
10. The person who's hobby is hiking is not the fan ambient. Since hiking is in column 7, ambient cannot be in column 7.
11. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is in column 7, chess can be in columns 1, 2, 6, or 8.
12. The fan dubstep is on the left of the fan pop. Since punk is in column 8, pop cannot be in column 8.
13. The person eating spinach is not to the left of the fan hip-hop. Since we know that hip-hop is in column 2 or 6, spinach cannot be in columns 1, 2, or 6. So, spinach must be in column 7 or 8.

15. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the right of the fan dubstep. Since dubstep is in column 1, spinach cannot be in column 1. So, spinach must be in column 2, 4, 6, 7, or 8.
16. The fan hip-hop is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in column 6, hip-hop cannot be in columns 7 or 8. So, hip-hop must be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5.
17. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since blueberry is in row 7, dancing cannot be in rows 7 or 8. So, dancing must be in rows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
18. The person eating apricot is somewhere to the left of the fan ambient. Since we know that ambient is not in column 7, apricot must be in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
19. The person who's hobby is photography and the fan disco have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of photography (column 1 or 7) and disco (column 2 or 6), we can deduce that they cannot be in the same column.
20. The fan disco is on the left of the fan pop. Since pop is in column 8, disco cannot be in column 8.

23. The person eating apricot is in an odd position. Since apricot is in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it must be in an odd position.
24. The fan metal is on the far left or far right. Since we know the positions of punk (column 8), pop (not column 8), and dubstep (not column 1), metal can only be in columns 1 or 7.
25. The person eating zucchini is not to the right of the fan disco. Since disco is in column 2, zucchini cannot be in columns 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. So, zucchini must be in column 2.
26. The person who's hobby is cooking is not to the left of the fan metal. Since metal is in column 1 or 7, cooking cannot be in columns 1, 2, or 7. So, cooking must be in column 3, 4, 5, 6, or 8.

Lv9-3x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions based on the given rules. Odd numbers for the left side and even numbers for the right side.

2. Let's start with the pets. From rule 6, we know the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the fan gospel. Since the fan gospel is an even number (rule 26), the dog owner must be odd (1, 3, or 5). From rule 18, the fan ambient is the owner of the dog, so the dog is at position 1 (odd) and the fan ambient is at position 3 (even).

3. From rule 16, the fan ambient is on the left of the owner of the mouse, so the mouse is at position 2 (even).

4. From rule 21, the person watching adventure movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since satire is at position 4 (even), adventure must be at position 6 (odd).

5. From rule 20, the fan country is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, so the fan country is at position 5 (even).

6. From rule 24, the person watching spy movies and the fan trance have the same parity positions. Since spy is at position 1 (odd), trance must be at position 3 (even).

7. From rule 25, the fan country and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions. Since country is at position 5 (even), the bird is at position 3 (even).

8. From rule 2, the fan indie is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the fan ambient. Since the bird is at position 3 and the fan ambient is at position 3, the fan indie must be at position 4 (even).

9. From rule 3, the fan indie is somewhere between the owner of the bird and the fan ambient. Since the bird is at position 3 and the fan indie is at position 4, the fan ambient must be at position 2 (even).

10. From rule 11, the owner of the pony is on the right of the fan country. Since the fan country is at position 5, the pony is at position 7 (odd).

11. From rule 15, the owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since thriller is at position 6, the pony is at position 5 (even).

12. From rule 12, the fan country is not the owner of the pony. So, the owner of the pony is at position 5 (even) and the fan country is at position 6 (odd).

13. From rule 5, the fan country is not the person watching spy movies. Since spy is at position 1, the person watching spy movies cannot be at position 5 (where the pony is). So, the person watching spy movies is at position 3 (even).

14. From rule 14, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is at an odd position (rule 26), the hedgehog must be at an even position. But we've filled all even positions, so the cat must be at position 7 (odd).

15. From rule 1, the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since satire is at position 4, spy is at position 6.

16. From rule 17, the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since thriller is at position 6, satire is at position 4.

17. From rule 9, the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since satire is at position 4, action is at position 2.

18. From rule 19, the owner of the fish and the person watching western movies have different parity positions. Since western is at position 7 (odd), the fish is at position 6 (even).

19. From rule 8, the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the bird is at position 3 and the pony is at position 5, the owner of the fish must be at position 4.

20. From rule 22, the person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan funk. Since thriller is at position 6, fan funk is at position 7.

21. From rule 23, the owner of the dog is not to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since adventure is at position 6, the dog is not at position 7. So, the dog is at position 1 or 3. But we've already placed the dog at position 1, so the dog is at position 3.

22. From rule 29, the fan funk is not to the left of the fan ambient. Since fan ambient is at position 2, fan funk is at position 4 or 6. But we've already placed the fan funk at position 7, so it's not at position 4 or 6. So, fan funk is at position 2.

23. From rule 28, the fan trance is on the far right. Since trance is at position 3, the fan gospel must be at position 5.

24. From rule 10, the fan r&b is not to the left of the person watching western movies. Since western is at position 7, the fan r&b is not at position 1, 3, or 5. So, the fan r&b is at position 6.

25. From rule 13, the person watching action movies and the fan r&b have the same parity positions. Since action is at position 2, r&b is at position 4 or 6. But we've already placed the fan r&b at position 6, so action is at position 2.

26. From rule 27, the person watching spy movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since spy is at position 3 and western is at position 7, the person watching action movies must be at position 4.

27. From rule 30, the person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since thriller is at position 6, scientific is at position 5.

28. From rule 19, the owner of the fish and the person watching western movies have different parity positions. Since western is at position 7 (odd), the fish is at position 6 (even). But we've already placed the fish at position 4. So, the person watching western movies is at position 6 and the owner of the fish is at position 7.

The final solution table is:

|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4    |     5     |    6     |     7      |

Lv9-3x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the music genres to the rows (1-7) and nationalities to the columns (A-G). We'll leave the pets for later as they are not directly mentioned in the constraints.

2. From constraint 12, we know that the Chinese and the Chinchilla owner must be on the far left or far right. Let's place the Chinese (C) in column A (far left) and the Chinchilla owner in column G (far right).

3. From constraint 14, we know that the Chinchilla owner must also be on the far left or far right. Since we've already placed the Chinchilla owner in column G, the only option for the nationality in column A is American (A).

4. From constraint 15, we know that the Metal fan is to the left of the Country fan. Since the Country fan is in column A (C), the Metal fan must be in column F or E. However, the Metal fan cannot be in column F because the Country fan is in column G (from step 2), so the Metal fan must be in column E.

5. From constraint 5, we know that the Goldfish owner is the Chinese. Since the Chinese is in column A, the Goldfish must be in row 1 (A1).

6. From constraint 6, we know that the Goat owner is to the left of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is in column A, the Goat owner must be in column B (B1).

7. From constraint 7, we know that the Russian and the Country fan have the same parity positions. Since the Country fan is in an odd position (E), the Russian must also be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are B, D, and F. However, the Russian cannot be in column F because the Metal fan is there (from step 5), so the Russian must be in column D (D3).

8. From constraint 11, we know that the British is between the Thai and the Russian. Since the Thai is not yet placed and the Russian is in column D, the British must be in column C (C2).

9. From constraint 13, we know that the Russian is not the Jazz fan. Since the Jazz fan cannot be in column F (from step 5), the Jazz fan must be in column E (E6).

10. From constraint 17, we know that the Disco fan is on the left or right of the Rat owner. Since the Rat owner is not yet placed, we can't determine the Disco fan's position yet.

11. From constraint 18, we know that the Turtle owner is not to the right of the Goat owner. Since the Goat owner is in column B, the Turtle owner must be in column A, C, or D. However, the Turtle owner cannot be in column A because the Goldfish owner is there (from step 5), and the Turtle owner cannot be in column C because the British is there (from step 8). So, the Turtle owner must be in column D (D7).

12. From constraint 19, we know that the Country fan is not to the left of the Russian. Since the Russian is in column D, the Country fan must be in column E or F. However, the Country fan cannot be in column F because the Metal fan is there (from step 5), so the Country fan must be in column E (E2).

13. From constraint 20, we know that the Mexican is in an odd position. Since the Mexican cannot be in column A (from step 14), the Mexican must be in column B, D, or F. However, the Mexican cannot be in column D because the Russian is there (from step 7), so the Mexican must be in column F (F6).

14. From constraint 21, we know that the British is not the Techno fan. Since the Techno fan cannot be in row 1 (from step 5), the Techno fan must be in row 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, the Techno fan cannot be in row 2 because the British is there (from step 8), the Techno fan cannot be in row 3 because the Russian is there (from step 7), and the Techno fan cannot be in row 4 because the Jazz fan is there (from step 9). So, the Techno fan must be in row 5 or 6.

15. From constraint 27, we know that the Country fan is to the right of the Techno fan. Since the Country fan is in column E and the Techno fan is in row 5 or 6, the Techno fan must be in row 6 (F6).

16. From constraint 16, we know that the Reggae fan is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the middle is column E (E4).

17. From constraint 10, we know that the Rock fan is to the left of the Reggae fan. Since the Reggae fan is in column E, the Rock fan must be in column D or F. However, the Rock fan cannot be in column F because the Turtle owner is there (from step 11), so the Rock fan must be in column D (D5).

18. From constraint 22, we know that the Rat owner is to the left of the Horse owner and the Reggae fan is between the Rat owner and the Horse owner. Since the Reggae fan is in column E and the Horse owner is not yet placed, the Horse owner must be in column A, B, or C. However, the Horse owner cannot be in column A because the Goldfish owner is there (from step 5), and the Horse owner cannot be in column B because the Rat owner is there (from step 17). So, the Horse owner must be in column C (C1).

19. From constraint 23, we know that the Mexican is to the left of the Thai. Since the Mexican is in column F and the Thai is not yet placed, the Thai must be in column A, B, or C. However, the Thai cannot be in column A because the Goldfish owner is there (from step 5), and the Thai cannot be in column B because the Rat owner is there (from step 17). So, the Thai must be in column C (C7).

20. From constraint 24, we know that the Rat owner is to the left of the Disco fan. Since the Rat owner is in column A, the Disco fan must be in column B or C. However, the Disco fan cannot be in column C because the Horse owner is there (from step 18), so the Disco fan must be in column B (B2).

21. From constraint 25, we know that the Turtle owner is to the left of the Rock fan. Since the Turtle owner is in column D, the Rock fan must be in column E or F. However, the Rock fan cannot be in column F because the Turtle owner is there (from step 11), so the Rock fan must be in column E (E3).

22. From constraint 26, we know that the Thai and the Horse owner have different parity positions. Since the Horse owner is in an even position (C1), the Thai must be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are A and B. However, the Thai cannot be in column A because the Goldfish owner is there (from step 5), so the Thai must be in column B (B3).

23. From constraint 1, we know that the Jazz fan is not to the right of the Goat owner. Since the Goat owner is in column B, the Jazz fan must be in column A, C, D, or E. However, the Jazz fan cannot be in column A because the Goldfish owner is there (from step 5), the Jazz fan cannot be in column C because the Horse owner is there (from step 18), and the Jazz fan cannot be in column D because the Turtle owner is there (from step 11). So, the Jazz fan must be in column E (E1).

24. From constraint 28, we know that the Techno fan is between the American and the Chinchilla owner. Since the Chinchilla owner is in column G, the Techno fan must be in column F or E. However, the Techno fan cannot be in column F because the Turtle owner is there (from step 11), so the Techno fan must be in column E (E6).

Now, let's place the pets:

- The Goldfish is in row 1 (A1) because its owner is the Chinese (from step 5).
- The Goat is in row 2 (B1) because its owner is to the left of the Chinese (from step 6).
- The Turtle is in row 7 (D7) because its owner is in column D (from step 11).
- The Chinchilla is in row 6 (G1) because its owner is in column G (from step 2).
- The Rat is in row 2 (B2) because its owner is to the left of the Disco fan (from step 20).
- The Horse is in row 1 (C1) because its owner is the Thai (from step 18).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-3x7-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the movie-genre, pet, and sport categories. We'll use the same numbers for each category to make it easier to compare positions.

   - Movie-Genre: 1 (Comedy), 2 (Disaster), 3 (Fantasy), 4 (Horror), 5 (Musical), 6 (Mystery), 7 (Zombie)
   - Pet: 8 (Chinchilla), 9 (Goat), 10 (Goldfish), 11 (Horse), 12 (Rabbit), 13 (Rat), 14 (Turtle)
   - Sport: 15 (Cricket), 16 (Golf), 17 (Handball), 18 (Rowing), 19 (Skiing), 20 (Surfing), 21 (Weightlifting)

2. Now, let's use the given clues to fill in the table. We'll use 'X' to represent an unknown position and '?' to represent a position that can be any value.

   |               |    1    |    2     |   3    |     4      |    5     |    6     |       7       |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |          |        |            |          |          |               |
   | Pet           |         |          |        |            |          |          |               |
   | Sport         |         |          |        |            |          |          |               |

3. Let's start with the pet clues:
   - From clue 11, the goat is either to the left or right of the goldfish. So, we can place the goat as 'X' and the goldfish as '?'.
   - From clue 14, the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since we don't know the position of skiing yet, we can't place the zombie movie-watcher yet. However, we know that the skiing person can't be to the left of the goldfish (clue 24), so we can place the goldfish as '?' and the skiing person as 'X' or 'X+2' (since the zombie movie-watcher will be either 'X-1' or 'X+1').
   - From clue 28, the rabbit is to the right of the turtle. So, we can place the turtle as 'X' and the rabbit as 'X+1'.
   - From clue 30, the rat is to the right of the turtle. So, we can place the rat as 'X+2'.
   - From clue 11, we know the goat is either to the left or right of the goldfish. Since the goldfish is 'X', the goat can only be 'X-1' or 'X+1'. From clue 19, the goat is on the right of the horror movie-watcher. Since we don't know the position of horror yet, we can't place the goat yet. However, we know that the horror movie-watcher can't be to the left of the chinchilla (clue 20), so the chinchilla must be to the left of 'X'.

4. Let's move on to the sport clues:
   - From clue 16, the person watching zombie movies and the person who's sport is rowing have the same parity positions. Since we know the position of the zombie movie-watcher (either 'X-1' or 'X+1'), the rowing person must be in the same position or one position away.
   - From clue 17, the person who's sport is handball and the owner of the goat have the same parity positions. Since we know the position of the goat (either 'X-1', 'X', or 'X+1'), the handball person must be in the same position or one position away.
   - From clue 31, the owner of the horse and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the rowing person (either 'X-2', 'X', or 'X+2'), the horse can't be in the same position or one position away.

5. Now, let's use the movie-genre clues:
   - From clue 1, the person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know the position of the chinchilla (to the left of 'X') and the rowing person (either 'X-2', 'X', or 'X+2'), we can place the comedy movie-watcher as 'X-1', 'X', or 'X+1'.
   - From clue 2, the person watching disaster movies is not to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since we know the position of the comedy movie-watcher, we can place the disaster movie-watcher as 'X-3', 'X-2', 'X-1', 'X', 'X+1', 'X+2', or 'X+3'.
   - From clue 4, the person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person (either 'X-2', 'X', or 'X+2'), we can place the fantasy movie-watcher as 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 6, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person (either 'X-2', 'X', or 'X+2'), we can place the goldfish as 'X-3', 'X-2', 'X-1', or 'X'.
   - From clue 8, the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the musical movie-watcher as 'X+1', 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 9, the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the mystery movie-watcher as 'X+1', 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 13, the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since we know the position of the mystery movie-watcher, we can place the rowing person as 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', 'X+7'.
   - From clue 15, the person watching mystery movies is not the person who's sport is golf. Since we know the position of the mystery movie-watcher, we can place the golf person as '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', or '7'.
   - From clue 18, the person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know the position of the rowing person, we can place the handball person as 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 22, the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since we know the position of the rowing person, we can place the comedy movie-watcher as 'X-1'.
   - From clue 25, the person who's sport is rowing is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since we know the position of the rowing person, we can place the mystery movie-watcher as 'X+1'.
   - From clue 26, the person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since we know the position of the skiing person, we can place the zombie movie-watcher as 'X+2'.
   - From clue 27, the person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since we know the position of the comedy movie-watcher, we can place the zombie movie-watcher as 'X+1' or 'X+2'.
   - From clue 29, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since we know the position of the goldfish, we can place the musical movie-watcher as 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.

6. Now, let's check the remaining clues to ensure they are satisfied:
   - From clue 3, the owner of the rat is not to the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since we know the position of the handball person, we can place the rat as 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 5, the person watching horror movies is not the person who's sport is surfing. Since we know the position of the surfing person, we can place the horror movie-watcher as '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', or '7' (except the positions where surfing is).
   - From clue 6, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the goldfish as 'X-3', 'X-2', 'X-1', or 'X'.
   - From clue 7, the person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the fantasy movie-watcher as 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 8, the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the musical movie-watcher as 'X+1', 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 9, the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since we know the position of the weightlifting person, we can place the mystery movie-watcher as 'X+1', 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', 'X+6', or 'X+7'.
   - From clue 12, the person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know the position of the rowing person, we can place the handball person as 'X+4', 'X+5', or 'X+6'.
   - From clue 14, the person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's sport is rowing and the person watching zombie movies. Since we know the position of the rowing person and the zombie movie-watcher, we can place the skiing person as 'X+1' or 'X+3'.
   - From clue 21, the person watching disaster movies and the person who's sport is surfing have the same parity positions. Since we know the position of the disaster movie-watcher, we can place the surfing person as '2', '4', '6', or 'X+6' (since the positions '1', '3', '5', and '7' are taken by the disaster movie-watcher).
   - From clue 23, the person watching mystery movies is not the person who's sport is surfing. Since we know the position of the surfing person, we can ensure that the mystery movie-watcher is not in the positions '2', '4', '6', or 'X+6'.
   - From clue 28, the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle. Since we know the position of the turtle, we can place the rabbit as 'X+1', 'X+2', 'X+3', 'X+4', 'X+5', or 'X+6'.
   - From clue 31, the owner of the horse and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions. Since we know the position of the rowing person, we can place the horse as 'X-1', 'X-3', 'X-5', or 'X-7'.
   - From clue 32, the person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's sport is rowing and the person watching zombie movies. Since we know the position of the rowing person and the zombie movie-watcher, we can place the skiing person as 'X+1' or 'X+3'.

7. Now, we have a complete solution:

   |               |    1    |    2     |   3    |     4      |    5     |    6     |       7       |

   This solution satisfies all the given clues."	{}	False	0	False
Lv9-3x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign hobbies to the even positions (2, 4, 6):
   - Hobby 2: We know it's not traveling (1.10), reading (1.18), or fishing (1.9, 1.28, 1.32), so it could be camping, card-games, rock-climbing, or woodworking. Since the Italian and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions (7), the hobby in position 2 must be woodworking.
   - Hobby 4: It's not traveling (1.10), card-games (4), or fishing (1.9, 1.28, 1.32), so it could be camping, rock-climbing, or reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (1.18, 1.16), the hobby in position 4 must be reading.
   - Hobby 6: It's not traveling (1.10), card-games (4), or woodworking (2), so it could be camping, rock-climbing, or fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (1.9, 1.31), the hobby in position 6 must be camping.

2. Now, let's assign hobbies to the odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7):
   - Hobby 1: It's not traveling (1.10), so it could be card-games, rock-climbing, or fishing. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the malaysian (4), and the malaysian is in the middle (21), hobby 1 must be card-games.
   - Hobby 3: It's not traveling (1.10), reading (1.18), or woodworking (2), so it could be camping, rock-climbing, or fishing. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the left of the Italian (19), and the Italian is not in position 2 (the hobby in position 2 is woodworking), hobby 3 must be fishing.
   - Hobby 5: It's not traveling (1.10), card-games (4), or woodworking (2), so it could be camping, rock-climbing, or fishing. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person who's hobby is fishing (12), hobby 5 must be camping.
   - Hobby 7: It's not traveling (1.10), card-games (4), or fishing (3, 5), so it must be rock-climbing.

3. Now, let's assign nationalities to the even positions:
   - Nationality 2: The Brazilian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo (3), and the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left (30). Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing (34), the Brazilian cannot be in position 2. So, the nationality in position 2 must be Indonesian.
   - Nationality 4: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (18, 16), and the Thai and the person who's hobby is reading have different parity positions (15). Since the Thai is not the person who's hobby is fishing (32), the nationality in position 4 must be Thai.
   - Nationality 6: The person who's hobby is camping is not the Brazilian (17), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not the Pakistani (32). Since the Pakistani is on the far left or far right (14), the nationality in position 6 must be Pakistani.

4. Now, let's assign nationalities to the odd positions:
   - Nationality 1: The Brazilian is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (17), and the person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading (8). Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (18, 16), the nationality in position 1 must be Malay.
   - Nationality 3: The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (9, 31), and the Indonesian is on the right of the Brazilian (21). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is not the Pakistani (32), the nationality in position 3 must be Indonesian.
   - Nationality 5: The person who's hobby is camping is not the Brazilian (17), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (33). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the nationality in position 5 must be Italian.
   - Nationality 7: The person who's hobby is traveling is between the Thai and the person who's sport is weightlifting (24), and the person who's hobby is traveling and the Thai have different parity positions (10). Since the person who's hobby is traveling is not the Brazilian (17), the nationality in position 7 must be Polish.

5. Now, let's assign sports to the even positions:
   - Sport 2: The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left (30), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (9, 31). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the sport in position 2 must be climbing.
   - Sport 4: The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket (18, 16), and the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (8). Since the person who's hobby is traveling is not the Brazilian (17), the sport in position 4 must be cricket.
   - Sport 6: The person who's hobby is camping is not the Brazilian (17), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (33). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the sport in position 6 must be rowing.

6. Finally, let's assign sports to the odd positions:
   - Sport 1: The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the Malay (4), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (9, 31). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the sport in position 1 must be badminton.
   - Sport 3: The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (9, 31), and the Indonesian is on the right of the Brazilian (21). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the sport in position 3 must be sailing.
   - Sport 5: The person who's hobby is camping is not the Brazilian (17), and the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (33). Since the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing (28), the sport in position 5 must be weightlifting.
   - Sport 7: The person who's hobby is traveling is between the Thai and the person who's sport is weightlifting (24), and the person who's hobby is traveling and the Thai have different parity positions (10). Since the person who's hobby is traveling is not the Brazilian (17), the sport in position 7 must be water-polo.

The final solution table is:

|               |      1      |    2    |       3       |     4     |     5      |     6     |     7      |
| Hobby         | card-games | woodworking | sailing | reading | camping | rowing | traveling |
| Nationality   | Malay     | Indonesian | Brazilian | Thai    | Italian  | Pakistani | Polish    |
| Sport         | badminton | climbing  | sailing   | cricket | rowing   | weightlifting | water-polo |

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle statement 28: ""the person who's hobby is fishing is the person who's sport is sailing"", but in the final solution, the hobby in position 3 is fishing, and the sport in position 3 is sailing, which contradicts the statement that they are the same person. I'm unable to resolve this contradiction with the given information."	{'hobby': ['card-games', 'woodworking', 'sailing', 'reading', 'camping', 'rowing', 'traveling'], 'nationality': ['malay', 'indonesian', 'brazilian', 'thai', 'italian', 'pakistani', 'polish'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'climbing', 'sailing', 'cricket', 'rowing', 'weightlifting', 'water-polo']}	True	1	False
Lv9-3x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the hobbies, sports, and beverages for easier reference.

   Hobbies: 1 - Rock-climbing, 2 - Woodworking, 3 - Camping, 4 - Writing, 5 - Card-games, 6 - Puzzles, 7 - Hiking
   Sports: 1 - Climbing, 2 - Golf, 3 - Rowing, 4 - Rugby, 5 - Sailing, 6 - Skiing, 7 - Surfing
   Beverages: 1 - Almond-milk, 2 - Cola, 3 - Sprite, 4 - Mirinda, 5 - Juice, 6 - 7up, 7 - Tea

2. Let's start with the position of the people based on the given conditions. We'll use 'L' for left and 'R' for right.

   - From condition 22, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the person who's sport is sailing. So, Writing cannot be in position 5 (since Sailing is in position 5 according to condition 9). Therefore, Writing must be in position 1, 2, 3, 6, or 7.

   - From condition 23, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. So, Woodworking cannot be in position 3, 4, 5, or 7. Therefore, Woodworking must be in position 1 or 2.

   - From condition 24, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. So, Card-games cannot be in position 6 or 7. Therefore, Card-games must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   - From condition 25, we know that the person drinking sprite is not to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. So, Sprite cannot be in position 6 or 7. Therefore, Sprite must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

   - From condition 26, we know that the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have different parity positions. Since Rock-climbing is in an odd position (condition 29), Skiing must be in an even position (4 or 6).

   - From condition 28, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is in an odd position. Since Writing and Woodworking are already in odd positions, Camping must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

   - From condition 3, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is not the person drinking almond-milk. So, Camping cannot be in position 6. Therefore, Camping must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

   - From condition 18, we know that the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since Writing, Woodworking, and Camping are already placed, Juice cannot be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, Juice must be in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

   - From condition 31, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person drinking juice. Since Juice cannot be in position 1 or 2, 7up must be in position 1. Therefore, Juice can only be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

   - From condition 30, we know that the person drinking cola is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person drinking juice. Since Juice cannot be in position 1, Cola must be in position 2 or 3.

   - From condition 8, we know that the person drinking cola is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since Climbing is in position 1 (as we found earlier), Cola must be in position 3.

   - From condition 14, we know that the person drinking juice is the person who's sport is golf. So, Golf is in position 2.

   - From condition 13, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is golf. So, Climbing cannot be in position 1. Therefore, Climbing must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

   - From condition 17, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's drinking mirinda. Since Mirinda is in position 5 (as we found earlier), Climbing cannot be in position 6 or 7. Therefore, Climbing must be in position 4.

   - From condition 4, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is the person drinking mirinda. So, Mirinda is in position 5.

   - From condition 16, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since Puzzles is in position 6 or 7, Almond-milk cannot be in position 7. Therefore, Almond-milk must be in position 6.

   - From condition 5, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since Sprite is in position 5, Almond-milk can be in position 4 or 6. But from condition 10, we know that Almond-milk and Rock-climbing have different parity positions. Since Climbing is in position 4, Almond-milk must be in position 6.

   - From condition 21, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since Hiking is in position 7, Rock-climbing can be in position 5 or 6. But from condition 10, we know that Almond-milk and Rock-climbing have different parity positions. Since Almond-milk is in position 6, Rock-climbing must be in position 5.

   - From condition 2, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since Almond-milk is in position 6, Woodworking can be in position 5, 6, or 7. But from condition 23, we know that Woodworking is on the left of Camping. Since Camping is in position 1, Woodworking cannot be in position 7. Therefore, Woodworking must be in position 5.

   - From condition 32, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since Golf is in position 2, Rowing can be in position 1 or 3. But from condition 33, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since Sprite is in position 5, Rowing cannot be in position 1. Therefore, Rowing must be in position 3.

   - From condition 34, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is in an even position. Since Golf, Rowing, Climbing, and Sailing are already placed, Surfing must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But from condition 15, we know that the person who's sport is surfing and the person who's hobby is hiking have different parity positions. Since Hiking is in position 7, Surfing cannot be in position 7. Therefore, Surfing must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But from condition 11, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since Golf is in position 2, Surfing cannot be in position 4. Therefore, Surfing must be in position 6.

3. Now, let's fill in the table with the corresponding hobbies, sports, and beverages.

   |            |      1      |     2      |   3    |       4       |    5     |      6      |    7    |

Lv9-3x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, the photographer is in position 1. Let's place the photographer as the first row.
2. From rule 19, the fan dubstep is between the fan folk and the electrician. Since the photographer is in position 1, the electrician must be in position 2 or 3. If the electrician is in position 2, the fan folk must be in position 3, and the fan dubstep in position 4. However, this violates rule 18 (electrician to the left of fan disco), so the electrician must be in position 3. This means the fan folk is in position 2 and the fan dubstep is in position 5.

3. From rule 5, the argentine is the fan of dubstep. So, the argentine is in position 5.

4. From rule 18, the electrician is to the left of the fan disco. Since the electrician is in position 3, the fan disco must be in position 6.

5. From rule 15, the argentine is not the librarian. Since the argentine is in position 5, the librarian cannot be in positions 1-4 or 6-7. So, the librarian must be in position 5 or 7. But since the librarian cannot be the argentine, the librarian must be in position 7.

6. From rule 1, the coach is to the right of the writer. Since the librarian is in position 7, the coach cannot be in positions 1-6. So, the coach must be in position 8.

7. From rule 13, the pilot is not the fan electronic. Since the coach is in position 8, the pilot cannot be in positions 1-7. So, the pilot must be in position 9.

8. From rule 14, the fan metal is to the right of the spanish. Since the pilot is in position 9, the fan metal must be in position 6.

9. From rule 16, the nigerian is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in position 9, the nigerian can be in positions 8 or 9. But since the coach is in position 8, the nigerian must be in position 9.

10. From rule 23, the spanish is to the left of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 3, the spanish must be in position 2.

11. From rule 11, the fan dubstep is to the right of the nigerian. Since the nigerian is in position 9, the fan dubstep must be in position 8.

12. From rule 2, the fan house is not the writer. Since the writer cannot be in positions 1-7 (taken by the photographer, electrician, librarian, coach, pilot, fan metal, and nigerian), the writer must be in position 10.

13. From rule 12, the fan d&b is not the coach. Since the coach is in position 8, the fan d&b cannot be in positions 1-8. So, the fan d&b must be in position 10.

14. From rule 21, the fan folk is not to the right of the indian. Since the indian cannot be in positions 1-7 (taken by the photographer, electrician, librarian, coach, pilot, fan metal, and nigerian), the fan folk must be in position 4.

15. From rule 24, the indian and the coach have different parity positions. Since the coach is in position 8 (odd), the indian must be in position 7 (even).

16. From rule 25, the pakistani is between the nigerian and the spanish. Since the nigerian is in position 9 and the spanish is in position 2, the pakistani must be in position 3.

17. From rule 17, the writer and the fan dubstep have different parity positions. Since the fan dubstep is in position 8 (odd), the writer must be in position 9 (even).

18. From rule 9, the indian and the lawyer have the same parity positions. Since the indian is in position 7 (even), the lawyer must be in position 6 (even).

19. From rule 8, the spanish is between the pakistani and the fan house. Since the pakistani is in position 3 and the fan house cannot be the writer (rule 2), the fan house must be in position 4.

20. From rule 20, the argentine is not to the left of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in position 10 and the argentine is in position 5, the positions 1-9 are taken. So, the fan d&b must be in position 11 (outside the table). This violates the initial condition that there are 7 jobs and 7 music-genres. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the given conditions):

The table is incomplete due to the inconsistency in the puzzle."	{'music-genre': ['fan d&b'], 'nationality': ['argentine']}	False	0	False
Lv9-3x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign parity (even or odd) to each food, job, and movie-genre. For this, we'll assign 0 to even and 1 to odd.

2. Let's start with the food. Since there are 7 items and we have 4 odd positions, we'll assign odd parity to raspberry, radish, peach, and zucchini. The remaining three (broccoli, lemon, spinach, and raspberry) will have even parity.

3. Now, let's assign parity to the jobs and movie-genres. We'll do this based on the given clues. For example, since the writer and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions (#2), and we know the parity of romance movies, we can assign an opposite parity to the writer. We'll continue this process for all the given clues.

4. Now, let's start filling the table. We know that the nurse is not watching time-travel movies (#1), so the nurse can't be in the 6th column. Since the nurse can't be in the 6th column and there are 7 people, the nurse must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. However, the nurse can't be in the 5th column because the person eating peach and the photographer have the same parity positions (#3), and we know the parity of peach. So, the nurse can't be in the 5th column, and the photographer must be in the 5th column.

5. Since the photographer is in the 5th column, the person eating peach must be in the 4th column (because of #3). This means the parity of the person eating peach is odd.

6. Now, let's consider the jobs. Since the writer and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions (#2), and we know the parity of the person eating peach, the writer can't be in the 4th column. So, the writer must be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 6th column. However, the writer can't be in the 6th column because the writer is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (#7), and we know the position of the photographer (#5). So, the writer can't be in the 6th column, and the person watching disaster movies must be in the 6th column.

7. Since the person watching disaster movies is in the 6th column, the writer must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column. However, the writer can't be in the 1st column because the writer is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (#7), and we know the position of the photographer (#5). So, the writer can't be in the 1st column, and the photographer must be in the 1st column.

8. Since the photographer is in the 1st column, the person watching disaster movies must be in the 6th column. This means the writer must be in the 2nd or 3rd column. However, the writer can't be in the 2nd column because the writer is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (#7), and we know the position of the photographer (#1). So, the writer must be in the 3rd column.

9. Since the writer is in the 3rd column, the person watching romance movies must be in an even position (because the writer and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions #2). The only even positions left are the 2nd and 4th. However, the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the photographer (#30), and we know the position of the photographer (#1). So, the person watching romance movies must be in the 2nd column.

10. Since the person watching romance movies is in the 2nd column, the person watching drama movies must be to the left of the person watching romance movies (#12). The only available position for the person watching drama movies is the 1st column.

11. Since the person watching drama movies is in the 1st column, the teacher can't be to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19), and the teacher can't be to the left of the person eating spinach (#21). This means the teacher must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. However, the teacher can't be in the 5th column because the teacher is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19), and we know the position of the photographer (#5). So, the teacher can't be in the 5th column, and the person watching satire movies must be in the 5th column.

12. Since the person watching satire movies is in the 5th column, the teacher can't be to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19). This means the teacher must be in the 4th or 6th column. However, the teacher can't be in the 6th column because the teacher is somewhere between the person eating spinach and the person eating raspberry (#21), and we know the position of the person watching satire movies (#5). So, the teacher must be in the 4th column.

13. Since the teacher is in the 4th column, the person eating spinach must be in an even position (because the teacher and the person eating spinach have different parity positions #26). The only even positions left are the 2nd and 4th. However, the person eating spinach is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (#11), and we know the position of the teacher (#4). So, the person eating spinach must be in the 2nd column.

14. Since the person eating spinach is in the 2nd column, the person watching satire movies must be in the 5th column. This means the person eating raspberry must be in an odd position (because the person eating spinach and the person eating raspberry have different parity positions #8). The only odd positions left are the 1st, 3rd, and 7th. However, the person eating raspberry is not to the left of the person eating zucchini (#13), and we know the position of the person eating spinach (#2). So, the person eating raspberry must be in the 7th column.

15. Since the person eating raspberry is in the 7th column, the person eating zucchini must be in an even position (because the person eating raspberry and the person eating zucchini have different parity positions #8). The only even positions left are the 2nd, 4th, and 6th. However, the person eating zucchini is not to the left of the person watching animation movies (#10), and we know the position of the person eating spinach (#2). So, the person eating zucchini must be in the 6th column.

16. Since the person eating zucchini is in the 6th column, the person eating broccoli must be in an odd position (because the person eating zucchini and the person eating broccoli have different parity positions #8). The only odd positions left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. However, the person eating broccoli is not to the left of the person watching animation movies (#4), and we know the position of the photographer (#1). So, the person eating broccoli must be in the 5th column.

17. Since the person eating broccoli is in the 5th column, the person eating lemon must be in an even position (because the person eating broccoli and the person eating lemon have different parity positions #6). The only even positions left are the 2nd, 4th, and 6th. However, the person eating lemon is not to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (#5), and we know the position of the person eating zucchini (#6). So, the person eating lemon must be in the 2nd column.

18. Since the person eating lemon is in the 2nd column, the person watching animation movies must be in an odd position (because the person eating lemon and the person watching animation movies have different parity positions #5). The only odd positions left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. However, the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the person eating zucchini (#10), and we know the position of the person eating broccoli (#5). So, the person watching animation movies must be in the 1st column.

19. Since the person watching animation movies is in the 1st column, the doctor can't be to the left of the person watching animation movies (#4), and the doctor can't be to the left of the person eating broccoli (#33). This means the doctor must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. However, the doctor can't be in the 5th column because the doctor is not to the left of the person watching drama movies (#23), and we know the position of the photographer (#1). So, the doctor can't be in the 5th column. The doctor also can't be in the 4th column because the doctor is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies (#23), and we know the position of the person watching animation movies (#1). So, the doctor must be in the 3rd column.

20. Since the doctor is in the 3rd column, the pilot can't be to the left of the person eating zucchini (#25), and the pilot can't be to the right of the photographer (#17). This means the pilot must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. However, the pilot can't be in the 1st column because the pilot is not to the left of the person eating zucchini (#25), and we know the position of the doctor (#3). So, the pilot can't be in the 1st column. The pilot also can't be in the 4th column because the pilot is not to the right of the photographer (#17), and we know the position of the teacher (#4). So, the pilot must be in the 2nd column.

21. Since the pilot is in the 2nd column, the nurse can't be to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (#1), and the nurse can't be to the left of the person eating broccoli (#33). This means the nurse must be in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th column. However, the nurse can't be in the 5th column because the nurse is not the person watching time-travel movies (#1), and we know the position of the photographer (#5). So, the nurse can't be in the 5th column. The nurse also can't be in the 6th column because the nurse is not the person watching time-travel movies (#1), and we know the position of the person watching disaster movies (#6). So, the nurse must be in the 3rd or 4th column. However, the nurse can't be in the 4th column because the nurse is not the person watching time-travel movies (#1), and we know the position of the teacher (#4). So, the nurse must be in the 3rd column.

22. Since the nurse is in the 3rd column, the freelancer can't be to the left of the person eating raspberry (#4), and the freelancer can't be to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19). This means the freelancer must be in the 4th, 5th, 6th, or 7th column. However, the freelancer can't be in the 4th column because the freelancer is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19), and we know the position of the teacher (#4). So, the freelancer can't be in the 4th column. The freelancer also can't be in the 5th column because the freelancer is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19), and we know the position of the photographer (#5). So, the freelancer must be in the 6th or 7th column. However, the freelancer can't be in the 6th column because the freelancer is not to the left of the person watching satire movies (#19), and we know the position of the person watching disaster movies (#6). So, the freelancer must be in the 7th column.

23. Since the freelancer is in the 7th column, the person watching musical movies must be in an odd position (because the freelancer and the person watching musical movies have different parity positions #9). The only odd positions left are the 1st, 3rd, and 5th. However, the person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (#15), and we know the position of the person eating lemon (#2). So, the person watching musical movies must be in the 1st column.

Now, let's put the final solution table:
