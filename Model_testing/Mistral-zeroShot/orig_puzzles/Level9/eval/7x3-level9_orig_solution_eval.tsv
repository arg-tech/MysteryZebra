Lv9-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From condition 13, the Italian is not the owner of the guinea-pig or the person drinking juice. Let's assume the Italian is in position 2 or 3 (since the person drinking juice has the same parity as the owner of the guinea-pig).

2. From condition 8, the Brazilian is the owner of the turtle, so the turtle is in position 3.

3. From condition 12, the owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking juice have the same parity. Since the turtle is in position 3, the guinea-pig cannot be in position 1 (odd position), so it must be in position 2. This means the person drinking juice is in position 1.

4. From condition 14, the person who's hobby is reading is the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person drinking juice is in position 1, the weightlifter cannot be in position 1, so they must be in position 2 or 3.

5. From condition 11, the Italian is to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the weightlifter is in position 2 or 3, the Italian cannot be in position 3 (because the turtle is there), so the Italian is in position 2. This means the person drinking sprite is in position 3.

6. From condition 10, the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since the Italian is in position 2 and the turtle is in position 3, the person drinking sprite must be in position 1.

7. From condition 7, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the person who's hobby is cooking can be in position 2 or 3.

8. From condition 4, the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (position 2). Since the person who's hobby is cooking can be in position 2 or 3, the person drinking iced-tea can be in position 1 or 3.

9. From condition 6, the fan hip-hop is between the owner of the turtle (position 3) and the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person drinking iced-tea can be in position 1 or 3, the fan hip-hop can be in position 2.

10. From condition 5, the person eating pear is to the right of the Italian (position 2). Since the person who's hobby is cooking can be in position 2 or 3, the person eating pear can be in position 3.

11. From condition 9, the fan hip-hop and the person eating apricot have different parity. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 2 and the person eating pear is in position 3, the person eating apricot must be in position 1.

12. From condition 3, the owner of the goldfish and the person who's sport is weightlifting have different parity. Since the person who's hobby is cooking can be in position 2 or 3, the owner of the goldfish cannot be in position 2 (since the turtle is there), so the owner of the goldfish is in position 3. This means the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 1.

13. From condition 15, the person eating pear is not the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is the person who's sport is weightlifting (position 1), the person eating pear is not in position 1. So, the person eating pear is in position 3.

14. From condition 2, the owner of the goldfish and the person who's sport is weightlifting have different parity. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 1, the owner of the goldfish is in position 2.

15. From condition 6, the fan hip-hop is between the owner of the turtle (position 3) and the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking can be in position 2 or 3, the person who's hobby is baking can be in position 1 or 2. Since the person eating pear is in position 3, the person who's hobby is baking is in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 6 positions, the parity of the positions for the roller driver and dubstep fan will be the same for positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the roller driver is in position 1 (odd) and the dubstep fan is in position 3 (odd).

2. The house fan can't be in position 1 or 3 because of rule 2, so it must be in position 2 (even).

3. The swimming person can't be in position 1 because of rule 3, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the soy-milk drinker can't be to the left of the roller driver (rule 4), the swimming person can't be in position 4. So, the swimming person is in position 2, and the soy-milk drinker is in position 3.

4. The juice drinker can't be in position 1 because of rule 4, so it must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Since the roller driver is in position 1, the juice drinker can't be in position 5 (because of rule 5). So, the juice drinker is in position 6.

5. The tram driver can't be in position 1 because of rule 6, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the software-developer can't be in position 1 (rule 7), the tram driver can't be in position 2 (because of rule 1, as the roller driver is in position 1). So, the tram driver is in position 6.

6. The bus driver can't be in position 1 because of rule 6, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the tram driver is in position 6, the bus driver can't be in position 6. So, the bus driver is in position 4.

7. The analyst can't be in position 1 because of rule 12, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the strawberry eater is between the analyst and the dubstep fan (rule 12), the analyst can't be in position 6. So, the analyst is in position 2.

8. The doctor can't be in position 1 because of rule 12, so it must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the strawberry eater is between the analyst and the dubstep fan (rule 12), the doctor can't be in position 3. So, the doctor is in position 5.

9. The software-developer can't be in position 1 because of rule 7, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the tram driver is in position 6, the software-developer can't be in position 6. So, the software-developer is in position 4.

10. The papaya eater can't be in position 1 because of rule 12, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the strawberry eater is between the analyst and the dubstep fan (rule 12), the papaya eater can't be in position 2. So, the papaya eater is in position 6.

11. The apricot eater can't be in position 1 because of rule 13, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the lemonade drinker can't be to the right of the apricot eater (rule 13), the apricot eater can't be in position 6. So, the apricot eater is in position 4.

12. The soccer player can't be in position 1 because of rule 10, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the swimming person is in position 2, the soccer player can't be in position 2. So, the soccer player is in position 6.

13. The skiing player can't be in position 1 because of rule 10, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the soccer player is in position 6, the skiing player can't be in position 6. So, the skiing player is in position 4.

14. The lemonade drinker can't be in position 1 because of rule 4, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the tram driver is in position 6, the lemonade drinker can't be in position 6 (because of rule 14). So, the lemonade drinker is in position 2.

15. The woodworking person can't be in position 1 because of rule 9, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the dubstep fan is in position 3, the woodworking person can't be in position 3. So, the woodworking person is in position 6.

16. The chess player can't be in position 1 because of rule 15, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the strawberry eater is to the left of the woodworking person (rule 9), the chess player can't be in position 6. So, the chess player is in position 2.

17. The soul music fan can't be in position 1 because of rule 1, so it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the house fan is in position 2, the soul music fan can't be in position 2. So, the soul music fan is in position 4.

18. The house music fan can't be in position 6 because of rule 3, so it must be in position 2 or 4. Since the soul music fan is in position 4, the house music fan is in position 2.

19. The dubstep fan can't be in position 6 because of rule 1, so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since the woodworking person is to the right of the dubstep fan (rule 9), the dubstep fan can't be in position 3. So, the dubstep fan is in position 1.

20. The papaya eater is between the analyst and the dubstep fan (rule 12), so the analyst is in position 2 and the papaya eater is in position 4. The strawberry eater is to the left of the woodworking person (rule 9), so the strawberry eater is in position 6 and the woodworking person is in position 5.

Lv9-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From clue 12, the hobby of magic-tricks is in an even position. Since there are 6 people and an even number, the hobby of magic-tricks must be in positions 2, 4, or 6. But since the hobby of sudoku is to the right of the fan d&b (clue 1), the hobby of magic-tricks can't be in position 6. So, the hobby of magic-tricks is either in position 2 or 4.

2. From clue 2, the fan jazz is not the person who's hobby is camping. Since the hobby of camping can't be in position 6 (as the hobby of magic-tricks is in an even position), the hobby of camping must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From clue 3, the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the hobby of camping can't be in position 6, the social-worker can't be in position 6 either. So, the social-worker is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

4. From clue 4, the person drinking water is somewhere between the indian (position 1, according to clue 11) and the person watching time-travel movies. So, the person drinking water is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

5. From clue 5, the freelancer is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person drinking water is in positions 2, 3, or 4, the freelancer can't be in positions 3 or 4. So, the freelancer is in position 2 or 1.

6. From clue 6, the social-worker and the person watching action movies have different parity positions. Since the social-worker is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, the person watching action movies must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

7. From clue 7, the person watching action movies is somewhere between the person driving the bike and the pakistani. Since the indian is on the far left (clue 11), the person driving the bike must be in position 2 or 3. So, the person watching action movies is in positions 3, 4, or 5.

8. From clue 8, the brazilian is the fan funk. So, the brazilian is in position 4 (according to clue 14).

9. From clue 9, the person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the indian is on the far left (clue 11), the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 3. So, the person watching disaster movies is in positions 1 or 3.

10. From clue 10, the electrician is not the person driving the skateboard. Since the person watching disaster movies is in positions 1 or 3, the electrician can't be in those positions. So, the electrician is in position 5 or 6.

11. From clue 13, the fan d&b is not to the right of the fan jazz. Since the brazilian is in position 4, the fan d&b can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the fan d&b is in position 1, 2, or 3.

12. From clue 1, the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in positions 1, 2, or 3, the person with the hobby of sudoku is in positions 4, 5, or 6.

Now, let's put the information together:

|               |       1       |      2       |      3      |

Lv9-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 categories (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport) and 3 items in each category. Let's assign numbers to each item in each category:

   Beverage: 1 - 7up, 2 - Cola, 3 - Iced-Tea
   Food: 4 - Broccoli, 5 - Cherry, 6 - Lime
   Movie-Genre: 7 - Epic, 8 - Martial-Arts, 9 - Western
   Music-Genre: 10 - d&b, 11 - Dubstep, 12 - Metal
   Nationality: 13 - Canadian, 14 - Indian, 15 - Indonesian
   Pet: 16 - Guinea-Pig, 17 - Horse, 18 - Mouse
   Transport: 19 - Helicopter, 20 - Subway, 21 - Train

2. From rule 11, the Canadian is on the far left, so Canadian = 13.

3. From rule 10, the Indonesian is on the right of the owner of the horse, so Indonesian ≠ 15 and Indonesian > 17. Since there are only 3 nationalities, Indonesian = 15.

4. From rule 1, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the fan dubstep. Since the Canadian is already assigned, the only possible position for iced-tea is 3. So, Iced-Tea = 3.

5. From rule 4, the person eating cherry is not to the right of the person driving the train. Since the Indonesian is already assigned, the only possible position for the train is 21. So, Train = 21.

6. From rule 8, the person driving the subway is between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the horse. Since the Indonesian is the owner of the horse and Indonesian = 15, the subway cannot be 15. Also, the subway cannot be 16 (left of the horse) because the Canadian is on the far left. So, Subway = 17.

7. From rule 2, the person eating broccoli is the fan d&b. Since the Canadian is already assigned, the only possible position for d&b is 10. So, d&b = 10.

8. From rule 3, the fan metal is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the Indonesian is already assigned and the subway and the train are already placed, the only possible position for the helicopter is 19. So, Helicopter = 19.

9. From rule 5, the person watching western movies is not the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter is already placed, the only possible positions for western are 7 and 9.

10. From rule 6, the person eating broccoli is not the person drinking cola. Since broccoli = 4 and iced-tea = 3, the only possible position for cola is 2. So, Cola = 2.

11. From rule 7, the person drinking cola and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions. Since cola = 2 and there are only 3 movie genres, epic = 8 or 9. Since the person watching western movies is not the person driving the helicopter (already placed), epic cannot be 9. So, Epic = 8.

12. From rule 12, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the person watching western movies and the person driving the helicopter. Since iced-tea = 3, western = 7 or 9, and helicopter = 19, the only possible position for western is 7. So, Western = 7.

13. From rule 13, the fan metal and the person eating broccoli have different parity positions. Since metal = 12 and broccoli = 4, the only possible position for the fan of metal is 11 or 10. Since the person eating broccoli is already placed (broccoli = 4), the fan of metal must be 11 (Dubstep). So, Dubstep = 11 and Metal = 12.

14. From rule 14, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person drinking cola. Since iced-tea = 3 and cola = 2, the only possible positions for the food items are 4, 5, and 6. Since the person eating broccoli is already placed (broccoli = 4), the only possible food items for the remaining positions are cherry (5) and lime (6). Since the person eating cherry is not to the right of the person driving the train (already placed), the food item 5 must be cherry. So, Cherry = 5 and Lime = 6.

15. Now, we have placed all the items except for the transport and the pet. Since the subway is between the mouse and the horse, the only possible positions for the transport are 16, 18, and 20. Since the subway is already placed (Subway = 17), the only possible positions for the transport are 16 (Guinea-Pig), 18 (Horse), and 20 (Train). Since the train is already placed (Train = 21), the only possible transport for the remaining position is 16 (Guinea-Pig). So, Guinea-Pig = 16.

16. Finally, the only possible position for the horse is 18 (since the subway is already placed and the train is not to the right of the person eating cherry, which is already placed). So, Horse = 18.

Lv9-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 nationalities, the person who is Indian cannot be in the first position (as the Indian is to the left of the filmmaker). So, the first row cannot be Indian.

2. The second row cannot be Thai (as the Thai is not driving the boat). So, the second row cannot be Transport.

3. Let's assume the first row is Dutch (Nationality) and the second row is Cooking (Hobby). Now, the third row cannot be Sport, as the Dutch is not a sport.

4. The third row must be Beverage, and the third column must be Cola, as the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking cola and the person driving the bike (7th rule). So, the third row is Cola.

Since the rower is in position 3 and the puzzler is in position 2, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 1. However, we know that the lacrosse player is in position 1, so there is a contradiction. This means that our initial placement of the rower in position 1 was incorrect. Let's try placing the rower in position 2 instead.

This is impossible as we have exhausted all possible positions for the rower. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the rower can be in position 1, 2, or 3, we can continue with the following steps:

2. Similarly, we can fill in the second row (Food) with cauliflower, corn, mango.

3. For the third row (Music-Genre), we know that the person listening to rock is not to the right of the person listening to corn. Since there are only 3 music genres, the person listening to classical must be to the left of corn, and the person listening to d&b must be to the right of corn. So, the Music-Genre row can be filled as: classical, d&b, rock.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column of the Beverage row.

5. The person driving the car and the person drinking milk have different parity positions. Since there are 6 people, the parity of positions is determined by the number of people before them (0 for an even number of people before, 1 for an odd number). Since the person drinking milk is not milk (which is in the last column), the person driving the car must be in an odd position. Let's place the car driver in the first column of the Transport row. Since the person drinking milk is not in the first column, it must be in an even position. Let's place milk in the second column of the Beverage row.

6. The person eating corn is not to the right of the fan rock. Since rock is in the third column, corn cannot be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 foods, corn must be in the first column.

7. The person drinking milk is not to the right of the fan d&b. Since d&b is in the second column, milk cannot be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 beverages, milk must be in the first column. This contradicts our previous placement of milk, so we made an error in our previous steps. Let's correct it: the person drinking milk is in the first column, and the person driving the car is in the second column.

8. Now, the person eating corn is in the first column. The person listening to rock is not to the right of this person, so the person listening to classical must be in the second column, and the person listening to d&b must be in the third column.

9. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right, so it must be in the sixth column.

10. The person eating mango is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake owner cannot be in the first column (because the person eating corn is there), the snake owner must be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 pets, the snake owner must be in the second column. This means the person eating mango is in the fifth column.

11. The person who's sport is parkour is in an even position. Since there are only 3 sports, parkour must be in the fourth column.

12. The person who's sport is sailing is not to the right of the fan classical. Since classical is in the second column, sailing cannot be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 sports, sailing must be in the first column.

13. The malaysian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling is in the fourth column, the malaysian must be in the fifth or sixth column. Since there are only 3 nationalities, the malaysian must be in the fifth column.

14. The turkish is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the car driver is in the second column, the taxi driver cannot be in the first or second column. Since there are only 3 nationalities, the taxi driver must be in the third column. This means the turkish is in the fourth column.

15. The australian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the car driver is in the second column and the taxi driver is in the third column, the jet-ski driver must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 nationalities, the jet-ski driver must be in the sixth column.

16. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake owner is in the second column, the jet-ski driver must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since there are only 3 means of transport, the jet-ski driver must be in the third column.

Now, we have the final solution table:

Lv9-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the writer is to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Let's place the writer in the first position (1). Since the librarian is the fan rock (10), the librarian can't be in the first position. So, the person who's sport is tennis must be in the second position (2).

2. The fan gospel is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the owner of the snake (2). Since the writer is in the first position (1), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing can't be in the first position. So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in the third position (3). This means the fan gospel is in the second position (2) and the owner of the snake is in the fourth position (4).

3. The person who's sport is rugby is between the person driving the van and the owner of the goat (3). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the third position (3), the person driving the van can't be in the third position. So, the person driving the van must be in the fourth position (4). This means the person who's sport is rugby is in the fifth position (5) and the owner of the goat is in the sixth position (6).

4. The person eating cherry and the person who's sport is badminton have different parity positions (9). Since the person who's sport is tennis is in the second position (even), the person eating cherry can't be in the second position. So, the person eating cherry must be in the first position (1). This means the person who's sport is badminton is in the third position (3).

5. The person driving the airplane and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions (9). Since the person driving the van is in the fourth position (even), the person driving the airplane can't be in the fourth position. So, the person driving the airplane must be in the second position (2). This means the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the sixth position (6).

6. The writer is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (12). Since the writer is in the first position (1), the person who's hobby is camping can't be in the first position. So, the person who's hobby is camping must be in the second position (2).

7. The fan soul is not to the right of the person eating cucumber (13). Since the person who's hobby is camping is in the second position (2), the person eating cucumber can't be in the second position. So, the person eating cucumber must be in the third position (3). This means the fan soul is in the fourth position (4).

8. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter (7). Since the person who's hobby is camping is in the second position (2), the person driving the helicopter can't be in the second position. So, the person driving the helicopter must be in the fifth position (5). This means the person who's hobby is woodworking is in the fourth position (4).

9. The person who's sport is badminton and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions (9). Since the person who's sport is badminton is in the third position (3), the person who's hobby is woodworking is also in the third position (3).

10. The librarian is the fan rock (9). We already placed the librarian in the second position (2).

11. The writer is not to the left of the owner of the frog (11). Since the writer is in the first position (1), the owner of the frog can't be in the first position. So, the owner of the frog must be in the sixth position (6).

12. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position (4). We already placed the person eating cherry in the third position (3), the person eating pomegranate must be in the fifth position (5).

13. The person who's hobby is camping is not to the left of the fan gospel (14). Since the person who's hobby is camping is in the second position (2), the fan gospel can't be in the first position. So, the fan gospel must be in the fourth position (4).

14. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the fourth position (4). We already placed the person who's hobby is camping in the second position (2).

Lv9-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the gardener is to the left of the singer. Let's label the positions as even (E) for left and odd (O) for right.

2. From rule 2, the person eating onion is driving the roller, so we know that the roller driver is in position 2 (O). Let's place the onion eater in position 2.

3. From rule 3, the onion eater is not to the left of the banana eater. Since the onion eater is in position 2, the banana eater must be in position 1 (E) or position 3 (O). However, since the gardener is to the left of the singer (rule 1), the banana eater cannot be in position 3 (O), so the banana eater is in position 1 (E).

4. From rule 4, the kale eater is between the swimmer and the Australian. Since the banana eater is in position 1, the kale eater must be in position 2 or 3. If the kale eater were in position 2, the swimmer would have to be in position 1, but the gardener is already there (rule 3). So, the kale eater is in position 3 (O).

5. From rule 5, the martial-arts movie watcher is the scooter driver. Since the onion eater is in position 2, the scooter driver must be in position 3 (O).

6. From rule 6, the roller driver (onion eater) is the hedgehog owner. So, the hedgehog owner is in position 2 (O).

7. From rule 7, the roller driver (onion eater) is to the right of the animation movie watcher. Since the animation movie watcher is in position 3 (O), the animation movie watcher cannot be the person in position 1 (E). So, the animation movie watcher is in position 3 (O).

8. From rule 8, the weightlifter is in the middle. Since the positions are filled up to 3, the weightlifter is in position 2 (O).

9. From rule 9, the subway driver is not to the right of the video-gamer. Since the video-gamer is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the subway driver yet.

10. From rule 10, the rabbit owner is not to the right of the ferret owner. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 2 (O), the ferret owner must be in position 1 (E). The rabbit owner cannot be in position 2 (O) because the hedgehog owner is already there, so the rabbit owner must be in position 3 (O).

11. From rule 11, the ferret owner is between the rabbit owner and the swimmer. Since the ferret owner is in position 1 (E) and the rabbit owner is in position 3 (O), the swimmer must be in position 2 (O).

12. From rule 12, the video-gamer is to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the video-gamer yet.

13. From rule 13, the nigerian is not to the left of the martial-arts movie watcher. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 3 (O), the nigerian cannot be in position 1 (E) or position 2 (O). So, the nigerian is in position 3 (O).

14. From rule 14, the banana eater is not the hedgehog owner. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 2 (O), the banana eater cannot be in position 2 (O). So, the banana eater is in position 1 (E).

15. From rule 15, the swimmer and the onion eater have the same parity positions. Since the swimmer is in position 2 (O) and the onion eater is in position 2 (O), this rule is satisfied.

16. From rule 16, the hedgehog owner and the animation movie watcher have different parity positions. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 2 (O) and the animation movie watcher is in position 3 (O), this rule is not satisfied. However, since we placed the animation movie watcher in position 3 (O) based on rule 7, we made an error. The animation movie watcher should be in position 1 (E), and the hedgehog owner should be in position 3 (O).

Now, let's place the remaining person, the video-gamer. Since the video-gamer is to the right of the Italian (rule 12), the video-gamer must be in position 3 (O).

Lv9-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities. Since the Colombian can't be to the right of the person rowing, and the only nationality left is Pakistani for the person rowing, the Colombian must be either Chinese or Pakistani. Let's place the Colombian as Chinese for now.

2. Since the Colombian is on the left or right of the Chinese, the Pakistani must be in the middle.

3. Now, let's place the sports. Since the person watching adventure movies is eating cabbage, we know their position. Let's place them in the middle (position 2). The sport they are watching must be either cricket, rowing, or swimming. Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, the owner of the guinea-pig must be on the left of the person watching adventure movies. So, the guinea-pig owner can't be in position 2. Therefore, the sport they are watching must be rowing or swimming. Let's place the rowing in position 1 and swimming in position 3.

4. Now, we know the person in position 1 is rowing, and the person in position 3 is swimming. The person in position 1 can't be the Colombian (as the Colombian is Chinese), so they must be Pakistani. The person in position 3 must be either Chinese or Colombian.

5. The person in position 3 can't be the journalist (as the journalist is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies, which is in position 2), so they must be the entrepreneur. The person in position 1 (Pakistani) is not to the right of the chinese, so the Chinese must be in position 2.

6. Now, we know the Chinese is in position 2, the Pakistani is in position 1, and the entrepreneur is in position 3. The person in position 2 (Chinese) can't be the owner of the cat (as the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming, which is the entrepreneur in position 3), so the Chinese can't be the cat owner. The only nationality left is Colombian for the cat owner.

7. The cat owner can't be the person watching cricket (as the person watching cricket and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity positions, and the guinea-pig owner is the Pakistani in position 1, who is odd, while the person watching cricket must be even), so the cat owner must be the person watching swimming.

8. Now, we know the Colombian is the cat owner and the person watching swimming. The only sport left is cricket, so the person watching cricket must be the person watching fantasy movies (as they are on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, who is the Pakistani in position 1).

9. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the guinea-pig owner must be even. The only even position left is position 2, so the guinea-pig owner is the Chinese.

10. The only sport left is cricket, so the person watching cricket must be the entrepreneur.

11. The person watching adventure movies is the software-developer.

12. The journalist is on the left or right of the software-developer. The only position left is position 1, so the journalist is the Pakistani.

13. The person drinking mirinda is not the Colombian, so they must be the Chinese.

14. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani, so they must be the person eating cherry. The only position left is position 3, so the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person eating cherry.

15. The only beverage left is milk, so the person drinking milk is the person eating papaya.

16. The only food left is cabbage, so the person eating cabbage is the person watching adventure movies (the software-developer).

17. The only movie-genre left is time-travel, so the person watching time-travel movies is the person eating papaya (the person drinking milk).
