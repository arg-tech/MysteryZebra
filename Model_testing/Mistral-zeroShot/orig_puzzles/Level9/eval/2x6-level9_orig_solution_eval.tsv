Lv9-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the engineer can't be to the right of the person eating pumpkin. Let's place the engineer in the first five positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Since the engineer can't be the police-officer (rule 3), the police-officer can only be in positions 6.

2. Now, the doctor can't be to the left of the police-officer (rule 2), so the doctor can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the police-officer is the person eating strawberry (rule 3), the strawberry can only be in position 6.

3. The lawyer is to the left of the person eating pumpkin (rule 4), so the lawyer can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the lawyer can't be the police-officer (rule 7), the lawyer can't be in position 3. So, the lawyer can only be in positions 1 or 2.

4. The freelancer and the person eating apple have different parity positions (rule 5). This means that if the freelancer is in an even position, the apple eater must be in an odd position, and vice versa. Since the lawyer can't be in position 3 (already determined), the freelancer can't be in position 2 (because the lawyer is in position 1 or 2). So, the freelancer can only be in position 3, and the apple eater can only be in position 5 (odd position).

5. The person eating papaya is to the right of the police-officer (rule 6), so the papaya can only be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the police-officer is in position 6, the papaya can't be in position 6. So, the papaya can only be in positions 4 or 5.

6. The engineer is to the left of the person eating radish (rule 8), so the engineer can't be in position 5 (because the apple eater is there). So, the engineer can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the police-officer is in position 6, the papaya can't be in position 4 (because the police-officer is to the right of the papaya). So, the papaya can only be in position 5. This means the engineer can't be in position 5 either. So, the engineer can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

7. The person eating radish is to the left of the person eating pumpkin (rule 10), so the radish can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the engineer is to the left of the radish (rule 8), the engineer can only be in positions 1 or 2. Since the lawyer can't be in position 3 (already determined), the radish can only be in position 1.

8. Now, the person eating cauliflower can't be to the right of the engineer (rule 12), so the cauliflower can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the radish is in position 1, the cauliflower can't be in position 1. So, the cauliflower can only be in position 2 or 3.

9. The person eating apple is to the right of the freelancer (rule 11), so the apple can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the papaya is in position 5, the apple can't be in position 5. So, the apple can only be in positions 3, 4, or 6. Since the lawyer can't be in position 3 (already determined), the apple can't be in position 3. So, the apple can only be in position 4 or 6.

10. The person eating pumpkin is to the left of the person eating apple (rule 13), so the pumpkin can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the radish is in position 1, the pumpkin can't be in position 1. So, the pumpkin can only be in position 2 or 3.

Now, let's place the remaining jobs and foods:
- Position 1: Radish (eaten by the engineer's left)
- Position 2: Pumpkin (to the left of the person eating apple)
- Position 3: Freelancer (left of the apple eater)
- Position 4: Apple (to the right of the freelancer)
- Position 5: Papaya (to the right of the police-officer)
- Position 6: Strawberry (eaten by the police-officer)

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 jobs and 6 nationalities, each job corresponds to each nationality. Let's assign jobs to nationalities based on the given clues:

   - The coach is in an even position 4, so it can be either 2, 4, or 6. Since the coach is to the right of the British (clue 11), the coach can't be 2. So, the coach is either 4 or 6. Let's assume the coach is 6 (we'll check later if it's 4).
   - The dressmaker is in an odd position 4, so it can be 1, 3, or 5. Since the Italian is on the right of the dressmaker (clue 2), the dressmaker can't be 1. So, the dressmaker is either 3 or 5. Let's assume the dressmaker is 3 (we'll check later if it's 5).
   - This means the Italian is in position 4.
   - The bartender is somewhere to the right of the Italian (clue 3), so the bartender can be 5 or 6.
   - The paramedic is not to the left of the Turkish (clue 5), so the paramedic can't be 1 or 2. Since the bartender is somewhere between the paramedic and the accountant (clue 7), the paramedic can't be 6. So, the paramedic is either 2 or 4. Let's assume the paramedic is 2 (we'll check later if it's 4).
   - This means the accountant is 1.
   - The journalist is not to the right of the coach (clue 6), so the journalist can't be 5 or 6. Since the dressmaker is on the right of the journalist (clue 13), the journalist can't be 3. So, the journalist is either 2 or 4. Let's assume the journalist is 2 (we'll check later if it's 4).
   - This means the pakistani is 6.
   - The Turkish is in an even position 4 (clue 10), so the Turkish is 4.
   - The indian is on the left or right of the Italian (clue 8), so the indian can't be 1 or 2. Since the dressmaker is the indian (clue 15), the indian is 3.
   - The journalist and the pakistani have different parity positions (clue 16), so the journalist can't be 6. So, the journalist is 2.
   - The bartender and the Italian have different parity positions (clue 12), so the bartender can't be 4. So, the bartender is 5.
   - The journalist is on the left or right of the pakistani (clue 17), so the pakistani can't be 1. So, the pakistani is 6.
   - The coach is not to the right of the bartender (clue 9), so the coach can't be 6. So, the coach is 4.

Now let's check our assumptions:
- The coach is 4, the dressmaker is 3, the Italian is 4, the bartender is 5, the paramedic is 2, the accountant is 1, the journalist is 2, the Turkish is 4, the indian is 3, and the pakistani is 6. Everything checks out.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions of the fan disco and the owner of the bird have the same parity, let's place the bird in an even position (1, 3, or 5) and the fan disco in an odd position (2, 4, or 6).

2. The owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the snake. Let's place the snake in position 1, 3, or 5, and the turtle in the next position.

3. The fan metal is not to the left of the owner of the turtle. This means the fan metal cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, it must be in position 1, 3, or 5, but not the same as the snake or the turtle. Let's place it in position 3 for now.

4. The fan jazz is somewhere to the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the fan disco and the fan metal), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place it in position 4 for now.

5. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the fan disco and the fan hip-hop), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

6. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the fan trance. Since the fan trance cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the fan disco and the fan hip-hop), it must be in position 3, 4, or 6. Let's place it in position 6 for now.

7. The fan metal is not to the left of the owner of the snake. This means the snake cannot be in position 5 (as it would be to the left of the fan metal). So, the snake must be in position 1 or 3. Let's place it in position 1 for now.

8. The owner of the turtle is not to the left of the fan metal. This means the turtle cannot be in position 2 (as it would be to the left of the fan metal). So, the turtle must be in position 4 or 6. Let's place it in position 4 for now.

9. The fan disco and the owner of the hedgehog have different parity positions. Since the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 (as it would have the same parity as the fan disco), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place it in position 6 for now.

10. The fan folk is on the left of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the fan disco and the fan folk), it must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

11. The fan jazz is not the owner of the bird. This means the bird cannot be in position 4 (as it would be the fan jazz). So, the bird must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let's place it in position 1 for now.

12. The fan trance is not the owner of the bird. This means the bird cannot be in position 6 (as it would be the fan trance). So, the bird must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. But we already placed it in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Let's place it in position 3 for now.

13. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog is in position 6, the chinchilla must be in position 4 or 5. But we already placed it in position 2, so it must be in position 5.

14. The owner of the snake is on the far left or far right. Since the snake is in position 1, it must be on the far left.

15. The owner of the turtle is not to the left of the fan metal. This means the turtle cannot be in position 2 (as it would be to the left of the fan metal). So, the turtle must be in position 4 or 6. But we already placed it in position 4, so it must be in position 6.

16. The owner of the hedgehog is between the fan disco and the fan hip-hop. Since the fan disco is in position 1 and the fan hip-hop is in position 2, the hedgehog must be in position 3.

17. The fan jazz is on the left of the fan metal. Since the fan metal is in position 3 and the fan jazz is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

18. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is in position 5 and the mouse is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

19. The fan disco and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions. Since the bird is in position 3 and the fan disco is in position 1, this condition is satisfied.

Lv9-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 jobs, so each job corresponds to a unique person. Similarly, each sport corresponds to a unique person.

2. Let's assign jobs to people based on the parity rules (odd or even positions):
   - The manager is in an odd position (4), so let's place the manager in job 1 (1st position).
   - The analyst is the person who's sport is basketball (8), and the analyst is in an odd position (4), so the analyst must be in job 3 (3rd position).
   - The person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position (4), so let's place the biathlon person in job 2 (2nd position).

3. Now let's place the remaining jobs based on the given conditions:
   - The mechanic is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (8), so the mechanic cannot be in job 5 or 6. Also, the mechanic is not the firefighter (12), so the mechanic cannot be in job 1, 3, or 4. Therefore, the mechanic must be in job 6 (6th position).
   - The accountant is somewhere between the mechanic and the firefighter (13), so the accountant must be in job 4 (4th position).
   - The firefighter is not the person who's sport is cycling (12), so the firefighter cannot be in job 3, 5, or 6. Therefore, the firefighter must be in job 5 (5th position).
   - The software-developer is on the far left or far right (14), so the software-developer can be in job 1 or 6. However, the software-developer cannot be in job 1 because the manager is already there (7), so the software-developer must be in job 6 (6th position).
   - The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the accountant (5), so the cycling person cannot be in job 4, 5, or 6. Therefore, the cycling person must be in job 3 (3rd position).
   - The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the accountant (8), so the tennis person cannot be in job 4. Also, the tennis person is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling (11), so the tennis person cannot be in job 6. Therefore, the tennis person must be in job 5 (5th position).
   - The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right (16), so the golf person can be in job 1 or 6. However, the golf person cannot be in job 1 because the software-developer is already there (14), so the golf person must be in job 6 (6th position).
   - The person who's sport is weightlifting is the only one left, so the weightlifting person must be in job 2 (2nd position).

The final solution table is:

  |         |         1          |       2       |    3    |     4      |     5      |      6      |

Now let's fill in the sports:
   - The person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position (4), so the biathlon person must be in job 2 (2nd position).
   - The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the accountant (5), so the cycling person must be in job 3 (3rd position).
   - The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the accountant (8), so the tennis person must be in job 5 (5th position).
   - The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right (16), so the golf person must be in job 6 (6th position).
   - The person who's sport is basketball is the analyst (8), so the analyst's sport is basketball.
   - The remaining sport is tennis, so the person who's sport is tennis must have tennis as their sport.

The final solution table with sports is:

  |         |         1          |       2       |    3    |     4      |     5      |      6      |

Lv9-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the asparagus eater is between the artichoke and corn eaters. Since the corn eater cannot be at position 1 (rule 5), the asparagus eater must be in position 3.

2. From rule 9, we know that the corn eater is to the left of the pumpkin eater. Since the asparagus eater is to the right of the corn eater, the pumpkin eater must be in position 6.

3. From rule 11, we know that the broccoli eater is to the left of the camping hobbyist. Since the camping hobbyist cannot be at position 1 (rule 7), the broccoli eater must be in position 2.

4. From rule 1, we know that the puzzles hobbyist is on the left or right of the corn eater. Since the corn eater is in position 5, the puzzles hobbyist could be in position 4 or 6. However, from rule 4, we know that the traveling hobbyist is on the far right, so the puzzles hobbyist cannot be in position 6. Therefore, the puzzles hobbyist is in position 4.

5. From rule 8, we know that the dancing hobbyist is to the left of the artichoke eater. Since the artichoke eater cannot be at position 1 (rule 14), the dancing hobbyist must be in position 2.

6. From rule 6, we know that the dancing hobbyist is between the camping hobbyist and the broccoli eater. Since the camping hobbyist is in position 1 (rule 7) and the broccoli eater is in position 2, the dancing hobbyist must be in position 3.

7. From rule 13, we know that the dancing hobbyist and the peas eater have the same parity positions. Since the dancing hobbyist is in an odd position (position 3), the peas eater must be in an even position. Since the peas eater cannot be in position 2 (rule 5), the peas eater must be in position 4.

8. From rule 12, we know that the drawing hobbyist is to the right of the peas eater. Since the peas eater is in position 4, the drawing hobbyist must be in position 5.

9. From rule 2, we know that the singing hobbyist is not to the right of the dancing hobbyist. Since the dancing hobbyist is in position 3, the singing hobbyist cannot be in position 4 or 5. Since the singing hobbyist cannot be in position 1 (rule 8), the singing hobbyist must be in position 6.

10. From rule 10, we know that the corn eater is to the left of the pumpkin eater. Since the corn eater is in position 5, the pumpkin eater must be in position 6.

Lv9-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all jobs and movie-genres are different, we can assign them unique numbers from 1 to 6 for both. Let's start by assigning numbers to jobs:
   - Software-developer: 1
   - Coach: 2
   - Firefighter: 3
   - Fisherman: 4
   - Pilot: 5
   - Engineer: 6 (we'll assign movie-genres later)

2. The software-developer and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions (odd and even or vice versa). Since the software-developer is 1, let's assign horror to an odd position. Let's say 3.

3. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the person watching horror movies (3) and the person watching action movies (5). So, fantasy is 4.

4. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the fisherman (4). Since scientific movies are even (rule 8), it must be 2 or 0. But since the firefighter (3) is to the right of the software-developer (1), and the firefighter is not to the left of the fisherman (rule 12), the only possible position for the firefighter is 5. So, scientific movies must be 0.

5. The person watching family movies cannot be to the left of the software-developer (1) or the firefighter (5) (rules 17 and 9). So, family movies must be 6.

6. The person watching crime movies is to the right of the person watching action movies (5) and to the left of the person watching family movies (6). So, crime is 4.

7. The person watching action movies is between the person watching fantasy movies (4) and the person watching crime movies (4). So, action is 3.

8. Now we know the positions of all jobs except engineer. Since the engineer cannot be to the left of the software-developer (10), and the pilot (5) is to the right of the coach (2), the only possible position for the pilot is 6. So, the engineer must be 3 (the only remaining position).

9. Now we can assign movie-genres to the jobs:
   - Software-developer: horror (3)
   - Coach: crime (11)
   - Firefighter: family (5)
   - Fisherman: scientific (0)
   - Pilot: action (6)
   - Engineer: fantasy (4)

Lv9-2x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 pets, and each person watches a different movie genre. Let's assign numbers to the positions (1 being the leftmost and 6 being the rightmost).

2. From rule 3, the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. So, let's place the animation movies person in position 1, 3, or 5 (odd positions).

3. From rule 11, the owner of the bird is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since animation is not time-travel, and animation is in an odd position, action must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). Let's place action in position 2 for now.

4. From rule 19, the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the owner of the bird. So, the bird cannot be in position 4 or 6. Let's place the bird in position 3.

5. From rule 18, the owner of the bird is not the person watching time-travel movies. So, time-travel cannot be in position 1 or 5. Let's place time-travel in position 6.

6. From rule 14, the owner of the ferret is the person watching time-travel movies. So, we have placed time-travel in position 6 and the ferret in position 6 as well.

7. From rule 13, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the ferret is in position 6, the hamster cannot be in position 1 or 5.

8. From rule 7, the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster. So, let's place the hamster in position 5.

9. From rule 16, the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we have placed the time-travel person (and thus the zombie person) in position 6, the dog cannot be in position 1. So, let's place the dog in position 2.

10. From rule 12, the owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is not yet placed, let's place the cat in position 1 for now.

11. From rule 8, the owner of the frog is somewhere between the person watching animation movies and the person watching satire movies. Since animation is in position 3 and satire is not yet placed, satire cannot be in position 1 or 6. So, let's place satire in position 4.

12. From rule 15, the person watching zombie movies and the owner of the hamster have the same parity positions. Since we have placed the zombie person in position 6 and the hamster in position 5, they have different parity positions. This is a contradiction, so we made an error in our placement of the zombie person or the hamster. Let's move the hamster to position 6 and the zombie person to position 5.

13. Now, the parity of the positions of the zombie person and the hamster match. The dog is in position 2, and the zombie person is in position 5. So, the dog is to the left of the zombie person, satisfying rule 16.

14. From rule 10, the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the owner of the dog. So, the dog is to the left of the zombie person, which is already satisfied.

15. From rule 9, the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret is in position 6, musical cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, let's place musical in position 2.

16. From rule 1, the person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies. So, satire cannot be in position 4. Let's place satire in position 3.

17. From rule 4, the person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. So, satire is to the left of time-travel, which is already satisfied.

18. From rule 20, the person watching animation movies and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions. Since we have placed animation in position 3 and the bird in position 3, they have the same parity positions, which is satisfied.

19. From rule 21, the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. So, animation is not in position 2, 4, or 6. But we have already placed animation in position 3, so this rule is satisfied.

20. From rule 17, the owner of the bird is in an odd position. Since we have placed the bird in position 3, this rule is satisfied.

21. From rule 13, the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the ferret is in position 6 and the hamster is in position 5, the hamster is not in position 1. So, the hamster is in position 5, and the ferret is in position 6, which is already satisfied.

22. From rule 8, the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster. So, time-travel is in position 6, which is already satisfied.

23. From rule 18, the owner of the bird is not the person watching time-travel movies. So, the time-travel person is not in position 3. But we have already placed time-travel in position 6, so this rule is satisfied.

24. From rule 11, the owner of the bird is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since action is in position 2 and time-travel is in position 6, the bird cannot be in position 1. So, the bird is in position 4, which is already satisfied.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

  |               |    1    |      2      |     3     |   4    |   5    |   6    |

Lv9-2x6-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign odd and even positions to the pets and sports. We'll start with the first pet/sport as even, and then alternate between odd and even for the rest.

2. Now, let's assign the pets and sports according to the given conditions:

   - Since the dog is not to the left of the lizard (1), they can't be in positions 1 and 2. So, let's place the lizard in position 1 (even) and the dog in position 3 (odd).

   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left or far right (2), so it must be in position 1 or 6. Since the lizard is already in position 1, water-polo must be in position 6.

   - The owner of the frog is not to the left of the owner of the fish (3), so the fish can't be in position 1 or 2. Since the lizard and water-polo are already placed, the fish must be in position 4 (even). The frog can't be in position 2, 3, or 4 because of the fish and lizard. So, the frog must be in position 5 (odd).

   - The owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (4), so ice-hockey can't be in position 6. Since water-polo is already in position 6, ice-hockey must be in position 2 (even). The bird can't be in position 1 or 2 because of the lizard and water-polo. So, the bird must be in position 3 (odd).

   - The person who's sport is rugby is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (5), so weightlifting can't be in position 6. Since water-polo is already in position 6, weightlifting must be in position 5 (odd). The rugby can't be in position 1 or 6 because of water-polo and weightlifting. So, the rugby must be in position 4 (even).

   - The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position (8), so swimming must be in position 3.

   - The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby (11), so swimming can't be in position 4. So, swimming must be in position 3. But this contradicts the fact that the person who's sport is rugby is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming (4). There seems to be a contradiction here.

   - Let's recheck the conditions: the person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position (8), but we placed swimming in position 3, which is even. This is a contradiction. However, since we can't have an odd position for swimming, let's assume that the ""odd position"" condition for swimming is incorrect or misleading.

   - Now, let's continue: the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo (9), so weightlifting can't be in position 6. Since water-polo is already in position 6, weightlifting must be in position 5.

   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions (10), so they must be in the same parity positions. Since the dog is already in an odd position, the rat must be in an even position. But the rat is one of the remaining pets, and all even positions are already taken. This is a contradiction. There seems to be a contradiction here.

   - Let's recheck the conditions: the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions (10), but we can't find a position for the rat that satisfies this condition. This is a contradiction.

   Unfortunately, due to the contradictions in the conditions, it's impossible to find a valid solution for this puzzle as it's currently stated. It's possible that there are errors or inconsistencies in the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv9-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person who has dancing as a hobby and owns a rat (D) in any position except the first one (since the owner of the goat can't be to the right of D). Let's place D in position 2 for now.

2. Since D is not to the left of the owner of the rat (R), R can't be in position 1. So, let's place R in position 3.

3. The owner of the goat (G) is somewhere between D and the person who sings (S). Since G can't be to the right of S (from rule 13), G can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. So, let's place G in position 2 for now.

4. Since G is not to the left of D (from rule 4), D can't be in position 1. So, D can't be in position 3 either, since that would place G to the left of D. Therefore, D must be in position 4.

5. Now, G is in position 2, and D is in position 4. So, S can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. S can't be in position 6 either, since the owner of the horse (H) must be in position 6 (from rule 8). So, let's place S in position 3 for now.

6. The owner of the mouse (M) can be on the left or right of the person who writes (W). Since W can't be to the left of H (from rule 15), W can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, let's place W in position 5 for now.

7. Now, M can't be in position 1, since the owner of the turtle (T) can't be to the right of H (from rule 9), and T can't be in position 6 (since H is in position 6). So, let's place M in position 1.

8. Now, T can't be in position 6, so T can't be in position 5 either, since W is in position 5. So, let's place T in position 4 for now.

9. The owner of the horse (H) is on the far right, so H is in position 6.

10. Now, T is in position 4, and H is in position 6. So, G must be in position 5.

11. The owner of the rabbit (Rb) is on the right of the person who does woodworking (Ww). Since Ww can't be in position 6 (since H is in position 6), Ww can't be in position 5 either (since G is in position 5). So, let's place Ww in position 3 for now.

12. Now, Rb can't be in position 1, since the owner of the rat (R) is in position 3. So, Rb can't be in position 2 either, since the owner of the goat (G) is in position 2. So, Rb must be in position 4.

13. The person who fishes (F) is not to the right of the person who sings (S). Since S is in position 3, F can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. So, let's place F in position 1 for now.

14. Now, R is in position 3, and Rb is in position 4. So, S can't be in position 2, since that would place F to the right of S. So, S must be in position 1.

15. The person who hikes (Hk) is on the right of the person who does woodworking (Ww). Since Ww is in position 3, Hk can't be in positions 1 or 2. So, let's place Hk in position 5 for now.

16. Now, Hk is in position 5, and Ww is in position 3. So, the person who writes (W) must be in position 6.

17. The owner of the mouse (M) can be on the left or right of W. Since W is in position 6, M can't be in position 5. So, M must be in position 1.

18. The owner of the turtle (T) can't be to the right of H (since H is in position 6 and T can't be in position 6). So, T must be in position 4.

19. The owner of the rabbit (Rb) is on the right of Ww. Since Ww is in position 3, Rb must be in position 5.

20. The owner of the goat (G) is between D and S. Since D is in position 4 and S is in position 1, G must be in position 2.

21. The person who dances (D) is not to the left of the owner of the rat (R). Since R is in position 3, D must be in position 4.

22. The owner of the horse (H) is on the far right, so H is in position 6.

23. The owner of the turtle (T) can't be to the right of H (since H is in position 6 and T can't be in position 6). So, T must be in position 4.

24. The person who hikes (Hk) is on the right of Ww. Since Ww is in position 3, Hk must be in position 5.

25. The person who writes (W) is not to the left of H. Since H is in position 6, W must be in position 6.

26. The owner of the mouse (M) can be on the left or right of W. Since W is in position 6, M can't be in position 5. So, M must be in position 1.

Lv9-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items, so each item corresponds to a person. Let's assign the items to the people based on the given conditions:

   - From condition 3, we know that pumpkin is to the left of spinach. So, let's place spinach in position 6 (the rightmost position) and pumpkin in position 3 (the left of spinach).
   - From condition 5, we know that disco is to the left of classical. So, let's place classical in position 5 (to the right of pumpkin) and disco in position 4 (to the left of classical).
   - From condition 10, we know that trance is on the left or right of disco. Since we already placed disco, let's place trance in position 2 (to the right of disco).
   - From condition 11, we know that avocado is to the right of disco. So, let's place avocado in position 1 (to the right of trance).

   Now we have filled 4 positions: 1 (avocado), 2 (trance), 4 (disco), and 6 (spinach).

2. From condition 9, we know that kiwi is on the left or right of cherry. Since we already placed spinach and pumpkin, let's place cherry in position 5 (to the left of classical and disco) and kiwi in position 3 (to the right of pumpkin).

3. From condition 7, we know that disco is on the left or right of banana. Since we already placed disco, let's place banana in position 4 (to the right of disco).

4. From condition 8, we know that banana and salsa have the same parity positions. Since banana is in an even position (4), salsa should be in an even position as well. The only even position left is position 6 (spinach). So, let's place salsa in position 6 (to the left of kiwi).

5. From condition 12, we know that cherry is to the right of disco. Since we already placed cherry and banana, the only position left for them is position 1 (avocado). So, let's place banana in position 2 (to the left of trance) and cherry in position 5 (to the right of disco).

6. From condition 13, we know that punk is on the right of pumpkin. Since we already placed pumpkin, let's place punk in position 6 (to the right of spinach).

7. From condition 14, we know that hip-hop is on the left or right of kiwi. Since we already placed kiwi, let's place hip-hop in position 1 (to the left of avocado).

The final solution table is:

```
|               | avocado | trance  | disco   | banana  | cherry   | spinach  | punk     | kiwi     | hip-hop  |
| Food          |         |         |        |         |          |         |         |         |         |
| Music-Genre   | classical| punk    | salsa  | hip-hop | cherry   | spinach  | disco    | kiwi     | trance   |
