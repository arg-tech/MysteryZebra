Lv9-4x6-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign jobs to the even positions (2, 4, and 6) since we know the bartender is in an odd position (8). Let's assume the bartender is in position 1. So, the jobs for positions 2, 4, and 6 are pilot, security-guard, and teacher, respectively.

2. Now, let's assign movie genres to the odd positions (1, 3, and 5). Since the person watching zombie movies is the bartender (19), the genre for position 3 is superhero (10). The person watching fantasy movies can't be in position 1 (6), so it must be in position 5. The remaining genre for position 3 is scientific (2).

3. Now, we can assign pets to the even positions. Since the security-guard is the owner of the ferret (12), the pet for position 4 is the horse (11). The owner of the horse can't be in position 6 (10), so it must be in position 2. The remaining pet for position 4 is the rabbit.

4. Now, let's assign beverages to the odd positions. Since the person drinking fanta is the bartender (19), the beverage for position 3 is iced-tea (17). The person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 1 (33), so it must be in position 5. The remaining beverage for position 3 is coffee (4).

5. Now, we can assign the remaining beverages and pets to the remaining positions. The person drinking almond-milk can't be the spy watcher (18), so it must be in position 6. The person watching spy movies can't be in position 2 (25), so it must be in position 4. The remaining beverage for position 6 is milk (26). The person watching superhero movies can't be in position 6 (10), so it must be in position 2. The remaining beverage for position 4 is 7up (21).

6. The remaining pet for position 1 is the mouse.

Here is the final solution table:

Now, let's fill in the missing Movie-Genre, Job, and Pet for the remaining rows:

1. Since the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies (2), and the person watching superhero movies is in position 2, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1. So, the genre for position 1 is thriller. The job for position 1 is bartender (19), and the pet for position 1 is ferret (12).

2. Since the person watching spy movies can't be in position 2 (25), it must be in position 4. So, the genre for position 4 is spy. The job for position 4 is security-guard, and the pet for position 4 is rabbit.

3. Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person drinking milk (33), and the person drinking milk is in position 6, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 5. So, the genre for position 5 is fantasy. The job for position 5 is chef (35), and the pet for position 5 is hedgehog.

Lv9-4x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires careful analysis of the given conditions. Here's a step-by-step solution:

Step 1: From condition 14, we know that the Chinese is the engineer. Let's place the engineer in position 3 (since the conditions don't specify otherwise).

Step 2: From condition 3, we know that the Chinese is to the left of the chef. So, the chef must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the chef can't be in position 6 (condition 22), the chef is either in position 2 or 4. Let's place the chef in position 4 for now.

Step 3: From condition 17, the musician is on the far left or far right. Since the chef is in position 4, the musician can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the musician must be in position 2 or 6. Let's place the musician in position 6 for now.

Step 4: From condition 18, the chef and the person who's hobby is chess have different parity positions. Since the chef is in an even position (4), the person who's hobby is chess must be in an odd position (1, 3, 5). Let's place the person who's hobby is chess in position 1 for now.

Step 5: From condition 25, the teacher is between the person driving the skateboard and the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1, the teacher can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the teacher must be in position 4 or 6. Since the teacher can't be in position 6 (condition 17), the teacher is in position 4.

Step 6: From condition 21, the person driving the scooter is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person driving the taxi. Since the person who's hobby is traveling can't be in position 1 (condition 28), the person driving the scooter can't be in position 6. So, the person driving the scooter is in position 2 or 4. Since the engineer is in position 3, the person driving the scooter can't be in position 4. So, the person driving the scooter is in position 2.

Step 7: From condition 26, the person driving the airplane is between the person driving the ship and the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is in position 2, the person driving the airplane can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the person driving the airplane is in position 4 or 6. Since the chef is in position 4, the person driving the airplane is in position 6.

Step 8: From condition 23, the person who's hobby is fishing is to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is in position 5, the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6.

Step 9: From condition 29, the indian is not to the left of the teacher. Since the teacher is in position 4, the indian is in position 5 or 6. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 6, the indian is in position 5.

Step 10: From condition 31, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the indian. Since the indian is in position 5, the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1, the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 3.

Step 11: From condition 11, the indian is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. This contradicts our placement of the indian and the person who's hobby is board-games in step 9 and step 10. To resolve this, we need to swap the positions of the indian and the person who's hobby is board-games. So, the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 5, and the indian is in position 3.

Step 12: From condition 22, the person driving the car is on the left or right. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 5, the person driving the car can't be in position 1, 3, or 6. So, the person driving the car is in position 2 or 4.

Lv9-4x6-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Identify the unique elements for each category (job, movie-genre, nationality, sport).
- Jobs: architect, bartender, electrician, manager, mechanic, pilot
- Movie-genres: family, musical, mystery, scientific, time-travel, zombie
- Nationalities: australian, dutch, italian, japanese, russian, spanish
- Sports: baseball, basketball, cycling, lacrosse, sailing, snowboarding

Step 2: Use the given clues to fill in as much information as possible.

Step 3: Continue filling in the table based on the given clues, using the process of elimination and logical deductions.

Step 4: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the table is filled.

Here's the solution:

|               |     1     |      2       |      3      |    4     |     5      |      6      |
| Job           | architect | bartender   | electrician | manager  | mechanic   | pilot       |
| Movie-Genre   | family    | musical      | mystery     | time-travel| scientific  | zombie      |
| Nationality   | australian| dutch        | italian     | russian   | japanese   | spanish     |
| Sport         | baseball  | basketball   | cycling     | lacrosse  | sailing     | snowboarding |

Explanation:
1. The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the manager (5). So, sailing can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the pilot is not to the left of the russian (8), sailing cannot be in position 1. So, sailing is either 2 or 3. Since the manager is on the right of the person watching family movies (6), sailing cannot be in position 6. So, sailing is in position 2.
2. The pilot is not to the left of the russian (8). So, the pilot is in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the pilot and the person who's sport is basketball have different parity positions (9), the pilot cannot be in position 6 (since basketball is in position 5). So, the pilot is either 4 or 5. Since the manager is on the right of the person watching family movies (6), the pilot cannot be in position 4. So, the pilot is in position 5.
3. The spanish is on the far right (26). So, the spanish is in position 6.
4. The bartender is the australian (22). So, the bartender is in position 2.
5. The manager is on the right of the person watching family movies (6). So, the manager is in position 5 or 6. Since the manager is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies (3), the manager cannot be in position 6 (since the mechanic is in position 6). So, the manager is in position 5.
6. The person watching mystery movies is the russian (5). So, the russian is in position 3.
7. The person who's sport is cycling is not the person watching musical movies (14). So, cycling cannot be in position 4 (since the mechanic is in position 4). So, cycling is in position 1 or 2. Since the spanish is on the left or right of the bartender (3), cycling cannot be in position 2 (since the bartender is in position 2). So, cycling is in position 1.
8. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person watching musical movies (4). So, lacrosse is in position 4.
9. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the mechanic (7). So, zombie can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies (20), zombie cannot be in position 3. So, zombie is either 1 or 2. Since the person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the person watching musical movies (27), zombie cannot be in position 1. So, zombie is in position 2.
10. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the russian (3). Since the russian is in position 3, the person watching scientific movies is in position 1 or 5. Since the manager is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies (3), the person watching scientific movies is not in position 5. So, the person watching scientific movies is in position 1.

Lv9-4x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 6 being the far right).

2. From rule 18, the person eating tomato is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the tomato is on position 1 for now.

3. From rule 28, the designer is between the librarian and the person eating tomato. So, the designer is on position 2 or 3. If the designer is on position 2, the librarian must be on position 4 or 5. But if the librarian is on position 4, the musician, who is to the right of the librarian (rule 15), would be on position 6, which is not possible because there are only 5 positions left. So, the designer is on position 3, and the librarian is on position 4.

4. From rule 10, the entrepreneur is on an even position. Since the designer and librarian are on positions 3 and 4, the entrepreneur must be on position 2 or 6. But from rule 7, the entrepreneur is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver can't be on position 1 (because the tomato is there), the boat driver must be on position 5 or 6. But if the boat driver is on position 6, the entrepreneur would have to be on position 2, which is already occupied by the designer. So, the boat driver is on position 5, and the entrepreneur is on position 2.

5. From rule 19, the baker is not the musician. Since the musician is on position 6, the baker can't be on position 6 either. So, the baker is on one of the remaining positions (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5). But from rule 22, the person driving the van is between the person eating onion and the boat driver. Since the boat driver is on position 5, the onion can't be on position 6. So, the onion is on position 1, and the van is on position 3.

6. From rule 24, the fisher is to the right of the taxi driver. Since the taxi driver can't be on position 1 (because the onion is there), the taxi driver must be on position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But from rule 1, the taxi driver is to the right of the person eating tomato, which is on position 1. So, the taxi driver is on position 2, and the fisher is on position 3, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 2, the bartender is not the person eating pepper. Since the pepper can't be on position 1 (because the onion is there), the pepper can't be on position 6 either (because the musician is there). So, the pepper is on position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But from rule 27, the person eating pepper is not the boat driver. So, the pepper is not on position 5.

8. From rule 21, the skateboard driver is not to the left of the person eating cherry. Since the cherry can't be on position 1 (because the onion is there), the cherry can't be on position 6 either (because the musician is there). So, the cherry is on position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But from rule 11, the photographer is not to the right of the person eating cherry. So, the cherry is not on position 5.

9. From rule 26, the cauliflower is to the left of the van driver. Since the van driver is on position 3, the cauliflower is on position 1, 2, or 4. But from rule 23, the person eating cauliflower is the sudoku person. So, the sudoku person is on position 1, 2, or 4.

10. From rule 25, the sudoku person is not to the left of the photographer. So, the sudoku person is not on position 1.

11. From rule 30, the person eating pepper is to the right of the van driver. So, the pepper is on position 4 or 5. But from rule 32, the person eating pepper is to the right of the bartender. Since the bartender is on position 2, the pepper can't be on position 4.

14. From rule 16, the person eating cherry and the person who's hobby is traveling have different parity positions. Since the cherry is on position 2, the traveler can't be on position 2 either.

Lv9-4x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know there are 6 nationalities, pets, sports, and transports. Since they are all different, we can fill in one of each in the first row and column. Let's start with nationalities:

   | Nationality   | Argentine | British  | Dutch   | Egyptian | Italian  | Polish   |
   |-------------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
   | Pet          | Cat      | Dog     | Guinea-pig| Lizard  | Mouse    | Turtle  |

   | Transport    | Car      | Jet-ski | Roller  | Snowmobile| Scooter  | Taxi    |

2. From rule 1, we know the Italian is on the far right, so we can fill in Italian in the last column.

   | Nationality   | Argentine | British  | Dutch   | Egyptian | Italian  | Polish   |
   |-------------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
   | Pet          | Cat      | Dog     | Guinea-pig| Lizard  | Mouse    | Turtle  |

   |-------------|----------|---------|--------|----------|----------|---------|
   | Pet          | Cat      | Dog     | Guinea-pig| Lizard  | Mouse    | Turtle  |
   | Sport        | Baseball | Basketball| Cycling | Lacrosse | Rugby    | Weightlifting|
   | Transport    | Car      | Jet-ski | Roller  | Snowmobile| Scooter  | Taxi    |

   Let's fill in Car in the first row since it's the only transport left.

Lv9-4x6-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person, nationality, job, pet, and beverage. We will use the numbers 1 to 6 to represent the positions from left to right.

Let's start by identifying the nationalities:
1. The French is on the far left or far right (1 or 6), and not to the left of the person drinking milk (2, 3, 4, or 5). So, the French can only be in position 1 or 6.
2. The Russian is in an even position (2, 4, or 6), and not the owner of the rabbit (6). So, the Russian can only be in position 2, 4, or 5.
3. The Italian is not the owner of the rabbit (6), and is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit (not in position 6). So, the Italian can be in position 1, 3, or 5.
4. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the bartender (3, 4, or 5), and the owner of the hamster (3). So, the Indonesian can be in position 4 or 5.
5. The Malaysian is not to the right of the nurse (6), and has the same parity positions as the person drinking iced-tea (2, 4, or 6). So, the Malaysian can be in position 2, 4, or 6.

Now let's identify the jobs:
1. The bartender is the owner of the hamster (3).
2. The firefighter and the Indonesian have the same parity positions (4 or 5), and the firefighter is not to the right of the owner of the ferret (not 6). So, the firefighter can be in position 2, 4, or 5.
3. The manager is not to the left of the owner of the ferret (not 1, 2, or 3), and the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the manager (1, 2, or 3). So, the manager can be in position 4, 5, or 6, and the person drinking cola can be in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. The nurse is not to the right of the owner of the lizard (6), and the malaysian is not to the right of the nurse (6). So, the nurse can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and the malaysian can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.
5. The project-manager is somewhere to the left of the malaysian (1, 2, or 3), and on the left of the nurse (1, 2, 4, or 5). So, the project-manager can be in position 1, 2, or 4, and the nurse can be in position 3, 5, or 6.
6. The architect is not to the right of the russian (not 2, 3, 4, or 5), so the architect can be in position 1 or 6.

Now let's identify the pets:
1. The owner of the hamster is the bartender (3).
2. The owner of the ferret is not to the right of the manager (not 4, 5, or 6), and the firefighter and the Indonesian have the same parity positions (4 or 5). So, the owner of the ferret can be in position 2, 4, or 5.
3. The owner of the lizard is not to the right of the nurse (not 5 or 6), so the owner of the lizard can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
4. The owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the French (not 2, 3, 4, or 5), so the owner of the goldfish can be in position 1 or 6.

Now let's identify the beverages:
1. The person drinking milk is not to the left of the French (not 2, 3, or 4), and is not to the left of the French (not 1, 2, or 3). So, the person drinking milk can be in position 4, 5, or 6.
2. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the manager (1, 2, or 3), and is not to the right of the owner of the ferret (not 4, 5, or 6). So, the person drinking cola can be in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up (not 1, 2, or 3), and the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the firefighter (not 1, 2, or 3). So, the person drinking hot-chocolate can be in position 4, 5, or 6, and the person drinking milk can be in position 2, 4, or 5, and the person drinking cola can be in position 1.
4. The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the owner of the rat (not 4, 5, or 6), and the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up (not 1, 2, or 3). So, the person drinking 7up can be in position 1.

Lv9-4x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 14, the owner of the lizard is in an even position. Since there are 6 people, the lizard owner can be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the lizard owner is in position 4 (we'll see why later).

2. From rule 1, the owner of the rabbit is to the right of the owner of the cat. So, the cat owner is in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume the cat owner is in position 1 (we'll see why later).

3. From rule 8, the owner of the cat is to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the skydiving hobby must be in position 5 or 6.

4. From rule 10 and 11, the owner of the lizard and the fisherman, and the owner of the lizard and the musician have the same parity positions. Since the lizard owner is in an even position (4), the fisherman and the musician must be in odd positions (1, 3, or 5).

5. From rule 20, the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position. Since the lizard owner is in an even position (4), the puzzles hobby must be in position 2 or 6. But from rule 27, the videographer is the owner of the mouse, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position. So, the puzzles hobby must be in position 2.

6. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is chess is the videographer. So, the chess hobby is in position 5 (since the videographer is the owner of the mouse).

7. From rule 24, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the musician. Since the musician is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), the chinchilla owner can be in position 2, 4, or 6. But from rule 25, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard owner is in position 4, the chinchilla owner can't be in position 6. So, the chinchilla owner is in position 2.

8. From rule 28, the person driving the bike is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the accountant. Since the chinchilla owner is in position 2 and the accountant can't be in position 1 (because the cat owner is there), the bike driver is in position 3.

9. From rule 26, the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the fisherman is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), the car driver can't be in position 1 (because the cat owner is there). So, the car driver is in position 5.

So, the musician is in position 6.

18. From rule 24, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard is in position 3, the chinchilla owner is in position 2.

19. From rule 26, the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the car driver is in position 5, the fishing hobby is in position 4.
