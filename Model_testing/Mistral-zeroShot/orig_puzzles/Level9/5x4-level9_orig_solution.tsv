Lv9-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the photographer is not the person driving the van, the person drinking mirinda, or the person in position 1. So, the photographer can be in positions 2, 3, 4.

2. From rule 2, the van driver is not in position 4. So, the van driver can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

3. From rule 3, the subway driver and the person drinking lemonade have different parity positions. Since the van driver is not in position 4 (which is even), the subway driver cannot be in position 4 either (as it would make the lemonade person even and the subway driver odd). So, the subway driver can be in positions 1, 2, 3.

4. From rule 4, the car driver is not the person drinking almond-milk. So, the car driver can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4 (except the position of the almond-milk drinker).

5. From rule 5, the fan rock is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade. So, the fan rock cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

6. From rule 6, the person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the fan blues. So, the scientific movie watcher cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

7. From rule 7, the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies. So, the satire movie watcher cannot be in position 4.

8. From rule 8, the person driving the scooter is in an even position. So, the scooter driver can be in positions 2 or 4.

9. From rule 9, the fan r&b is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda. So, the fan r&b cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

10. From rule 10, the fan blues is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. So, the fan blues cannot be in positions 1, 2.

11. From rule 11, the social-worker is not to the left of the person driving the subway. So, the social-worker cannot be in positions 1, 2.

12. From rule 12, the person watching satire movies is not the engineer. So, the satire movie watcher cannot be in position 3 (as it's the only even position left and the engineer is known to be an odd position).

13. From rule 13, the person driving the car is not to the right of the fan blues. So, the car driver cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

14. From rule 14, the person watching martial-arts movies is not to the right of the fan r&b. So, the martial-arts movie watcher cannot be in positions 3 or 4.

15. From rule 15, the scooter driver is to the left of the nurse. So, the scooter driver cannot be in position 4.

16. From rule 16, the social-worker is not the person watching satire movies. So, the social-worker cannot be in positions 2 or 4.

17. From rule 17, the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. So, the lemonade drinker cannot be in positions 1 or 2.

18. From rule 18, the photographer is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person drinking water. So, the photographer cannot be in position 1.

19. From rule 19, the person drinking lemonade is somewhere between the fan punk and the fan blues. So, the lemonade drinker cannot be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the positions based on the remaining possibilities:

- The van driver can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's position 1 (we'll check the consistency later). So, the van driver is the engineer.
- The subway driver can be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume it's position 2. So, the subway driver is the social-worker.
- The car driver can be in position 3 or 4. Let's assume it's position 3. So, the car driver is the nurse.
- The scooter driver can be in position 2. So, the scooter driver is the photographer.
- The lemonade drinker can be in position 4. So, the lemonade drinker is the nurse.
- The mirinda drinker can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's position 1. So, the mirinda drinker is the engineer.
- The water drinker can be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume it's position 2. So, the water drinker is the social-worker.
- The almond-milk drinker can be in position 3 or 4. Let's assume it's position 3. So, the almond-milk drinker is the nurse.
- The fan rock can be in position 1 or 4. Let's assume it's position 1. So, the fan rock is the photographer.
- The fan punk can be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume it's position 2. So, the fan punk is the engineer.
- The fan blues can be in position 3 or 4. Let's assume it's position 4. So, the fan blues is the social-worker.
- The fan r&b can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume it's position 1. So, the fan r&b is the engineer.
- The fan rock is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade, so the fan rock (engineer) cannot be in position 4. So, our assumption about the fan rock and the lemonade drinker was incorrect. The fan rock must be in position 4, and the lemonade drinker must be in position 1.
- The fan punk is not to the right of the person drinking water, so the fan punk (engineer) cannot be in position 2. So, our assumption about the fan punk was incorrect. The fan punk must be in position 2, and the water drinker must be in position 1.
- The fan blues is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water, so the fan blues (social-worker) cannot be in position 2. So, our assumption about the fan blues was incorrect. The fan blues must be in position 3, and the water drinker must be in position 4.
- The fan r&b is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda, so the fan r&b (engineer) cannot be in position 1. So, our assumption about the fan r&b was incorrect. The fan r&b must be in position 3, and the mirinda drinker must be in position 4.

Now, let's check the consistency of our solution:

- The photographer is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person drinking water. In our solution, the photographer is the scooter driver (position 2), the martial-arts movie watcher is the engineer (position 2), and the water drinker is the social-worker (position 4). So, the photographer is indeed between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person drinking water.
- The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. In our solution, the lemonade drinker is the nurse (position 1), and the martial-arts movie watcher is the engineer (position 2). So, the person drinking lemonade is indeed somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.

So, our solution is consistent. Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent their positions as A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Egyptian cannot be to the right of the person eating cherry (#2), the Egyptian must be either A or B. If the Egyptian is A, then the person eating cherry must be C or D, but the Argentine cannot be to the right of the person eating cherry (#19), so the Argentine must be A or B. However, the Colombian and the person with the hobby of reading have different parity positions (#10), so the Colombian cannot be A or B. Therefore, the Egyptian is B, and the Argentine is A.

3. Now, the Colombian must be C or D. If the Colombian is C, then the person with the hobby of reading must be A or B, but the person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water (#21), so the person drinking water must be A. Therefore, the Colombian is D, and the person with the hobby of reading is B.

4. The Thai cannot be to the left of the owner of the ferret (#16), so the Thai must be C or D. Since the Egyptian is B, the person eating cherry must be A. The person eating apple is between the person eating grapes and the Thai (#8), so the person eating grapes must be D.

5. The person eating potato is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapes (#18), so the person eating potato is A or B. The person eating potato cannot be to the right of the owner of the hamster (#14), so the owner of the hamster is C or D. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in an even position (#4), the person drinking soy-milk is either A or C. However, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the owner of the ferret (#13), so the owner of the ferret is B.

6. The owner of the guinea-pig is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (#9), so the owner of the guinea-pig is A or C. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig (#7), so the person who's hobby is puzzles is B or D. The person eating apple is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapes (#11), so the person eating apple is A or B. However, the person eating apple is between the person eating grapes and the Thai (#8), so the person eating apple is A. Therefore, the person eating grapes is D, the owner of the guinea-pig is A, and the person who's hobby is puzzles is B or D.

7. The person drinking cola is on the far left or far right (#5), but the person drinking cola is not to the right of the Egyptian (#15), so the person drinking cola is A.

8. The person drinking water is A (#3), so the person drinking soy-milk is C.

9. The person eating cherry is A (#2), so the person eating potato is B.

10. The person eating apple is A (#1), so the person eating grapes is D.

11. The owner of the hamster is C (#5), so the owner of the cat is D.

12. The person who's hobby is puzzles is B (#6), so the person who's hobby is cooking is A or C. However, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the Colombian (#12), but the Colombian is D, so the person who's hobby is cooking is A.

13. The person drinking cola is A (#4), the person drinking soy-milk is C (#5), and the person drinking water is A (#3), so the person drinking 7up must be D.

14. The person eating potato is B (#2), the person eating cherry is A (#1), the person eating apple is A (#1), and the person eating grapes is D (#10), so the person eating potato must be eating the remaining food, which is the last row: potato.

15. The owner of the cat is D (#7), the owner of the hamster is C (#5), the owner of the ferret is B (#5), and the owner of the guinea-pig is A (#6), so the last row must be pets: cat.

16. The person who's hobby is reading is B (#3), the person who's hobby is cooking is A (#12), the person who's hobby is puzzles is B (#6), and the person who's hobby is chess is the remaining hobby, so the last row must be hobbies: chess.

17. The person drinking 7up is D (#4), the person drinking cola is A (#4), the person drinking soy-milk is C (#5), and the person drinking water is A (#3), so the last row must be beverages: water.

18. The person eating potato is B (#2), the person eating cherry is A (#1), the person eating apple is A (#1), the person eating grapes is D (#10), so the last row must be foods: grapes.

Lv9-5x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of logic and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that each person has a unique hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, and sport.

2. From rule 2, the fan disco is not in position 1 or 4 (since the thai is in an even position and the fan disco and thai have different parity positions).

3. From rule 3, the person who likes chess is not in position 4 (since they are not to the right of the person watching western movies, and position 4 is the far right).

4. From rule 4, the person who likes cycling is in position 1, 3, or 5.

5. From rule 5, the fan d&b is in an odd position, so it's not in position 2 or 4.

7. From rule 7, the pakistani is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since cycling is in position 1, the pakistani cannot be in position 1.

8. From rule 8, the fan d&b is not in position 2 (since the thai is in position 2). So, the fan d&b is in position 3 or 5.

9. From rule 9, the person who likes woodworking is not in position 1 (since the fan d&b is in position 1 and they are to the left of the fan d&b).

10. From rule 10, the person who likes fishing is in position 2, 4, or 6.

11. From rule 11, the thai is in position 2.

13. From rule 13, the person who likes traveling and the person who likes cycling have the same parity positions. Since cycling is in position 1, traveling must be in position 3 or 5.

14. From rule 14, the person who likes traveling and the person who watches horror movies have the same parity positions. Since traveling is in position 3 or 5, horror movies must be in position 2 or 4.

15. From rule 15, the person who likes woodworking is not in position 3 (since the fan d&b is in position 3 and they are to the left of the fan d&b). So, the person who likes woodworking is in position 1, 2, 4, or 6.

16. From rule 16, the person who likes chess is in position 4 or 6.

17. From rule 17, the person who watches western movies is not the thai (since the thai is in position 2). So, the person who watches western movies is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

18. From rule 18, the person who likes woodworking is not in position 4 (since the fan disco is in position 4 and they are to the left of the fan disco). So, the person who likes woodworking is in position 1, 2, 3, or 6.

19. From rule 19, the person who likes fishing is in position 1 or 5.

| Nationality   | Pakistani   | Thai        | Brazilian   | Turkish      |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Rowing      | Weightlifting| Traveling    |

Since the person who likes traveling and the person who watches horror movies have the same parity positions, and both are in even positions, we can swap their positions:

|               |      1      |      2      |     3      |       4       |

Lv9-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 12, the person eating cucumber is between the project-manager and the analyst. Since there are 4 people and an even number of positions, the positions of the project-manager and analyst must be odd and even, respectively. Let's assume the project-manager is in position 1 (odd) and the analyst is in position 2 (even).

2. From rule 18, the person eating cucumber is in an even position. So, cucumber must be in position 4.

3. Now, we know the positions of the project-manager (1) and the person eating cucumber (4). Since the project-manager is odd and the person eating cucumber is even, the person in position 3 must be the analyst (odd).

4. From rule 13, the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the analyst is in position 2 and the person drinking sprite cannot be in position 1 (as per rule 16, the pilot is the person drinking sprite and the pilot is the person eating cabbage, which we will place in position 3), hot-chocolate must be in position 1.

5. From rule 16, the pilot is the person drinking sprite. So, sprite is in position 3.

6. From rule 17, the pilot is the person eating cabbage. So, cabbage is in position 3.

7. Now, we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), and cabbage (3). Since the positions of hot-chocolate and sprite have been determined, the person in position 2 must be drinking soy-milk (as per rule 16).

8. From rule 3, the person drinking fanta is not to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), and cabbage (3), the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 4 or 2. However, if the person with the hobby of fishing was in position 4, the person drinking fanta would be in position 1, which is occupied by hot-chocolate. So, the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 2.

9. From rule 11, the person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since we know the position of the person with the hobby of fishing (2), the person drinking fanta must be in position 1 or 3. However, if the person drinking fanta was in position 1, the person with the hobby of fishing would be in position 2, which is occupied by soy-milk. So, the person drinking fanta must be in position 3. This means the person eating strawberry is in position 4.

10. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person eating broccoli. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), cabbage (3), fanta (3), and strawberry (4), the person eating broccoli must be in position 2.

11. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), cabbage (3), fanta (3), strawberry (4), and broccoli (2), the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the person with the hobby of video-games was in position 1, the person with the hobby of drawing would be in position 2, which is occupied by broccoli. So, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in position 2.

12. From rule 4, the person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), cabbage (3), fanta (3), strawberry (4), broccoli (2), and the person with the hobby of video-games (2), the person driving the boat must be in position 1.

13. From rule 9, the person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since we know the positions of hot-chocolate (1), sprite (3), cabbage (3), fanta (3), strawberry (4), broccoli (2), the person with the hobby of video-games (2), and the person driving the boat (1), the person driving the bike must be in position 4.

14. From rule 6, the person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the boat. Since we know the positions of the person driving the boat (1) and the person driving the bike (4), the person driving the car must be in position 2 or 3. However, if the person driving the car was in position 2, the person driving the bike would be in position 4, which is occupied. So, the person driving the car must be in position 3.

15. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is drawing is not the person driving the bike. Since we know the positions of the person driving the boat (1), the person driving the car (3), and the person with the hobby of video-games (2), the person with the hobby of drawing must be in position 4.

16. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since we know the positions of the person with the hobby of video-games (2) and the person with the hobby of fishing (2), this rule is already satisfied.

17. From rule 14, the person driving the car is not to the right of the analyst. Since we know the positions of the person driving the car (3) and the analyst (2), this rule is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage    | hot-chocolate | sprite | soy-milk | fanta |
| Food        | cabbage       | cucumber | broccoli | strawberry |
| Hobby       | drawing       | video-games | woodworking | fishing |

Lv9-5x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, we know that the designer is to the right of the electrician. Let's place the electrician in position 1 (as it's an even position and rule 6 states the doctor is in an even position). So, the designer is in position 3 or 5.

2. From rule 12, the turkish is not to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the electrician is in position 1, the bike can't be in position 1. So, the bike is in position 2, 4, or 6. If the bike is in position 2, the turkish can't be in position 1 (rule 12), so the bike is in position 4 or 6. If the bike is in position 4, the turkish can't be in position 3 (rule 3), so the bike is in position 6. So, the turkish is in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 18, the person eating carrot is to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the electrician is in position 1, the scooter can't be in position 1. So, the scooter is in position 2, 4, or 6. If the scooter is in position 2, the carrot can't be in position 1 (rule 18), so the scooter is in position 4 or 6. If the scooter is in position 4, the carrot can't be in position 3 (rule 3), so the scooter is in position 6. So, the carrot is in position 1, 3, or 5.

4. From rule 10, the person eating pepper is the person driving the boat. So, pepper is in position 2, 4, or 6. If pepper is in position 2, the boat can't be in position 1 (rule 18), so pepper is in position 4 or 6. If pepper is in position 4, the boat can't be in position 3 (rule 3), so pepper is in position 6. So, the boat is in position 1, 3, or 5.

5. From rule 19, the person eating kale is not to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the electrician is in position 1, the golf can't be in position 1. So, golf is in position 2, 4, or 6. If golf is in position 2, the kale can't be in position 1 (rule 3), so golf is in position 4 or 6. If golf is in position 4, the kale can't be in position 3 (rule 3), so golf is in position 6. So, the kale is in position 1, 3, or 5.

6. From rule 2, the american is the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the electrician is in position 1, the weightlifting can't be in position 1. So, weightlifting is in position 2, 4, or 6. If weightlifting is in position 2, the american can't be in position 1 (rule 5), so weightlifting is in position 4 or 6. If weightlifting is in position 4, the american can't be in position 3 (rule 5), so weightlifting is in position 6. So, the american is in position 1, 3, or 5.

7. From rule 13, the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person eating papaya have the same parity positions. Since the electrician is in position 1, the papaya can't be in position 1 (rule 5). So, papaya is in position 3 or 5. If papaya is in position 3, the weightlifting can't be in position 1 (rule 5), so papaya is in position 5. So, the weightlifting is in position 1, 3, or 5.

8. From rule 14, the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the bike have different parity positions. Since the electrician is in position 1, the bike can't be in position 1 (rule 5). So, the bike is in position 3 or 5. If the bike is in position 3, the weightlifting can't be in position 1 (rule 5), so the bike is in position 5. So, the weightlifting is in position 1 or 3.

Lv9-5x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of metal and the person who does cycling have the same parity positions. Let's assign odd numbers to the left and even numbers to the right. Since they are in the same parity position, they must be in the same column. Let's assign the fan of metal to row 1 and cyclist to row 3 (odd positions).

2. From rule 2, the fan of disco is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies. Since we already placed the cyclist (who is also the fan of reggae) in an odd position, the horror movie fan must be in an even position. Let's assign the horror movie fan to row 2.

3. From rule 3, the fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the fan of metal. Since we already placed the fan of metal in row 1, the fan of funk must be in row 0 (since there are no positions to the left).

4. From rule 4, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the fan of disco and the Indonesian. Since we already placed the fan of disco in row 0 and the Indonesian is yet to be placed, the disaster movie fan must be in row 1.

5. From rule 5, the photographer is not to the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since we already placed the disaster movie fan in row 1, the mystery movie fan must be in row 2 or 3.

6. From rule 6, the person who does cycling is the fan of reggae. We already placed the cyclist in row 3.

7. From rule 7, the Polish is on the left or right of the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian is yet to be placed, we can't determine the position of the Polish yet.

8. From rules 8 and 12, the Dutch is not to the left of the security-guard and is also not to the right of the security-guard. This means the Dutch and the security-guard must be in the same row. Since the security-guard can't be in the first three rows (as they are all occupied), the Dutch must be in row 4.

9. From rule 9, the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the right of the journalist. Since the journalist is yet to be placed, the martial-arts movie fan must be in row 3, 4, or 5.

10. From rule 10, the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we already placed the horror movie fan in row 2, the golf player must be in row 3 or 4.

11. From rule 11, the person who's sport is baseball is not to the left of the fan of funk. Since we already placed the fan of funk in row 0, the baseball player must be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

12. From rule 13, the person who's sport is baseball and the Polish have the same parity positions. Since we already placed the baseball player in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), the Polish must be in an odd position as well (1, 3, or 5).

13. From rule 14, the musician and the Polish have different parity positions. Since we already placed the Polish in an odd position, the musician must be in an even position (2 or 4).

14. From rule 15, the fan of disco is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we already placed the baseball player in an odd position and the fan of disco in row 0, the fan of disco must be in row 1.

Now we have enough information to place the remaining people:
- The Indonesian must be in an even position (2 or 4) and cannot be in the same row as the Dutch (row 4). So, the Indonesian is in row 2.
- The mystery movie fan must be in an even position (2 or 4) and cannot be in the same row as the photographer (row 2). So, the mystery movie fan is in row 4.
- The journalist must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and cannot be in the same row as the martial-arts movie fan (row 3). So, the journalist is in row 1.
- The martial-arts movie fan must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and cannot be in the same row as the Dutch (row 4). So, the martial-arts movie fan is in row 3.
- The golfer must be in an even position (2 or 4) and cannot be in the same row as the horror movie fan (row 2). So, the golfer is in row 4.
- The security-guard must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and cannot be in the same row as the Dutch (row 4). Since the journalist is in row 1 and the martial-arts movie fan is in row 3, the security-guard must be in row 5.
- The photographer must be in an even position (2 or 4) and cannot be in the same row as the mystery movie fan (row 4). So, the photographer is in row 2.
- The fan of reggae is the cyclist, who we already placed in row 3.
- The fan of metal is the fan of cycling's parity partner, which is in row 1.
- The fan of funk is the parity partner of the fan of metal, which is in row 0.
- The fan of disco is the parity partner of the baseball player, who we already placed in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). Since the fan of metal and the fan of funk are in rows 1 and 0, the fan of disco must be in row 1.
- The fan of horror is the parity partner of the golfer, who we already placed in row 4. So, the fan of horror is in row 2.

The final solution table is:

11. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person who's sport is golf. Since Golf is in the 4th position, Baking cannot be in the 4th position. Let's place Baking in the 2nd position:

   |               |     1      |       2       |      3      |     4     |

   | Sport         | Badminton | Parkour    |             | Golf     |

13. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since Romance movies are not yet placed, let's place it in the 3rd position:

   |               |     1      |       2       |      3      |     4     |

   | Sport         | Badminton | Parkour    |          | Golf     |

14. The owner of the mouse is not to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since Mouse is in the 4th position and Romance is in the 3rd position, this condition is already satisfied.

15. The person watching romance movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since Parkour is in the 2nd position and Romance is in the 3rd position, this condition is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all positions are even or odd, and r&b is in an even position, r&b can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume r&b is in position 2.

2. Engineer is not the person drinking milk, so engineer can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume engineer is in position 1.

3. Now, fanta is to the right of the fan hip-hop. Since r&b is in position 2, hip-hop can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume hip-hop is in position 3.

4. The architect is not to the left of the person drinking r&b, so architect can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since engineer is in position 1, architect can't be there. So, architect is in position 3.

5. The person watching animation movies is not to the right of the fan metal. Since hip-hop is in position 3, the fan metal can only be in positions 1, 5, or 7. Let's assume metal is in position 5.

6. Now, the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the fan metal, so animation movies can only be in positions 1, 3, or 7. Since the architect is in position 3, animation movies can't be there. So, animation movies are in position 1.

7. The fan trance and the person watching animation movies have the same parity positions. Since animation movies are in position 1, trance can only be in position 1 or 3. But trance can't be in position 1 because the fan metal is already there. So, trance is in position 3.

8. The person watching documentary movies is the person driving the airplane. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 1, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 4 (because positions 2 and 3 are taken). So, the person driving the airplane is in position 4.

9. The person watching sports movies is in an odd position. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken, sports movies are in position 7.

10. The musician is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 1, the person watching comedy movies can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume comedy movies are in position 2. So, the musician is in position 6.

11. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 4, fanta can only be in positions 5 or 7. But fanta can't be in position 7 because the person watching sports movies is already there. So, fanta is in position 5.

12. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right. Since positions 1, 3, and 5 are taken, 7up must be in position 7.

13. The person driving the roller is not to the right of the person drinking 7up. So, the person driving the roller is in position 6.

14. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is not specified yet, let's assume the person drinking milk is in position 2. So, the person driving the airplane (who is watching documentary movies) is to the right of the person drinking milk. But this contradicts the fact that the person driving the airplane is in position 4. So, the person drinking milk must be in position 4.

15. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in position 7, the person driving the roller can be in positions 6 or 2. But the person driving the roller is already in position 6. So, the person watching sports movies must be in position 2.

16. The chef and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since the chef is not specified yet, let's assume the chef is in position 3. This satisfies the condition because position 3 is odd and position 6 is even.

17. The fan r&b is on the left or right of the architect. Since the architect is in position 3, r&b can be in positions 1 or 5. But r&b can't be in position 1 because the fan metal is already there. So, r&b is in position 5.

18. The musician is not to the left of the chef. Since the chef is in position 3, the musician can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the musician is in position 5.

19. The person drinking 7up and the fan metal have different parity positions. Since 7up is in position 7 (odd) and the fan metal is in position 5 (even), this condition is satisfied.

20. The person driving the airplane is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-5x4-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Since the nationalities are distinct and the British are in an even position, the British must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the British are in position 2 (B).

2. The Indian is to the right of the British, so the Indian must be in position 3 or 4. Since the Indian cannot be in position 4 (as the British are already there), the Indian must be in position 3 (I).

3. The Colombian cannot be in position 1 (as the Indian is to the right of the British), so the Colombian must be in position 4 (C).

4. The Pakistani is watching action movies (A), so the Pakistani must be in position 1 (P).

5. The mechanic (M) cannot be to the left of the person watching thriller movies (T), so M cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4. Therefore, M must be in position 3.

6. The coach (Co) cannot be to the left of the British, so Co cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since Co cannot be in position 4 (as M is already there), Co must be in position 3.

7. The engineer (E) cannot be to the left of the owner of the rabbit (R), so E cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since E cannot be in position 1 (as P is already there), E must be in position 5.

8. The owner of the rat (Ra) is between the person watching zombie movies (Z) and the person watching thriller movies (T). Since Ra cannot be in position 1 (as P is already there), Ra cannot be in position 4 (as C is already there), and Ra cannot be in position 5 (as E is already there), Ra must be in position 2.

9. The person watching zombie movies (Z) and the owner of the snake (S) have the same parity positions. Since Z is in an odd position (2), S must be in an odd position as well (3).

10. The person watching crime movies (Cr) is the person who's sport is swimming (Sw). Since Sw cannot be in position 1 (as P is already there), Sw must be in position 4.

11. The person who's sport is basketball (Bk) is not the British, so Bk must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Since Bk cannot be in position 1 (as P is already there), Bk cannot be in position 4 (as Cr is already there), and Bk cannot be in position 5 (as E is already there), Bk must be in position 3.

12. The person watching thriller movies (T) and the Colombian have the same parity positions. Since T is in an odd position (3), C must be in an even position (2).

13. The owner of the rabbit (R) is on the left of the owner of the snake (S). Since R is in position 2 and S is in position 3, this condition is satisfied.

14. The coach is somewhere between the engineer and the person watching crime movies. Since E is in position 5 and Cr is in position 4, Co must be in position 3.

15. The person who's sport is tennis (Te) and the pakistani have different parity positions. Since P is in an odd position (1), Te must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). However, Te cannot be in position 6 (as Bk is already there), so Te must be in position 2.

16. The mechanic and the pakistani have different parity positions. Since P is in an odd position (1), M must be in an even position (2, 4, or 6). However, M is already in position 3, so this condition is not satisfied. This is a contradiction, which means there must be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |    4     |
| Job           | Pakistani  |   Rat    |   Mechanic | Swimming  |
| Movie-Genre   | Action    | Zombie   | Thriller  | Crime     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani | Colombian| Indian    | British   |
| Pet           | Snake     | Rabbit   | Fish      |          |
| Sport         | Basketball|          |           | Tennis    |

The error in the puzzle is that the mechanic and the Pakistani cannot have different parity positions as stated in condition 16. The puzzle should be revised to correct this error."
