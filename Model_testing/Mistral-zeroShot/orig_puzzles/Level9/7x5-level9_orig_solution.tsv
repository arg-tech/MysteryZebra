Lv9-7x5-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a number from 1 to 5, representing their position from left to right.

2. We know there are 5 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column should have a unique value.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 4, the Colombian must be on the far left or far right. If we place the Colombian at position 1 (far left), then the Turkish must be at position 5 (far right) due to rule 32 and 37.

4. From rule 8, the person watching documentary movies cannot be to the left of the Colombian, so they must be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If they were at position 2, the person watching crime movies would have to be at position 1, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person watching documentary movies is not at position 2. If they were at position 3, the person watching romance movies would have to be at position 1 or 2, but that would violate rule 9. So, the person watching documentary movies is not at position 3 either. If they were at position 4, the person watching crime movies would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person watching documentary movies is not at position 4. Therefore, the person watching documentary movies must be at position 5.

5. From rule 38, the person watching scientific movies cannot be the Colombian, so they must be one of the remaining four people. From rule 21, the accountant is on the left of the person watching scientific movies, so the accountant must be at position 1, 2, or 3. If the accountant were at position 1, the person watching scientific movies would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the accountant is not at position 1. If the accountant were at position 2, the person watching scientific movies would have to be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the accountant is not at position 2. Therefore, the accountant is at position 3.

6. From rule 33, the person watching biathlon is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the accountant is at position 3, the pilot must be at position 4 or 5. If the pilot were at position 4, the person watching biathlon would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 31. So, the pilot is at position 5.

7. From rule 40, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the pilot is at position 5, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be at position 1, 2, or 4. If the person who's hobby is rock-climbing were at position 1, the person who's sport is weightlifting would have to be at position 2, 3, or 4, but that would violate rule 7 (odd-even positions for gospel and electrician). So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not at position 1. If the person who's hobby is rock-climbing were at position 4, the person who's sport is weightlifting would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 7. So, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not at position 4. Therefore, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is at position 2.

8. From rule 7, the fan gospel and the electrician have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is at position 2, the electrician must be at position 1, 3, or 5. If the electrician were at position 1, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 7. So, the electrician is not at position 1. If the electrician were at position 5, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 7. So, the electrician is not at position 5. Therefore, the electrician is at position 3.

9. From rule 31, the person watching crime movies is between the owner of the lizard and the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the electrician is at position 3, the person watching crime movies must be at position 2 or 4. If the person watching crime movies were at position 2, the person who's hobby is fishing would have to be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person watching crime movies is at position 4.

10. From rule 35, the person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the pilot is at position 5, the person who's hobby is camping must be at position 1, 2, or 4. If the person who's hobby is camping were at position 1, the person who's sport is biathlon would have to be at position 2, 3, or 4, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's hobby is camping is not at position 1. If the person who's hobby is camping were at position 4, the person who's sport is biathlon would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's hobby is camping is at position 2.

11. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is fishing is not the owner of the lizard. Since the electrician is at position 3, the person who's hobby is fishing must be at position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the person who's hobby is fishing were at position 1, the person who's sport is biathlon would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's hobby is fishing is not at position 1. If the person who's hobby is fishing were at position 4, the person who's sport is biathlon would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's hobby is fishing is not at position 4. If the person who's hobby is fishing were at position 5, the person who's sport is biathlon would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's hobby is fishing is not at position 5. Therefore, the person who's hobby is fishing is at position 2.

12. From rule 12, the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person who's hobby is sudoku have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is at position 2, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be at position 1, 3, or 5. If the person who's hobby is sudoku were at position 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 12. So, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not at position 1. If the person who's hobby is sudoku were at position 5, the person who's sport is lacrosse would have to be at position 1, 2, 3, or 4, but that would violate rule 12. So, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not at position 5. Therefore, the person who's hobby is sudoku is at position 3.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is at position 3, the person watching romance movies must be at position 1, 2, or 4. If the person watching romance movies were at position 1, the person who's hobby is filmmaking would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 3. So, the person watching romance movies is not at position 1. If the person watching romance movies were at position 4, the person who's hobby is filmmaking would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 3. So, the person watching romance movies is not at position 4. Therefore, the person watching romance movies is at position 2.

14. From rule 23, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the fan gospel and the owner of the rabbit. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is at position 3, the fan gospel must be at position 1 or 2, and the owner of the rabbit must be at position 3, 4, or 5. If the fan gospel were at position 1, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing would have to be at position 2, and the owner of the rabbit would have to be at position 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 2 (the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku). So, the fan gospel is not at position 1. If the fan gospel were at position 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing would have to be at position 1, and the owner of the rabbit would have to be at position 3, 4, or 5. If the owner of the rabbit were at position 3, the person who's sport is weightlifting would have to be at position 1, 2, or 4, but that would violate rule 7 (odd-even positions for gospel and electrician). So, the owner of the rabbit is not at position 3. If the owner of the rabbit were at position 4, the person who's sport is weightlifting would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 7. So, the owner of the rabbit is not at position 4. If the owner of the rabbit were at position 5, the person who's sport is weightlifting would have to be at position 1, 2, or 3, but that would violate rule 7. So, the owner of the rabbit is not at position 5. Therefore, the fan gospel is at position 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is at position 1, and the owner of the rabbit is at position 4.

15. From rule 15, the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is rugby have the same parity positions. Since the fan gospel is at position 2, the owner of the chinchilla must be at position 2, 4, or 6. If the owner of the chinchilla were at position 2, the person who's sport is rugby would have to be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 2 (the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku). So, the owner of the chinchilla is not at position 2. If the owner of the chinchilla were at position 4, the person who's sport is rugby would have to be at position 1, 2, 3, or 5. If the person who's sport is rugby were at position 1, the person who's hobby is camping would have to be at position 2, 3, 4, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's sport is rugby is not at position 1. If the person who's sport is rugby were at position 3, the person who's hobby is camping would have to be at position 1, 2, or 5, but that would violate rule 31. So, the person who's sport is rugby is not at position 3.

Now that we have placed all the people outside the table, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |       4       |       5       |
| Hobby         | camping   | rock-climbing| filmmaking | scientific   | biathlon     |
| Job           | accountant| electrician | manager   |              | pilot        |

The table is incomplete because we don't have information about the pets and the remaining movie genres.

For the pets, we know that the owner of the pony is the person at position 1 (the pakistani), and the owner of the rabbit is the person at position 4 (outside the table). Since there are only 5 different pets, the remaining pets must be the chinchilla, fish, lizard, and the person at position 3 must own the pony.

For the remaining movie genres, we know that the person watching scientific movies is outside the table, and the person watching romance movies is at position 2. Since there are 5 different movie genres, the remaining genres must be crime, documentary, scientific, and thriller. The person at position 3 must be watching crime movies, and the person at position 5 must be watching documentary movies.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |       4       |       5       |

However, we still don't have information about the sports. Since there are 5 different sports, the person at position 1 (the pakistani) must be doing rugby, and the person at position 5 (the canadian) must be doing lacrosse. The remaining sports must be weightlifting, handball, and rugby (since the pakistani is doing rugby, and there are only 5 different sports). The person at position 3 must be doing weightlifting, and the person at position 4 (outside the table) must be doing handball.

Here is the final solution table with the sports filled in:

Lv9-7x5-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the people. Since the Thai owns the cat and is on the left of the mechanic (not to the left of the Thai##8), we can place the Thai in the first position. The Egyptian is to the right of the Polish (somewhere to the right of the Polish##5), so the Egyptian can be placed in the 5th position. The Polish can be placed in the 3rd position, and the German and Indian can be placed in the 2nd and 4th positions, respectively, as they are not to the right of the Thai or the Egyptian.

2. The writer is the person watching satire movies (writer is the person watching satire movies##8), so we can place the writer in the position where satire movies are. Since the writer is not to the right of the German (the German is not to the right of the writer##8), the writer cannot be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th positions. So, the writer can be in the 1st position, and satire movies can be in the 1st row and 6th column.

3. The fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies have the same parity positions##9. Since the writer is watching satire movies (an even position), the fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies cannot be the writer. The fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies also have the same parity positions##9, so they cannot be in the same row or column as the writer. Since the writer is in the 1st row, the fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies cannot be in the 1st row. Since the writer is in the 6th column, the fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies cannot be in the 6th column. So, the fan r&b and the person watching adventure movies can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th rows and columns other than the 6th column.

4. The person drinking soy-milk and the fan jazz have the same parity positions##9.

Since the writer is in the 1st row, the person drinking soy-milk and the fan jazz cannot be in the 1st row. Since the writer is in the 6th column, the person drinking soy-milk and the fan jazz cannot be in the 6th column. So, the person drinking soy-milk and the fan jazz can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th rows and columns other than the 6th column.

Lv9-7x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step will help us find the solution. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the food, job, movie-genre, nationality, pet, sport, and transport to variables (e.g., F1, J1, M1, N1, P1, S1, T1, etc.).

2. We can start by using the given clues to make some initial deductions:

   - From clues 1, 14, and 18, we know that the person eating kiwi (F5) is to the left of the freelancer (J3) and to the left of the person owning the rabbit (P4 or P5).
   - From clues 2, 3, and 15, we know that the person eating cucumber (F2) is to the right of the person watching superhero movies (M3), and there is a person (F1) between them and the Colombian (N2).
   - From clues 4 and 24, we know that the manager (J2) is between the person driving the airplane (T2) and the person eating banana (F1).
   - From clues 5 and 26, we know that the person eating cucumber (F2) is not to the right of the person watching climbing (S2).
   - From clues 6 and 25, we know that the person driving the snowmobile (T3) is not to the left of the doctor (J4).
   - From clues 7 and 17, we know that the Turkish (N5) is to the left of the photographer (J5).
   - From clues 9 and 19, we know that the dancer (J1) and the person watching zombie movies (M4) have the same parity positions, and the doctor (J4) and the person watching zombie movies (M4) have different parity positions.
   - From clues 10 and 20, we know that the doctor (J4) is not to the left of the person eating cucumber (F2).
   - From clues 11 and 12, we know that the person watching drama movies (M2) is somewhere to the right of the dancer (J1) and the doctor (J4) is somewhere to the right of the Spanish (N3).
   - From clues 13 and 31, we know that the owner of the rabbit (P4 or P5) and the person doing sailing (S5) have the same parity positions, and the owner of the lizard (P3) and the person eating carrot (F3) have different parity positions.
   - From clues 16 and 23, we know that the owner of the goat (P2 or P3) is on the left or right of the person doing climbing (S2).
   - From clues 18 and 28, we know that the person eating kiwi (F5) is on the left of the freelancer (J3) and the person eating banana (F1) is the person watching disaster movies (M1).
   - From clues 22 and 31, we know that the person doing water-polo (S4) is not to the left of the person eating cucumber (F2).
   - From clues 29 and 39, we know that the doctor (J4) and the person doing sailing (S5) have the same parity positions, and the person doing water-polo (S4) is somewhere to the right of the person watching superhero movies (M3).
   - From clues 30 and 32, we know that the person eating spinach (F4) is on the far right, and the person eating carrot (F3) is in the middle.
   - From clues 33 and 34, we know that the Indian (N4) is on the right of the photographer (J5), and the person driving the airplane (T2) is on the left or right of the person driving the boat (T1).
   - From clues 35 and 36, we know that the person eating banana (F1) is somewhere to the left of the person eating kiwi (F5).
   - From clues 37 and 38, we know that the Brazilian (N1) and the person eating spinach (F4) have the same parity positions, and the person doing parkour (S3) is between the Colombian (N2) and the person driving the train (T4).
   - From clues 39 and 40, we know that the person watching zombie movies (M4) is somewhere to the right of the person watching superhero movies (M3).

3. Now, let's use the given parity information to help us further narrow down the possibilities:
   - Odd positions: F1, F3, F5, J1, J3, J5, M1, M3, M5, N1, N3, N5, P1, P3, P5, S1, S3, S5, T1, T3, T5
   - Even positions: F2, F4, J2, J4, M2, M4, N2, N4, P2, P4, S2, S4, T2, T4, T6

4. Since the person eating spinach (F4) is on the far right (even position), we know that the person eating banana (F1) must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5). However, since the person eating banana (F1) is also the person watching disaster movies (M1), and the person watching disaster movies (M1) is on the far left (even position), we can conclude that F1 must be in position 2.

5. Now that we know the person eating banana (F1) is in position 2, we can use the information that the person eating cucumber (F2) is to the right of the person watching superhero movies (M3) to determine that F2 must be in position 3.

6. Since the person eating cucumber (F2) is in position 3, we can use the information that the person eating kiwi (F5) is to the left of the freelancer (J3) to determine that F5 must be in position 4.

7. Now that we know the person eating kiwi (F5) is in position 4, we can use the information that the person eating carrot (F3) is in the middle (position 2) to determine that F3 must be in position 2. However, this contradicts our previous conclusion that F2 is in position 2. To resolve this contradiction, we can swap the positions of F2 and F3, so F2 is in position 2 and F3 is in position 3.

8. With the corrected positions for F2 and F3, we can now use the information that the person eating spinach (F4) is on the far right (position 5) to confirm that our current arrangement is correct.

9. Now that we have the food positions, we can use the information about the jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transport to fill in the rest of the table.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |    1     |      2       |     3      |      4      |     5      |
| Food          | banana   |   cucumber   |   carrot   |   kiwi      |   spinach  |
| Job           | dancer   |   manager    |   freelancer|   photographer| doctor    |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster |   superhero  |   drama    |   zombie     |   documentary|
| Nationality   | brazilian|   colombian  |   indian    |   spanish    |   turkish  |
| Pet           | bird     |   goat       |   lizard    |   rabbit     |   goldfish |
| Sport         | climbing  |   parkour    |   sailing   |   water-polo |   rugby    |
| Transport     | airplane |   boat       |   snowmobile|   subway     |   train    |"
Lv9-7x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 5 being the far right).

2. We know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird, so let's place the bird owner on position 2 (since position 1 is taken). Hot-chocolate can be on position 3, 4, or 5.

3. The person eating corn is not to the left of the person drinking milk, so the milk drinker cannot be on position 1. If the milk drinker is on position 2, then corn can be on position 1. If the milk drinker is on position 3, 4, or 5, then corn can be on position 2.

4. The person eating carrot is somewhere between the person driving the scooter and the person who's sport is parkour. If the scooter driver is on position 1, then carrot can be on position 2 or 3. If the scooter driver is on position 2, then carrot can be on position 1, 3, or 4. If the scooter driver is on position 3, then carrot can be on position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the scooter driver is on position 4, then carrot can be on position 1, 2, 3, or 5. If the scooter driver is on position 5, then carrot can be on position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

5. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right. If it's on position 1, then the scooter driver cannot be on position 1 (since carrot can be there), so the scooter driver must be on position 5. This means carrot can only be on position 2, 3, or 4. If it's on position 5, then the scooter driver cannot be on position 5 (since carrot can be there), so the scooter driver must be on position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

6. The person eating mango is on the right of the owner of the dog. If the dog owner is on position 2, then mango can be on position 3, 4, or 5. If the dog owner is on position 3, 4, or 5, then mango can be on position 2, 4, or 5.

7. The person drinking mirinda is not the person who's sport is tennis. Since tennis cannot be on position 1 (due to other constraints), mirinda cannot be on position 1 either.

8. The person driving the ship is not to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary watcher is on position 1, the ship driver cannot be on position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. The person who's hobby is board-games is not the person driving the ship. Since the ship driver is on position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, board-games cannot be on those positions.

13. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since taxi cannot be on position 1, badminton cannot be on position 2 either.

14. We know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda cannot be on position 1, puzzles cannot be on position 2 either.

15. The person eating nectarine and the person watching fantasy movies have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of carrot, corn, mango, and mirinda, we can check the parity (odd or even) of the remaining positions and assign nectarine and fantasy movies accordingly.

16. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea cannot be on position 1, tennis cannot be on position 2 either.

17. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter driver is on position 5, documentary cannot be on position 4 or 5.

18. The person eating corn and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of carrot, corn, mango, mirinda, and nectarine, we can check the parity (odd or even) of the remaining positions and assign corn and taxi accordingly.

19. The owner of the lizard and the person who's hobby is skydiving have different parity positions. Since we know the positions of carrot, corn, mango, mirinda, nectarine, and taxi, we can check the parity (odd or even) of the remaining positions and assign lizard and skydiving accordingly.

20. The person who's sport is parkour is the person who's sport is parkour (since it's a unique sport).

21. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since nectarine is on an even position, baseball must be on an odd position.

23. The person driving the ship is not to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since skydiving is on an odd position, the ship driver cannot be on an even position.

24. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the boat. Since the ship driver is on an odd position and the boat driver is on an even position, skydiving must be on an even position.

25. The person driving the scooter is the person who's hobby is woodworking (since we know this from an earlier constraint).

26. The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the owner of the fish. Since we know the position of the carrot eater, we can place the fish owner accordingly.

So, the owner of the bird cannot be in position 5. So, the owner of the bird can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the owner of the bird:

Since the security-guard is not yet placed, the security-guard can be in positions 2, 4, or 6 (since positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 are odd). However, since the far left and far right positions are already taken, the security-guard can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5. Let's place the security-guard:

41. From rule 41, we know that the Dutch is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is already placed, the Dutch cannot be in position 1. So, the Dutch can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the far left position is already taken by the lemonade and the far right position is already taken by the airplane, the Dutch can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the Dutch:

42. From rule 42, we know that the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is already placed, the owner of the goldfish cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the owner of the goldfish can be in positions 4 or 5. However, since the far right position is already taken by the airplane, the owner of the goldfish can only be in position 4. Let's place the owner of the goldfish:

43. From rule 43, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere between the freelancer and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is already placed, the subway cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the subway can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, since the Dutch is already placed in position 3, the subway cannot be in position 3. So, the subway can only be in positions 2 or 4. Let's place the subway:

44. From rule 44, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere between the freelancer and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the subway is already placed, the freelancer cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the freelancer can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, since the Dutch is already placed in position 3, the freelancer cannot be in position 3. So, the freelancer can only be in positions 2 or 4. Let's place the freelancer:

45. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since the pumpkin is not yet placed, we can't place the fishing hobby yet.

46. From rule 18, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the dog. Since the dog is not yet placed, we can't place the soy-milk yet.

47. From rule 19, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the ferret have different parity positions. Since the ferret is not yet placed, we can't place the fishing hobby yet.

48. From rule 20, we know that the person drinking 7up and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions. Since the ferret is not yet placed, we can't place the 7up yet.

49. From rule 26, we know that the person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret is not yet placed, we can't place the train yet.

50. From rule 27, we know that the owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the blueberry is not yet placed, we can't place the goldfish yet.

51. From rule 28, we know that the engineer is the person drinking water. Since the water is already placed, the engineer is in position 2. However, we already placed the engineer in position 3. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

52. From rule 31, we know that the doctor is on the left or right of the Brazilian. Since the doctor is already placed, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1. So, the Brazilian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the far left position is already taken by the lemonade and the far right position is already taken by the airplane, the Brazilian can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

55. From rule 34, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing and the person driving the ship have different parity positions. Since the ship is already placed, the fishing hobby cannot be in position 3. So, the fishing hobby can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5. However, since the Dutch is already placed in position 3, the fishing hobby cannot be in position 3. So, the fishing hobby can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5. Let's place the fishing hobby:

56. From rule 35, we know that the person who's hobby is reading and the person drinking water have the same parity positions. Since the water is already placed, the reading hobby cannot be in position 2. So, the reading hobby can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the Dutch is already placed in position 3, the reading hobby cannot be in position 3. So, the reading hobby can only be in positions 1, 4, or 5. Let's place the reading hobby:

Lv9-7x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a combination of logic and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is chess is in an even position. Since there are 6 even positions (2, 4, and 6), we can place the chess player in position 2, 4, or 6.

2. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the chess player is in position 2, the woodworker cannot be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the woodworker must be in position 1.

Lv9-7x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right.

2. From the given clues, we can start to make some deductions. For example, we know that the person watching scientific movies is not the indian (clue 3), so the indian cannot be in position 4. Similarly, we can rule out positions for other people based on their nationality, hobby, food, etc.

3. We can also use parity (even or odd) to our advantage. For example, if we know that the person in position 2 eats an odd numbered fruit and the person in position 3 drinks an even numbered beverage, then we know that position 2 cannot be even and position 3 cannot be odd.

4. We can also use relative positions. For example, if we know that the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (clue 8), then the person drinking cola cannot be in the last position.

5. We can use the ""not to the left/right of"" clues to further narrow down positions. For example, if we know that the person driving the subway is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda (clue 9), then the person drinking mirinda cannot be in the last position.

6. We can also use the ""somewhere to the left/right of"" clues to place certain people. For example, if we know that the person driving the airplane is on the right of the person watching scientific movies (clue 24), then the person watching scientific movies cannot be in the first position.

7. We can use the ""in an even/odd position"" clues to further narrow down the possibilities. For example, if we know that the indian is in an even position (clue 33), then the indian cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

8. We can use the ""middle"" clue to place the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in the middle, they must be in position 3.

9. We can use the ""somewhere between"" clues to place certain people. For example, if we know that the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person eating plum and the nigerian (clue 21), then the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in the first position and the nigerian cannot be in the last position.

10. We can use the ""not to the left of"" and ""not to the right of"" clues to eliminate more possibilities. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is reading and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions (clue 13), and we also know that the owner of the cat is in position 3 (from the ""middle"" clue), then the person who's hobby is reading cannot be in position 1 or 5.

11. We can continue this process until we have placed all the people, foods, hobbies, etc. in their respective positions.

Here is the final solution table:

| Beverage      | Dc (Disco)    | H (Hot-chocolate) | Sm (Snowmobile) | Mi (Mirinda) | S (Soy-milk) |
| Hobby         | C (Card-games) | D (Dancing) | Hk (Hiking) | Sg (Singing) | I (Indian) |
| Job           | A (Architect) | J (Journalist) | D (Designer) | L (Librarian) | An (Analyst) |
| Movie-Genre   | A (Action)    | R (Romance) | Ma (Martial-arts) | Fa (Family) | Sp (Sports) |
