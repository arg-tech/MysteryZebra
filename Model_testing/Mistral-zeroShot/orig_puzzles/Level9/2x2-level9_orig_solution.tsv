Lv9-2x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. There are two different types of food: grapes and raspberry. Let's denote G for grapes and R for raspberry.

2. There are two different types of sports: parkour and rowing. Let's denote P for parkour and Rw for rowing (to differentiate it from raspberry).

3. The person who's sport is rowing is in an odd position. This means that the rower cannot be in position 1 (since positions are numbered 1 and 2, and 1 is even). So, the rower must be in position 2.

4. The person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is rowing have the same parity positions. Since the rower is in position 2 (an odd position), the person eating raspberry must be in position 1 (an even position).

5. Now we know the positions of the rower and the raspberry eater. The remaining person must be eating grapes and doing parkour, as there is only one type of each left.

So, the final solution table is:
#############
  |         |     1     |    2    |
  | Food    | Grapes   | Raspberry|
  | Sport   | Parkour  | Rowing  |

Lv9-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two different beverages (7up, milk) and two different foods (asparagus, pineapple).

2. From the first condition, the person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus have the same parity positions (meaning they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions). Since there are only two positions, they must be in the same position.

3. The person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking milk. This means that 7up cannot be in position 1, it must be in position 2.

4. Now we know that the person drinking 7up is in position 2 and eating asparagus, which means the person eating asparagus is also in position 2.

5. Since both 7up and asparagus are in position 2, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.

6. The last food, pineapple, cannot be in the same position as 7up or asparagus, so it must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|            |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage   |  milk    |  7up     |
| Food       | pineapple| asparagus|

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv9-2x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: folk, r&b. Let's assign 'F' for folk and 'R' for r&b.

2. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, ice-hockey. Let's assign 'C' for cycling and 'I' for ice-hockey.

3. The fan of folk and the person who's sport is cycling have different parity positions##9. This means that the number of steps from the folk fan to the cyclist (or cyclist to the folk fan) along the rows or columns is odd. Since they are in different rows and columns, we can consider each row and column separately.

   - If the folk fan is in row 1 and the cyclist is in row 2, the difference in their column positions must be odd. Since there are only 2 columns, the only possible odd difference is 1 column. So, the folk fan is in column 1 and the cyclist is in column 2.
   - If the folk fan is in column 1 and the cyclist is in row 1, the difference in their row positions must be odd. Since there are only 2 rows, this is not possible as the difference between 1 and 1 is even. So, the folk fan cannot be in row 1.
   - If the folk fan is in row 2 and the cyclist is in row 1, the difference in their column positions must be even. But since there are only 2 columns, this is not possible as the difference between 1 and 2 is odd. So, the cyclist cannot be in row 1.
   - Therefore, the only possible arrangement is that the folk fan is in row 2 and the cyclist is in row 1.

4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the cyclist is in row 1 and column 2, the ice-hockey fan must be in row 1 and column 1 or row 2 and column 3 (since there are no other empty cells). But since the folk fan is in row 2, the ice-hockey fan cannot be in row 2 and column 3 because that would mean the folk fan and the ice-hockey fan are in the same column, which is not possible. So, the ice-hockey fan must be in row 1 and column 1.

5. Now we know the folk fan is in row 2 and column 2, the cyclist is in row 1 and column 2, and the ice-hockey fan is in row 1 and column 1. The r&b fan must be in the remaining cell, which is row 2 and column 1.

The final solution table is:

  |               |    1    |     2      |
  | Music-Genre   | R       | F          |
  | Sport         | C       | I          |

So, the final table is:

| Cycling   |       | Ice-Hockey|

Lv9-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two nationalities (Argentine and Mexican) and two sports (Parkour and Swimming). We know that each nationality prefers a different sport, so we can pair them as follows:
   - Argentine: Parkour
   - Mexican: Swimming

2. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we already know their sports, we can place them in the table:
   - Nationality 1 (Argentine): Parkour
   - Nationality 2 (Mexican): Swimming
   - However, the exact positioning is not determined yet. Let's try both possibilities:
     - Case 1:
       | Nationality   |    1    |     2     |
       | Sport         | Parkour | Swimming |
     - Case 2:
       | Nationality   |    2    |     1     |
       | Sport         | Swimming| Parkour  |

3. The mexican and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions. In our table, the position number is odd for the Mexican (2) and even for the swimmer (1 or 2, depending on the case). Since the parity is different, both cases are valid.

4. The argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. In both cases, the Argentine is on the right of the Parkour, so both cases are still valid.

5. Since both cases are valid, we cannot determine the exact positioning based on the given information.

Final answer: We cannot determine the exact positioning of the nationalities and sports in the table.

#############
| Nationality   |    1    |     2     |
| Sport         | Parkour | Swimming |

Lv9-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two different beverages (iced-tea, sprite) and two different hobbies (gardening, woodworking).

2. Since there are two items for each category, we can assign them as follows:

   - Beverages: Iced-tea (1) and Sprite (2)
   - Hobbies: Gardening (1) and Woodworking (2)

3. Now let's apply the first rule: ""the person drinking sprite and the person who's hobby is gardening have different parity positions##9"". This means that the difference between their positions should not be a multiple of 9.

   - If the sprite drinker is in position 1, the gardener must be in position 2. But in this case, the difference between their positions is 1, which is a multiple of 9, so this doesn't work.
   - If the sprite drinker is in position 2, the gardener must be in position 1. This satisfies the condition, as the difference between their positions is 1, which is not a multiple of 9.

4. Now let's apply the second rule: ""the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening"". Since we've already placed the sprite drinker in position 2 and the gardener in position 1, this rule is also satisfied.

5. So, the final solution table is:

   |            |      1      |     2     |
   | Beverage   | Gardening   |   Sprite  |
   | Hobby      |   Iced-tea  | Woodworking|

   However, since the question asks for the beverages, the final solution table for beverages only is:

   |            |      1      |     2     |
   | Beverage   |   Iced-tea  |   Sprite  |

   But since the hobby information is still important for a complete understanding of the puzzle, I'll include it as well:

   |            |      1      |     2     |
   | Beverage   |   Iced-tea  |   Sprite  |
   | Hobby      |   Gardening | Woodworking|

Lv9-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The parity of positions (odd or even) for the dog owner and the pineapple eater should be the same. This means they cannot be in the same column (since the columns have different parities). So, the dog must be in row 1 and the pineapple eater in row 2, or vice versa.

2. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since the food is in the columns and the eaters are in the rows, this means the column for the pineapple eater should be to the left of the column for the lemon eater.

Given these conditions, let's try to place the elements:

- If the dog is in row 1, the pineapple eater must be in row 2 (due to the parity condition). But if the pineapple eater is in the left column (column 1), there's no place for the lemon eater (since the lemon eater must be to the right of the pineapple eater). So, the pineapple eater cannot be in column 1.

- If the dog is in row 2, the pineapple eater must be in row 1. In this case, if the pineapple eater is in column 2, there's no place for the lemon eater again. So, the pineapple eater cannot be in column 2.

- The only remaining option is that the dog is in row 1 and the pineapple eater is in row 2, with the lemon eater in row 1 as well. But this violates the condition that the lemon eater must be to the right of the pineapple eater, since they are in the same row.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given conditions, and the puzzle might not have a valid solution.

However, if we assume that the condition about the lemon eater being to the right of the pineapple eater was a typo and it should be the other way around (the pineapple eater is to the right of the lemon eater), then the solution would be:

|        |     1     |   2    |

Lv9-2x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The jobs are fisherman and nurse, and the pets are rat and snake.

2. The fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions##9. This means that if we assign positions (1, 2) to the jobs and pets, the sum of the positions of the fisherman and the rat owner should not be a multiple of 9. The only way to achieve this is to assign the fisherman to job 1 and the rat owner to job 2, because (1+2=3) is not a multiple of 9.

3. The owner of the snake is in an odd position##4. Since the fisherman is in position 1 (an even number), the snake owner must be in position 2 (an odd number). So, the snake owner is a nurse.

4. Now we know that the fisherman is in position 1 and the nurse (snake owner) is in position 2. The pet of the fisherman is the rat, so the pet of the nurse (who owns the snake) is not the rat. Therefore, the pet of the fisherman is the rat and the pet of the nurse is the snake.

The final solution table is:

|       |     1     |   2   |
| Job   | fisherman | nurse |
| Pet   |      rat  | snake |

So, the final solution is:

Lv9-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two different beverages (coffee and hot-chocolate) and two different means of transport (quad-bike and roller).

2. The people drinking hot-chocolate and the people driving rollers have the same parity positions when arranged in a sequence where the first position is considered position 1. This means that either both are in odd positions or both are in even positions.

3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee. This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1 (since coffee must be there), and the person drinking coffee cannot be in position 2 (since hot-chocolate is to its right).

4. Since both hot-chocolate and roller cannot be in the first two positions, they must be in positions 3 and 4. However, this violates the first condition that they have the same parity positions. So, both hot-chocolate and roller cannot be in positions 3 and 4.

5. The only other possibility is that both hot-chocolate and roller are in positions 1 and 2, which also violates the first condition as 1 and 2 are not the same parity.

6. The only way to satisfy all conditions is to have coffee in position 1 and roller in position 2. But this leaves hot-chocolate and quad-bike. Since both hot-chocolate and roller cannot be in positions 3 and 4 (due to parity), and they cannot be in positions 1 and 2, the only remaining positions are 5 and 6. So, hot-chocolate must be in position 5 and quad-bike in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different movie genres: family and satire. Let's label them as F and S respectively.

2. Similarly, there are two different means of transport: car and motorbike. Let's label them as C and M respectively.

3. From the first rule, the person watching satire movies (S) is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies (F). This means S cannot be in the first column and F cannot be in the second column. So, the possible arrangements are:

   |   | F  | S  |
   |--|----|----|
   | T1 |    |    |
   | T2 |    |    |

4. From the second rule, the person driving the car (C) and the person watching satire movies (S) have different parity positions. This means they cannot be in the same column. Since S is already placed in the second column, C must be in the first column (T1).

   |   | F  | S  |
   |--|----|----|
   | T1 | C |    |
   | T2 |    | S |

5. Now, we need to place the transport for the second person (T2). Since the person watching satire movies (S) is already using a motorbike (M), the person watching family movies (F) must be using a car (C). But this would violate the second rule because both C and S would be in the same parity position (first column).

   This means our initial assumption that F is in the first column was incorrect. So, let's swap F and S in the table:

   |   | S  | F  |
   |--|----|----|
   | T1 | C |    |
   | T2 |    | M |

6. Now, the second rule is satisfied because C and S are in different parity positions (first and second columns). The first rule is also satisfied because we have two different movie genres (S and F) and two different means of transport (C and M).

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   | Satire | Family |
|--|--------|--------|
| Transport 1 | Car   |        |
| Transport 2 |       | Motorbike |

Lv9-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food (apricot and carrot), and we don't know their positions yet, we can represent them as A and C for now.

|               |      A      |     C    |
| Food          |            |         |
| Nationality   |            |         |

2. From the first rule, the person eating apricot (A) and the Indonesian have the same parity positions as 9. This means that the number of positions between them and the Indonesian (or the number of positions between the Indonesian and the person eating apricot) is either both even or both odd. Since there are only two nationalities, the British must be the other nationality. So, we can represent the Indonesian as I and the British as B.

|               |      A      |     C    |
| Food          | B or I      |   B or I  |
| Nationality   |     I       |     B    |

3. Now, the person eating carrot (C) is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot (A). Since there are only two positions (left and right), C must be to the right of A. So, the final arrangement could be:

|               |      A      |     C    |
| Food          | B or I      |   B or I  |
| Nationality   |     I       |     B    |

However, since we don't know which is the apricot and which is the carrot, we can't definitively say who is eating which food. So, the final solution table would be:
