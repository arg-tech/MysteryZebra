Lv9-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 types of food, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and transport, each row should have a unique value. Let's assign them systematically:

   Food: Pear (1), Pineapple (2), Plum (3)
   Hobby: Cooking (1), Magic-tricks (2), Woodworking (3)
   Movie-Genre: Crime (1), Romance (2), Sports (3)
   Music-Genre: Gospel (1), Metal (2), Pop (3)
   Nationality: American (1), Malaysian (2), Mexican (3)
   Transport: Airplane (1), Skateboard (2), Trike (3)

2. From point 11, we know that the Malay and the person watching Romance have the same parity positions. Since they are both odd (2), the person watching Romance must be in an odd position. Since there are only 3 positions, the person watching Romance must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already taken by the American eating Pineapple (from point 9), so the person watching Romance must be in position 3.

3. From point 6, we know that the Malaysian is to the right of the person eating Plum. Since the person watching Romance is in position 3, the person eating Plum must be in position 2. So, the person eating Plum is the Malaysian.

4. From point 4, we know that the Mexican is driving the Airplane. Since the person eating Plum is the Mexican (from point 3), the person driving the Airplane is in position 2.

5. From point 8, we know that the person eating Plum is the person driving the Airplane. So, the person eating Plum is in position 2.

6. From point 1, we know that the person watching Crime and the fan of Pop have different parity positions. Since the person watching Crime is in position 2 (from point 5), the fan of Pop must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already taken by the American eating Pineapple (from point 9), so the fan of Pop must be in position 3.

7. From point 10, we know that the fan of Gospel is in an even position. Since the fan of Pop is in position 3, the fan of Gospel must be in position 2.

8. From point 2, we know that the person eating Pear is not the fan of Pop. Since the fan of Pop is in position 3, the person eating Pear must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already taken by the American eating Pineapple (from point 9), so the person eating Pear must be in position 2.

9. From point 3, we know that the person driving the Trike is to the right of the person who's hobby is Cooking. Since the person driving the Airplane (Mexican) is in position 2, the person driving the Trike must be in position 3.

10. From point 5, we know that the person driving the Skateboard is not to the left of the person who's hobby is Magic-tricks. Since the person driving the Trike is in position 3, the person driving the Skateboard must be in position 1 or 2. But position 1 is already taken by the American eating Pineapple (from point 9), so the person driving the Skateboard must be in position 2.

11. From point 12, we know that the person watching Sports is on the right of the person who's hobby is Woodworking. Since the person driving the Trike is in position 3, the person watching Sports must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already taken by the American eating Pineapple (from point 9), so the person watching Sports must be in position 3.

12. From point 7, we know that the person driving the Airplane (Mexican) is the person who's hobby is Cooking. Since the person driving the Airplane is in position 2, the person with the hobby of Cooking must be in position 2.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

   |               |    1     |      2      |      3       |
   | Food          | Pear     | Plum (Malaysian) | Pineapple (American) |
   | Hobby         | Cooking (Mexican) | Magic-tricks | Woodworking |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports | Crime | Romance |
   | Music-Genre   | Gospel | Metal | Pop |
   | Nationality   | American | Malaysian | Mexican |
   | Transport     | Skateboard | Airplane (Mexican) | Trike |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 types of food, nationalities, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and transport, each row should have a unique value. Let's assign a number to each unique value in each category.

   - Food: 1 (Potato), 2 (Cabbage), 3 (Cauliflower)
   - Nationality: 1 (Australian), 2 (Nigerian), 3 (Thai)
   - Movie-Genre: 1 (Musical), 2 (Sports), 3 (Zombie)
   - Music-Genre: 1 (Ambient), 2 (Salsa), 3 (Techno)
   - Sport: 1 (Biathlon), 2 (Parkour), 3 (Swimming)
   - Transport: 1 (Bike), 2 (Helicopter), 3 (Snowmobile)

2. From rule 1.1, the person eating potato and the Thai have different parity positions. Since they are both in odd positions (1 and 3), the Thai cannot be in position 1 (eating potato). So, the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality).

3. From rule 2.2, the person eating cabbage is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality), the person eating cabbage must be in position 2 or 3. But from rule 1.1, the Thai and the person eating potato have different parity positions, so the person eating cabbage cannot be in position 3 (Sport). Therefore, the person eating cabbage is in position 2 (Food).

4. From rule 3.3, the fan of ambient is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality), the person driving the snowmobile cannot be in position 3 (Transport). So, the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 or 2. But from rule 8.5, the Nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 (Nationality).

5. From rule 4.1, the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality) and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 (Nationality), the person driving the helicopter must be in position 2 (Movie-Genre).

6. From rule 5.5, the person driving the bike and the fan of techno have different parity positions. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality) and the person driving the helicopter is in position 2 (Movie-Genre), the person driving the bike cannot be in position 2 (Sport). So, the person driving the bike is in position 1 (Food).

7. From rule 6.6, the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality), the person watching parkour must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 4.1, the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person watching sports movies, so the person watching parkour is in position 1 (Sport).

8. From rule 7.7, the person eating cauliflower and the person who's sport is biathlon have the same parity positions. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality) and the person driving the bike is in position 1 (Food), the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 (Food).

9. From rule 8.8, the Nigerian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 (Nationality), the Nigerian is in position 3 (Nationality).

10. From rule 9.9, the person eating potato is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in position 3 (Nationality) and the person driving the bike is in position 1 (Food), the person eating potato must be in position 2 (Food).

11. From rule 10.10, the person who's sport is swimming is not the person eating cauliflower. Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 2 (Food), the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 1 or 3 (Sport). But from rule 11.11, the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the Thai, so the person who's sport is swimming is in position 3 (Sport).

12. From rule 12.12, the person driving the helicopter is in an even position. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2 (Movie-Genre), it is an even position.

13. From rule 13.13, the person who's sport is biathlon is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2 (Movie-Genre) and the person watching parkour is in position 1 (Sport), the person watching musical movies must be in position 3 (Movie-Genre).

Now we have the final solution table:

Lv9-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the parity positions of the person eating cabbage and the person watching drama movies are different, let's assign an odd number to the position of the person eating cabbage and an even number to the position of the person watching drama movies.

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Let's assign 1, 2, 3 to the sports from left to right (handball, swimming, volleyball). So, handball is 1, swimming is 2, and volleyball is 3.

3. The mechanic is somewhere between the coach and the person watching fantasy movies. Since the mechanic can't be the person watching fantasy movies (because of the parity rule), the mechanic must be the coach's left neighbor or the person watching fantasy movies' right neighbor. Let's assign 2 to the coach and 4 to the person watching fantasy movies. So, the mechanic can be either 1 or 3.

4. The pakistani is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. So, the pakistani can be 1, 2, or 3. But since the pakistani can't be the person watching fantasy movies (because of the parity rule), the pakistani can only be 1. So, the coach is 2, the mechanic is 3, and the person watching fantasy movies is 4.

5. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the mechanic. So, the person driving the motorbike (who can't be the mechanic) must be to the right of the person playing volleyball.

6. The pakistani is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike. So, the person driving the motorbike must be 5.

7. The pakistani is not to the right of the person driving the bus. So, the person driving the bus must be 6.

8. The argentine is not to the right of the coach. Since the coach is 2, the argentine can't be 3 or 4. So, the argentine must be 1.

9. The person eating corn is not to the right of the person eating strawberry. So, the person eating strawberry must be 3.

10. The person eating corn is not the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies can't be 1, 2, or 3 (because of the parity rule and the positions already assigned), the person eating corn must be 4.

11. The person watching animation movies and the pakistani have different parity positions. Since the pakistani is 1, the person watching animation movies can't be 1 or 3 (because of the parity rule). So, the person watching animation movies must be 2.

12. The person watching fantasy movies is 4.

13. The person driving the car can't be the person watching drama movies (because of the parity rule), the person eating strawberry (because of the position already assigned), or the person watching animation movies (because of the position already assigned). So, the person driving the car must be 5.

14. The person watching drama movies can't be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (because of the positions already assigned). So, the person watching drama movies must be 7.

15. The person eating cabbage is the only one left, so it must be 8.

Final solution table:

Lv9-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 categories and 3 items in each category. So, we can arrange the categories in a 6x3 grid.

2. From rule 3, the Italian can be in the first or the sixth position. Let's place the Italian in the first position.

3. From rule 8, the Canadian must be in an even position. Since the Italian is in the first position (1st is an odd position), the Canadian must be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's place the Canadian in the second position.

4. From rule 10, the person watching documentary movies (eating raspberry) cannot be to the left of the Italian. So, the raspberry cannot be in the first column. Since the Canadian is in the second position, the raspberry cannot be in the second column either. So, the raspberry must be in the third column.

5. From rule 9, the person eating raspberry is watching documentary movies. So, we have filled the third row and third column.

6. From rule 7, the fan of reggae is watching action movies. Since the raspberry (documentary) is in the third column, the action movies must be in the first or the sixth row. Let's place the action movies in the first row.

7. From rule 11, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the action movies are in the first row, the iced-tea must be in the first column.

8. From rule 13, the person drinking sprite and the person watching mystery movies have the same parity positions. Since the iced-tea is in the first column, the sprite must be in an even column (second or fourth). Since the action movies are in the first row, the mystery movies must be in the sixth row. So, the sprite must be in the fourth column.

9. From rule 12, the person eating raspberry is not to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the raspberry is in the third column, the cat cannot be in the first or second row. So, the cat must be in the fifth row.

10. From rule 6, the person watching mystery movies is not to the right of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is in the fifth row, the mystery movies must be in the fourth row.

11. From rule 4, the person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person eating kale and the Italian. Since the raspberry (eating kale) is in the third column and the Italian is in the first column, the mystery movies must be in the second column.

12. From rule 2, the person eating kale and the fan of blues have different parity positions. Since the raspberry (eating kale) is in the third column, the blues cannot be in the third row. Since the Italian is in the first column, the blues cannot be in the first row. So, the blues must be in the second or fourth row. Since the action movies are in the first row, the blues cannot be in the first row. So, the blues must be in the fourth row.

13. From rule 5, the owner of the snake is on the far left or far right. Since the Italian is in the first column and the raspberry (eating kale) is in the third column, the snake must be in the sixth column.

14. From rule 1, the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the sprite is in the fourth column and the snake is in the sixth column, the sprite is in the third column. But this contradicts our earlier placement of the raspberry (eating kale) in the third column. So, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

Here is the table up to the point where we found the contradiction:

|               |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | sprite  | coffee      |
| Food          | kale    | pear    | raspberry   |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | mystery | documentary |
| Music-Genre   | blues   | folk    | reggae      |
| Nationality   | canadian| italian | polish      |
| Pet           | cat     | goat    | snake       |

The puzzle seems to have a contradiction."
Lv9-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From the given information, we know that there are 6 unique categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Transport) with 3 items in each category. We can represent each person with a number from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the person watching family movies, we can place skydiving in the middle (2). Traveling can't be in the middle because of the parity rule with family movies (#9), so traveling can be either 1 or 3. Let's place traveling at position 1 for now. Cooking can't be at position 3 because of the parity rule with the British (#2), so cooking can be either 1 or 2. Let's place cooking at position 1 for now. That leaves us with skydiving at position 2 and traveling at position 1.

3. The person watching family movies can't be to the right of the person driving the helicopter (#3), so the helicopter can't be at position 3. The helicopter can't be at position 1 because of the parity rule with the person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi (#9), so the helicopter must be at position 2. That means the person watching family movies is at position 3.

4. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the helicopter (#8), so the car can't be at position 1 or 2. The car can't be at position 3 because of the parity rule with the person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi (#9), so the car must be at position 2. That means the person driving the helicopter is at position 1.

5. The person drinking almond-milk is the person watching action movies (#4), so almond-milk is at position 3. The person drinking 7up can't be at position 3 because almond-milk is at position 3 (#11), so 7up is at position 1 or 2. Let's place 7up at position 1 for now. That leaves us with cola at position 2.

6. The person driving the taxi is not to the left of the person drinking cola (#5), so the taxi can't be at position 1. The taxi can't be at position 3 because of the parity rule with the person watching sports movies (#9), so the taxi must be at position 2. That means the person drinking cola is at position 3.

7. The person eating cherry is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter (#7), so the cherry eater can't be at position 3. The cherry eater can't be at position 1 because of the parity rule with the person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi (#9), so the cherry eater must be at position 2. That means the person driving the helicopter is eating broccoli (position 1).

8. The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating cherry (#12), so the broccoli eater is at position 1 and the cherry eater is at position 2.

9. The person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions (#9), so the person watching sports movies is either at position 1 or 3. Since the person watching sports movies can't be at position 1 (because the person watching family movies is at position 3), the person watching sports movies is at position 3. That means the person driving the taxi is at position 1.

10. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person eating cucumber (#6), so the person eating cucumber is at position 1.

11. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling (#13), so the person watching family movies is at position 3.

12. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking 7up (#11), so the person drinking 7up is at position 1.

13. The person driving the helicopter and the Mexican have the same parity positions (#10), so the Mexican is at position 1. That means the nationality of the person at position 3 is either British or Russian. Since the person watching family movies is at position 3, the nationality of the person at position 3 can't be British (because of rule #2). So, the nationality of the person at position 3 is Russian.

14. The person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions (#9), so the person watching sports movies is at position 1 (as we already placed the taxi at position 1). That means the person watching sports movies is British.

15. The only remaining nationality is Mexican, so the Mexican is at position 2.

16. The only remaining food is cucumber, so the person eating cucumber is at position 2.

17. The only remaining movie genre is action, so the person watching action movies is at position 3.

18. The only remaining beverage is cola, so the person drinking cola is at position 3.

19. The only remaining hobby is traveling, so the person with the hobby of traveling is at position 1.

20. The only remaining transport is the car, so the person driving the car is at position 2.

Lv9-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the scooter is to the left of the person driving the subway. Let's place the scooter driver in the first position and the subway driver in the third position.

   | Transport     | Quad-bike| Scooter   | Subway      |

2. From rule 5, the fan classical is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in the third position (subway driver), the fan classical cannot be in the first or second position. Let's place the fan classical in the second position.

   |               |    1     |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      |          | Classical | Subway      |

   | Transport     | Quad-bike| Scooter   | Subway      |

3. From rule 11, the fan metal and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions. Since the fan metal cannot be in the first position (as the fan classical is there), the person eating carrot must be in the first position. Let's place the person eating carrot in the first position.

   |               |    1     |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | Carrot  | Classical | Subway      |

4. From rule 12, the person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person eating carrot is in the first position, the person who's hobby is writing must be in the second, third, or fourth position. Let's place the person who's hobby is writing in the fourth position.

46. From rule 1, the people have 3 different transport options"
Lv9-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person watching drama movies is somewhere between the person driving the airplane and the fan of blues. Let's place the drama fan in the middle (position 2).

2. From point 2, the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person drinking juice. So, let's place the almond-milk fan in position 3. This means the juice fan is in position 1.

3. From point 5, the polish is to the left of the person drinking juice. So, the polish is in position 1 (nationality). From point 6 and 7, the polish's hobby is singing, and they are in an odd position (position 1).

4. From point 4, the person driving the subway is in an even position. Since the polish is in position 1, the subway driver must be in position 2 (transport).

5. From point 8, the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of blues. Since the blues fan is in position 3, the salsa fan is in position 2 (music-genre).

6. From point 13, the fan of blues is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the drama fan is in position 2, the time-travel fan must be in position 1 (movie-genre).

7. From point 10, the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the drama fan is in position 2, the airplane driver is in position 1 (beverage).

8. From point 11, the person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the person watching crime movies. Since the time-travel fan is in position 1 (movie-genre), the crime fan must be in position 3 (beverage).

9. From point 12, the thai and the person driving the tram have different parity positions. Since the polish is in position 1 (nationality), the thai cannot be in position 1 (nationality). So, the thai is in position 3 (nationality), and the tram driver is in position 2 (transport).

10. From point 14, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right. Since the polish (singing) is in position 1, the board-games fan must be in position 3 (hobby).

11. From point 9, the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the subway driver is in position 2 (transport), the skydiving fan must be in position 1 or 3 (hobby). However, the board-games fan is already in position 3 (hobby), so the skydiving fan must be in position 1 (hobby).

2. From rule 11, the hobby of sudoku and the german have different parity positions. Since there are only 3 positions, one must be even and the other odd. Let's assume the german is even (position 2). So, sudoku must be odd (position 1 or 3).

3. From rule 3, the turkish is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the nationalities are in positions 1, 2, and 3, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3. So, the turkish is in position 2 or 3.

4. From rule 7, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the german. Since the german is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3. So, the turkish is in position 1 or 2.

5. From rule 8, the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since singing is in position 2 (from rule 2), the skateboard cannot be in position 1. So, the skateboard is in position 3.

6. From rule 5, the person driving the taxi is on the far left or far right. Since the skateboard is in position 3, the taxi cannot be in position 3. So, the taxi is in position 1.

7. From rule 9, the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the fan jazz. Since the taxi is in position 1, the quad-bike cannot be in position 3. So, the quad-bike is in position 2.

8. From rule 1, the person driving the quad-bike and the analyst have the same parity positions. Since the quad-bike is in position 2, the analyst must be in position 2 as well.

9. From rule 4, the person drinking soy-milk is not to the left of the writer. Since the writer is in position 2 (from rule 8), the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 3.

10. From rule 6, the fan soul is in the middle. Since the positions are 1, 2, and 3, the fan soul is in position 2.

11. From rule 10, the person driving the taxi and the electrician have different parity positions. Since the taxi is in position 1, the electrician must be in position 3.

12. From rule 2, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since sudoku is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2 or 3. However, we already know that the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 2 (from rule 4). So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 3.

Lv9-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each row (Beverage, Job, Music-Genre, Nationality, Sport, Transport) and 3 instances for each variable.

2. From the clues, we know that the French is not to the left of the person driving the jet-ski, so the French cannot be in the first column. This means the French is either in the second or third column.

3. The Italian is the librarian (clue 4), so the Italian is in the Job column. Since the French is not to the left of the Italian (clue 12), the French cannot be in the first column either, so the French is in the third column.

4. The Italian is on the right of the fan country (clue 9), so the fan country is in the first or second column. Since the French is in the third column, the fan country must be in the first column.

5. The fan country and the person drinking mirinda have the same parity positions (clue 5), so the person drinking mirinda is also in an odd position (since the first column is odd).

6. The person drinking mirinda and the fan salsa have the same parity positions (clue 5), so the fan salsa is also in an odd position.

7. The person drinking tea is not to the left of the thai (clue 8), so the person drinking tea is in the second or third column. Since the French is in the third column, the person drinking tea is in the second column.

8. The person drinking tea is on the right of the french (clue 10), so the french is in the first column.

9. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (clue 2), so the skateboarding person is in the first or second row. Since the fan country and the person drinking mirinda are in the first column, the skateboarding person is in the first row.

10. The dressmaker and the person who's sport is skateboarding have the same parity positions (clue 6), so the dressmaker is also in the first row.

11. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere between the person who's sport is badminton and the person driving the train (clue 7). Since the skateboarding person is in the first row, the baseball person must be in the second row.

12. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the dancer (clue 3), so the dancer is in the first or second column. Since the French, fan country, and skateboarding person are in the first column, the dancer is in the second column. This means the person driving the bike is in the third row.

13. The only remaining variable for the third row is the music-genre. Since the fan salsa and the person drinking mirinda are in the first column, the fan salsa cannot be in the third row. So, the fan salsa is in the second row, and the music-genre for the third row is jazz.

14. The only remaining variable for the second row is the sport. Since the baseball person is in the second row, the sport for the third row must be badminton.

15. The only remaining variable for the first row is the transport. Since the person driving the bike is in the third row, the transport for the first row must be jet-ski.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv9-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport) and we have 12 clues. This means that each clue will give us information about at least 2 variables.

2. From clue 3, we know that the owner of the rabbit is the same person (position 3). So, we can fill in the Pet column for position 3 with 'Rabbit'.

3. From clue 8, we know that the owner of the rabbit is also the fan of rock music. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre column for position 3 with 'Rock'.

4. From clue 1, we know that the owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner, we can deduce that the person watching adventure movies is not in positions 1 or 2. So, we can fill in the Movie-Genre column for positions 1 and 2 with something other than 'Adventure'.

5. From clue 2, we know that the owner of the cat is to the left of the nurse. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner, we can deduce that the nurse is not in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, we can fill in the Job column for positions 1, 2, and 3 with something other than 'Nurse'.

6. From clue 4, we know that the dancer is between the fan of disco music and the person who's sport is cycling. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner and the nurse, we can deduce that the dancer is in positions 4, 5, or 6. Also, since the fan of disco music is not to the left of the fan of rock (clue 5), the dancer cannot be in position 3 (because that would place the fan of disco to the left of the fan of rock). So, the dancer is either in position 4 or 5.

7. From clue 6, we know that the person watching disaster movies is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner and the nurse, and the dancer is either in position 4 or 5, the person watching disaster movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the person watching disaster movies is in position 6.

8. From clue 7, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner, the nurse, the dancer, and the person watching disaster movies, the person watching mystery movies must be in positions 1, 2, or 6. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 6, the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 6. So, the person watching mystery movies is in position 1 or 2.

9. From clue 9, we know that the dancer is not the fan of disco music. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner, the nurse, the dancer, the person watching disaster movies, and the person watching mystery movies, the fan of disco music must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

10. From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite. Since we know the position of the rabbit owner, the nurse, the dancer, the person watching disaster movies, the person watching mystery movies, and the fan of disco music, the person drinking sprite must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

11. From clue 11 and 12, we know that the parity (odd or even) of the positions of the person watching disaster movies and the fan of disco music, and the person drinking sprite and the fan of disco music, are the same. Since we know the position of the person watching disaster movies (position 6), the fan of disco music must be in an odd position (3, 5). Since the person drinking sprite must be in positions 3, 4, or 5, the person drinking sprite is in position 3 or 5.

12. Since we have placed the rabbit owner, the nurse, the dancer, the person watching disaster movies, the person watching mystery movies, the fan of disco music, and the person drinking sprite, we only have the Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, and Sport for positions 1, 2, and 4 left to fill.

13. From clue 4, we know that the dancer is between the fan of disco music and the person who's sport is cycling. Since we know the position of the dancer (position 4), the fan of disco music is in position 2, and the person who's sport is cycling is in position 6, the person who's sport is cycling cannot be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1.

14. From clue 2, we know that the owner of the cat is to the left of the nurse. Since we know the position of the nurse (position 5), the owner of the cat is in position 4.

15. From clue 1, we know that the owner of the rabbit is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since we know the position of the person watching adventure movies (position 1), the owner of the rabbit is not in position 1. So, the owner of the rabbit is in position 2.

16. From clue 5, we know that the fan of ambient music is not to the left of the fan of rock. Since we know the position of the fan of rock (position 3), the fan of ambient music is not in position 3. So, the fan of ambient music is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 2 (clue 15), the fan of ambient music is not in position 2. So, the fan of ambient music is in position 4 or 6.

17. From clue 6, we know that the person watching disaster movies is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know the position of the person watching disaster movies (position 6) and the person drinking sprite (position 3), the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 or 2. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 2 (clue 15), the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1.

18. From clue 13, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 (clue 17), the Beverage for position 1 is Soy-Milk.

19. From clue 14, we know that the owner of the cat is in position 4. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 1, the Job for position 4 is Cat-Owner.

20. From clue 16, we know that the fan of ambient music is in position 6. Since the owner of the cat is in position 4, the Music-Genre for position 6 is Ambient.

21. From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 3, the Sport for position 3 is Surfing.

22. From clue 9, we know that the dancer is not the fan of disco music. Since the fan of disco music is in position 2, the Job for position 2 is Dancer.

23. From clue 12, we know that the person drinking sprite and the fan of disco music have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 3 and the fan of disco music is in position 2, the Music-Genre for position 3 is Disco.

24. From clue 8, we know that the owner of the rabbit is the fan of rock music. Since the fan of rock music is in position 3, the Pet for position 3 is Rabbit.

25. From clue 7, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1, the person watching mystery movies is in position 2 or 6. Since the fan of rock music is in position 3, the Movie-Genre for position 2 is Mystery.

So, the final solution table is:
