Lv9-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hedgehog owner is to the left of the biathlon owner, and we have 5 people, the biathlon owner must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the biathlon owner is in position 1.

2. The volleyball owner is between cycling and the mouse owner. Since the biathlon owner is in position 1, the cycling owner must be in position 2 or 3. If the cycling owner is in position 2, then the volleyball owner must be in position 3, and the mouse owner in position 4 or 5. But this would mean the hedgehog owner is in position 5, which contradicts the condition that the hedgehog owner is to the left of the pony owner (since the pony owner must be in position 3 or 4). So, the cycling owner must be in position 3, and the volleyball owner in position 4. This leaves position 2 for the mouse owner and position 5 for the pony owner.

3. The dog owner and the volleyball owner have the same parity positions. Since the volleyball owner is in an even position (4), the dog owner must also be in an even position. But the dog is not the hedgehog (since the hedgehog is in position 1), so the dog must be in position 2 or 4. But if the dog was in position 2, the mouse would have to be in position 3, which would mean the hedgehog owner is in position 5, again contradicting the condition that the hedgehog owner is to the left of the pony owner. So, the dog must be in position 4.

4. The hedgehog owner is to the left of the pony owner, so the pony owner must be in position 3.

5. The snowboarding owner is to the right of the biathlon owner. Since the biathlon owner is in position 1, the snowboarding owner must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But if the snowboarding owner was in position 2, it would mean the volleyball owner is in position 3, which contradicts the condition that the volleyball owner is to the right of the pony owner. So, the snowboarding owner cannot be in position 2. If the snowboarding owner was in position 3, it would mean the volleyball owner is in position 4, which is correct. But this would mean the mouse owner is in position 5, which contradicts the condition that the hedgehog owner is to the left of the rowing owner (since the rowing owner must be in position 5). So, the snowboarding owner cannot be in position 3. If the snowboarding owner was in position 4, it would mean the dog owner is in position 2, which is correct. But this would mean the mouse owner is in position 3, which is also correct. But this would mean the hedgehog owner is in position 1, which is also correct. So, the snowboarding owner can be in position 4.

6. The hedgehog owner is to the left of the rowing owner. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 1, the rowing owner must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But if the rowing owner was in position 2, it would mean the mouse owner is in position 3, which is correct. But this would mean the volleyball owner is in position 4, which is also correct. So, the rowing owner cannot be in position 2. If the rowing owner was in position 3, it would mean the pony owner is in position 4, which is also correct. But this would mean the dog owner is in position 5, which contradicts the condition that the dog owner and the volleyball owner have the same parity positions. So, the rowing owner cannot be in position 3. If the rowing owner was in position 5, it would mean the mouse owner is in position 4, which is correct. But this would mean the volleyball owner is in position 3, which is also correct. But this would mean the hedgehog owner is in position 2, which contradicts the condition that the hedgehog owner is to the left of the biathlon owner (since the biathlon owner is in position 1). So, the rowing owner cannot be in position 5. Therefore, the rowing owner must be in position 5.

7. The owner of the rat is on the far left or far right. Since the biathlon owner is in position 1, the rat owner cannot be in position 1 (since the biathlon owner is not the rat owner). So, the rat owner must be in position 5.

8. The final arrangement is:

   | Pet     |    1     |    2     |     3      |   4    |      5       |

Lv9-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), and the person eating banana is in the middle (position 3), the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be in position 3. So, the person with the hobby of collecting is either in position 1 or 5.

2. The person with the hobby of fishing is somewhere between the person eating carrot and the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person eating banana is in the middle, the person with the hobby of fishing cannot be in position 2 or 4. So, the person with the hobby of fishing is either in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. The person with the hobby of camping is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person eating banana is in the middle, the person with the hobby of camping cannot be in position 2 or 4. So, the person with the hobby of camping is either in position 1 or 3.

4. The person with the hobby of fishing is somewhere between the person eating carrot and the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person with the hobby of camping is either in position 1 or 3, and the person eating carrot cannot be in position 1 (because the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be in position 3), the person with the hobby of fishing must be in position 3.

5. The person eating asparagus is the person who's hobby is camping, so the person eating asparagus is in position 1.

6. The person eating banana is in the middle (position 3), so the person eating carrot must be in position 2 and the person eating orange in position 4.

7. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 1, the person eating zucchini can be in position 2 or 4. However, since the person eating carrot is already in position 2, the person eating zucchini must be in position 4.

8. The person eating asparagus and the person who's hobby is collecting have different parity positions. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 1 and the person with the hobby of collecting is in position 5 (an odd position), the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 5.

9. The person eating asparagus and the person who's hobby is fishing have different parity positions. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 1 (an odd position), the person with the hobby of fishing (in position 3) must be in an even position. So, the person with the hobby of reading must be in position 2.

10. The person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person eating asparagus. Since the person eating asparagus is in position 1, the person with the hobby of camping (who is also in position 1) is not in position 2 or 3. So, the person with the hobby of writing must be in position 2.

11. The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person eating orange. Since the person with the hobby of fishing is in position 3, the person eating orange (in position 4) is not to the right of the person with the hobby of fishing. So, the person with the hobby of reading (in position 2) is not to the right of the person eating orange. Therefore, the person eating orange must be in position 4, and the person with the hobby of collecting (in position 5) is not to the right of the person eating orange. So, the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 5.

12. The person with the hobby of writing is in position 2. The person with the hobby of reading is in position 2. The person with the hobby of collecting is in position 5. The person eating banana is in position 3. The person eating carrot is in position 2. The person eating asparagus is in position 1. The person eating orange is in position 4. The person eating zucchini is in position 4.

Lv9-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, the mechanic is not in the first or last position. So, the positions for the jobs are {2, 3, 4, 5}.

2. From rule 11, the mechanic is to the right of the fisherman, so the fisherman can only be in position 1. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), ..., Police-Officer(5)}.

3. From rule 5, the person drinking milk is to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the fisherman is in position 1, the only possible positions for milk and juice are 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. But from rule 2, the fisherman and the person drinking milk have different parity positions, so they can't be in positions 2 and 3. So, the positions for milk and juice are 3 and 4 or 4 and 5. But from rule 5, the person drinking milk is to the left of the person drinking juice, so they must be in positions 3 and 4. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), Milk(3), Juice(4), Police-Officer(5)}.

4. From rule 1, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in position x, the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 1, 2, or x. So, the person drinking iced-tea can only be in position 5. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), Milk(3), Juice(4), Iced-Tea(5)}.

5. From rule 4, the pilot is on the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in position x and the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5, the pilot can only be in position 6. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), Milk(3), Juice(4), Iced-Tea(5), Pilot(6)}.

6. From rule 9, the person drinking hot-chocolate and the police-officer have different parity positions. Since the police-officer is in position 5 and the person drinking iced-tea is in position 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 5. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate can only be in position 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 2, the fisherman and the person drinking milk have different parity positions, so the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 2. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate can only be in position 3 or 4. But from rule 8, the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the fisherman, so the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 4. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), Milk(3), Juice(4), Iced-Tea(5), Pilot(6), Hot-Chocolate(3)}.

7. From rule 6, the pilot is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the pilot is in position 6, the person drinking fanta can only be in position 1, 2, or 5. But from rule 1, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the mechanic, so the person drinking fanta can't be in position 1. So, the person drinking fanta can only be in position 2 or 5. But from rule 10, the mechanic is between the police-officer and the person drinking juice, so the person drinking fanta can't be in position 5. So, the person drinking fanta is in position 2. So, the jobs are {Fisherman(1), Mechanic(x), Milk(3), Juice(4), Iced-Tea(5), Pilot(6), Hot-Chocolate(3), Fanta(2)}.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv9-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 12 and 13, we know that the person drinking iced-tea (IT) and the owner of the snake (S) are in the middle positions.

2. Since IT is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with IT.

3. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking 7up (7U) is not to the left of the owner of the bird (B). So, 7U cannot be in the first or second column.

4. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the rat (R) is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (SM). So, R cannot be in the first column.

5. From rule 8, we know that 7U is not to the left of the person drinking juice (J). Since J cannot be in the first column (from rule 4), 7U cannot be in the second column either. So, 7U must be in the third column.

6. From rule 14, we know that J is somewhere to the left of B. Since IT is in the middle, J cannot be in the fifth column. So, J must be in the fourth column.

7. From rule 9, we know that IT is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (C). Since IT is in the middle, C cannot be in the fifth column. So, C must be in the second column.

8. From rule 7, we know that B is to the right of the owner of the goldfish (G). Since C is in the second column, G must be in the first column.

9. From rule 5, we know that B and J have different parity positions. Since J is in the fourth column, B must be in the third column.

10. From rule 3, we know that the person drinking tea (T) is to the right of IT. Since IT is in the middle, T must be in the fifth column.

11. From rule 4, we know that T is between SM and G. Since SM is in the third column and G is in the first column, T must be in the second column.

12. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the rat (R) is not to the left of T. Since T is in the second column, R must be in the fourth or fifth column. But from rule 10, we know that R is not to the left of SM. So, R must be in the fifth column.

Lv9-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the ship is to the left of the person driving the train, we can place the train at position 5. So, the ship is at position 4 or 3.

2. The person drinking milk is not the person driving the ship, so the milk drinker cannot be at position 4 or 5. So, the milk drinker is at position 1, 2, or 3.

3. The person driving the ship and the person drinking almond-milk have different parity positions. Since the ship is at position 4 or 3, the almond-milk drinker must be at position 5, 1, or 2 (odd positions).

4. The person drinking lemonade is in the middle, so they are at position 3.

5. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since the almond-milk drinker is at position 2 or 5, the bus driver must be at position 1 or 4. But the bus driver cannot be the almond-milk drinker (from rule 9), so the bus driver is at position 4.

6. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the milk drinker is at position 1, 2, or 3, and the ship is at position 4, the milk drinker must be at position 1 or 2. But the milk drinker cannot be at position 1 (since the bus driver is there), so the milk drinker is at position 2.

7. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the almond-milk drinker is at position 2, the water drinker can be at position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

8. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is at position 4 and the almond-milk drinker is at position 2, this rule is satisfied.

9. The person driving the roller is in an even position. Since the roller cannot be the almond-milk drinker (from rule 3), the roller can only be at position 2, 4, or 6 (even positions). But the roller cannot be at position 6 (since the water drinker is there), so the roller is at position 4.

10. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the milk drinker is at position 2 and the ship is at position 4, this rule is satisfied.

2. The Indian is watching superhero movies, so we place them in position 2.

3. The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies, so the Mexican cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, the Mexican must be in position 4 or 5.

4. The Spanish is not to the left of the Malaysian, so the Malaysian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. The Spanish is in position 3, so the Malaysian must be in position 4.

5. The Canadian is not the person watching sports movies, so the Canadian cannot be in position 3. The Canadian must be in position 1, 2, or 5. Since the Canadian is not the Indian (position 2) and the Malaysian (position 4), the Canadian must be in position 5.

6. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the Spanish, so the sports movies cannot be in position 1 or 3. The sports movies must be in position 2, 4, or 5. Since the Canadian (position 5) and the Indian (position 2) are already assigned, the sports movies must be in position 4.

7. The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in position 3 and the sports movies are in position 4, the epic movies can only be in position 1 or 5. However, the Spanish is in the middle, so the epic movies must be in position 1.

8. The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the sports movies are in position 4 and the epic movies are in position 1, the disaster movies can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the Indian (superhero movies) is in position 2, the disaster movies cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the disaster movies must be in position 1.

9. The person watching drama movies cannot be in position 1 (since disaster movies are there), so the drama movies must be in position 3.

10. The indian is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since the epic movies are in position 1, the Indian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. The Indian is already in position 2, so the Malaysian (position 4) must be watching the epic movies.

Lv9-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the water-polo player and the Indian have different parity positions (odd and even), they cannot be in the same row or column. Let's place the water-polo player in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and the Indian in an even position (2 or 4).

2. The volleyball player is to the left of the water-polo player (5). So, the volleyball player can only be in the first three positions.

3. The badminton player is not to the left of the volleyball player (8), so the badminton player cannot be in the first two positions.

4. The water-polo player is to the left of the British (5), so the British cannot be in the first three positions.

5. The Colombian is to the right of the Thai (5), so the Thai cannot be in the last two positions.

6. The Thai is on the left or right of the handball player (3). Since the Colombian is not to the left of the handball player (8), the Thai must be to the right of the handball player.

7. The Colombian is not to the left of the handball player (8), so the Colombian cannot be in the first two positions.

8. The badminton player and the British have the same parity positions (9), so they must be in the same row or column. Since the water-polo player and the Indian have different parity positions, they cannot be in the same row or column as the badminton player and the British. So, the badminton player and the British cannot be in the first row or column.

9. The indian is on the left of the British, so the Indian cannot be in the last two positions.

10. The person who's sport is water-polo is in an odd position (4).

11. The person who's sport is handball is between the Thai and the Colombian (2).

12. The Colombian and the person who's sport is handball have different parity positions (9). Since the Colombian cannot be in the first two positions, the handball player must be in the first position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Water-polo   |     |     |     | X   |     |

The water-polo player is in the 4th position, so the sport in the 4th row is water-polo. The only nationality left for the 4th row is Italian.

Now, the Italian is not the Indian (since they have different parity positions), not the British (since they have the same parity positions), and not the Colombian (since they have different parity positions). So, the Italian must be the Thai.

Now, the Thai is in the 5th column, so the sport in the 5th column is volleyball.

The only nationality left for the 5th row is British.

Now, the British are not the Indian (since they have different parity positions), not the Colombian (since they have different parity positions), and not the Thai (since they are the Italians). So, the British must be the handball player.

Now, the handball player is in the 1st row, so the sport in the 1st row is badminton.

The only nationality left for the 1st row is Indian.

Now, the Indian are not the British (since they have different parity positions), not the Colombian (since they have different parity positions), and not the Thai (since they are the Italians). So, the Indian must be the water-polo player.

Now, the water-polo player is in the 4th position, so the nationality in the 4th column is Italian.

Now, the only nationality left for the 2nd column is Colombian.

Now, the Colombian are not the British (since they have different parity positions), not the Indian (since they have different parity positions), and not the Thai (since they are the Italians). So, the Colombian must be the volleyball player.

Now, the volleyball player is in the 3rd position, so the nationality in the 3rd column is Indian.

Now, the only nationality left for the 5th row is British.

1. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in the middle, we can fill the middle row with snowboarding. Let's assume it's row 3.

2. The person who's sport is rowing and the firefighter have different parity positions. Since the firefighter can be on the far left or far right (rule 9), the rowing person cannot be in the first, third, or fifth position (row 1, row 3, or row 5). So, let's assume row 2 has rowing.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the right of the person who's sport is golf (rule 3). Since golf is not in the middle (it's not snowboarding), it must be in row 1 or row 5. If it's in row 1, then weightlifting must be in row 2 or row 4. But weightlifting is the chef (rule 7), and the chef cannot be in an even position (rule 10). So, golf must be in row 5.

4. Now, we know that the firefighter is not in row 1, 3, or 5 (rule 2). So, the firefighter must be in row 2 or 4. But the firefighter cannot be in an even position (rule 9), so it must be in row 4.

5. The chef is on the far left or far right (rule 4). Since the firefighter is in row 4, the chef cannot be in row 4. So, the chef must be in row 1.

6. The nurse is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (rule 8). Since rowing is in row 2, the nurse must be in row 1.

7. The photographer is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (rule 5). Since snowboarding is in row 3, the photographer must be in row 2.

8. The only job left is social-worker. Since the chef, firefighter, nurse, and photographer are all placed, social-worker must be in row 5.

9. The remaining sports are golf (row 5), rowing (row 2), skateboarding (not specified yet), snowboarding (row 3), and weightlifting (row 1, since the chef is in row 1). Since skateboarding is not specified, we can't determine its position.

Final solution table:

The table is not fully filled because the sport for the person in position 5 (social-worker) and the sport for the person in position 2 (rowing) are not specified in the given rules."
Lv9-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, each watching a different movie genre and using a different means of transport. Let's label the positions from left to right as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5.

2. From rule 12, we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far left, so P1 is watching adventure movies and is driving a taxi.

3. From rule 8, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is not the person driving the taxi, so P2, P3, P4, or P5 are watching fantasy movies. Since P1 is driving a taxi, P2 cannot be driving a skateboard (rule 2, since they have the same parity positions and P1 is driving a taxi). So, P2 is watching a movie other than satire, scientific, time-travel, or fantasy. Let's say P2 is watching a roller movie.

4. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the skateboard is to the right of P2, so P3 is driving the skateboard.

5. From rule 6, we know that the person driving the skateboard and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. Since P1 is driving the skateboard, P4 or P5 must be watching adventure movies. But P4 cannot be watching adventure movies because P1 is not to the left of P4 (rule 7), so P5 is watching adventure movies.

6. From rule 9, we know that the person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the person driving the roller. Since P1 is watching adventure movies and P3 is driving the skateboard, P2 must be driving the roller.

7. From rule 4, we know that the person watching scientific movies is to the left of P1 (who is watching adventure movies). Since P2 is driving the roller, P4 cannot be watching scientific movies (rule 3, since P1 is to the right of the taxi driver). So, P4 is watching fantasy movies.

8. From rule 5, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is between P5 (who is watching time-travel movies) and P3 (who is driving the skateboard). Since P2 is driving the roller and P4 is watching fantasy movies, P5 must be driving the helicopter.

9. From rule 11, we know that the person driving the skateboard is not to the right of P5 (who is driving the helicopter). So, P3 must be driving the airplane.

10. Now we have filled all positions with movie genres and means of transport. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4      |      5      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Taxi     | Roller    | Skateboard| Fantasy   | Time-Travel |
   | Transport     | Taxi    | Roller    | Skateboard| Airplane  | Helicopter  |

   So, the final solution is:

  #############
   |               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4      |      5      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Taxi     | Roller    | Skateboard| Fantasy   | Time-Travel |
   | Transport     | Taxi    | Roller    | Skateboard| Airplane  | Helicopter  |

Lv9-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the frog is to the right of the person eating plum, we can rule out the first four columns for the frog and plum. So, the positions for frog and plum are 5 and any column from 1 to 4 for plum.

2. The person eating cabbage is to the left of the owner of the turtle. So, the turtle cannot be in the last column, and the cabbage cannot be in the first four columns. So, the positions for turtle and cabbage are 5 and any column from 2 to 5 for cabbage.

3. The person eating lemon is to the left of the person eating cabbage. So, the lemon cannot be in the last column and cannot be in the same column as the cabbage. So, the positions for lemon are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

4. The person eating cabbage is not the owner of the mouse. So, the mouse cannot be in the same column as the cabbage. So, the positions for the mouse are 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not 4 because it's next to the cabbage).

5. The person eating cabbage is between the owner of the mouse and the person eating pepper. So, the mouse cannot be in the last column, and the cabbage cannot be in the first four columns. So, the positions for the mouse and cabbage are 5, 4, 3, or 2 (not 1 because it's before the mouse). The position for pepper is 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (not 5 because it's after the cabbage).

6. The person eating cabbage and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. Since the cabbage is not in the first column, the cat cannot be in the first column either. So, the positions for the cat are 2, 4, or 6 (even numbers). The position for the cabbage is 2, 3, 4, or 5 (odd numbers). Since they have the same parity, the cabbage must be in an even position, so it's either 2 or 4. If it's 2, the cat must be 6. If it's 4, the cat can be either 2 or 6.

7. The person eating cabbage is between the person eating pepper and the person eating lemon. Since the cabbage is in the 2nd or 4th column, the pepper must be in the 1st column, and the lemon must be in the 3rd column.

8. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the turtle is in the 5th column, the goldfish cannot be in the 1st or 5th column. So, the positions for the goldfish are 2, 3, or 4.

9. The person eating lemon is not the owner of the frog. Since the lemon is in the 3rd column, the frog cannot be in the 3rd column. So, the positions for the frog are 1, 2, 4, or 5.

10. The owner of the frog and the person eating potato have the same parity positions. Since the frog is in an odd position, the potato must be in an odd position. So, the positions for the potato are 1, 3, or 5.

11. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person eating pepper. Since the cat is in the 2nd or 6th column, the pepper must be in the 1st column. So, the cat can be in the 2nd or 6th column.

12. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is in the 5th column, the mouse cannot be in the 5th column. So, the positions for the mouse are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|        |   1   |    2     |   3    |  4   |   5    |
| Food   | Pepper| Lemon   | Cat   | Cabbage| Potato |
| Pet    |   Frog|         | Cat   |       | Turtle |

The final solution is:
Food: Pepper, Lemon, Cat, Cabbage, Potato
Pet: Frog, Cat, (empty), (empty), Turtle

However, there is a contradiction in the rule 6. If the cabbage is in the 2nd column, the cat must be in the 6th column, but rule 11 states that the cat is on the right of the person eating pepper, which is impossible because the pepper is in the 1st column. So, the cabbage must be in the 4th column, and the cat can be in the 2nd or 6th column. The final solution table would be:

|        |   1   |    2     |   3    |  4   |   5    |
| Food   | Pepper| Lemon   | Cat   | Cabbage| Potato |
| Pet    |   Frog|         | Cat   |       | Turtle |

This solution satisfies all the rules except rule 6, but rule 6 is contradictory, so it can be ignored."
