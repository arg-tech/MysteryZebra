Lv9-4x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different favorite beverages, we can fill one row with 'almond-milk' and the other with 'tea'. Let's assume the 'almond-milk' is in the first row and 'tea' is in the second row.

   |               |      1       |      2       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | tea         |
   | Hobby         |              |              |
   | Job           |              |              |
   | Music-Genre   |              |              |

2. Since there are 2 different hobbies, we can fill one column with 'magic-tricks' and the other with 'skydiving'. Let's assume 'magic-tricks' is in the first column and 'skydiving' is in the second column.

   |               |      1       |      2       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | tea         |

   | Music-Genre   |              |              |

3. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking tea, the person drinking tea must be in the second row and second column (since the hobby column is filled). So, the tea drinker is a 'writer' (since the jobs are different and the writer is in the second row).

   |               |      1       |      2       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | tea         |

   | Music-Genre   |              |              |

4. Since the writer and the person who's hobby is skydiving have different parity positions, the videographer must be in the first row (since the writer is in the second row).

   |               |      1       |      2       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | tea         |

   | Music-Genre   |              |              |

5. Since the fan hip-hop is on the right of the fan soul, the soul fan must be in the first column and the hip-hop fan must be in the second column.

   |               |      1       |      2       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | tea         |

Lv9-4x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. The people have 2 different jobs, so we can write them down:
   - Job 1: Photographer
   - Job 2: Videographer

2. There are 2 different nationalities, so we can write them down:
   - Nationality 1: Colombian
   - Nationality 2: Polish

3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport, so we can write them down:
   - Sport 1: Ice-hockey
   - Sport 2: Sailing

4. The people use 2 different means of transport, so we can write them down:
   - Transport 1: Train
   - Transport 2: Van

Now let's apply the clues:

1. The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions. This means that if we number the rows and columns starting from 1, the sum of the digits in the row or column that the videographer is in should not be the same as the sum of the digits in the row or column that the train driver is in. Since there are only two numbers in each row and column, this means that the videographer cannot be in the same row or column as the train driver.

2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means that the train driver cannot be in the second column (since the ice-hockey player is in the first column according to clue 3).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the colombian. This means that the ice-hockey player cannot be in the second row (since the colombian is in the second row according to the nationality).

Now we have some restrictions:
- The videographer cannot be in the same row or column as the train driver.
- The train driver cannot be in the second column.
- The ice-hockey player cannot be in the second row.

Let's try to place the elements one by one while respecting these restrictions:

- We can place the Colombian in the second row and first column (since the ice-hockey player cannot be there).
- We can place the Polish in the first row and second column (since the train driver cannot be there).
- We can place the Photographer in the first row and first column (since the ice-hockey player cannot be there and the train driver cannot be in the second column).
- We can place the Videographer in the second row and second column (since the train driver cannot be there and the Colombian is in the second row).
- We can place the Ice-hockey player in the first row and second column (since the Colombian is to its left).
- We can place the Sailing player in the second row and first column (since the train driver is not to its right).
- We can place the Train driver in the first row and second row (since the Colombian is not there and the ice-hockey player is not there).
- We can place the Van in the second row and second column (since the train is not there).
- We can place the Ice-hockey in the first row and the Sailing in the second row.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Photographer| Colombian | Sailing   |
| Nationality |          | Sport    |
| Sport      | Ice-hockey|          |

Lv9-4x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, and 2 nationalities. So, each category will have one unique item.

2. Let's assign the food, hobby, job, and nationality to variables: F1, F2, H1, H2, J1, J2, N1, and N2.

3. From point 1, we know that F1 is either papaya or pear, H1 is either reading or rock-climbing, J1 is either project-manager or scientist, N1 is either russian or thai, and similarly for F2, H2, J2, and N2.

4. Point 1 also tells us that each variable has a unique value. So, F1 cannot be the same as F2, H1 cannot be the same as H2, J1 cannot be the same as J2, and N1 cannot be the same as N2.

5. Point 2 tells us that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the scientist have different parity positions. This means that if we number the rows from 1 to 2, the scientist cannot be in position 1 (odd number) if the rock-climber is in position 2 (even number), and vice versa.

6. Point 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear. This means that if we number the columns from 1 to 2, the person reading cannot be in column 2 if the person eating pear is in column 1.

7. Now, let's assign the unique values to the variables based on the information given. Since the scientist cannot be in position 1 (odd number) if the rock-climber is in position 2 (even number), and the scientist is a job, we can assign the scientist to F1 (job) and the rock-climber to F2 (job).

8. Since the person reading cannot be in column 2 if the person eating pear is in column 1, and reading is a hobby, we can assign reading to H1 (hobby) and pear to H2 (hobby).

9. Now, we have two remaining variables: nationality (N1 and N2) and the food that the person eating (F1 and F2). Since the scientist is a job and a food, and the scientist is assigned to F1, the person eating F1 cannot be a nationality. So, we can assign the nationalities to N1 and N2.

10. Since there are only two nationalities, we can assign them to the remaining cells based on the information that the russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. This means that if we number the columns from 1 to 2, the russian cannot be in column 1. So, the russian can only be assigned to N2 (column 2).

11. Now, the only remaining variable is the nationality of the person in column 1 (N1). Since the russian is assigned to N2, the only remaining nationality is thai. So, we can assign thai to N1 (column 1).

12. Finally, we can assign the remaining food (papaya) to the person eating F1 (scientist) and the remaining food (papaya or pear) to the person eating F2 (rock-climber). Since the scientist is assigned to F1 and the scientist eats a food, the person eating F2 must eat a fruit that the scientist does not eat, which is pear.

The final solution table is:

|               |     1     |        2        |
| Food          | Scientist | Pear           |

| Job           | Project-manager | Scientist |
| Nationality   | Thai      | Russian      |"
Lv9-4x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food, 2 hobbies, 2 pets, and 2 sports. So, each column will have one unique item.

2. Let's assign the items to the columns based on the parity positions##9 rule. This rule means that the items in the same parity positions (1st, 3rd, or 2nd, 4th) will have the same value when we take the last digit modulo 9. Since there are 4 items and 3 positions that follow the rule, we can assign the items in the following way:
   - Food: Apricot (last digit is 7, so it goes in the 1st or 3rd column), Asparagus (last digit is 2, so it goes in the 2nd or 4th column)
   - Hobby: Reading (last digit is 5, so it goes in the 1st or 3rd column), Woodworking (last digit is 0, so it goes in the 2nd or 4th column)
   - Pet: Bird (last digit is 3, so it goes in the 1st or 3rd column), Turtle (last digit is 5, so it goes in the 2nd or 4th column)
   - Sport: Cricket (last digit is 0, so it goes in the 2nd or 4th column), Skateboarding (last digit is 5, so it goes in the 1st or 3rd column)

3. Now let's use the information about the turtle owner being to the right of the person eating apricot. Since the apricot is in the 1st or 3rd column, the turtle must be in the 2nd or 4th column. But the turtle cannot be in the same column as the bird (because they are different pets), so the turtle must be in the 4th column. This means the apricot is in the 1st column.

4. Now we know the position of the apricot and the turtle. Using the same parity rule, the reading hobby must be in the 3rd column, and the cricket sport must be in the 2nd column.

5. The only remaining items are woodworking hobby and skateboarding sport. Since they have the same parity and cannot be in the same column as their counterparts (reading and cricket), they must be in the 1st and 4th columns, respectively.

The final solution table is:

|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | Apricot    | Asparagus    |

Lv9-4x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (cranberry and lemon), two movie genres (martial-arts and satire), two pets (lizard and rabbit), and two means of transport (bus and motorbike). So, we can fill the first row with the two food types, the second row with the two movie genres, the third row with the two pet types, and the fourth row with the two means of transport.

2. From point 1, we have 8 items and only 6 positions. This means that two items must share a position. Let's assume that cranberry and bus share a position (since they are both common to all people).

3. Now we have 6 items left (lemon, satire, martial-arts, lizard, motorbike, rabbit). We know that the owner of the lizard is to the left of the person driving the bus. Since we've placed cranberry and bus together, the lizard cannot be in the first column. So, the lizard must be in the second column, and the person driving the bus must be in the first column.

4. The person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. Since we've placed the lizard and the bus in the first and second columns, the motorbike must be in an odd-numbered position (3 or 5). However, the lizard is in the second column, so the motorbike cannot be in the third column (since the lizard is to the left of the person driving the bus). Therefore, the motorbike must be in the fifth column, and the person eating lemon must be in the third column.

5. The owner of the lizard is to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since we've placed the lizard in the second column and the satire in the second row, the person watching satire movies must be in the first row. However, we've already placed cranberry in the first row. This contradicts the information that the lizard is to the left of the person watching satire movies.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle as it stands.

Lv9-4x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports. So, for each category, we have 2 unique options.

   For Movie-Genre: Comedy, Thriller
   For Music-Genre: Ambient, Indie
   For Pet: Cat, Lizard
   For Sport: Basketball, Soccer

2. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that either Comedy is in column 2 and Soccer is in column 1, or Comedy is in column 1 and Soccer is in column 2. Let's assume Comedy is in column 1 and Soccer is in column 2 for now.

   |               |    1     |     2      |

   | Sport         | Soccer  | Basketball  |

3. The fan ambient and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. This means they are either in the same column or the same row. Since they can't be in the same row (because there's only one pet and one music genre in each row), they must be in the same column. Let's assume Ambient is in column 1 and the Cat is in column 1 for now.

   |               |    1     |     2      |

   | Pet           | Cat     | Lizard     |
   | Sport         | Soccer  | Basketball  |

4. The fan indie is somewhere to the right of the fan ambient. Since Ambient is in column 1, Indie must be in column 2.

   |               |    1     |     2      |

2. Let's assign numbers to each item based on their category and the order in which they are listed:

   - Beverage: Fanta = 1, Tea = 2
   - Hobby: Dancing = 3, Fishing = 4
   - Movie-Genre: Scientific = 5, Sports = 6
   - Music-Genre: House = 7, Soul = 8

3. Now let's use the given conditions:

   - The person drinking tea is on the left of the fan of soul, so Tea cannot be in position 8 (Soul) or 7 (House). Let's assume Tea is in position 1 (Beverage column).
   - The person watching sports movies and the fan of house have the same parity positions. Since we know that Tea is not in position 7 (House), the other one must be in position 2 (Beverage column). So, Sports is in position 2.
   - The person who's hobby is dancing and the person drinking fanta have the same parity positions. Since we know that Fanta is in position 1 (Beverage column) and Dancing is not in position 3 (Hobby column), Dancing must be in position 4 (Hobby column).
   - Now, we know that Tea is in position 1, Sports is in position 2, Dancing is in position 4, and Fanta must be in position 1 or 2 (since it's the only item left). Since position 1 is already taken by Tea, Fanta must be in position 2.
   - The remaining items for Movie-Genre and Music-Genre can be placed in any order, but they must have different parity positions. Let's place Scientific in position 5 (Movie-Genre column) and Soul in position 6 (Movie-Genre column) to maintain different parity positions. The remaining item, House, can be placed in position 7 (Music-Genre column).

Lv9-4x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 4 variables: Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, and Transport. Each has 2 unique values.

2. From the parity conditions, we can infer that the variables are divided into two groups of odd and even positions. Let's label the positions 1 and 2 as even and odd respectively.

3. From the first condition (the person driving the boat is on the right of the fisherman), we know that the Fisherman cannot be in position 1 (Boat in position 1 implies Fisherman in position 2, violating the condition). So, the Fisherman is in position 2.

4. Now, let's consider the parity conditions for the Boat driver and Thriller watcher (different parity positions##9). Since the Fisherman is in position 2 (even), the Boat driver must be in position 1 (odd). So, the Boat driver is watching Thriller movies.

5. The parity condition for the Western watcher and Water drinker (different parity positions##9) implies that the Western watcher cannot be in position 1 (since the Water drinker is already in position 1). So, the Western watcher is in position 2.

6. Now, we know the positions of the Fisherman, Boat driver, Western watcher, and Water drinker. The remaining positions must be filled with the remaining jobs and movie genres. Since the Journalist job and the Water beverage are not yet assigned, they must be in the remaining positions.

7. The Journalist cannot be in position 1 (since the Boat driver is already there), so the Journalist is in position 2. This leaves position 1 for the Mirinda drinker.

8. The Mirinda drinker cannot be a Western watcher (since they are already in position 2), so the Mirinda drinker must be a Fisherman. But we already know the Fisherman is the Water drinker. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

However, if we assume that the puzzle has a mistake and the Fisherman is actually the Mirinda drinker, then the solution would be:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Mirinda  | Water     |
| Job           | Journalist| Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Western   |
| Transport     | Boat     | Subway    |

   | Pet           | Pony     | Rabbit    |

4. The owner of the rabbit and the person eating onion have the same parity positions. Since the rabbit is in the second column, the onion eater must also be in an even position. The only even position left is the second row, so the onion eater must be Indonesian:

   |             |    1     |        2        |
   | Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
   | Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
   | Job         | Musician |                |
   | Transport   | Bus      | Train          |

3. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the Job column is already filled, this means the person with the hobby of chess must be in the Hobby column. So, the Hobby column is:

   |             |    1     |        2        |
   | Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
   | Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
   | Job         | Musician |                |
   | Transport   | Bus      |                |

4. The person driving the train is the person who's hobby is chess. Since we just placed the person with the hobby of chess in the Hobby column, the person driving the train must be in the Transport column. So, the Transport column is:

   |             |    1     |        2        |
   | Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
   | Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
   | Job         | Musician |                |
   | Transport   | Train    | Bus            |

5. The musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions##9. Since the musician is in position 1, the person eating peach must be in position 2. So, the Food column is:

   |             |    1     |        2        |
   | Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
   | Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
   | Job         | Musician | Project-Manager |
   | Transport   | Train    | Bus            |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |    1     |        2        |
| Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
| Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
| Job         | Musician | Project-Manager |
| Transport   | Train    | Bus            |
