Lv9-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Transport) and 2 of each. Let's label them A1 to F2.

2. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - A1 and A2 are different beverages (Milk and Sprite)
   - B1 and B2 are different hobbies (Baking and Rock-climbing)
   - C1 and C2 are different jobs (Fisherman and Photographer)
   - D1 and D2 are different movie genres (Documentary and Thriller)
   - E1 and E2 are different nationalities (American and French)
   - F1 and F2 are different means of transport (Helicopter and Taxi)

3. Clue 1 tells us that the Taxi driver is to the left of the Photographer. This means F1 is either C1 or C2. Since we know the nationalities and movie genres, we can check the possibilities:
   - If F1 = C1 (Fisherman), then E1 = D2 (French = Thriller) and E2 = D1 (American = Documentary). But this violates clue 4, as the positions of Documentary and Baking have the same parity. So, F1 cannot be C1.
   - If F1 = C2 (Photographer), then E1 = D1 (American = Documentary) and E2 = D2 (French = Thriller). This satisfies all the clues.

4. Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking Sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. This means A2 is either B1 or B2. Since we know the nationalities and jobs, we can check the possibilities:
   - If A2 = B1 (Baking), then A1 = Sprite. This satisfies all the clues.

5. Now we know A1 = Milk and A2 = Sprite, C1 = Fisherman, C2 = Photographer, D1 = Documentary, D2 = Thriller, E1 = American, E2 = French, F1 = Taxi, and F2 = Helicopter.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the bus is not the one with video-games as a hobby. So, we can place the bus driver in the first column (1).

2. From rule 2, the project-manager is to the right of the person drinking tea. Since the bus driver is already placed, the tea drinker must be in the first column (1).

3. Now, the person with video-games as a hobby cannot be in the first column (1) because of rule 3 (the fan of R&B is not to the right of the person with video-games). So, the person with video-games is in the second column (2).

4. From rule 4, the fan of R&B cannot be in the first column (1) because the person with video-games is in the second column (2). So, the fan of R&B is in the first column (1).

5. From rule 5, the owner of the dog and the person with video-games have different parity positions. Since the person with video-games is in the second column (2), the owner of the dog must be in the first column (1).

6. Now, we have only one pet left, the rat. Since the dog owner is in the first column (1), the rat owner must be in the second column (2).

7. From rule 6, the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person with video-games. Since the person with video-games is in the second column (2), the tram driver can only be in the second column (2).

8. Finally, from rule 7, the pop music fan must be in the first column (1) because the tram driver is in the second column (2).

Lv9-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food, two movie genres, two music genres, two pets, two sports, and two types of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the owner of the pony is in column 2 (since the fan of R&B is on the right of the pony owner). So, Pet[2] = Pony.

3. From rule 2, the person watching horror movies is in column 1 or column 2. Let's assume it's in column 1 (Movie-Genre[1] = Horror).

4. From rule 4, the person eating kiwi is not in column 2 (since the person watching horror movies is in column 1 and the fan of R&B is on the right of the pony owner, which is column 2). So, Food[1] ≠ Kiwi.

5. From rule 5, the person eating kiwi is in column 3 (Food[3] = Kiwi).

6. From rule 6, the person who's sport is cycling is not in column 3 (since the person eating kiwi is in column 3). So, Sport[1] ≠ Cycling.

7. From rule 7, the fan of R&B is not in column 1 (since the person watching horror movies is in column 1 and the fan of R&B is not to the left of the person watching horror movies). So, Music-Genre[2] = R&B.

8. Now, we know that Sport[1] ≠ Cycling, and we have already assigned Food[1], Movie-Genre[1], and Music-Genre[2]. Since there are only two sports left, Sport[2] = Cycling.

9. From rule 3, the person who's sport is cycling and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. Since we have already placed Cycling in an odd position (Sport[1]), the quad-bike must be in an even position (Sport[2] cannot be even because it's Cycling, so Transport[1] = Quad-bike).

10. Now, we have placed Food[1], Movie-Genre[1], Music-Genre[2], Pet[2], Sport[1], and Transport[1]. Since there are only two types of food left, Food[3] = Banana.

11. From rule 6, the person eating kiwi (Food[3]) is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling (Sport[1]). So, Sport[2] ≠ Badminton (since Badminton would be to the right of Cycling). Therefore, Sport[2] = Badminton.

12. Since we have already placed all the sports, the remaining sport must be the one that has odd parity (Sport[1] is even, so Sport[3] = Cycling).

13. Now, we have placed all the sports, so the remaining sport must be the one that has odd parity (Sport[1] is even, so Sport[3] = Cycling).

14. Since we have placed all the sports, the remaining sport must be the one that has odd parity (Sport[1] is even, so Sport[3] = Cycling).

15. Since we have placed all the sports, the remaining sport must be the one that has odd parity (Sport[1] is even, so Sport[3] = Cycling).

Final solution:

|               |    1    |     2     |
| Food          | Banana  |   Kiwi    |

Lv9-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food, two hobbies, two movie-genres, two pets, two sports, and two types of transport, we can assign numbers 1 and 2 to each category for the two people.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person eating zucchini is the person who's sport is tennis, so we can place Tennis in the row where Zucchini is. Let's say Zucchini is in row 1, then Tennis is in row 1 as well.

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the owner of the snake. Since there are only two positions in each row, the gardener must be in row 1, and the snake owner must be in row 2. So, Gardening is in position 1,1 and Snake is in position 2,1.

4. From rule 3, the owner of the snake and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since the snake is in position 2,1 (an even position), the tram must be in an even position as well. The only even position left in row 2 is position 2,2. So, Tram is in position 2,2.

5. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we know the positions of Gardening, Snake, and Tram, the only possible positions for Sudoku and Zombie are in row 1, column 1 and row 1, column 2, respectively.

6. From rule 5, the person eating blueberry is not the person who's hobby is gardening. Since Gardening is in position 1,1, the blueberry eater cannot be in position 1,1. The only remaining position for the blueberry eater is 1,2.

7. Now, we have only one category left, Movie-Genre. Since we know the positions of Zucchini, Tennis, Gardening, Snake, Tram, Sudoku, and Blueberry, the only possible combinations for Movie-Genre are Sports in position 1,1 and Zombie in position 1,2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |

Lv9-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two jobs, two movie-genres, two music-genres, two nationalities, and two sports, and two means of transport, we can fill in the first row with the jobs. Let's assume the manager is in the first column and the photographer is in the second column.

| Job           | Manager  | Photographer |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
|              |         |             |

|              |         |             |

2. Since the people have 2 different movie-genres, we can fill in the second row with the movie-genres. Let's assume the first column has adventure and the second column has fantasy.

|              |         |             |

3. Since the people have 2 different music-genres, we can fill in the third row with the music-genres. Let's assume the first column has disco and the second column has funk.

| Job           | Manager  | Photographer |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Fantasy      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Funk        |

|              |         |             |

4. Since there are 2 different nationalities, we can fill in the fourth row with the nationalities. Let's assume the first column has American and the second column has Japanese.

| Job           | Manager  | Photographer |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Fantasy      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Funk        |

|              |         |             |

5. Since the people have 2 different sports, we can fill in the fifth row with the sports. Let's assume the first column has handball and the second column has skiing.

| Job           | Manager  | Photographer |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Fantasy      |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Funk        |

|              |         |             |

6. Since the people use 2 different means of transport, we can fill in the sixth row with the means of transport. Let's assume the first column has helicopter and the second column has van.

| Job           | Manager  | Photographer |
|--------------|---------|-------------|
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Fantasy      |

| Nationality   | American| Japanese    |
| Sport         | Handball| Skiing      |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Van        |

Now let's solve the given conditions:

1. The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese. This means the photographer cannot be in the first column, so the manager must be in the first column.
2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the fan disco. Since the skiing is in the first column and the fan disco is in the second column, this condition is satisfied.
3. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager. Since the helicopter is in the first column and the manager is in the second column, this condition is not satisfied. However, since the table is symmetric, if we swap the helicopter and van, this condition will be satisfied. So, let's swap the helicopter and van.
4. The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. Since the helicopter is in the first column (odd position) and adventure is in the first row (odd row), this condition is satisfied.
5. The American is on the far left or far right. Since the American is in the first column, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

2. Since the person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the Malaysian, the pumpkin eater must be in Column 2. So, let's place the pumpkin eater in Column 2.

3. Now, we know that the coach is on the far right. Since the pumpkin eater is in Column 2, the coach must be in Column 1. So, let's place the coach in Column 1.

4. The coach's position and the surfing person's position have different parity (odd and even positions). Since the coach is in Column 1 (odd position), the surfing person must be in Column 2 (even position). So, let's place the surfing person in Column 2.

5. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the surfing person is in Column 2, the gardener must be in Column 1. So, let's place the gardener in Column 1.

6. The person driving the tram is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus (from rule 2). Since the gardener and the coach are already placed, the only spot left for the person eating asparagus is Column 2. So, let's place the asparagus eater in Column 2.

7. The nationality of the person eating asparagus cannot be Malaysian (from rule 1). So, the nationality of the asparagus eater must be Polish.

8. The remaining hobby, job, sport, and transport can be filled in any order. Let's place the remaining hobby (photography) in Column 1 and the remaining job (firefighter) in Column 2.

9. The remaining sport (volleyball) can be placed in either column. Let's place it in Column 1.

7. From rule 6, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the owner of the dog. Since we already know the position of hot-chocolate, this means that dog cannot be in row 1. So, dog must be in row 2.

Lv9-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two positions for each category, we can label the positions with numbers 1 and 2. Let's assign the positions for the beverages first. Since there are two different beverages (7up and lemonade), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position (to avoid having the same favorite beverage for two people). Let's say 7up is in position 1 and lemonade is in position 2.

2. Now let's assign the positions for the food. Since there are two different types of food (strawberry and watermelon), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position. Since we already have 7up in position 1, let's say watermelon is in position 1 and strawberry is in position 2. But this contradicts the information that the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon, so we need to swap them: 7up is in position 2 and watermelon is in position 1.

3. Now let's assign the positions for the jobs. Since there are two different jobs (accountant and chef), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position. Since we already have watermelon in position 1, let's say the accountant is in position 1 and the chef is in position 2.

4. Now let's assign the positions for the music-genres. Since there are two different music-genres (blues and salsa), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position. Since we already have the accountant in position 1, let's say the blues fan is in position 1 and the salsa fan is in position 2.

5. Now let's assign the positions for the sports. Since there are two different sports (badminton and skateboarding), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position. Since we already have the accountant in position 1, let's say the person who prefers badminton is in position 1 and the person who prefers skateboarding is in position 2.

6. Now let's assign the positions for the transport. Since there are two different means of transport (snowmobile and taxi), they must be in positions 1 and 2, but not in the same position. Since we already have the person who prefers badminton in position 1, let's say the person driving the snowmobile is in position 1 and the person driving the taxi is in position 2.

7. Now we have a table that satisfies all the conditions:

   |               |     1      |       2       |
   | Beverage      | 7up        |  Lemonade    |
   | Food          | Watermelon  |  Strawberry  |
   | Job           | Accountant  |  Chef        |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues      |  Salsa       |
   | Sport         | Badminton  |  Skateboarding|
   | Transport     | Snowmobile |  Taxi        |

   This table satisfies all the conditions, so the final solution is:

Lv9-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two types of beverages, we can fill the first row with hot-chocolate in the first column and iced-tea in the second column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          |              |           |
| Hobby         |              |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     |              |           |

2. Since there are only two types of food, we can fill the second row with avocado in the first column and pear in the second column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         |              |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     |              |           |

3. From rule 1.6, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person eating pear. So, the person eating pear cannot be in the first column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         |              |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     |              |           |

4. From rule 5.4, the person driving the airplane is to the left of the person eating avocado. So, the person driving the airplane must be in the first column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         |              |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     |           |

5. From rule 5.5, the person eating avocado is to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person driving the airplane is already in the first column, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in the second column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    |           |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     |           |

6. From rule 2.9, the person driving the airplane (in the first column) and the fan of classical music have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the airplane is already in the first column, the fan of classical music must also be in the first column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    | Classical |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     |           |

7. From rule 3.6, the person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching zombie movies. Since we have already placed the person drinking hot-chocolate and iced-tea, and the person watching zombie movies cannot be the person driving the airplane (since there's only one airplane), the person watching zombie movies must be in the second row.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    | Classical |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie       |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     |           |

8. From rule 4.5, the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person eating avocado. Since the person driving the airplane is already in the first column and the person eating avocado is in the second column, the person driving the snowmobile must be in the third column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    | Classical |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie       |           |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     | Snowmobile|

9. From rule 2.9 again, the person driving the snowmobile (in the third column) and the fan of electronic music have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the airplane (in the first column) and the fan of classical music are already placed, the fan of electronic music must be in the second column.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    | Classical |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie       | Electronic|
| Music-Genre   |              |           |
| Transport     | Airplane     | Snowmobile|

10. Now, we have filled all the categories except for the last one, Music-Genre. Since there are only two music genres left (classical and electronic), we can fill the last row with either classical or electronic. Since we have already placed classical in the second column, we will place electronic in the last row.

| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |
| Hobby         | Traveling    | Classical |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie       | Electronic|
| Music-Genre   |              | Electronic|
| Transport     | Airplane     | Snowmobile|

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea  |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|
| Food          | Avocado      | Pear      |

Lv9-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two people, the hobby of video-games cannot be in the first column (as it would violate the given condition). So, video-games must be in the second column.

2. The person eating potato watches documentary movies. So, potato must be in the second row.

3. The person playing water-polo is on the left of the fan of metal. Since water-polo is in the first column (from point 1), the fan of metal must be in the second row. So, metal is in the first row.

4. The person drinking water and the fan of techno have the same parity positions. Since we know the positions of water and metal, we can deduce that techno must be in the first column (as the first and second rows have an odd number of items, and the first row has an even number of vowels, while the second row has an odd number of vowels).

5. The fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since techno is in the first column and grapefruit is in the second row (from point 2), the person eating grapefruit must be in the first row.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      | water       | soy-milk    |

| Movie-Genre   | documentary | martial-arts|
| Music-Genre   | techno      | metal       |
