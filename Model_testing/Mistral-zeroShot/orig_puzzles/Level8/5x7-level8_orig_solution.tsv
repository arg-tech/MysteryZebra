Lv8-5x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the jobs to the rows. Since the fisherman owns a frog, he must be in row 4 (as frogs are not pets for any other job). The coach is on the far left (row 1), so the jobs are:
   - Row 1: Coach
   - Row 2: (empty)
   - Row 3: (empty)
   - Row 4: Fisherman
   - Row 5: (empty)
   - Row 6: (empty)
   - Row 7: (empty)

2. Now, let's assign the nationalities. The Pakistani owns the frog, so he must be in row 4. The Mexican can be on the far left or far right, so let's place him in row 1 (coach) or row 7 (leaving the other job for the British). Let's place the Mexican in row 1 for now. The British cannot own the dog, so the British cannot be in row 6 (dog owner). So, the nationalities are:
   - Row 1: Mexican (Coach)
   - Row 2: (empty)
   - Row 3: (empty)
   - Row 4: Pakistani (Fisherman)
   - Row 5: (empty)

The project-manager is somewhere to the left of the fan of country (rule 10), so the project-manager cannot be in row 7. The project-manager is in an even position (rule 27), so the project-manager is in row 2 or 4. Let's place the project-manager in row 2 for now. This means the fan of disco is in row 3.

7. The person watching comedy movies is not the owner of the pony (rule 19), so the comedy movies cannot be in row 2 (pony owner). The person watching comedy movies is not to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 48), so the comedy movies cannot be in row 1 (rabbit owner). The comedy movies are not to the right of the owner of the hamster (rule 44), so the comedy movies cannot be in row 7.

8. The person watching horror movies is in an even position (rule 6 and 16), so the horror movies are in row 2, 4, or 6.

The owner of the rabbit is not the person watching horror movies (rule 49), so the rabbit is not in row 2. The owner of the rabbit is not the person watching zombie movies (rule 49), so the rabbit is not in row 6. The owner of the rabbit is in row 1.

Let's place the hamster in row 2 for now.

14. The owner of the mouse is in the middle (rule 33), so the mouse is in row 4.

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

Lv8-5x7-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the beverages, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and transport to the columns.

1. We know there are 7 different options for each category, so we can fill in the first row with the unique options from each category.

| Beverage      | Job           | Movie-Genre   | Nationality   | Transport     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|

2. From rule 1, we know the nurse is not drinking lemonade, so we can assign lemonade to the person in column 2.

| Beverage      | Job           | Movie-Genre   | Nationality   | Transport     |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| iced-tea     | doctor        | adventure      | australian    | car           |

3. From rule 2, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the firefighter, so the firefighter must be in a column to the left of the scooter. Since the scooter cannot be in the first column (as it is not iced-tea), the firefighter must be in column 1.

| Beverage      | Job           | Movie-Genre   | Nationality   | Transport     |

Step 1: Identify the number of each genre, pet, sport, and transport, and assign them numbers from 1 to 7.

Movie-Genre: 1. animation, 2. martial-arts, 3. musical, 4. mystery, 5. scientific, 6. spy, 7. western
Music-Genre: 1. d&b, 2. electronic, 3. folk, 4. indie, 5. r&b, 6. techno, 7. trance

Transport: 1. car, 2. jet-ski, 3. motorbike, 4. quad-bike, 5. taxi, 6. tram, 7. trike

Step 2: Analyze the clues and make deductions.

1. r&b is in an even position (4, 6, or 2) and not next to western (1, 3, 5, or 7). So, r&b can be in position 4, 6, or 2. Let's assume r&b is in position 4 for now.
2. Water-polo is in position 6 (since r&b is in position 4 and not to the right of water-polo).
3. Biathlon is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7). Since it's not in position 1 (due to clue 28), biathlon is in position 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume biathlon is in position 3 for now.
4. Indie is between scientific (5) and martial-arts (2 or 4). Since r&b is in position 4, indie can't be in position 4. So, indie is in position 3 or 5. Let's assume indie is in position 3 for now.

10. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person watching mystery movies (4 or 6).
11. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left or far right (1 or 7). Since biathlon is in position 3, it can't be in position 7. So, biathlon is in position 1.
12. The fan of indie is between scientific (5) and martial-arts (2 or 4). Since indie is in position 3, it can't be in position 4. So, indie is in position 2.
13. The fan of electronic is not to the right of the person driving the tram (5). So, electronic can't be in position 6 or 7.
