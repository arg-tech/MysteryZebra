Lv8-4x7-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the beverages to the columns. We know that the fan of folk is to the right of the fan of d&b, and the person drinking cola is to the left of the fan of d&b. So, we can place cola in the second column, d&b in the first column, and the rest of the beverages in the remaining columns from left to right.

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | cola    |   | △ |   |   |   |   |   |
   | d&b     | △ |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   | ...     |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. Next, let's assign the jobs to the rows. We know that the mechanic is on the left or right of the fan of d&b, and the manager is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard. So, we can place the mechanic in the first or seventh row, and the manager in the row below the skateboard (which we'll place in the sixth row). The rest of the jobs can be placed in the remaining rows.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |   |   | cola |   |   |   | skateboard |   |
   |   |   | d&b  |   |   |   |   |   |
   | mechanic|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   | manager |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

3. Now, let's assign the music-genres. We know that the fan of folk is to the left of the social-worker, and the fan of salsa is to the right of the security-guard. We also know that the fan of salsa is between the fan of folk and the manager. So, we can place the fan of folk in the first row, the fan of salsa in the third row, and the fan of metal in the fifth row (since it's to the left of the dancer and the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the musician). The rest of the music-genres can be placed in the remaining rows.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |   |   | cola |   |   |   | skateboard |   |
   |   |   | d&b  |   |   |   |   |   |
   | mechanic|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   | manager |   |
   |   | folk |   | salsa |   | metal |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

4. Next, let's assign the means of transport. We know that the person driving the skateboard is the person drinking soy-milk, and the person driving the boat is to the left of the fan of rock. We also know that the person driving the bike is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. So, we can place the person driving the skateboard in the sixth row, the person driving the boat in the fourth row, and the person driving the bike in the second row. The rest of the means of transport can be placed in the remaining rows.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |   |   | cola |   |   |   | skateboard (soy-milk) |   |
   |   |   | d&b  |   |   |   |   |   |
   | mechanic|   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   | manager |   |
   |   | folk |   | salsa | boat | metal |   |   |
   | bike |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

5. Finally, let's fill in the remaining details. We know that the dancer is to the left of the fan of rock, the fan of house is not to the left of the person drinking cola, the person drinking fanta is to the right of the fan of folk, the person drinking 7up is the fan of metal, the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the fan of metal, the person drinking milk is not the person driving the tram, the social-worker is to the right of the person driving the van, the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the musician, the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person driving the tram, the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person driving the van, the chef is to the left of the person drinking cola, the person drinking cola is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk, the fan of metal is not to the left of the dancer, the social-worker is not the person driving the tram, and the person driving the tram is not to the left of the mechanic.

Lv8-4x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the bartender is not in position 1, so they must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Since the scientist is to the right of the bartender in position 5, the bartender cannot be in position 5. So, the bartender is either in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.

2. From rule 2, the person watching family movies is either in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, or the person watching horror movies is in position 5 or 6. Since the coach drives the car (rule 3), they cannot be in position 1 (as it's the only odd position and the car is an even position). So, the coach is in position 2, 4, or 6. If the person watching family movies is in position 1, then the person watching horror movies must be in position 5 or 6, but the bartender cannot be in position 5 (from rule 1), so the person watching family movies is in position 2. Therefore, the person watching horror movies is in position 6.

3. From rule 4, the lawyer is to the right of the person watching action movies. Since the coach is in position 2, 4, or 6, the person watching action movies must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. If the person watching action movies is in position 1, then the lawyer must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But the lawyer cannot be in position 4 (as it's an even position and the lawyer is to the right of the person watching action movies), so the person watching action movies is in position 3.

4. From rule 5, the bartender is not the person driving the airplane. Since the bartender is not in position 1 (from step 1), the person driving the airplane must be in position 1.

5. From rule 6, the person eating orange is between the bartender and the person driving the bus. Since the bartender is in position 2 and the bus driver is in position 6, the person eating orange must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

6. From rule 7, the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the airplane (in position 1). So, the person driving the bus must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But the bus driver cannot be in position 4 (as it's an even position and the bus driver is in an even position, according to rule 26), so the person driving the bus is in position 2.

7. From rule 8, the person eating corn is to the left of the manager. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person eating corn must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

8. From rule 9, the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching horror movies is in position 6, the person watching romance movies must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

9. From rule 10, the person watching adventure movies is to the left of the entrepreneur. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

10. From rule 11, the person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person driving the airplane (in position 1). So, the person eating lettuce must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

11. From rule 12, the lawyer is to the left of the entrepreneur. Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 1, 2, or 4, the entrepreneur must be in position 3, 5, 6, or 7.

12. From rule 13, the person watching romance movies is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching family movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 1 and the person watching family movies is in position 2, the person watching romance movies must be in position 3.

13. From rule 14, the musician is not to the left of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, the musician must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

14. From rule 15, the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 7.

15. From rule 16, the person eating orange is to the left or right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is in position 1, the person eating orange must be in position 2 or 3.

16. From rule 17, the person driving the taxi is to the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the person eating corn is in position 1 and the person eating artichoke is between the person eating banana and the person watching family movies (from rule 23), the person eating artichoke must be in position 3. So, the person driving the taxi is in position 2.

17. From rule 18, the musician is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage. Since the person driving the taxi is in position 2, the person eating cabbage must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

18. From rule 19, the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the person driving the helicopter must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7.

19. From rule 20, the person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 3, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 1, 4, 5, or 7.

20. From rule 21, the bartender is to the right of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in position 3, 5, 6, or 7, the bartender must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. But the bartender cannot be in position 5 (as it's an even position and the bartender is to the right of the entrepreneur), so the bartender is in position 6.

Lv8-4x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each category a number from 1 to 7. We'll use the given information to eliminate impossible combinations for each category.

2. Let's start with the Beverages. From rule 8, the fanta must be in an odd position. So, fanta can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume fanta is in position 2 for now.

3. From rule 29, asparagus must be in position 6 or 7, as it must be to the right of the Russian. Since fanta is in position 2, asparagus can't be in position 1. So, asparagus is either in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

4. From rule 30, cola must be between soy-milk and the Canadian. Since fanta is in position 2, cola can't be in position 1. So, cola can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6.

5. From rule 31, potato can't be in position 1 or 2, as it must be to the left of the person drinking fanta. So, potato can be in positions 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

6. From rule 11, almond-milk must be between potato and iced-tea. So, almond-milk can't be in position 1, and it can't be in position 7 if iced-tea is in position 6. So, almond-milk can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. From rule 13, almond-milk must be somewhere between the Australian and iced-tea. Since almond-milk can't be in position 1, it can't be in position 7 if iced-tea is in position 6. So, almond-milk can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

8. From rule 33, tea must be between the Thai and almond-milk. Since almond-milk can't be in position 1, tea can't be in position 7. So, tea can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. From rule 18, the person drinking tea can't be to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the frog can't be in position 1, the person drinking tea can't be in position 7 if the frog is in position 6. So, the person drinking tea can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. Since we've placed tea, almond-milk, and fanta, we can now place the remaining beverages: soy-milk, iced-tea, water, cola, tea, and almond-milk in the remaining positions.

Lv8-4x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the nationalities. Since the Brazilian is in an even position (4th), and the Malaysian is to the right of the Malay (5th). The Argentine (1st), Australian (2nd), and Turkish (7th) can be placed accordingly.

2. The Pakistani is to the right of the Malaysian (5th), so the Pakistani is 6th.

3. The Canadian can't be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, or 7th due to the even position rule, so the Canadian is 5th.

4. The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching animation movies and the Pakistani (2nd and 6th), so the martial-arts fan is 3rd.

5. The person watching superhero movies is in an odd position (1st, 3rd, 5th, or 7th), so the superhero fan is 1st.

6. The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (5th or 6th), but not 6th due to the even position rule for the Canadian, so the western fan is 5th.

7. The person watching time-travel movies is not 1st due to the superhero fan being 1st, and not 2nd due to the martial-arts fan being 3rd, so the time-travel fan is 4th.

8. The person watching animation movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is reading (4th or 5th), so the animation fan is 6th.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies (5th or 6th), so the person watching documentary movies is 6th.

10. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling, but not 7th due to the Turkish, so the cyclist is 2nd.

11. The person who's sport is cycling is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer (3rd or 4th), so the soccer player is 3rd.

12. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not 1st due to the superhero fan being 1st, so the skateboarder is 4th.

13. The person watching musical movies is the cricket player, so the musical fan is 1st.

14. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the Canadian (5th), so the hiker is 2nd, 3rd, or 4th. Since the hiker is not to the left of the basketball player (6th or 7th), the hiker is not 2nd. The hiker is also not 4th due to the skateboarder being 4th. So, the hiker is 3rd.

15. The malaysian is the basketball player.

16. The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the Canadian (5th), so the gardener is 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th.

Since the gardener is not to the left of the Malaysian (6th), the gardener is not 2nd. So, the gardener is 3rd.

17. The person who's hobby is board-games is not the Malaysian (6th), so the board-games fan is 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, or 7th. Since the board-games fan is not to the left of the person who's sport is basketball (6th), the board-games fan is not 1st. The board-games fan is also not 4th due to the skateboarder being 4th. The board-games fan is not 5th due to the person watching documentary movies being 5th. The board-games fan is not 7th due to the Turkish. So, the board-games fan is 2nd.

Lv8-4x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 2, the rock-climber is in position 3, 5, or 7 (odd positions). Let's assume the rock-climber is in position 3 (as we'll see later, this assumption helps us solve other clues).

2. From rule 8, the German is between the adventure and superhero movie watchers. Since the rock-climber is in position 3, the German must be in position 2 (as the superhero movie watcher can't be in position 1 due to rule 1).

3. From rule 17, the German is to the left of the drawer. Since the German is in position 2, the drawer must be in position 4 (even position).

4. From rule 26, the baker is in an even position. Since the German is in position 2 and the drawer is in position 4, the baker must be in position 6.

21. From rule 42, the turtle owner is not the British. Since the turtle owner is in position 2 and the British is in position 5, the turtle owner can't be in position 6. So, the turtle owner must be in position 1.

Please note that we don't have enough information to fill the Nationality and Movie-Genre columns. However, we can infer that the collector is Indonesian and the superhero movie watcher is Malaysian. The rest of the nationalities and movie genres can be filled based on the available information. For example, the gardener could be British, the person watching family movies could be Dutch, and so on."

   - The person watching spy movies is not to the right of the person watching spy movies (41). This condition is already satisfied.
   - The person eating papaya is not to the right of the person watching spy movies (45). So, Papaya (Pap) cannot be in the sixth or seventh column. Let's place it in the fifth column (5).
   - The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person eating asparagus (33). This condition is already satisfied.
   - The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching family movies (44). This condition is already satisfied.

Lv8-4x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's find the positions of the people who have unique constraints on their position:

1. The person drinking juice is the bartender (position 2).
2. The person driving the scooter is not the videographer (position 6 is not 5).
3. The bartender is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (position 3 or 5). Let's assume it's position 5 for now.
4. The person who's sport is handball is not to the right of the person drinking juice (position 2). So, handball can't be in positions 3, 4, 6, or 7.
5. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the photographer (position 5). So, skiing can't be in positions 6, 7.
6. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the bartender (position 4).
7. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter can't be in position 1 (it's an even position, and only 2 and 6 are even), the helicopter must be in position 6. So, parkour is in position 7.
8. The person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position (position 1 or 3).
9. The nurse is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (position 4 or 5).
10. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5).
11. The person driving the helicopter is in an even position (position 6).
12. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the journalist (position 2, 4, or 6).
13. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere between the person who's sport is skiing and the nurse (position 3 or 4 or 5).
14. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position (position 2, 4, or 6).
15. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (position 6 or 7).
16. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee (position 1, 2, or 3).
17. The person driving the scooter is on the right of the videographer (position 5).
18. The person who's sport is cricket is the journalist (position 2).
19. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (position 1, 2, or 3).
20. The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the photographer (position 2, 4, or 6).
21. The videographer is not to the right of the person drinking juice (position 2).
22. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane (position 2 or 4 or 6).
23. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (position 1, 2, or 3).
24. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 3, 4, or 5).
25. The person driving the ship is on the far right (position 7).
26. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the person driving the scooter (position 3, 4, or 5).

Now, let's fill in the table with the positions we've found so far:

| Beverage    |     1      |      2       |       3       |       4       |     5      |      6       |    7    |
|------------|------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Job         |            |     Bartender|               |               |            |              |         |
| Sport       |            |     Handball  |               |     Skiing    | Parkour    |     Snowboarding| Weightlifting|
| Transport   |   Snowmobile|              | Motorbike     |               | Scooter    |              | Ship    |

We still have some variables that are not determined yet, but we can continue to fill in more positions based on the remaining constraints:

27. The person driving the helicopter is in an even position (position 6).
28. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the journalist (position 2, 4, or 6). Since the journalist is in position 2, the jet-ski can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the jet-ski is in position 6.
29. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere between the person who's sport is skiing and the nurse (position 3 or 4 or 5). Since the motorbike is in an even position (position 4), the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 2.
30. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position (position 2, 4, or 6). Since the snowboarding is not in position 6 (it's occupied by the jet-ski), it must be in position 2 or 4. Since the person who's sport is skiing is in position 2, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 4.
31. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5). Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4, the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be in position 5. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1.
32. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the person driving the scooter (position 3, 4, or 5). Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4, the person who's sport is weightlifting can't be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 3.
33. The journalist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball (position 1 or 3). Since the person who's sport is handball is in position 2, the journalist must be in position 1.
34. The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk (position 1, 2, or 3). Since the person who's sport is skiing is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3.
35. The photographer is in an even position (position 2, 4, or 6). Since the journalist is in position 1, the photographer can't be in position 1 or 6. So, the photographer is in position 4.
36. The person drinking cola is not to the right of the person drinking coffee (position 1, 2, or 3). Since the person who's sport is handball is in position 2, the person drinking cola can't be in position 3. So, the person drinking cola is in position 1.
37. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (position 1, 2, or 3). Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4, the person drinking tea can't be in position 4 or 5. So, the person drinking tea is in position 1.
38. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the person driving the scooter (position 3, 4, or 5). Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4, the person who's sport is weightlifting can't be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 3.
39. The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the photographer (position 2, 4, or 6). Since the photographer is in position 4, the person driving the airplane can't be in position 4. So, the person driving the airplane is in position 6.
40. The person who's sport is cricket is the journalist (position 2).
41. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is parkour (position 1, 2, or 3). Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 7, the person drinking tea can't be in position 7. So, the person drinking tea is in position 1.
42. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (position 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7). Since the person who's sport is parkour is in position 7, the person driving the snowmobile can't be in position 7. So, the person driving the snowmobile is in position 5.

Now, let's fill in the table with the remaining positions:

| Beverage    |     1      |      2       |       3       |       4       |     5      |      6       |    7    |

| Transport   |   Snowmobile|              | Motorbike     |              | Scooter    |     Helicopter|     Airplane  |

We still have one missing sport and transport, but we can't determine them based on the given constraints.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-4x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on the given information:

   - The fan of punk is eating pineapple (P2).
   - The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's hobby is writing (Q3).
   - The person driving the train is the fan of dubstep (T7).
   - The person eating peas is the fan of dubstep (P5).
   - The person eating broccoli is the fan of hip-hop (Bx).
   - The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right (Sx).
   - The person eating cherry is between the person eating onion and the person driving the quad-bike (C2).
   - The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cherry (Wx).
   - The person driving the car is on the left of the person eating cucumber (Cx).
   - The person eating onion is the person driving the subway (Oy).
   - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person eating broccoli (Fx).
   - The person driving the ship is on the far right (Sp).
   - The fan of electronic is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry (Ez).
   - The fan of electronic is not to the left of the person driving the boat (Ez).

2. Now let's use the relative positions to fill in the gaps:

   - The fan of electronic cannot be in position 1, as it is to the right of the person eating cherry (Ez). So, E is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But it cannot be in position 6, as it is to the left of the person driving the boat (Ez). So, E is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But it cannot be in position 4, as it is to the left of the person driving the boat (Ez). So, E is in position 2 or 3. But it cannot be in position 2, as the fan of punk is to the left of the fan of electronic (P2). So, E is in position 3.

   - The fan of pop is somewhere to the left of the fan of r&b (Nx). But the fan of r&b cannot be in position 7, as T7 is the fan of dubstep. So, R is in position 6, and P is in position 5.

   - The fan of r&b cannot be in position 1, as it is to the right of the fan of pop (P5). So, R is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But it cannot be in position 6, as T7 is the fan of dubstep. So, R is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But it cannot be in position 4, as it is to the right of the fan of pop (P5). So, R is in position 2 or 3. But it cannot be in position 2, as the fan of electronic is to the right of the fan of r&b (R2). So, R is in position 3.

   - The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep (Hx). But the fan of dubstep is in position 7 (T7). So, H is in position 8.

   - The person driving the boat cannot be to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (Bx). But the fan of electronic is to the left of the person driving the boat (E3). So, G is in position 6.

   - The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (Gx). But the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Vx). So, V is in position 1 or 2. But it cannot be in position 1, as the person driving the bike is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (V1). So, V is in position 2.

   - The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (V2). So, F is in position 1.

   - The person driving the bike is on the left of the person eating cucumber (Cx). But the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cherry (Wx). So, C is in position 4.

   - The person eating cucumber is not to the right of the person driving the boat (C4). So, B is in position 5.

   - The person eating onion is the person driving the subway (Oy). But the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Sx). So, Q is in position 6.

   - The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's hobby is writing (Q3). But the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of r&b (Wx). So, H is in position 8 and R is in position 3.

   - The person eating peas is on the left of the person driving the boat (P5). So, B is in position 6.

   - The person eating zucchini is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Zx). But the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person eating broccoli (Fx). So, Z is in position 4.

   - The person eating broccoli is the fan of hip-hop (Bx). But the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep (Hx). So, D is in position 1.

   - The person driving the train is the fan of dubstep (T7). But the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry (E3). So, C is in position 4.

   - The person eating cherry is between the person eating onion and the person driving the quad-bike (C2). So, O is in position 1 and Q is in position 6.

3. Now we have filled all the positions except for W, S, and Y.

   - The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cherry (Wx). But the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (V2). So, W is in position 2.

   - The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (Sx). But the person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the left of the person driving the subway (Oy). So, S is in position 7.

   - The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right (Sx). But the person driving the subway is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Oy). So, S is in position 1.

Lv8-4x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the jobs in the first row. Since the scientist is to the left of the analyst (10), and the positions are odd for the owner of the rabbit (11), we can place the scientist in position 1, the analyst in position 3, and the rabbit owner (journalist) in position 5 (odd position).

2. The malaysian is to the right of the owner of the frog (15), and the analyst is on the right of the journalist (10), so the frog owner (journalist) must be in position 2, and the malaysian in position 6.

3. The canadian is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (16), and the malaysian is to the left of the canadian (17), so the martial-arts movie watcher must be in position 4.

4. The pakistani is not to the right of the nigerian (4), so the nigerian must be in position 7.

5. The pakistani is somewhere to the left or right of the owner of the fish (3), and the pakistani is not to the right of the person watching crime movies (1), so the fish owner must be in position 2 or 3. If the fish owner was in position 2, the pakistani would be in position 4, which is not allowed because the pakistani is not to the right of the nigerian (4). So, the fish owner must be in position 3.

6. The owner of the pony is not to the right of the person watching crime movies (27), and the pony owner is on the left or right of the scientist (35), so the pony owner must be in position 1 or 7. If the pony owner was in position 1, the scientist would be in position 3, which is not allowed because the fisherman is to the left of the scientist (22). So, the pony owner must be in position 7.

7. The doctor is between the canadian and the nigerian (29), so the doctor must be in position 5 or 6. If the doctor was in position 5, the canadian would be in position 3, which is not allowed because the canadian is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (16). So, the doctor must be in position 6.

8. The coach is not to the right of the owner of the mouse (6), and the coach is on the left or right of the doctor (36), so the coach must be in position 1 or 7. If the coach was in position 1, the scientist would be in position 3, which is not allowed because the fisherman is to the left of the scientist (22). So, the coach must be in position 7.

9. The fisherman is to the left of the scientist (22), so the fisherman must be in position 2.

10. The person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the pakistani (1), and the person watching crime movies is not the journalist (28), so the person watching crime movies must be in position 6.

11. The owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rabbit (31), and the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the owner of the rat (26), so the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1.

12. The person watching epic movies is in an odd position (23), and the person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the pakistani (5), so the person watching epic movies must be in position 5.

13. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish (8), and the person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies (5), so the person watching mystery movies must be in position 4.

14. The owner of the frog is on the right of the analyst (14), and the malaysian is to the right of the owner of the frog (15), so the owner of the frog must be in position 6.

15. The brazilian is on the right of the person watching crime movies (33), and the person watching crime movies is not to the right of the nigerian (34), so the brazilian must be in position 7.

16. The owner of the snake is not the person watching western movies (30), and the person watching western movies is not to the right of the owner of the snake (position not determined yet), so the person watching western movies must be in a position to the left of the snake owner.

17. The person watching satire movies is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person watching adventure movies (19), and the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies (5), so the person watching satire movies must be in position 4 or 5. If the person watching satire movies was in position 4, the person watching adventure movies would be in position 2, which is not allowed because the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the owner of the rat (11). So, the person watching satire movies must be in position 5.

18. The owner of the pony is not to the right of the person watching crime movies (27), and the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the scientist (35), so the owner of the pony must be in position 1 or 7. If the owner of the pony was in position 1, the scientist would be in position 3, which is not allowed because the fisherman is to the left of the scientist (22). So, the owner of the pony must be in position 7.

19. The person watching martial-arts movies is not to the right of the owner of the snake (32), and the canadian is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (16), so the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 4.

Now, we have placed all the jobs. Let's fill the remaining columns:

20. The nationalities: Since the journalist is the owner of the frog (20), the journalist must be Australian (as all other nationalities are taken), so the journalist is Australian.

21. The nationalities: The Australian is not to the left of the journalist (21), so the Australian must be in position 3.

22. The pets: Since the scientist is on the left of the analyst (10), and the scientist is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the scientist must be in position 2. So, the scientist is a Malaysian. The pet of the scientist is not determined yet.

23. The pets: Since the fisherman is to the left of the scientist (22), and the fisherman is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the fisherman must be in position 1. So, the fisherman is a Canadian. The pet of the fisherman is not determined yet.

24. The pets: Since the coach is not to the right of the owner of the mouse (6), and the coach is on the left or right of the doctor (36), the coach must be in position 7. So, the coach is a Brazilian. The pet of the coach is not determined yet.

25. The pets: Since the doctor is not to the right of the nigerian (4), and the doctor is on the left or right of the coach (36), the doctor must be in position 6. So, the doctor is a Pakistani. The pet of the doctor is not determined yet.

26. The pets: Since the analyst is on the right of the journalist (10), and the analyst is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the analyst must be in position 5. So, the analyst is a Nigerian. The pet of the analyst is not determined yet.

27. The pets: Since the journalist is Australian (20), and the journalist is the owner of the frog (20), the frog is an Australian pet.

28. The pets: Since the coach is a Brazilian (24), and the coach is not to the right of the owner of the mouse (6), the mouse is a Brazilian pet.

29. The pets: Since the doctor is a Pakistani (25), and the doctor is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the nigerian must be the owner of the rat.

30. The pets: Since the scientist is a Malaysian (22), and the scientist is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the snake is a Malaysian pet.

31. The pets: Since the fisherman is a Canadian (23), and the fisherman is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the pony is a Canadian pet.

32. The pets: Since the analyst is a Nigerian (26), and the analyst is not to the right of the nigerian (4), the rabbit is a Nigerian pet.

Now, we have filled all the cells:
