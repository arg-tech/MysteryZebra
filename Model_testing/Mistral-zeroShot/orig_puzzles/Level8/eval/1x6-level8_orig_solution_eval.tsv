Lv8-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching crime movies is the same person throughout the table (P1).

2. Since the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies (P2), and the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies (P3), we can place crime movies in the 6th position, sports movies in the 5th position, and action movies in the 4th position. This leaves drama movies in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's place drama movies in the 1st position for now.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies (P7). Since action movies are in the 4th position, martial-arts movies must be in the 3rd position, and time-travel movies must be in the 5th or 6th position. However, the person watching time-travel movies cannot be to the left of the person watching action movies (P4), so time-travel movies must be in the 6th position.

4. Now, the person watching drama movies is on the far left or far right (P5). Since drama movies are in the 1st position, the person watching sports movies must be in the 6th position, as there is no far right position left.

5. The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies (P8). Since crime movies are in the 6th position and time-travel movies are in the 5th position, crime movies must be on the left of time-travel movies, so crime movies are in the 5th position and time-travel movies are in the 6th position.

6. Finally, the person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (P6), so action movies are in the 4th position and martial-arts movies are in the 3rd position.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Let's place cola as the first beverage and iced-tea as the second beverage.

2. Now, the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking cola. So, mirinda should be placed before cola.

3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is already placed, almond-milk can only be placed after mirinda or before cola. However, since cola is already placed, almond-milk must be placed before mirinda.

4. We know that water is on the far right. Since we have already placed 4 beverages, water must be the 6th beverage.

5. Sprite can be placed anywhere between cola and water, but not to the right of mirinda (according to rule 6) or to the left of iced-tea (according to rule 7). So, sprite can be placed either 3rd or 4th. Let's place it 4th for now.

6. Now, we have cola (1), mirinda (2), almond-milk (3), sprite (4), and iced-tea (5) placed. Water (6) is still on the far right.

7. Since sprite is not to the right of mirinda, the only remaining position for sprite is 3rd. So, sprite should be 3rd and iced-tea should be 4th.

8. Now, water is on the right of the person drinking sprite, which is the 5th position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat. This means the guinea-pig cannot be in columns 5 or 6.

2. From rule 2, the owner of the rat can be either to the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since we know the guinea-pig is not in columns 5 or 6, the rat can be in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle. Since we don't know the position of the turtle yet, we can't place the mouse yet.

4. From rule 4, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the turtle. This means the rabbit can be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 5, the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since we know the guinea-pig is not in columns 5 or 6, the mouse can be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 6, the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the owner of the lizard. This means the rat cannot be in column 6, and the lizard cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3 (since the rat and mouse are to their left). So, the lizard can be in columns 4 or 5.

Now let's place the pets based on the information we have:

- The rat can be in columns 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's place it in column 4 for now.
- The lizard can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place it in column 5 for now.
- The rabbit can be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place it in column 1 for now.
- The mouse can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since it is to the left of the guinea-pig and the rat is in column 4, let's place the mouse in column 2.

Now we have a conflict with rule 3, as the mouse is not to the right of the turtle. So, the turtle must be in column 3.

Finally, the guinea-pig cannot be in columns 5 or 6, and it is not to the right of the rat (which is in column 4). So, the guinea-pig must be in column 1.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv8-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 sports and 6 people, so each person represents a unique sport.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person who does rowing is to the left of the person who does parkour. Let's place rowing in the first position and parkour in the second position.

3. From rule 2, we know that the person who does weightlifting is not to the left of the person who does rowing. So, weightlifting cannot be in the first, second, or third position. Let's place weightlifting in the fourth position (the first available position to the right of rowing).

4. From rule 3, we know that the person who does weightlifting is not to the right of the person who does biathlon. So, biathlon cannot be in the fifth or sixth position. Let's place biathlon in the third position (the first available position to the right of parkour).

5. From rule 4, we know that the person who does water-polo is on the right of the person who does surfing. Since we've placed biathlon, parkour, and rowing, the only available positions for surfing are the first, second, and fifth. If surfing were in the first position, it would violate rule 5 (parkour is to the left of surfing), so surfing must be in the second position. This means water-polo must be in the sixth position (the only available position to the right of surfing).

6. From rule 5, we know that the person who does parkour is on the left of the person who does surfing. This is already satisfied since we've placed parkour in the second position and surfing in the second position.

7. From rule 6, we know that the person who does water-polo is on the left or right of the person who does weightlifting. Since we've placed water-polo in the sixth position and weightlifting in the fourth position, water-polo is to the right of weightlifting, which is not allowed. However, if we swap water-polo and surfing, it satisfies rule 6 (water-polo is on the left of weightlifting) and doesn't violate any other rules.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |   1    |    2    |    3    |     4      |       5       |    6     |

Lv8-1x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all sports are different and there are 6 positions, each sport must be in a unique position.

2. From rule 1, the person who's sport is rugby is in position 4 (odd position).

3. From rule 2, the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since rugby is in position 4, parkour must be in position 5 or 6.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is snowboarding is in an odd position. Since we know rugby is in position 4 (odd), and parkour is either in position 5 or 6, snowboarding cannot be in position 4, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (even positions). However, from rule 4, snowboarding is to the left of skateboarding, so snowboarding cannot be in position 5. Therefore, snowboarding is in position 1.

5. From rule 5, skateboarding is to the right of parkour. Since we know snowboarding is in position 1, skateboarding cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But from rule 10, skateboarding is on the left or right of rugby (position 4), so skateboarding cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 6. Therefore, skateboarding is in position 5.

6. From rule 6, climbing is between parkour and rugby. Since we know snowboarding is in position 1, skateboarding is in position 5, and rugby is in position 4, climbing must be in position 3.

7. From rule 7, climbing is somewhere between parkour and rugby. Since we already placed climbing in position 3, it is between parkour and rugby.

8. From rule 8, parkour is somewhere to the right of biathlon. Since we know climbing is in position 3, parkour cannot be in position 1 or 2, so it must be in position 6.

9. From rule 9, the person who's sport is rugby is not to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (which is itself). This rule is redundant as it doesn't provide any new information.

10. Now we have filled all the positions:

   |         |      1       |    2     |    3    |    4     |   5   |       6       |

Lv8-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, we know that the rabbit is between the lizard and the chinchilla. So, the possible positions for the pets are: [Lizard, Rabbit, Chinchilla, Goldfish, Rat, Snake].

2. From rule 4, we know that the rabbit is in an odd position. So, the rabbit must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

3. If the rabbit is in the 1st position, then the lizard must be in the 2nd position and the chinchilla in the 4th position. But this violates rule 7 (goldfish is to the right of the lizard). So, the rabbit can't be in the 1st position.

4. If the rabbit is in the 3rd position, then the lizard must be in the 1st position and the chinchilla in the 5th position. This satisfies all the rules. So, the correct arrangement is: [Lizard, Rabbit, Chinchilla, Goldfish, Rat, Snake].

5. Now, we can fill the remaining positions. From rule 5, the goldfish is to the left of the rat. So, the goldfish must be in the 2nd position and the rat in the 6th position.

6. From rule 2, the snake is not to the right of the goldfish. So, the snake must be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. But the 1st position is already taken by the lizard, and the 5th position is taken by the chinchilla. So, the snake must be in the 3rd position.

7. Now, the only remaining position is the 4th position. From rule 8, the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the rabbit. But we already know the positions of the lizard and the rabbit. The only way for the chinchilla to be between them is if it's in the 4th position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 sports and 6 people, so each person represents a unique sport.

2. From rule 8, we know that weightlifting is on the far right, so it goes in the last column (column 6).

3. From rule 9, we know that baseball is to the right of sailing and to the right of weightlifting, so it goes in the second last column (column 5).

4. From rule 6, we know that sailing is between cricket and baseball, so it goes in the middle column (column 3).

5. From rule 4, we know that cricket is not to the right of sailing, so it goes in either column 1 or 2. Since it can't be in column 2 (because of rule 1), it goes in column 1.

6. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, so the order is Cricket (column 1) and Baseball (column 5).

7. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, so Lacrosse must be in column 2.

8. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse, so the order is Lacrosse (column 2) and Baseball (column 5).

9. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting, so it goes in column 4.

10. From rule 5, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon, so the order is Biathlon (column 4) and Lacrosse (column 2).

Now, we have filled all the positions with the given conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv8-1x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the mechanic is on the far left or far right, it can't be in the first or sixth position. So, the mechanic can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. The architect is on the right of the videographer, so the architect can't be in the first column. This means the architect can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.

3. The mechanic is on the right of the analyst, so the mechanic can't be in the first column either. This means the mechanic can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already established that the mechanic can't be in the first or sixth position, so the mechanic must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

4. The manager is on the left of the videographer, so the manager can't be in the sixth position. This means the manager can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. The architect is not to the right of the project-manager. Since the architect can't be in the first column, the project-manager can't be in the second column either. So, the project-manager can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 6. But the architect can't be in the sixth position, so the project-manager can't be in the sixth position either. This means the project-manager can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

6. The analyst is somewhere to the right of the videographer. Since the architect can't be in the first column, the analyst can't be in the first column either. This means the analyst can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But the mechanic can't be in the first column, so the analyst can't be in the second column either. This means the analyst can be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Now, let's put the jobs in the table:

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   |         |              |           | project-manager | analyst | videographer |

We still have some possibilities for the mechanic and the architect:
- Mechanic can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But since the mechanic is on the right of the analyst, the mechanic can't be in the third position. So, the mechanic can be in positions 2 or 4.
- Architect can be in positions 2, 3, or 6. But since the architect is on the right of the videographer, the architect can't be in the second position. So, the architect can be in positions 3 or 6.

Let's try the architect in the third position:

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   | manager | mechanic    | architect | project-manager | analyst | videographer |

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. If the architect were in the sixth position instead, the mechanic would have to be in the second position, which would violate the condition that the mechanic is on the right of the analyst. So, the final solution is:

| Job   | manager | mechanic    | architect | project-manager | analyst | videographer |

Lv8-1x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the nigerian is on the left of the American, so we can place the Nigerian in the first or second position. Let's try placing the Nigerian in the first position.

   |  1   |   2    |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |

2. The American is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian, so the American can be in the first, second, or third position. If the American is in the first position, the Egyptian must be in the fourth position. However, this would mean the Italian is between the Polish and the American, which contradicts rule 3 (the Italian is between the Polish and the American). So, the American cannot be in the first position.

   If the American is in the second position, the Egyptian can be in the third or fourth position. If the Egyptian is in the third position, the Italian must be in the fifth position, and the Polish in the sixth position. This satisfies all the conditions.

   |  1   |   2    |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |

   If the Egyptian is in the fourth position, the Italian must be in the fifth position, and the Polish in the sixth position. However, this would mean the American is in the third position, which contradicts rule 3 (the Italian is between the Polish and the American). So, the Egyptian cannot be in the fourth position.

   Therefore, the American must be in the second position, the Egyptian in the third position, and the Italian in the fifth position.

3. The Polish is on the left of the Italian, so the Polish must be in the sixth position.

4. The Canadian is on the right of the Italian, so the Canadian must be in the fourth position.

5. The canadian is not to the left of the Canadian, which means the Canadian cannot be in the first, second, or third position. So, the Canadian is in the fifth position.
