Lv8-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 hobbies, movie-genres, nationalities, and means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 3 for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the roller is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. This means that the roller cannot be in columns 2 or 3. So, the roller is in column 1.

3. From rule 6, we know that the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the roller is in column 1, the chess player must be in column 2 or 3. But the roller cannot be in column 2, so the chess player must be in column 3.

4. From rule 2, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the chess player is in column 3, the romance movies must be in column 1 or 2. But the roller is in column 1, so the romance movies must be in column 2.

5. From rule 4, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller is in column 1, the gardening must be in column 3.

6. From rule 3, we know that the Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the American. Since the roller is the Indonesian and is in column 1, the American must be in column 2 or 3. But the gardening is in column 3, so the American must be in column 2.

7. From rule 5, we know that the Indonesian is driving the car. Since the Indonesian is in column 1, the car must be in column 2 or 3. But the American is in column 2, so the car must be in column 3.

8. From rule 8, we know that the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the left of the American. Since the American is in column 2, the scientific movies must be in column 1.

9. From rule 7, we know that the American is not to the right of the person driving the car. Since the car is in column 3, the American cannot be in column 3. So, the American is in column 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | Gardening  | Chess    | Collecting |

| Nationality   | Indonesian | American  |           |
| Transport     | Car       | Roller   | Ship      |

The person watching animation is not specified, so it can be in any column.

Final solution table:

Lv8-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and we have 6 constraints, we can deduce one position for each variable. Let's start with Food (Column 1).

   - From constraint 6, we know that the person eating mango is the person driving the airplane. So, we can place the mango in the cell where the airplane is.

2. Now let's place the airplane (Column 4). Since the person eating mango is the person driving the airplane, we know that mango must be in the 3rd row (Column 1, Row 3). So, we place the airplane in the 3rd column (Column 4, Row 3).

3. Now we have two empty cells in Column 1 (Food) and one in Column 4 (Transport). Since there are only 3 types of food and 3 types of transport, we can deduce the remaining Food and Transport positions.

   - For Food, since we know that the person eating mango is in the 3rd row, the person eating cabbage must be in the 1st row and the person eating orange must be in the 2nd row. So, we place cabbage in the 1st row (Column 1, Row 1) and orange in the 2nd row (Column 1, Row 2).

   - For Transport, since the person driving the bus is to the right of the person driving the airplane (which we know is in the 3rd column), the bus must be in the 4th column. Since the person driving the bus is not to the left of the fan of reggae (which we will place later), the bus cannot be in the 1st column. So, we place the bus in the 2nd column (Column 4, Row 1). Since the person driving the scooter is not the person driving the airplane (which we know is the person eating mango), the scooter must be in the remaining cell. So, we place the scooter in the 1st column (Column 4, Row 2).

4. Now let's place the Music-Genre (Column 2).

   - From constraint 2, we know that the fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul. Since the person eating cabbage is in the 1st row and the person eating orange is in the 2nd row, the fan of d&b must be in the 2nd row. Since the fan of soul cannot be in the 1st row (because the fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul), the fan of soul must be in the 3rd row. So, we place d&b in the 2nd row (Column 2, Row 2) and soul in the 3rd row (Column 2, Row 3).

   - From constraint 3, we know that the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane. Since the person driving the airplane is in the 3rd column, the person driving the bus can be in either the 1st or 4th column. However, since the brazilian is to the right of the person driving the bus (from constraint 1), the person driving the bus cannot be in the 1st column. So, we place the bus in the 4th column (Column 2, Row 1).

5. Now let's place the Nationality (Column 3).

   - From constraint 1, we know that the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus. Since the bus is in the 4th column, the brazilian can be in the 2nd or 3rd column. However, since the person eating mango is the person driving the airplane (which we know is in the 3rd column), the brazilian cannot be in the 3rd column. So, we place the brazilian in the 2nd column (Column 3, Row 1).

   - From constraint 5, we know that the person eating mango is the person driving the airplane (which we know is the brazilian), and the person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the russian. Since the brazilian is in the 2nd column, the russian must be in the 3rd column. So, we place the russian in the 3rd column (Column 3, Row 3).

6. Finally, we have no more constraints left. So, the final solution table is:

   ```
   |               |    1    |     2     |    3    |
   | Food          | Cabbage |   d&b    |   Mango |
   | Music-Genre   |   Soul  |   Reggae |   None  |
   | Nationality   | Brazil  |   Russian|    Thai |
   | Transport     |   Bus   |   Scooter| Airplane|
   ```
   We can see that the brazilian is indeed somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus, the fan of d&b is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of soul, the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane, the person driving the airplane is not to the left of the fan of reggae, the person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the russian, and the person eating mango is the person driving the airplane. So, the solution is correct.

   However, we don't have enough information to determine the fan of reggae's nationality or the exact position of the reggae music-genre. So, we can't fill in those cells with certainty.

Lv8-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the German is in the middle, we can place the German in the third column (column 3).

2. Let's assume the fan of d&b is in the first column (column 1). This means the fan of salsa must be in the second column (column 2) due to condition 7.

3. Now, the nationalities are fixed: German (column 3), Pakistani (column 2), and the nationality in column 1 is unknown. Since the Pakistani is not to the left of the fan of salsa, the nationality in column 1 cannot be Pakistani. So, it must be either German or Polish.

4. If the nationality in column 1 is German, it would violate condition 1 (German is in the middle). So, the nationality in column 1 must be Polish.

5. Now, let's place the sports. Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and the person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse, we can place lacrosse in column 1, rugby in column 2, and the sport in column 3 is yet to be determined.

6. The person driving the roller is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b (condition 5). Since the fan of d&b is in column 1, the person driving the roller can only be in column 2 or 3. However, if it were in column 3, it would violate condition 1 (German is in the middle). So, the person driving the roller must be in column 2.

7. The only sport left is water-polo, which must be in column 3.

8. Finally, the means of transport. Since the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the fan of d&b (condition 3), it can only be in column 1 or 2. However, if it were in column 1, it would violate condition 6 (lacrosse is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski). So, the person driving the jet-ski must be in column 2. The only transport left is jet-ski for column 1, roller for column 2, and snowmobile for column 3.

The final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   | d&b      |   salsa    |            |
| Nationality   | Polish   |   Pakistani | German     |
| Sport         | lacrosse |   rugby    | water-polo |
| Transport     | jet-ski  |   roller   | snowmobile |

Lv8-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Let's place the documentary movie watcher in the first column (1) and the romance movie watcher in the second column (2).

2. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person watching romance movies, so the family movie watcher must be in the third column (3).

3. The fisherman is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarder is to the right of the romance movie watcher (2), the fisherman must be in the first column (1).

4. The freelancer is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies (1). This means the freelancer can only be in the second or third column (2 or 3).

5. The writer is the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is in the third column (3), the writer must be there as well.

6. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding (2). Since the snowboarder is to the right of the romance movie watcher (2), the bird owner must be in the first column (1).

7. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the writer (3). Since the writer is in the third column (3), ice-hockey must be in the first row (1).

8. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person watching romance movies (2). This means the ice-hockey player cannot be in the first column (1). So, the sport must be in the second row (2).

9. The fisherman is on the left or right of the freelancer. Since the fisherman is in the first column (1) and the freelancer is in the second or third column (2 or 3), the fisherman can be in any column. However, since the sport of ice-hockey (2) is to the right of the romance movie watcher (2), the fisherman cannot be in the second column (2). So, the fisherman must be in the third column (3).

Now, let's place the jobs, movie-genres, pets, and sports in the table:

Lv8-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions are odd for 7up and odd numbers can't be consecutive, 7up can't be in positions 1, 3, or both 2 and 3. So, 7up can only be in position 2 or 3.

2. The person drinking sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking can't be in position 1 (because of rule 4), and it can't be in position 3 (because of rule 6), woodworking must be in position 2. This means sprite must be in position 3.

3. The person eating potato is between the fan of indie and the person eating banana. Since indie can't be in position 1 (because of rule 7), and it can't be in position 3 (because of rule 6), indie must be in position 2. This means banana must be in position 1 and potato must be in position 3.

4. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position. Since we already placed 7up in position 2, it must be in position 3.

5. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Since camping can't be in position 1 (because of rule 5), it must be in position 2.

6. The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since r&b can't be in position 1 (because of rule 7), it must be in position 2. This means electronic must be in position 3.

7. Now we have all the positions filled, but we have a contradiction: the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (position 2), but the person drinking sprite is in position 3. This means the puzzle has no solution with the given conditions.

However, if we relax the condition that the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, the puzzle can be solved:

Lv8-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the designer is Canadian (clue 5), we can place the Canadian in the first column (Column 1). Let's put the designer in the first row (Row 1).

2. Since the designer is to the left of the owner of the goldfish (clue 2), the goldfish owner cannot be in the first row. So, the goldfish owner must be in either Row 2 or Row 3.

3. Since the person drinking coffee is to the right of the person drinking juice (clue 5), the juice cannot be in the first column. So, the juice must be in either Column 2 or Column 3.

4. Since the indonesian is not to the left of the goldfish owner (clue 8), the indonesian cannot be in Row 1 or Row 2 (as the goldfish owner is in either Row 2 or Row 3). So, the indonesian must be in Row 3.

5. Since the indonesian is on the left of the owner of the hamster (clue 6), the hamster owner must be in Column 3.

6. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the owner of the hamster (clue 7), the lemonade must be in Column 3.

7. Now we have the following arrangement:

   | Pet           |            |          | turtle   |

   We know the designer is in Row 1, so the job of the person in Row 1 is designer. The job of the person in Row 2 must be dressmaker (as the dressmaker is to the left of the musician, and the designer is in Row 1). The job of the person in Row 3 must be musician.

8. The only beverage left is juice, so it must be in Column 2.

9. Now we have the following arrangement:

2. From rule 2, the person driving the car is to the left of the fan of reggae. Since the person eating peach cannot be to the right of the person eating orange (rule 3), the car must be in the first column. So, we fill the second row:

3. Now, the fan of reggae must be in the third column because the person driving the car is to the left of the fan of reggae (rule 2) and the person eating peach is in the first column (step 1). So, we fill the second row:

4. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the fan of reggae. So, the hobby of the person in the second column must be singing. We fill the second row:

2. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person who's sport is rowing and the accountant. Since the corn eater can't be in the first column, the rower must be in the first column (1). The card-gamer can't be in the third column (3) because the paramedic can't be to the left of the person eating papaya, and the only way to place the paramedic in the second column (2) is if the card-gamer is in the third column (3). So, the card-gamer goes in the third column (3), and the accountant goes in the second column (2).

4. The person driving the bike is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the person driving the tram. Since B is already placed between C and the third spot, and the tram (T) cannot be in the first two spots, T must be in the third spot.

5. The person driving the bike is the person who's sport is cycling. Since B and C are already placed in the same row, we can conclude that the sport of cycling (C) is in the second spot.

6. The person watching horror movies (H) is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since H and C are already placed, H must be in the first column.

7. The person driving the car (not placed yet) is the person watching horror movies. Since H is already placed in the first column, the car owner (H) must be in the first row.

9. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish (G). Since S and G are already placed, S cannot be in the third column. Since S is already placed in the second row, G must be in the third row.

10. The only remaining spot is for the ferret owner (F). Since F cannot be to the right of S, F must be in the first column. But F is already placed in the first column, so we have a contradiction. There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions."	{'movie-genre': ['h', 'c', 'w'], 'pet': ['c', 'f', 'g'], 'sport': ['b', 'c', 's'], 'transport': ['h', 'c', 't']}	True	0	False
Lv8-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person playing water-polo is on the far right, so we can place it in the rightmost column of the Sport row.

2. Since the Turkish is on the left or right of the person eating spinach, and the person playing water-polo is on the right, the Turkish cannot be in the rightmost column. So, the Turkish must be in the first or second column.

3. The person driving the taxi is not the person eating garlic, so the garlic cannot be in the third column.

4. The person driving the trike is the person eating garlic, so garlic goes in the third column.

5. The person driving the airplane is to the right of the person playing tennis. Since the water-polo player is on the right, the tennis player must be in the first or second column.

6. The person playing tennis is between the person driving the trike (garlic) and the person playing water-polo. So, the tennis player must be in the second column.

7. The Canadian is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is not in the rightmost column, the Canadian must be in the second or third column.

8. The Canadian is not to the right of the person playing tennis, so the Canadian must be in the first column.

9. The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the person playing cricket. Since the cricket player is not determined yet, we can't place the airplane yet.

Now, let's place the nationalities:
- The Canadian is in the first column, so the nationality in the first column is Canadian.
- The Turkish is not in the first column, so it must be in the second column. The nationality in the second column is Turkish.
- The nationality in the third column is not determined yet.

Now, let's place the sports:
- The tennis player is in the second column, so the sport in the second row is tennis.
- The water-polo player is in the third row, so the sport in the third row is water-polo.
- The sport in the first row is not determined yet.

Now, let's place the foods:
- The garlic is in the third column, so the food in the third row is garlic.
- The spinach cannot be in the third column because the Turkish is on the left or right of the person eating spinach, and the Turkish is in the second column. So, the spinach must be in the first column. The food in the first row is spinach.
- The food in the second row is not determined yet.

Now, let's place the transports:
- The person driving the trike is eating garlic, so the transport in the third row is trike.
- The person driving the taxi is not eating garlic, so the transport in the second row cannot be taxi.
- The person driving the airplane is to the right of the person playing tennis, and the tennis player is in the second column. The only available column to the right of the tennis player is the third column. So, the transport in the first row is airplane.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     Spinach    |     Turkish     |      Garlic      |
| Food          |         spinach |         Turkish   |         garlic    |
| Nationality   |         canadian |         dutch     |         canadian   |
| Sport         |         tennis   |         cricket   |         water-polo  |
| Transport     |         airplane |         taxi      |         trike       |
