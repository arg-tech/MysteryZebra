Lv8-2x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food (onion, orange) and two types of transport (airplane, scooter).

2. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the scooter. This means that the seating arrangement could be either:
   - Airplane (1) -> Scooter (2) or
   - Scooter (1) -> Airplane (2)

3. The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. This means that the person eating onion cannot be seated to the right of the scooter driver in both possible seating arrangements.

4. Let's consider the first seating arrangement (Airplane (1) -> Scooter (2)). If the person eating onion is on the left of the scooter driver, then the person eating orange must be on the right of the airplane driver. But this would mean that the onion eater is to the right of the scooter driver, which contradicts the given condition. So, the first seating arrangement is not possible.

5. Now, let's consider the second seating arrangement (Scooter (1) -> Airplane (2)). If the person eating onion is on the left of the airplane driver, then the person eating orange must be on the right of the scooter driver. This satisfies the given condition that the onion eater is not to the right of the scooter driver.

6. So, the final solution table is:

   |             |    1    |    2     |
   | Food        | Onion   | Orange   |
   | Transport   | Scooter | Airplane |

Lv8-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different sports (cycling and lacrosse) and two different beverages (juice and soy-milk).

2. From the first condition, the person who does cycling is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This means that if we place the cyclist in the right column, the soy-milk drinker must be in the left column. So, let's place the soy-milk in the left column.

3. Now, the second condition states that the person who does cycling is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the soy-milk drinker is already in the left column, the cyclist must be in the right column.

4. The last remaining sport and beverage are lacrosse and juice. Since we have already placed the cyclist in the right column, we must place the lacrosse player in the left column.

5. Finally, we place juice in the left column since it's the last unplaced beverage.

The final solution table is:

  |            |    1     |    2    |
  |-----------|---------|--------|
  | Beverage   | soy-milk | juice  |

Lv8-2x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different types of food (cabbage and peach) and two different music-genres (pop and r&b).

2. From the first condition, the person eating cabbage cannot be to the left of the fan of r&b. This means the person eating cabbage must be in the right column.

3. From the second condition, the person eating peach is on the left of the fan of r&b. This means the person eating peach must be in the left column.

4. Since we know the position of both types of food now, we can fill in the music-genre preferences: the person eating cabbage (in the right column) prefers pop, and the person eating peach (in the left column) prefers r&b.

The final solution table is:

|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          | Peach | Cabbage |
| Music-Genre   | R&B   | Pop    |

Lv8-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different types of food (lime, potato) and two different pets (dog, fish).

2. From the first condition, we can deduce that the person who owns the dog cannot be eating lime because if they were, the person to their right would have to eat lime as well, which would mean there are two people eating lime, contradicting the fact that there are only two different types of food. So, the person owning the dog must be eating potato.

3. Now, since the person eating lime cannot be to the right of the person owning the dog (from the first condition), the only remaining position for the person eating lime is the leftmost position.

4. Therefore, the final solution table would look like this:

   |        |   1    |  2   |
   | Food   | Lime   | Potato|
   | Pet    | Fish  | Dog  |

So, the final solution is:

Lv8-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the people prefer 2 different types of sports (ice-hockey and soccer), we can write them in the first column as follows:

   |             |     1      |     2      |
   | Sport       | Ice-Hockey | Soccer    |

2. Since the people use 2 different means of transport (helicopter and snowmobile), we can write them in the second column:

   |             |     1      |     2      |
   | Sport       | Ice-Hockey | Soccer    |
   | Transport   | Helicopter | Snowmobile|

3. Now let's apply the first rule: ""The person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter##8"". Since the names are already in order, this rule doesn't provide any new information.

4. Now let's apply the second rule: ""the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile##5"". This means the person playing soccer cannot be in the second row (Soccer) because the snowmobile is in the second column. So, the person playing soccer must be in the first row (Ice-Hockey).

5. Now we have the sport and transport for one person:

   |             |     1      |     2      |
   | Sport       | Ice-Hockey | Soccer    |
   | Transport   | Helicopter | Snowmobile|

   But we know that the person playing soccer is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile, so the person playing soccer should be in the first column and the person driving the snowmobile should be in the second column. However, this would mean that the person playing soccer is driving the helicopter, which contradicts the fact that people prefer different sports.

6. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction in the given rules, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.

Final solution table:

#############
|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       | Ice-Hockey | Soccer    |

Lv8-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different sports (baseball and volleyball) and two different beverages (fanta and soy-milk).

2. The person who drinks fanta is to the right of the person who plays baseball.

3. The person who plays volleyball is not to the right of the person who plays baseball.

4. From point 2, we can deduce that the person who drinks fanta cannot be the one playing baseball, because if they were, the person playing baseball would have to be on the left, and there would be no room for the person playing volleyball. So, the person playing baseball must be drinking soy-milk.

5. Now, the person playing volleyball must be on the left, because the person playing baseball is on the right. Since the person playing baseball is drinking soy-milk, the person playing volleyball must be drinking fanta.

6. Finally, we can place the sports and beverages in the table:

   |            |     1      |    2     |
   |-----------|-----------|---------|
   | Beverage  | fanta     | soy-milk |

Lv8-2x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two types of food and two hobbies, we can create a 2x2 table with four cells.

   |         |     1     |      2      |
   | Food    |           |             |
   | Hobby   |           |             |

2. From the first rule, the person eating pomegranate is to the right of the gardener. This means that the person eating pomegranate must be in the second column (column 2) and the gardener must be in the first column (column 1). So, we can fill the first row as follows:

   |         |     1     |      2      |
   | Food    | Pomegranate | Papaya |
   | Hobby   | Gardener   | Chess |

3. From the second rule, the person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate. This means that the person eating pomegranate must be in the first cell of the second row (row 2, column 1). So, we can fill the second row as follows:

   |         |     1     |      2      |
   | Food    | Pomegranate | Papaya |
   | Hobby   | Gardener   | Chess |

4. Now we have filled both the food and hobby for both people. The final solution table is:

Lv8-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs (librarian and videographer) and two means of transport (helicopter and scooter).

2. The videographer is on the far left, so the first row and first column must contain ""videographer"" and ""scooter"". Let's fill that in:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer|          |
   | Transport   | scooter     |          |

3. Now, the librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. This means the librarian cannot be in the second column (since the videographer is in the first column). So, the librarian must be in the first column:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer| librarian |
   | Transport   | scooter     |          |

4. Since there are only two means of transport, the person driving the helicopter must be in the second row:

   | Job         |      1       |     2     |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | Job         | videographer| librarian |
   | Transport   | scooter     | helicopter|

5. Now we have filled all the jobs and transport, so the final solution is:

Lv8-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different movie genres (thriller and zombie) and two different nationalities (American and Mexican).

2. From rule 1, the person watching zombie movies cannot be to the left of the Mexican. This means the nationality of the person watching the thriller movie must be Mexican, and the nationality of the person watching the zombie movie must be American.

3. From rule 2, the American is somewhere to the left of the person watching the zombie movie. Since the Mexican is already to the left of the person watching the zombie movie, the American must be to the left of the Mexican.

4. Now we can fill in the table:

   |               |    1     |    2    |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |         |
   | Nationality   | Mexican | American |

5. To determine the movie genres, we know the American is watching the zombie movie, so the Mexican must be watching the thriller movie.

6. Finally, we can fill in the movie genres:

Lv8-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different nationalities (Argentine and Pakistani) and two different sports (Surfing and Tennis).

2. From the first condition, the person who prefers Surfing is not to the left of the Pakistani. This means that if we were to arrange them in a row, the Pakistani cannot be on the left side, and the Surfer cannot be on the right side.

3. The second condition states that the Pakistani is on the far right. Since the Surfer cannot be on the right side, the Pakistani must be on the left side, which contradicts the first condition.

4. To resolve this contradiction, we can assume that the table is not a horizontal arrangement but a vertical one. In this case, the first row represents the nationality, and the second row represents the sport.

5. Now, let's arrange the data:

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Nationality   | Pakistani | Argentine |
   | Sport         | Tennis   | Surfing  |

6. To make sure the Pakistani is on the far right in the vertical arrangement, we place Pakistani in the second column and Tennis in the first row. The Surfer must be to the left of the Pakistani, so Surfing goes in the first column and the second row.

So, the final solution table is:
