Lv8-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 6, the person watching disaster movies is in an odd position. Since there are 7 positions, the positions are 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, from point 4, the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person watching documentary movies, which means it can't be in position 7. So, the possible positions for disaster movies are 1, 3, or 5.

2. From point 10, the person watching animation movies is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since disaster movies can't be in position 7, animation movies can't be in position 6 either. So, the possible positions for animation movies are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

3. From point 5, the person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the person watching spy movies. Since spy movies can't be in position 1 (as it would violate point 10), the possible positions for spy movies are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. From point 8, the person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching zombie movies. Since zombie movies can't be in position 1, spy movies can't be in position 2 either. So, the possible positions for spy movies are 3, 4, 5, or 6.

5. From point 7, the person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since epic movies can't be in position 1 (as it would violate point 9), the possible positions for epic movies are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

6. From point 2, the person watching epic movies is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since spy movies can't be in position 1, and martial-arts movies can't be in position 7, the possible positions for martial-arts movies are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

7. From point 3, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person watching animation movies. Since disaster movies can't be in position 7, and spy movies can't be in position 1, the possible positions for animation movies are 2, 3, or 4.

8. From point 4, the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since disaster movies can't be in position 7, and they can't be in position 1, the possible positions for documentary movies are 2, 3, or 4.

9. From point 9, the person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person watching epic movies. Since epic movies can't be in position 1, the possible positions for documentary movies are 2 or 3.

10. From point 8, the person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching zombie movies. Since martial-arts movies can't be in position 7, and zombie movies can't be in position 1, the possible positions for zombie movies are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Now, let's combine the possible positions for each movie genre:
- Animation: 2, 3, or 4
- Disaster: 1, 3, or 5
- Documentary: 2 or 3
- Epic: 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
- Martial-arts: 2, 3, 4, or 5
- Spy: 3, 4, 5, or 6
- Zombie: 2, 3, 4, 5

From the intersection of these possible positions, we can see that the only possible combination is:
- Animation: 3
- Disaster: 3
- Documentary: 2
- Epic: 6
- Martial-arts: 2
- Spy: 4
- Zombie: 5

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is swimming is the person who's sport is swimming, we know that the sport in the 1st column is swimming.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since we already know the position of swimming, let's place skateboarding in the 2nd column.

3. The person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know the position of swimming and skateboarding, let's place lacrosse in the 4th column (even position).

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position. This confirms our placement of lacrosse in the 4th column.

5. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since we know the position of swimming and lacrosse, let's place water-polo in the 6th column (odd position).

6. The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know the position of skiing should be to the left of lacrosse, it must be in the 3rd column.

7. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we know the position of climbing should be to the left of snowboarding, it must be in the 7th column.

8. The person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. This confirms our placement of snowboarding in the 5th column.

9. The person who's sport is water-polo is in an even position. This confirms our placement of water-polo in the 6th column.

10. Now we have filled all the positions except for the 3rd column. Since skiing is in the 3rd column, the remaining sport must be skateboarding.

Final solution table:

Lv8-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the position of the filmmaking hobby is not to the left of reading (Rule 1), it must be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 7. But since it's not in position 1 (Rule 8), it can't be in position 2. Also, it can't be in position 4 because the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of puzzles (Rule 10), and if filmmaking were in position 4, reading would have to be in position 3, which is odd (Rule 8). So, filmmaking can only be in position 5 or 7.

2. The position of woodworking is in an even position (Rule 2), so it can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7 (odd positions). So, it must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 8. But since it's not to the right of chess (Rule 6), it can't be in position 6. Also, it can't be in position 8 because the position of drawing is between reading and dancing (Rule 7), and if woodworking were in position 8, drawing would have to be in position 7, which is odd (Rule 2). So, woodworking can only be in position 2, 4, or 6.

3. Since the position of reading is on the right of puzzles (Rule 10), reading can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. So, reading can only be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7. But since reading is not to the right of drawing (Rule 9), it can't be in position 7. Also, since reading is somewhere to the left of dancing (Rule 3), it can't be in position 6. So, reading can only be in position 2 or 4.

4. Since the position of puzzles is on the left or right of reading (Rule 4), and reading is in position 2 or 4, puzzles can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. But since the position of chess is in an odd position (Rule 8), chess can't be in position 2. So, puzzles can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

5. Since the position of drawing is between reading and dancing (Rule 7), and reading is in position 2 or 4, drawing can't be in position 1 or 7. So, drawing can only be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since drawing is not to the right of chess (Rule 9), it can't be in position 6. So, drawing can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

6. Since the position of dancing is somewhere to the right of reading (Rule 3), and reading is in position 2 or 4, dancing can't be in position 1. So, dancing can only be in positions 3, 5, 6, or 7. But since the position of woodworking is not to the right of chess (Rule 6), and woodworking can't be in position 6, dancing can't be in position 7. So, dancing can only be in positions 3, 5, or 6.

7. Since the position of chess is in an odd position (Rule 8), and it's not to the right of drawing (Rule 9), chess can only be in position 1 or 3. But since the position of puzzles is on the left or right of reading (Rule 4), and reading is in position 2, puzzles can't be in position 1. So, chess must be in position 3.

8. Now we know that chess is in position 3, reading is in position 2, and puzzles are to the left of reading. So, puzzles must be in position 1.

9. Since drawing is between reading and dancing (Rule 7), and reading is in position 2 and puzzles are in position 1, drawing must be in position 4.

10. Since woodworking is not to the right of chess (Rule 6), and chess is in position 3, woodworking can only be in position 2.

11. Since dancing is somewhere to the right of reading (Rule 3), and reading is in position 2 and puzzles are in position 1, dancing must be in position 6.

12. Finally, since the position of filmmaking is on the left or right of reading (Rule 3), and reading is in position 2, filmmaking must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that 7up is between Cola and Coffee. Let's place them in that order: [Cola, 7up, Coffee]
2. Coffee is on the left of Milk, so we can place Coffee and move Milk to the right: [Cola, 7up, Coffee, ___, Milk]
3. Milk is to the right of Coffee, so we know that Coffee is in position 3: [Cola, 7up, Coffee, Milk, _]
4. Juice is between Soy-Milk and Coffee. Since Coffee is in position 3, Soy-Milk must be to the right of Juice: [Cola, 7up, Coffee, Milk, Juice, Soy-Milk]
5. Soy-Milk is between Juice and Fanta. Since Juice is in position 4, Soy-Milk must be to the right of Juice and to the left of Fanta: [Cola, 7up, Coffee, Milk, Juice, Soy-Milk, Fanta]
6. Fanta is between 7up and Soy-Milk. Since 7up is in position 1 and Soy-Milk is in position 5, Fanta must be in position 2: [Cola, Fanta, 7up, Coffee, Milk, Soy-Milk]
7. Fanta is not to the left of Soy-Milk, so Soy-Milk is in position 5 and Fanta is in position 6: [Cola, Fanta, 7up, Coffee, Soy-Milk, Fanta, Milk]
8. Fanta is on the right of 7up, so 7up is in position 1 and Fanta is in position 2: [Cola, Fanta, 7up, Coffee, Soy-Milk]
9. Now we have only 4 positions left for Cola, Coffee, Soy-Milk, and Milk. Since Coffee is in position 3, it can't be in the last position (Milk), so it must be in one of the first three positions. If it were in the first position, it would be to the left of Cola, which contradicts the fact that 7up is between Cola and Coffee. Therefore, Coffee must be in the second position: [Cola, Coffee, 7up, Soy-Milk]
10. Now we have only three positions left for Cola, 7up, and Soy-Milk. Since 7up is in position 2, it can't be in the last position (Soy-Milk), so it must be in one of the first two positions. If it were in the first position, it would be to the right of Cola, which contradicts the fact that it is between Cola and Coffee. Therefore, 7up must be in the last position: [Cola, Coffee, Soy-Milk, 7up]

The final solution table is:

```

| Beverage   | Cola | Coffee| Soy-Milk| 7up   |       |        |      |
```

Now we just need to fill in the remaining beverages:

11. Cola, Coffee, Soy-Milk, and 7up are already placed.
12. Milk is to the right of Coffee, so it can only be in position 6: [Cola, Coffee, Soy-Milk, 7up, Milk]
13. Fantas is on the right of 7up, so it can only be in position 7: [Cola, Coffee, Soy-Milk, 7up, Milk, Fanta]
14. Juice is between Soy-Milk and Coffee. Since Soy-Milk is in position 3 and Coffee is in position 2, Juice must be in position 4: [Cola, Coffee, Juice, Soy-Milk, 7up, Milk, Fanta]

The final solution table is:

```
|            |  1   |  2  |   3   |    4     |   5   |   6    |  7   |

2. From point 5, we know that the person watching family movies is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies. So, family movies can be in positions 1, 2, or 4. Let's try placing family movies in position 1 for now.
3. From point 6, we know that the person watching crime movies is to the right of the person watching family movies. So, crime movies can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Let's try placing crime movies in position 2 for now.
4. From point 8, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person watching crime movies. So, superhero movies can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's try placing superhero movies in position 1 for now.
5. From point 3, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is to the right of the person watching superhero movies. So, martial-arts movies can be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7. Let's try placing martial-arts movies in position 4 for now.
6. From point 9, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. So, our current placement of superhero movies in position 1 is correct.
7. From point 8, we know that the person watching superhero movies is also to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since superhero movies are already placed, mystery movies can be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7. Let's try placing mystery movies in position 2 for now.
8. From point 4, we know that the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. So, our current placement of mystery movies in position 2 is correct.
9. Now, we have no more constraints for the remaining positions. Let's place thriller movies in position 6 (to the right of crime movies as per point 2). The only remaining genre is family, which must be in position 5 (to the left of superhero movies as per point 1).

Lv8-1x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Italian is to the left of the Chinese, so we can place the Chinese in position 2 or higher. Let's try placing the Chinese in position 2 for now.

2. From rule 4, the Canadian is to the right of the Chinese, so the Canadian can only be in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

3. From rule 7, the Brazilian is to the right of the Canadian, so the Brazilian can only be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. If the Brazilian is in position 4, the Spanish must be in position 3 (rule 6). However, this violates rule 10 (the Spanish must be in an even position). So, the Brazilian cannot be in position 4.

4. Now, let's try placing the Brazilian in position 5. This means the Spanish must be in position 6. The Italian is to the left of the Brazilian (rule 1, 9), so the Italian can be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the Italian is in position 1, the Chinese must be in position 2 (rule 1), and the Canadian can be in position 3, 4, or 5. But if the Canadian is in position 3, the Brazilian cannot be in position 5 (rule 7), which contradicts our current placement. If the Canadian is in position 4 or 5, the Argentine must be in position 7 (rule 2), and the Polish can be in position 1 or 6 (rule 8). But if the Polish is in position 1, the Italian cannot be in position 3 (rule 8), which contradicts our current placement. So, the Italian cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the Italian must be in position 2 or 3.

5. If the Italian is in position 2, the Chinese must be in position 3, the Canadian can be in position 4, the Brazilian in position 5, the Spanish in position 6, the Argentine in position 7, and the Polish in position 1. This satisfies all the rules.

6. If the Italian is in position 3, the Chinese must be in position 4, the Canadian can be in position 5, the Brazilian in position 6, the Spanish in position 7, the Argentine in position 2, and the Polish in position 1. This also satisfies all the rules.

So, both placements are possible. Here are the two solutions:

Lv8-1x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the Indian cannot be in position 1, so it must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the Argentine is to the right of the Indian (rule 5), the Argentine cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the Argentine must be in position 4 or 5.

2. From rule 2, the British cannot be in position 5 because the Colombian is to the left of the British (rule 7). So, the British must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the Colombian is to the left of the British (rule 7), the Colombian cannot be in position 6, 7, or 8. So, the Colombian must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1 because the French is to the left of the Brazilian. So, the Brazilian must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Since the Argentine is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 3), the Argentine cannot be in position 2, 3, or 8. So, the Argentine must be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7.

4. From rule 4, the Colombian cannot be to the right of the Indian (rule 4). So, the Colombian cannot be in position 5. Since the Colombian is to the left of the British (rule 7), the Colombian cannot be in position 4. So, the Colombian must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 6.

5. From rule 5, the American cannot be in position 1 because the Brazilian is to the right of the American. So, the American must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Since the American is between the Brazilian and the Argentine (rule 8), the American cannot be in position 4 or 6. So, the American must be in position 2, 3, 5, or 7.

6. From rule 6, the Colombian is to the left of the Brazilian. Since the Colombian cannot be in position 5 (from rule 5), the Colombian must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we already know that the Colombian cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

7. From rule 9, the French can be in any position except 1 and 8 because the French is not to the left or right of the Brazilian. So, the French can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. Since the Argentine is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 3), the Argentine cannot be in position 2. So, the Argentine must be in position 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. But we already know that the Argentine cannot be in position 5 (from rule 6), so it must be in position 4, 6, 7, or 8.

8. From rule 10, the American cannot be to the left of the British. Since the British cannot be in position 5 (from rule 4), the British cannot be in position 6 or 7 because the American is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 5). So, the British must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. But we already know that the Colombian is to the left of the British (rule 7), so the British cannot be in position 1. So, the British must be in position 2, 3, or 4.

9. Now we have the British in position 2, the Colombian in position 1, and the Argentine in position 4. From rule 3, the Brazilian cannot be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the Brazilian must be in position 3, 6, 7, or 8. But we already know that the Argentine is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 3), so the Brazilian cannot be in position 8. So, the Brazilian must be in position 3, 6, or 7.

10. From rule 9, the French can be in any position except 1 and 8. But we already know that the Brazilian is in position 3, so the French cannot be in position 3. So, the French must be in position 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. But we already know that the British is in position 2, so the French cannot be in position 2. So, the French must be in position 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. But we already know that the Argentine is in position 4, so the French cannot be in position 4. So, the French must be in position 5, 6, 7, or 8.

11. Since the French cannot be in position 5 (from rule 6), the French must be in position 6, 7, or 8. But we already know that the Argentine is in position 4, so the French cannot be in position 8. So, the French must be in position 6 or 7.

12. Since the American is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 5) and the Brazilian is in position 3, the American must be in position 5, 6, or 7. But we already know that the French is in position 6, so the American cannot be in position 6. So, the American must be in position 5 or 7.

Lv8-1x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nigerian is on the far left (position 1), the nationalities in positions 2-7 must be the other six nationalities.

2. From rule 4, the spanish cannot be in position 1 (leftmost), so it must be in one of the positions 2-7.

3. From rule 1, the french is not to the left of the spanish, so the spanish cannot be in position 2 (as it would leave position 1 for the nigerian and position 2 for the spanish, violating rule 1). So, the spanish must be in positions 3-7.

4. From rule 2, the brazilian is to the left of the french. Since the spanish is not the french (as we determined in step 3), the brazilian cannot be in positions 3-7. So, the brazilian must be in positions 1 or 2.

5. If the brazilian is in position 1, then the french cannot be in position 2 (as it would violate rule 2), so the french must be in position 3. This leaves position 4 for the nigerian, position 5 for the british (as it is to the left of the chinese, according to rule 6), and positions 6-7 for the spanish and the remaining nationality (dutch or chinese). In this case, the dutch can be in position 6 (as it is between the french and the british, according to rule 8), and the chinese in position 7.

6. If the brazilian is in position 2, then the french cannot be in position 3 (as it would violate rule 1), so the french must be in position 4. This leaves position 5 for the nigerian, position 6 for the british (as it is to the left of the chinese, according to rule 6), and positions 1, 3, 7 for the spanish, dutch, and the remaining nationality (chinese). In this case, the spanish can be in position 1 (as it is not to the left of the nigerian, according to rule 3), the dutch in position 3 (as it is between the french and the british, according to rule 8), and the chinese in position 7.

So, both arrangements are possible:

Both solutions are valid, but the exact order within the groups (e.g., the order of the Spanish, Dutch, and Chinese) cannot be determined with the given information."	{'nationality': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'], 'brazilian': ['brazilian', '', 'spanish', 'french', 'nigerian', 'british', 'chinese'], 'british': ['', '', '', '', '', 'british', ''], 'spanish': ['', '', 'spanish', '', '', '', ''], 'french': ['', 'french', '', '', '', '', ''], 'nigerian': ['nigerian', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'dutch': ['', '', 'dutch', '', '', '', ''], 'chinese': ['', '', '', '', '', 'chinese', '']}	True	0	False
Lv8-1x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (#1), the chinchilla cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the chinchilla can be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.

2. The owner of the turtle is on the far right (#2), so the turtle must be in position 7.

3. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse (#3), so the horse cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. The horse can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

4. The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the horse (#4), so the rat cannot be in positions 5 or 6. The rat can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. The owner of the horse is in an even position (#5), so the horse can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

6. The owner of the lizard is not to the left of the owner of the frog (#6, #9), so the frog cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. The frog can be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.

7. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog (#7), so the hedgehog cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3 if the frog is in positions 4, 5, or 6. If the frog is in position 7, then the hedgehog can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

8. The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle (#8, #10), so the lizard cannot be in positions 6 or 7. The lizard can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

Now, let's combine these findings:

- The chinchilla is not in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The turtle is in position 7.
- The horse is in an even position (2, 4, or 6).
- The rat is not in positions 5 or 6.
- The frog is not in positions 1, 2, or 3 if the frog is not the owner of the position 7. If the frog is the owner of position 7, then the hedgehog can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
- The lizard is not in positions 6 or 7.

Since the horse is in an even position, let's check the possibilities for the horse:

- If the horse is in position 2, then the rat can be in position 1, the frog can be in position 4 or 5, and the lizard can be in position 3. The chinchilla can be in any of the remaining positions (4, 5, 6, or 7). The hedgehog can be on the left or right of the frog, so it can be in positions 3, 4, 5, or 6. This arrangement satisfies all conditions.

- If the horse is in position 4, then the rat can be in position 1, the frog can be in position 5 or 6, and the lizard can be in position 3. The chinchilla can be in any of the remaining positions (2, 3, 5, or 6). The hedgehog can be on the left or right of the frog, so it can be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6. This arrangement also satisfies all conditions.

- If the horse is in position 6, then the rat can be in position 1, the frog can be in position 5, and the lizard can be in position 3. The chinchilla can be in any of the remaining positions (2, 4, or 7). The hedgehog can be on the left or right of the frog, so it can be in positions 2, 4, or 7. This arrangement also satisfies all conditions.

So, there are three possible solutions:

Solution 1:
|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | rat | chinchilla | lizard | frog | hedgehog | horse | turtle |

Solution 2:
|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | rat | chinchilla | frog | lizard | hedgehog | horse | turtle |

Solution 3:
|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | rat | lizard | chinchilla | frog | hedgehog | horse | turtle |

The final solution table is:
#############
|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | rat | chinchilla | lizard | frog | hedgehog | horse | turtle |
#############

This solution satisfies all given conditions."	{'pet': ['rat', 'chinchilla', 'lizard', 'frog', 'hedgehog', 'horse', 'turtle']}	True	2	False
Lv8-1x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, we know that almond-milk is between iced-tea and lemonade. Since almond-milk can't be on the far right (rule 5), it must be to the left of iced-tea. So, the arrangement for iced-tea, almond-milk, and lemonade is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | ...`

2. From rule 9, we know that almond-milk is between lemonade and milk. Since almond-milk is already placed to the left of iced-tea, milk must be to the right of iced-tea. So, the arrangement for iced-tea, almond-milk, lemonade, and milk is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | milk | ...`

3. From rule 1, we know that milk is on the left or right of almond-milk. Since we already placed milk to the right of iced-tea, it must be on the right of almond-milk. So, the arrangement for iced-tea, almond-milk, lemonade, milk is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | milk | ...`

4. From rule 8, we know that almond-milk is to the right of mirinda. Since almond-milk is already placed, mirinda must be to the left of almond-milk. So, the arrangement for mirinda, almond-milk is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | milk | mirinda | ...`

5. From rule 10, we know that juice is on the left of mirinda. So, the arrangement for juice and mirinda is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | milk | mirinda | juice | ...`

6. From rule 3, we know that mirinda is to the left of lemonade. Since we already placed mirinda, lemonade must be to the right of mirinda. So, the arrangement for mirinda, lemonade is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | mirinda | lemonade | milk | juice | ...`

7. From rule 4, we know that hot-chocolate is on the right of mirinda. So, the arrangement for hot-chocolate and mirinda is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | mirinda | lemonade | milk | juice | hot-chocolate | ...`

8. From rule 6, we know that milk is not to the right of iced-tea. Since we already placed milk, iced-tea must be on the left of milk. So, the arrangement for iced-tea and milk is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | mirinda | lemonade | milk | juice | hot-chocolate | ...`

9. From rule 2, we know that lemonade is on the left or right of almond-milk. Since we already placed lemonade to the right of almond-milk, it can't be on the far right (rule 5). So, lemonade must be to the left of juice. So, the arrangement for almond-milk, lemonade, and juice is fixed: `######### | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | juice | ...`

10. From rule 11, we know that juice is not to the right of mirinda. Since we already placed juice to the left of mirinda, the arrangement for juice and mirinda is correct.

Now, we have placed all the beverages except for hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is on the right of mirinda, it can only be on the far right (rule 5). So, the final arrangement is:

`############# | iced-tea | almond-milk | lemonade | milk | mirinda | juice | hot-chocolate |`"	{}	False	0	False
