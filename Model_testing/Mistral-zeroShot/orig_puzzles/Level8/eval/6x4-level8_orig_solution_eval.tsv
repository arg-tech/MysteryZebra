Lv8-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From statement 12, we know that the electrician is watching disaster movies. Let's place the electrician in position 1 (since the electrician is the software-developer in statement 5, and we can't place the software-developer yet).

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

   | Job           | electrician|                    |             |              |

2. From statement 6, we know that the electrician is not the person who's hobby is collecting. So, the collector cannot be in position 1. Let's place the collector in position 4 (since the collector is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike in statement 13, and we can't place the person driving the motorbike yet).

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

3. From statement 8, we know that the fan of techno is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. So, the fan of techno cannot be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the fan of techno in position 3.

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

4. From statement 13, we know that the collector is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the fan of techno is in position 3 and the collector is in position 4, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

5. From statement 11, we know that the musician is not the person driving the motorbike. So, the musician cannot be in position 2. Let's place the musician in position 1 (since the musician is on the far left or far right in statement 22, and we can't place the pilot yet).

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

6. From statement 14, we know that the pilot is on the far left or far right. Since the musician is in position 1 and the electrician is in position 1, the pilot cannot be in position 1. Let's place the pilot in position 4 (since the pilot is on the left or right of the fan of classical in statement 18, and we can't place the fan of classical yet).

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

7. From statement 18, we know that the fan of classical is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in position 4, the fan of classical cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4. Let's place the fan of classical in position 3.

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

8. From statement 19, we know that the fan of ambient is not to the right of the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical is in position 3, the fan of ambient cannot be in position 4. Let's place the fan of ambient in position 2.

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

9. From statement 16, we know that the person eating pumpkin is the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the fan of martial-arts movies cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4 (as the musician, fan of ambient, and pilot are already placed), let's place the person eating pumpkin in position 3.

   |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

10. From statement 15, we know that the musician is not to the right of the person driving the train. Since the pilot is in position 4 and the person driving the train must be in an even position (statement 20), the person driving the train cannot be in position 2 or 4. Let's place the person driving the train in position 6.

    |               |     1      |         2          |      3      |      4       |

Lv8-6x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill the numbers 1 to 4 in the first column.

2. From rule 10, we know that the fan of disco is in the first row (since there's only one fan of disco). Let's put 'Disco' in the Music-Genre of the first row.

3. From rule 12, we know that the fan of indie is on the far left. Since the fan of disco is already in the first row, the fan of indie must be in the second row. Let's put 'Indie' in the Music-Genre of the second row.

4. From rule 15, we know that the Italian is in an even position. Since the first two positions are filled, the Italian must be in the third or fourth row. However, the Italian cannot be in the fourth row because the fan of indie is already there (rule 3). So, the Italian is in the third row. Let's put 'Italian' in the Nationality of the third row.

5. From rule 17, we know that the architect is on the left or right of the Polish (who is in the third row). Since the first two positions are filled, the architect must be in the fourth row. Let's put 'Architect' in the Job of the fourth row.

6. From rule 14, we know that the architect is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog (who is the Polish, in the third row). So, the frog must be in the first or second row. Since the first row is filled, the frog is in the second row. Let's put 'Frog' in the Pet of the second row.

7. From rule 16, we know that the person eating pineapple is between the person who's hobby is dancing and the musician. Since the musician is in the first row (Disco fan), the person eating pineapple cannot be in the first row. Also, the person eating pineapple cannot be in the fourth row because the architect is there (rule 5). So, the person eating pineapple is in the second or third row. Since the second row is filled, the person eating pineapple is in the third row. Let's put 'Pineapple' in the Food of the third row.

8. From rule 18, we know that the fan of salsa is not to the right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating pineapple is in the third row, the fan of salsa must be in the first or second row. However, the first row is filled, so the fan of salsa is in the second row. Let's put 'Salsa' in the Music-Genre of the second row.

9. From rule 19, we know that the social-worker is on the far left or far right. Since the first and fourth rows are filled, the social-worker is in the second or third row. However, the second row is filled, so the social-worker is in the third row. Let's put 'Social-Worker' in the Job of the third row.

10. From rule 13, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is the social-worker (in the third row). Let's put 'Fishing' in the Hobby of the third row.

11. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the lizard is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in the fourth row (rule 4), the owner of the lizard is not in the first three rows. So, the owner of the lizard is in the fourth row. Let's put 'Lizard' in the Pet of the fourth row.

12. From rule 16, we know that the person eating pineapple is between the person who's hobby is dancing and the musician. Since the musician is in the first row (Disco fan) and the person eating pineapple is in the third row, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in the second row. Let's put 'Dancing' in the Hobby of the second row.

13. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different types of food. Since we have already filled Cranberry, Orange, Pineapple, and Pumpkin in the first, second, third, and fourth rows respectively, the hobby of the person in the first row must be Cooking (since all other hobbies are already assigned). Let's put 'Cooking' in the Hobby of the first row.

14. From rule 18, we know that the fan of salsa is not to the right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco is in the first row and the fan of salsa is in the second row, the nationality of the person in the first row must be Colombian (since the Indian is in the second row, and the Polish and Italian are in the third row). Let's put 'Colombian' in the Nationality of the first row.

15. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different pets. Since we have already filled Bird, Frog, Lizard, and Rat in the first, second, third, and fourth rows respectively, the job of the person in the fourth row must be Nurse (since all other jobs are already assigned). Let's put 'Nurse' in the Job of the fourth row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-6x4-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and the values of each variable (hobby, job, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport) for each person.

Let's start by assigning variables to each person:

1. A: Australian
2. B: Bartender
3. C: Canadian
4. D: Canadian (since C is not to the left of B)
5. E: Dutch
6. F: Doctor
7. G: Gardener
8. H: Hobbyist (sudoku)
9. I: Hobbyist (traveling)
10. J: Hobbyist (drawing)
11. K: Hobbyist (gardening)
12. L: Musician
13. M: Fan of funk
14. N: Fan of jazz
15. O: Fan of pop
16. P: Fan of punk
17. Q: Owner of dog
18. R: Owner of frog
19: S: Owner of goat
20: T: Owner of hedgehog
21: U: Owner of pet (not dog, frog, or goat)
22: V: Parkour player
23: W: Rugby player
24: X: Soccer player
25: Y: Surfer

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions and values:

1. H is somewhere to the right of A (H > A)
2. E is not to the left of V (E > V)
3. F is not to the right of T (F < T)
4. H is not A (H ≠ A)
5. W is not to the left of B (W > B)
6. R is on the left or right of T (R ≈ T)
7. V is somewhere to the left of G (V < G)
8. E is not to the right of W (E < W)
9. O is a fan of pop (O = P)
10. F is not to the right of R (F < R)
11. Q is on the right of A (Q > A)
12. O is not to the right of E (O < E)
13. O is in an even position (O = D or K)
14. D is on the left of M (D < M)
15. L is not to the right of E (L < E)
16. C is not to the left of B (C > B)
17. A is on the left or right of V (A ≈ V)
18. H is on the left of O (H < O)
19. X is on the far left or far right (X = 1 or 4)
20. T is somewhere to the right of P (T > P)
21. H is on the right of M (H > M)
22. A is on the left of L (A < L)
23. P is the hobbyist I (P = I)
24. E is on the left of L (E < L)
25. R is on the left or right of V (R ≈ V)

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |     4     |
| Hobby         | I         | J          | K         | H         |
| Job           | B         | D          | C         | A         |
| Music-Genre   | M         | N          | O         | P         |
| Nationality   | A         | C          | D         | E         |
| Pet           | Q         | R          | S         | T         |
| Sport         | X         | W          | V         | Y         |

Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the remaining positions:

- Since O is in an even position (O = D or K), we know that D is the fan of jazz (N) and K is the gardener (G).
- Since H is on the right of M (H > M), we know that H is the hobbyist of sudoku (H = 3) and M is the hobbyist of drawing (J).
- Since T is somewhere to the right of P (T > P), we know that T is the owner of the hedgehog (T = 4).
- Since R is on the left or right of V (R ≈ V), we know that R is the owner of the frog (R = 2).
- Since Q is on the right of A (Q > A), we know that Q is the owner of the dog (Q = 3).
- Since S is not the owner of the dog, frog, or hedgehog (S ≠ Q, R, T), we know that S is the owner of the goat (S = 1).

Now we have the final solution table:

11. From rule 12, we know that the project-manager is in the position opposite to the freelancer. So, the project-manager is in the fourth position.

|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |        4        |

13. From rule 14, we know that the architect is not to the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in the fourth position, the architect cannot be in the fifth position. So, the architect must be in the second position.

|               |    1     |      2      |      3       |        4        |
