Lv8-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person with photography cannot be to the right of the person watching scientific movies. This means that the person watching scientific movies cannot be in the last column (column 3).

2. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. This means that the person with water-polo cannot be in the first column (column 1).

3. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we know the person with collecting is not in the first column, the person watching western movies cannot be in the first column either.

4. The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the person who's sport is golf. Since we know the person with water-polo is not in the first column, the person with soccer must be in the second column (column 2).

5. Now we know that the person with soccer is in the second column, the person with golf must be in the first column (column 1).

6. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since we know the person with water-polo is not in the first column, the person with photography must be in the third column (column 3).

7. Finally, the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we know the person with collecting is not in the first column and the person with photography is in the third column, the person watching western movies must be in the first column (column 1).

The final solution table is:

  |               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | Golf       | Soccer      | Photography |
| Movie-Genre   | Western    |             |             |
| Sport         |           | Water-polo  |             |

However, we still don't know the movie genre for the person watching western movies and the hobby for the person playing water-polo. We can only determine their relative positions.

To find out their exact positions, we would need more information or make assumptions. For example, if we assume that the person watching scientific movies prefers fantasy movies, we can deduce that the person watching western movies prefers scientific movies and the person playing water-polo prefers fantasy movies. But this is an assumption and not a definitive solution based on the given information."	{'hobby': ['golf', 'soccer', 'photography'], 'movie-genre': ['western', '', ''], 'sport': ['', 'water-polo', '']}	True	0	False
Lv8-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person playing tennis is in the middle (6), we can fill the middle row with tennis. Let's assume it's Tennis in the middle row.

2. From rule 7, the person eating orange is also in the middle. So, the middle column must contain Orange.

3. Now, we know that the person eating Orange is in the middle, so the left and right of Orange are not Orange. Since the photographer is on the left or right of the person eating Orange (2), the left and right of Orange cannot be the photographer. So, the left and right of Orange must be different sports. Let's assume the left is Basketball and the right is Ice-Hockey for now.

4. The photographer is on the left of the lawyer (4), so the lawyer cannot be in the middle (as the photographer is there). The lawyer must be either on the left or the right. Since the left is already occupied by Basketball, the lawyer must be on the right. So, the rightmost column is Lawyer.

5. Now, the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating Orange (5). Since the left is occupied by Basketball and the right is occupied by Lawyer, the freelancer must be on the right of Orange.

6. The person eating carrot is not to the right of the photographer (3), so the carrot cannot be in the rightmost column (as the photographer is there). The carrot must be either in the left or the middle. Since the middle is occupied by Orange, the carrot must be in the left column.

7. The only food left is watermelon, which must be in the middle row but not in the middle column (as it's occupied by Orange). So, the watermelon must be in the right column.

8. Since the person playing tennis is in the middle, the sports to the left and right must be different. The left is Basketball and the right is Ice-Hockey.

9. Finally, the job of the person playing tennis is not specified, so it can be any of the jobs. Let's assume the person playing tennis is a Freelancer.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    | Carrot      | Orange | Watermelon |
| Job     | Freelancer  | Lawyer | Photographer|
| Sport   | Basketball  | Tennis | Ice-Hockey |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."	{'food': ['carrot', 'orange', 'watermelon'], 'job': ['freelancer', 'lawyer', 'photographer'], 'sport': ['basketball', 'tennis', 'ice-hockey']}	True	5	False
Lv8-3x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the nationalities in the first column. Let's say:
   - Nationality 1: Colombian
   - Nationality 2: French
   - Nationality 3: Malaysian

2. From puzzle point 1, the Malaysian is somewhere between the firefighter and the French. Since the nationalities are in order, the only possible positions for the firefighter and the Malaysian are:
   - Firefighter: Nationality 2 (French)
   - Malaysian: Nationality 3 (Malaysian)
   - This leaves Nationality 1 (Colombian) for the remaining person.

3. From puzzle point 5, the person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since we know the nationalities, the beverages are:
   - Beverage 1: Cola (not yet placed)
   - Beverage 2: Iced-tea (not yet placed)
   - Beverage 3: Mirinda (Nationality 3, far right)

4. From puzzle point 2, the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we know the nationalities and the beverages for the far right and the middle, the only possible position for cola is:
   - Cola: Nationality 1 (Colombian)

5. From puzzle point 3, the person drinking cola is not to the left of the French. Since we know the nationalities and the beverage for the Colombian, the only possible position for iced-tea is:
   - Iced-tea: Nationality 2 (French)

6. From puzzle point 4, the firefighter is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since we know the nationalities and the beverages for the firefighter and the Colombian, the social-worker must be Nationality 1 (Colombian). But we already placed the Colombian with cola. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

However, if we assume that the puzzle is missing some information or there is a mistake, we can still fill in the table with the information we have:

  |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
  | Beverage      | Cola     | Iced-tea     | Mirinda     |
  | Job           |         |              |             |
  | Nationality   | Colombian| French       | Malaysian   |

The job information is still missing due to the inconsistency in the puzzle."	{}	False	0	False
Lv8-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the ship is the person watching musical movies (from condition 6). So, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2    |      3       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           |         |              |
   | Music-Genre   |                |         |              |
   | Transport     | Ship             |         |              |

2. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship (from condition 2). Since the ship is in position 1, we can place d&b in position 2:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2 (d&b)    |      3       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           | d&b          |              |

   | Transport     | Ship             | Subway/Quad-bike |              |

3. The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching musical movies (from condition 3). Since the ship is in position 1 and the subway can't be in position 3 (because the fan of d&b is in position 2), the subway must be in position 2:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2 (Subway)    |      3       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           | d&b/Quad-bike  |              |

   | Transport     | Ship             | Subway         |              |

4. The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies (from condition 4). Since the subway is in position 2, the fan of blues can't be in position 1 (because the ship is there). So, the fan of blues must be in position 3:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2 (Subway)    |      3 (Blues)   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           | d&b/Quad-bike  | Martial-arts   |

   | Transport     | Ship             | Subway         |              |

5. The fan of blues is in an even position (from condition 5). We've already placed the fan of blues in an even position (position 3).

6. Now, let's fill in the missing music-genre for positions 1 and 2. Since the fan of blues is in position 3, the fan of d&b must be in position 2:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2 (d&b)    |      3 (Blues)   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           | d&b          | Martial-arts   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues            |         |         Folk   |
   | Transport     | Ship             | Subway         |              |

7. The remaining music-genre is folk. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |   1 (Ship/Musical) |    2 (d&b)    |      3 (Blues)   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Musical           | d&b          | Martial-arts   |

   | Transport     | Ship             | Subway         |              |

8. We've filled in all the information according to the given conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv8-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Indian is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla, and the Pakistani is to the right of the person with the hobby of writing, we can place the Indian and Pakistani based on their nationalities. Let's assume the Indian is in the first column and the Pakistani is in the third column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |     3      |

   | Pet           |             |         |            |

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right. Since there are three pets and the Indian is already placed, the chinchilla cannot be in the first column. So, it must be in the third column.

   |               |      1      |    2    |     3      |

   | Pet           |             |         | Cat or Dog  |

3. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the Indian. Since the Indian is in the first column, the hobby of photography must be in the first column as well.

   |               | Photography|    2    | Chinchilla  |

4. The owner of the cat is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the dog. Since the hobby of photography is already placed in the first column, the cat cannot be in the first column. So, the cat must be in the second column, and the dog must be in the third column.

   |               | Photography| Fishing  | Chinchilla  |
   | Nationality   | Indian     |         | Pakistani   |
   | Pet           | Cat        | Dog     | Cat or Dog  |

5. The owner of the cat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the cat is already in the second column, the hobby of fishing must be in the first column.

   |               | Fishing    | Photography| Chinchilla  |
   | Nationality   | Indian     |           | Pakistani   |
   | Pet           | Cat        | Dog       | Cat or Dog  |

6. The only remaining hobby is writing. Since it cannot be on the far left (as the Indian is there), it must be in the second column.

   | Pet           | Cat        | Dog       | Cat or Dog  |

7. Now, the hobby of the person in the third column (Pakistani) is either fishing, writing, or photography. Since the hobby of photography is already taken, and the hobby of writing is also taken to the left of the Pakistani, the hobby of the Pakistani must be fishing.

1. We know that the Mexican is between the person driving the car and the person driving the ship. Let's assume the order is as follows: Ship - Mexican - Car.

2. The person driving the car is to the right of the person driving the ship. So, the order cannot be Ship - Mexican - Car. It must be Car - Mexican - Ship.

3. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the Canadian. Since the Mexican is to the right of the Canadian (from point 2), the person who swims cannot be the Mexican. So, the order must be Car - Canadian - Mexican - Ship.

4. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the Mexican is the one who swims, the person who climbs must be to the left of the Mexican. But we already know that the order is Car - Canadian - Mexican - Ship. So, the person who climbs must be the Canadian, and the person who swims must be the Mexican.

5. Now, we have the nationality of the person who climbs (Canadian) and the person who swims (Mexican). The only sport left is volleyball. So, the person who plays volleyball must be the one driving the car.

6. Finally, the person who drives the ship can only be the Australian, as the nationalities are Australian, Canadian, and Mexican, and we have already placed the Canadian and the Mexican.

Lv8-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows for each category (Food, Hobby, Job).

2. From rule 1, we know the photographer is not the last person, so we can place the photographer in the first or second position in the Job column. Let's place the photographer in the first position (Photographer).

3. From rule 2, we know the electrician is not the person eating apricot, and since we have already placed the photographer, the only remaining position for the electrician is the third position (Electrician).

4. Now, the person eating apricot must be in the second position (Apricot).

5. From rule 3, the person with the hobby of camping is not to the right of the person eating apricot. Since the person eating apricot is in the second position, the person with the hobby of camping must be in the first or third position. However, from rule 7, the person with the hobby of camping is on the right of the person with the hobby of video-games. Since we haven't placed the person with the hobby of video-games yet, the person with the hobby of camping must be in the third position (Camping).

6. Now, the person with the hobby of video-games must be in the second position (Video-games).

7. From rule 4, the person eating onion is not to the right of the person with the hobby of camping. Since the person with the hobby of camping is in the third position, the person eating onion must be in the first or second position. However, from rule 5, the person eating onion is to the right of the person with the hobby of cooking. Since we haven't placed the person with the hobby of cooking yet, the person eating onion must be in the second position (Onion).

8. Now, the person with the hobby of cooking must be in the first position (Cooking).

9. From rule 6, the person who's job is electrician is not to the right of the person with the hobby of video-games. Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in the second position, the person with the job of electrician must be in the first position (Electrician).

10. From rule 7, the person with the hobby of camping is on the right of the person with the hobby of video-games. Since the person with the hobby of video-games is in the second position, the person with the hobby of camping must be in the third position (Camping).

1. We know that the Dutch is to the left of the person who has camping as a hobby. Let's place the Dutch in the first column and the camper in the second or third column.

2. The camper is to the right of the Chinese, so the Chinese cannot be in the second column (as it would place the camper in the first column, violating rule 1). Therefore, the Chinese must be in the third column.

3. The gardener is not to the right of the person who has gardening as a hobby. This means the gardener cannot be in the first or third column (as it would place the gardener to the right of themselves). So, the gardener must be in the second column.

4. The camper is to the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the camper is in the second column, the lizard owner must be in the first or third column. But the lizard owner cannot be in the first column because the gardener is in that column (violating rule 3). So, the lizard owner must be in the third column.

5. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the pony and the person who has woodworking as a hobby. The only possible arrangement is: Pony - Lizard - Woodworking. This means the pony must be in the first column and the woodworker in the third column.

Lv8-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who cooks is to the left of the person eating cabbage, and there are only three people, the cook cannot be in the third column. So, the cook can only be in the first or second column.

2. The musician travels, so the traveler is the musician. This means the musician must be in the second column (since there are only three people and the cook can't be in the second column).

3. Now we know the musician is in the second column, so the hobby ""traveling"" is in the second row.

4. Since the musician is on the left of the police-officer, the police-officer must be in the third column. This means the job ""police-officer"" is in the third row.

5. The bartender is not to the right of the person eating spinach, so the bartender cannot be in the third column. Since the cook and the police-officer are already in the first and third columns, the bartender must be in the second column.

6. The bartender is on the left of the person eating plum, so the person eating plum must be in the third column. This means the food ""plum"" is in the third row.

7. Now we know the food ""plum"" is in the third row, and the ""police-officer"" is also in the third row. Since there are only three rows, the food ""cabbage"" must be in the first row, and the food ""spinach"" must be in the second row.

Lv8-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the almond-milk drinker is not the car driver, so let's place the car driver in the first position (1) and the almond-milk drinker in the second or third position (2 or 3).

2. The scooter driver is not to the right of the car driver, so the scooter driver must be in position 1 or 2. However, since the almond-milk drinker is not the car driver and is to the right of the cauliflower eater, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 3. So, the scooter driver is in position 1.

3. Now, the almond-milk drinker is in position 3, and the car driver is in position 1. The cauliflower eater must be to the left of the almond-milk drinker, so the cauliflower eater is in position 2.

4. The papaya eater is on the left or right of the ship driver. Since the radish eater is on the far right (position 3), the ship driver must be in position 1 or 2. But the ship driver can't be in position 1 because the scooter driver is there. So, the ship driver is in position 2.

5. The papaya eater can't be in position 1 because the ship driver is there, and the cauliflower eater is in position 2. So, the papaya eater must be in position 3.

6. Now, the only position left for the sprite drinker is position 1, and the only food left for the radish eater is position 3.

Final solution table:

| Beverage    | Almond-milk | Sprite   |
| Food        | Cauliflower | Papaya   |
| Transport   | Car         | Ship     |
|             |             | Scooter  |
|             |             |          |
|             |             | Radish   |

However, we are missing the position of the scooter and the food for the far right position. Since the scooter driver is in position 1, the scooter must be in position 4. The only food left for the far right position is radish, so the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage    | Almond-milk | Sprite   |
| Food        | Cauliflower | Papaya   |
| Transport   | Car         | Ship     |
|             |             | Scooter  |
| Food        |             |          |
|             |             | Radish   |
#############

To fill the missing food position, we can place it in position 5, but the puzzle doesn't provide enough information to determine which food it should be. So, the final solution table with an unknown food is:

#############
| Beverage    | Almond-milk | Sprite   |
| Food        | Cauliflower | Papaya   |
| Transport   | Car         | Ship     |
|             |             | Scooter  |
| Food        | Unknown     |          |
|             |             | Radish   |
