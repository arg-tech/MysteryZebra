Lv8-1x4-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know the nurse is either to the left or right of the dancer. Let's assume the nurse is on the left (N1). If the nurse were on the right (N4), the dancer would have to be in position 3 (D3), which would mean the dressmaker (DM) would have to be in position 1 (DM1), but that contradicts rule 3 (the dressmaker is not to the left of the entrepreneur).

2. Now, since the nurse is on the left (N1), the dancer must be to the right of the nurse (D2 or D4). If D2, then the entrepreneur (E) would have to be in position 1 (E1), which would mean the dressmaker (DM) would have to be in position 4 (DM4), but that contradicts rule 4 (the dressmaker is on the left of the nurse). So, D4 is the only option.

3. With D4, the entrepreneur (E) can be in any of the remaining positions (E2 or E3). If E2, then the dressmaker (DM) would have to be in position 1 (DM1), which is allowed by all rules. If E3, then the dressmaker (DM) would have to be in position 2 (DM2), which is also allowed by all rules.

4. Now that we have the positions for the nurse (N1), dancer (D4), entrepreneur (E3), and dressmaker (DM2), the only remaining job is for position 1. The only job left is the job of the tailor (T), so T1 is the final solution.

The final solution table is:

  |       |      1       |     2      |   3   |   4    |

Lv8-1x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. This means that 7up cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, it must be in position 5 (since there are only 5 positions).

2. Now we know that the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking milk. Since we already placed 7up (which is not mirinda), and we know that mirinda is to the right of 7up, the only possible positions for mirinda are 2, 3, or 4. If mirinda was in position 2, then lemonade would have to be in position 1, but we know that 7up is in position 5, so mirinda cannot be in position 2. If mirinda was in position 3, then lemonade would have to be in position 4, but that would mean milk is in position 1, which is not possible because 7up is in position 5. So, mirinda must be in position 4.

3. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since we placed mirinda in position 4, lemonade must be in position 3.

4. The person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since we placed mirinda in position 4, milk can only be in position 2.

5. Now we know the positions of 7up, mirinda, lemonade, and milk. The only remaining position is 1. Since all other beverages are placed, the person drinking the remaining beverage, which is 7up, must be in position 1.

The final solution table is:

  |            |  1  |  2   |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage   | 7up | milk | lemonade| mirinda |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|            |  1  |  2   |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage   | 7up | milk | lemonade| mirinda |

Lv8-1x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the person eating grapes is not to the left of the person eating peach. This means that grapes cannot be in the first column (column 1).

2. Now, let's consider the second column (column 2). If grapes were in this column, then according to rule 1, papaya would have to be to the right of grapes. However, this would mean that peach would have to be in the first column (which we already know is not possible), contradicting rule 3. So, grapes cannot be in the second column either.

3. Since grapes cannot be in the first two columns, they must be in the third column (column 3). This means that according to rule 1, papaya must be in the fourth column (column 4).

4. Now, let's consider the first column (column 1). If apricot were in this column, according to rule 2, peach would have to be in the second column. But we already know that grapes are in the third column, which means peach cannot be in the second column. So, apricot cannot be in the first column.

5. Since apricot cannot be in the first column, it must be in the second column. This means that peach must be in the fourth column (according to rule 2).

6. Now, the only remaining food is peach in the fourth column and grapes in the third column. According to rule 1, papaya must be to the right of grapes, so it must be in the fourth column as well.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-1x4-4	"Let's break down the information given in the puzzle:

1. We know there are 4 hobbies, and one of them is woodworking.
2. Woodworking is between baking and chess, so it cannot be in the first or last position.
3. Woodworking is not to the right of rock-climbing, so woodworking cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. Rock-climbing is in an odd position, so it cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since positions 1 and 2 are even).
5. Rock-climbing is not to the right of baking, so rock-climbing cannot be in position 4.

Now let's analyze the remaining possibilities:
- If rock-climbing is in position 3, then woodworking must be in position 2, and the other two hobbies will be in positions 1 and 4.
- If rock-climbing is in position 2, then woodworking must be in position 1, and the other two hobbies will be in positions 3 and 4.

Since rock-climbing is in an odd position (position 3), the final solution table is:

#############
|   1   |   Rock-climbing   |   Woodworking   |   3    |   4    |
| Hobby  |                   |                |        |        |

Lv8-1x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, we know that cycling is on the left of rowing. So, we can place cycling in the first or second position, and rowing in the third position.

2. Now, let's place weightlifting. From rule 3, we know it's to the left of biathlon. Since cycling is already on the left, weightlifting can only be in the fourth position.

3. Now, we know that rowing is in the third position and weightlifting is in the fourth position. From rule 2, we know that rowing is not to the right of weightlifting. So, rowing must be in the first position.

4. Finally, from rule 1, we know that rowing is either to the left or right of weightlifting. Since rowing is in the first position and weightlifting is in the fourth position, rowing must be to the right of weightlifting, which contradicts rule 2. This means that our initial assumption that rowing is in the first position is incorrect.

5. Let's try placing rowing in the second position instead. Now, weightlifting can be in the fourth position, and cycling can be in the first position. Rowing is not to the right of weightlifting, and weightlifting is to the left of biathlon (which we haven't placed yet).

6. Since cycling is in the first position, rowing must be in the third position. This means that biathlon can be in the second position, as it is to the left of weightlifting.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |    1    |   2    |       3       |    4     |

Lv8-1x4-6	"Let's break down the conditions and try to find a solution:

1. Pineapple is in an odd position (1, 3, or 4).
2. Asparagus is in an odd position (1, 3, or 4). Since asparagus can't be to the left of nectarine (condition 3), asparagus can only be in position 3 or 4. However, if asparagus is in position 4, then pineapple must be in position 1 (since both can't be in the same position), which contradicts condition 1 (pineapple must be in an odd position). So, asparagus must be in position 3.

3. Now we know asparagus is in position 3. Since asparagus can't be to the left of nectarine, nectarine must be in position 2.

4. Pineapple must be in an odd position, so it can only be in position 1 or 3. Since position 1 is already occupied by nectarine, pineapple must be in position 1.

5. The only remaining food is peach. Since all other positions are occupied, peach must be in position 4.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv8-1x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that gardening is to the right of chess. Let's place gardening in the rightmost position (column 4).

2. From rule 3, we know that card-games is to the right of chess. Since gardening is already in the rightmost position, card-games must be in one of the three leftmost positions (columns 1, 2, or 3).

3. From rule 4, we know that card-games is to the left of writing. Since card-games is already placed in one of the three leftmost positions, writing must be in one of the two remaining positions (columns 2 or 3).

4. Now, let's place writing in column 2. This means that chess must be in column 3, as it is to the left of card-games (which is in column 1).

5. Finally, we have no restrictions for the hobby in column 1, so it can be any of the four hobbies. Let's place chess in column 1 for now.

6. With this arrangement, we have:

   |         |   1   |     2     |     3      |    4    |
   | Hobby   | Chess | Writing  | Card-games| Gardening|

7. However, this arrangement violates rule 3, as card-games is not to the right of chess. To fix this, we need to swap the positions of chess and card-games.

8. So, the final solution is:

   |         |   1   |     2     |     3      |    4    |
   | Hobby   | Card-games| Writing  | Chess    | Gardening|

So, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fans of 4 different music-genres are arranged from left to right: disco, indie, r&b, techno.

2. Since the fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of techno, r&b must be in the first or second position. But if r&b were in the first position, there would be no room for indie between r&b and techno, so r&b must be in the second position.

3. Now we know that r&b is in the second position, so indie must be in the third position, and techno in the fourth position. This leaves disco to be in the first position.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Disco     | Indie | R&B   | Techno |

Lv8-1x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is not to the left of the doctor (rule 2), the bartender cannot be in the first or second position. So, the bartender can only be in the 3rd or 4th position.

2. If the bartender is in the 3rd position, then the doctor must be in the 2nd position and the security-guard in the 1st position (since the bartender is between the doctor and the security-guard, rule 1). But this arrangement violates rule 3, as the musician must be to the right of the security-guard. So, the bartender cannot be in the 3rd position.

3. Therefore, the bartender must be in the 4th position. This means the doctor must be in the 3rd position and the security-guard in the 1st position. But this arrangement also violates rule 3, as the musician must be to the right of the security-guard.

4. This means our initial assumption that the bartender is in the 4th position is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: the bartender is in the 1st position.

5. In this case, the doctor must be in the 2nd position and the security-guard in the 3rd position. The musician can be in any of the remaining positions (2nd, 3rd, or 4th). However, since the musician must be to the right of the security-guard (rule 3), the musician cannot be in the 2nd position. So, the musician must be in either the 3rd or 4th position.

6. If the musician is in the 3rd position, then the only remaining position for the security-guard is the 4th position. But this arrangement violates rule 1, as the bartender is not between the doctor and the security-guard.

7. Therefore, the musician must be in the 4th position. This means the security-guard must be in the 3rd position, and the doctor in the 2nd position. This arrangement satisfies all the rules.

So, the final solution table is:

  |       |   1    |     2     |       3        |    4     |

1. From rule 1, the architect is not in the first position (1) because if it were, the police-officer would have to be in the second position, which contradicts rule 2. So, the architect is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. From rule 2, the police-officer is in positions 1 or 2. If the police-officer were in position 1, the writer would have to be in position 4, which contradicts rule 4. So, the police-officer is in position 2.

3. From rule 3, the architect cannot be in position 1. So, the architect is in positions 3 or 4. If the architect were in position 3, the writer would have to be in position 1, which contradicts rule 2. So, the architect is in position 4.

4. From rule 4, the writer is in position 3.
