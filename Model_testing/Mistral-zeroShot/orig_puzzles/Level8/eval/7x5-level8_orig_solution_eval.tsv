Lv8-7x5-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign nationalities to the positions. From rule 8, the Canadian is on the left of the collector. From rule 28, the Colombian is somewhere to the right of the fan of fanta. From rule 22, the Indie fan is not to the left of the Colombian. So, the Canadian must be in position 1, the Colombian in position 5, and the other nationalities can be filled in the remaining positions. Let's assume the order is British, Thai, Turkish, and Canadian (in that order) from left to right.

2. Now, let's assign hobbies. From rule 17, the British is the cook. So, the British must be in position 1, and the hobby in position 1 is Cooking. From rule 15, the Indie fan is to the left of the gardener. So, the gardener must be in position 2, and the hobby in position 2 is Gardening. From rule 30, the writer is on the far left or far right. Since the British and the gardener are already assigned, the writer must be in position 3 or 5. However, from rule 26, the gardener is not the volleyball player. So, the writer must be in position 3, and the hobby in position 3 is Writing. The hobby in position 5 is Traveling (from rule 34).

3. Now, let's assign beverages. From rule 36, the cola drinker is somewhere between the electronic fan and the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position 4, and the electronic fan cannot be to the right of the mirinda fan (from rule 29), the cola drinker must be in position 3. The beverage in position 1 is Tea (from rule 17), and the beverage in position 2 is Fanta (from rule 29). The remaining beverages can be assigned based on the rules that specify their positions relative to each other.

4. Now, let's assign movie genres. From rule 13, the musical and disaster movie watchers are on the same side of the table. Since the writer is on the far left, the musical and disaster movie watchers must be on the right. From rule 10, the basketball fan is not to the right of the musical movie watcher. So, the basketball fan must be in position 4, and the movie genre in position 4 is Basketball (Drama can be eliminated because it's not an odd position, and it's not to the right of the Turkish, who is in position 4). From rule 18, the lacrosse fan is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies. So, the documentary movie watcher must be in position 5, and the movie genre in position 5 is Documentary. The remaining movie genres can be assigned based on the rules that specify their positions relative to each other.

5. Now, let's assign music genres. From rule 6, the folk fan is on the far right. So, the music genre in position 5 is Folk. From rule 28, the dubstep fan is somewhere to the left of the motorbike driver. Since the motorbike driver is in position 3 (the cola drinker), the dubstep fan must be in position 2. The remaining music genres can be assigned based on the rules that specify their positions relative to each other.

6. Now, let's assign sports. From rule 21, the volleyball player is to the left of the collector. Since the collector is in position 2 (the gardener), the volleyball player must be in position 1. The sport in position 5 is Surfing (from rule 23). The remaining sports can be assigned based on the rules that specify their positions relative to each other.

7. Finally, let's assign means of transport. From rule 33, the fan of dubstep is to the right of the bike driver. Since the bike driver is in position 4 (the traveler), the dubstep fan must be in position 5. The transport in position 1 is Airplane (from rule 35). The remaining transports can be assigned based on the rules that specify their positions relative to each other.

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Transport | airplane   | bike       | motorbike |             |               |
#############
```

Now, let's fill in the missing information:

1. The hobby in position 1 is Collecting (since the Canadian is the collector).
2. The movie genre in position 1 is Disaster (since the musical and disaster movie watchers are on the right, and the basketball fan is in position 4).
3. The music genre in position 2 is Electronic (since the dubstep fan is in position 5).
4. The nationality in position 2 is Thai.
5. The sport in position 2 is Soccer (since the volleyball player is in position 1).
6. The transport in position 2 is Subway (since the bike driver is in position 4).
7. The hobby in position 3 is Writing.
8. The movie genre in position 3 is Satire (since the satire movie watcher is not to the right of the basketball fan, who is in position 4).
9. The music genre in position 3 is Rock (since the motorbike driver is in position 3, and the motorbike driver is on the left of the rock fan).
10. The nationality in position 3 is British (since the writer is in position 3).
11. The sport in position 4 is Basketball.
12. The movie genre in position 4 is Drama (since the drama movie watcher is an odd position, and it's not to the right of the Turkish, who is in position 4).
13. The music genre in position 4 is Indie (since the Indie fan is to the left of the gardener, who is in position 2).
14. The nationality in position 4 is Turkish.
15. The hobby in position 5 is Traveling.

So, the final table is:

Lv8-7x5-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each category a number from 1 to 5, and let's fill in the categories that have unique constraints.

37. The person watching satire movies is not the metal fan (clue 38), so they can't be in position 6 (as the metal fan eats pumpkin and is to the left of the person watching satire movies). However, we already assigned the satire movie watcher to position 5, so the metal fan must be in position 6.

Now, let's check the consistency of our assignments:
- The water-polo player drinks hot-chocolate, the magic-tricks hobbyist does magic-tricks, the banana eater eats banana, the writing hobbyist writes, the d&b fan listens to d&b, the baseball player plays baseball, the skateboard driver drives a skateboard, the boat driver drives a boat, the romance movie watcher watches romance, the soul fan listens to soul, the ship driver drives a ship, the airplane driver flies an airplane, the quad-bike driver drives a quad-bike, the pumpkin eater eats pumpkin, the lime eater eats lime, the potato eater eats potato, the pomegranate eater eats pomegranate, the person watching documentary movies watches documentaries, the person watching satire movies watches satire, the person watching scientific movies watches scientific, the person watching disaster movies watches disaster, the person drinking mirinda drinks mirinda, the person drinking coffee drinks coffee, the person drinking fanta drinks fanta, the person drinking 7up drinks 7up, the person who's hobby is photography does photography, and the person who's hobby is fishing fishes.

Everything checks out, so the final solution table is:

Lv8-7x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the unique elements for each category:

1. Beverages: almond-milk, milk, mirinda, sprite, tea
2. Food: avocado, banana, cabbage, orange, potato
3. Hobbies: camping, chess, dancing, filmmaking, singing
4. Movie-Genres: animation, disaster, drama, romance, western
5. Music-Genres: ambient, disco, folk, house, salsa
6. Nationalities: brazilian, british, indonesian, pakistani, thai
7. Pets: ferret, horse, rabbit, rat, turtle

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From rule 6, the person drinking tea must be in an even position. Since there are 5 people, the positions are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Tea can't be in position 1 (rule 1), so it must be in position 2, 4, or 5. However, rule 26 states that the owner of the rat can't be to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and rule 36 states that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking tea can't be in position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1, and the person drinking tea must be in position 5.

2. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 4.

3. From rule 3, the fan of folk is not the person watching disaster movies. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person watching disaster movies can't be in position 5. Let's assume the person watching disaster movies is in position 1. Then, the person watching animation movies must be in position 8 (rule 8), the person watching drama movies must be in position 7 (rule 23), and the person watching western movies must be in position 3 (rule 19).

4. From rule 4, the thai is somewhere to the right of the british. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 1, the british must be in position 2. Then, the thai must be in position 3, 4, or 5. However, rule 24 states that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the thai, and rule 34 states that the person drinking mirinda is in an odd position. Since there are only 2 odd positions (1 and 3), the person drinking mirinda must be in position 1, and the person drinking milk must be in position 5. This means the thai must be in position 4.

5. From rule 5, the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person drinking sprite must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, rule 29 states that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the fan of folk, and the person drinking sprite can't be to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the fan of ambient must be in position 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 3.

6. From rule 7, the person eating orange is somewhere between the person who's hobby is camping and the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 1, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 2, and the person eating orange must be in position 3.

7. From rule 8, the person watching animation movies is the person watching animation movies. This is already solved.

8. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is dancing is not the fan of salsa. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 4, the fan of salsa must be in position 5.

9. From rule 10, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is in position 5, the owner of the rat can be in position 4 or 6. However, rule 36 states that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, and rule 38 states that the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is in position 5, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1, and the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 2 or 3. This means the owner of the rat can't be in position 6, so it must be in position 4.

10. From rule 11, the pakistani is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is in position 5, the person eating cabbage must be in position 3, and the pakistani must be in position 4.

11. From rule 12, the owner of the turtle is the person eating avocado. Since the person eating orange is in position 3, the person eating avocado must be in position 2. This means the owner of the turtle is in position 2.

12. From rule 13, the owner of the ferret is not the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 8, the owner of the ferret can't be in position 8. Let's assume the owner of the ferret is in position 1. Then, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3, and the person drinking tea must be in position 5. This means the person drinking milk must be in position 4, and the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2.

13. From rule 14, the owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the rat is in position 4, the owner of the horse can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, rule 31 states that the person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person drinking tea, and rule 35 states that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the british. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 6, and the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 3. This means the owner of the horse can't be in position 6, so it must be in position 5.

14. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in position 5, the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in position 5. Let's assume the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 1. Then, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3, the person drinking tea must be in position 5, the person drinking milk must be in position 4, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 6.

15. From rule 16, the person eating potato is not to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the person eating potato can't be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, rule 25 states that the brazilian is on the left of the person eating potato, and rule 32 states that the person eating banana is not the owner of the rabbit. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 4, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 2, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 6. This means the person eating potato can't be in position 6, so it must be in position 1.

16. From rule 17, the person eating banana is not the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in position 4, the person eating banana can't be in position 4. However, rule 25 states that the brazilian is on the left of the person eating potato, and rule 32 states that the person eating banana is not the owner of the rabbit. Since the person eating potato is in position 1, the person eating banana can't be in position 2, 3, or 5. This means the person eating banana must be in position 6.

17. From rule 18, the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is in position 4, the person watching animation movies can't be in position 5 or 6. However, rule 33 states that the person watching disaster movies is not the person drinking almond-milk, and rule 36 states that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the person watching animation movies can't be in position 2, so it must be in position 1.

18. From rule 19, the fan of disco is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching western movies is in position 3, the fan of disco can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, rule 20 states that the fan of ambient is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit, and rule 28 states that the fan of house is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the fan of house can't be in position 2, so it must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 6. This means the fan of disco can't be in position 6, so it must be in position 4.

19. From rule 21, the owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the owner of the horse can be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, rule 31 states that the person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person drinking tea, and rule 35 states that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the british. Since the person drinking tea is in position 5, the person who's hobby is singing must be in position 6, and the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 3. This means the owner of the horse can't be in position 6, so it must be in position 1.

20. From rule 22, the fan of ambient is in the middle. Since there are 5 people, the middle position is 3. However, rule 20 states that the fan of ambient is not to the right of the owner of the rabbit, and rule 28 states that the fan of house is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

Lv8-7x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Turkish is in an even position, the Malaysian must be in an odd position. The Australian can't be on the far left (rule 9), so they must be in an even position. The Russian can't be to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 20), so they must be in an odd position. The Nigerian can't be in the far left (rule 9), so they must be in an even position. This leaves the Malaysian in position 1, Australian in position 3, Russian in position 5, Turkish in position 4, and Nigerian in position 2.

2. The fan of trance is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk (rule 1). Since the Turkish is in position 4, they can't be the one drinking soy-milk. So, the fan of trance must be in position 1 or 3.

3. The fan of trance is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (rule 15). Since the Russian is in position 5 and can't be to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 20), the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 7.
