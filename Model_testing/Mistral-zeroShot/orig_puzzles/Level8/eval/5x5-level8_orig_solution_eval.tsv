| Transport     | T1     | T2        | T3        | T4       |         |

From clue 15, we know that H2 is between the italian (N2) and the owner of the horse (P3). Since N2 is in the third column and P3 is in the fifth column, H2 must be in the fourth column. Let's place H2 in the fourth row:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3      |    4     |    5    |

| Transport     | T1     | T2        | T3        | T4       |         |

From clue 1, we know that T2 is somewhere to the right of T5. Since T5 is in the third column, T2 must be in the fourth or fifth columns. From clue 5, we know that T1 is somewhere to the left of T5. Since T5 is in the third column, T1 must be in the first or second columns. From clue 20, we know that F2 is on the left or right of T5. Since T5 is in the third column, F2 cannot be in the first column. Therefore, F2 must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth columns. From clue 30, we know that F5 is not to the right of H3. Since H3 is in the fourth row, F5 cannot be in the fifth column. Therefore, F5 must be in the first, second, third, or fourth columns.

Let's place T2 in the fifth row and F2 in the fourth row:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3      |    4     |    5    |

| Transport     | T1     | T2        | T3        | T4       |         |

From clue 18, we know that T5 is on the right of the italian (N2). Since N2 is in the third column, T5 must be in the fourth or fifth columns. From clue 14, we know that T5 is somewhere between F2 and N3. Since F2 is in the fourth column and N3 is in the fifth column, T5 must be in the third column. Let's place T5 in the third row:

|               |    1    |     2      |     3      |    4     |    5    |

| Transport     | T1     | T2        | T3        | T4       |         |

From clue 15, we know that H2 is between the italian (N2) and the owner of the horse (P3). Since N2 is in the third column and P3 is in the fifth column, H2 must be in the fourth column. Let's place H2 in the fourth row:

Lv8-5x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, D, and E, from left to right.

2. Let's start with the beverages. From clue 10, the owner of the goldfish is not the person drinking coffee. So, let's place the coffee drinker as A (leftmost). From clue 14, the goldfish owner is in the middle, so the person drinking coffee is B and the person drinking milk is C (since C is between B and D). From clue 6, the person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, so D drinks lemonade. From clue 10, the owner of the goldfish is not the person drinking coffee, so E must drink either milk, hot-chocolate, or mirinda. Since E can't be on the far right (clue 25), E can't drink hot-chocolate (clue 25). So, E drinks either milk or mirinda. Let's assume E drinks mirinda for now.

3. Now let's place the movie genres. From clue 13, the person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the American. Since the American can't be on the far left (clue 16), the American must be D (family movies). From clue 16, the Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since D watches family movies, the Egyptian must be C (time-travel movies). From clue 19, the person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the fan of electronic. Since C watches time-travel movies, the spy movie watcher must be B (spy movies). From clue 18, the nigerian is not to the left of the fan of jazz. Since D watches family movies, the nigerian must be A (nationality).

4. Now let's place the music genres. From clue 15, the fan of gospel is on the far left or far right. Since A watches family movies, the gospel fan can't be A. So, the gospel fan is E. From clue 17, the fan of gospel is somewhere to the right of the fan of disco. Since E watches gospel, the disco fan must be B. From clue 7, the fan of disco is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since B watches spy movies, the Italian must be D. From clue 21, the owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since D watches family movies, the horse owner can't be D. So, the horse owner is A. From clue 26, the German is on the left or right of the Italian. Since D watches family movies and A owns the horse, the German must be C (time-travel movies).

5. Now let's place the pets. From clue 27, the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since C watches time-travel movies and A owns the horse, the owner of the rat must be B (spy movies). So, the owner of the cat is D (family movies). From clue 2, the person drinking milk is between the Italian and the owner of the rat. Since D watches family movies and B owns the rat, the person drinking milk must be E (mirinda).

6. Finally, from clue 11, the owner of the hedgehog is not the person watching time-travel movies. Since C watches time-travel movies, the hedgehog owner must be A (horse).

The final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Pet           |

9. From point 21, we know the accountant is somewhere between the canadian and the social-worker. Since the pakistani is in the first position (beverage column), the accountant cannot be in the first or last position (job column). So, the accountant must be in the third position (job column).

10. From point 19, we know the person watching drama movies is not to the left of the software-developer. Since the accountant is in the third position (job column), the software-developer cannot be in the first or second position (job column). So, the software-developer must be in the fourth position (job column).

Lv8-5x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique conditions. The journalist is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (Column 5). The writer is the person drinking sprite, so we can place them in the first row (Row 1) of Column 5.

2. The coach is the person watching martial-arts movies, so we can place them in the first row of a suitable column. Since the coach is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping (Rule 16), and the journalist is on the far right (Rule 4), the coach must be in Column 4 or Column 3. However, the coach cannot be in Column 3 because the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking milk (Rule 6), and the only available positions for milk in Column 3 would violate this rule. So, the coach must be in Column 4.

3. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (Rule 17), so the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in Column 1, 2, or 3. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an odd position (Rule 23), they must be in Column 1.

Lv8-5x5-7	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the first position, 5 being the last position).

1. The person eating zucchini is not the polish, so they cannot be in position 3 (since the only nationality left for position 3 is Polish).
2. The person eating zucchini is not the person who's sport is surfing, so they cannot be in position 1 (since the only sport left for position 1 is surfing).
3. The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the fan of punk, so the person in position 1 cannot be surfing.
4. The person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person in position 1 cannot be surfing, the person in position 2 cannot be baseball (as there is no position to the left of position 1).
