Lv8-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different items in each category, so we can fill in the table with 6 unique items. Let's label them A-F for now.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A          | B          |
| Food          | C          | D          |
| Hobby         | E          | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G          | H          |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J          |
| Sport         | K          | L          |

2. We know that the person who's hobby is collecting is watching satire movies (G), so we can place 'E' in the 'Hobby' column and 'G' in the 'Movie-Genre' column.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A          | B          |
| Food          | C          | D          |
| Hobby         | E (Collecting) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H          |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J          |
| Sport         | K          | L          |

3. The fan of trance (J) is somewhere to the right of the person eating orange (D). So, D cannot be orange. Let's assume D is onion. Now, J can be placed in the 'Music-Genre' column.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A          | B          |
| Food          | C (Orange) | D (Onion)  |
| Hobby         | E (Collecting) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H          |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K          | L          |

4. The person drinking almond-milk (A) is on the far right. So, A can be placed in the 'Beverage' column 2.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A (Almond-milk) | B          |
| Food          | C (Orange) | D (Onion)  |
| Hobby         | E (Collecting) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H          |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K          | L          |

5. The person watching fantasy movies (H) is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby (L). So, H cannot be fantasy. Let's assume H is fantasy for now and L is rugby. But this contradicts the rule that the person watching fantasy movies is not to the left of the fan of trance (J). So, H cannot be fantasy. Let's try H as satire instead. Now, L can be rugby.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A (Almond-milk) | B          |
| Food          | C (Orange) | D (Onion)  |
| Hobby         | E (Collecting) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H (Fantasy) |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K          | L (Rugby)  |

6. The person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the fan of trance (J). So, E cannot be to the left of J. E must be on the right of J. But this contradicts the rule that the person drinking almond-milk (A) is on the far right. So, E cannot be collecting. Let's try E as video-games instead. Now, E is not to the left of J.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A (Almond-milk) | B          |
| Food          | C (Orange) | D (Onion)  |
| Hobby         | E (Video-games) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H (Fantasy) |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K          | L (Rugby)  |

7. The person who's sport is rugby (L) is not to the left of the fan of trance (J). So, L cannot be to the left of J. L must be on the right of J. But this contradicts the rule that the person watching fantasy movies (H) is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby (L). So, H cannot be fantasy. Let's try H as satire instead. Now, H is not to the left of J.

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A (Almond-milk) | B          |
| Food          | C (Orange) | D (Onion)  |
| Hobby         | E (Video-games) | F          |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H (Satire) |
| Music-Genre   | I          | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K          | L (Rugby)  |

8. Now, the table is consistent with all the given rules. The final solution table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | A (Almond-milk) | B (Sprite) |

| Hobby         | E (Video-games) | F (Collecting) |
| Movie-Genre   | G (Satire)  | H (Satire) |
| Music-Genre   | I (Salsa)   | J (Trance) |
| Sport         | K (Swimming) | L (Rugby)  |

Lv8-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nurse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving, the nurse can't be in the first column. So, the first column is the teacher.

2. Similarly, the teacher is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing, so the second column is the nurse.

3. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the nurse and teacher are already placed, the ferret owner must be in the first column (as it can't be in the second column due to the nurse). So, the first row is the pet.

4. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person eating grapefruit. Since the pet and teacher are already placed, the ship driver must be in the second row. So, the second row is the transport.

5. Now, we have the nurse, teacher, pet, and transport placed. The only food left is grapefruit, so the third row is the food.

6. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the pet and food are already placed, the person eating zucchini must be in the fourth row. So, the fourth row is the food.

7. The remaining items are hobby, music-genre, and the fifth food. Since we have placed all other items, the fifth food must be zucchini (as it's the only food left). So, the fifth row is the food again.

8. The hobby of the person who's eating zucchini can't be skydiving (as the nurse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving), so the hobby must be writing. So, the first column is the hobby.

9. The music-genre of the teacher can't be trance (as the nurse is not to the left of the fan of trance), so the music-genre must be pop. So, the second row is the music-genre.

Now, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |    2     |
| Food          | Zucchini  | Grapefruit|

| Pet           | Ferret    |          |
| Transport     |          | Ship     |

The table is not complete as we don't have the hobby for the person eating grapefruit. However, since we have placed all other items, we can't determine the hobby of the person eating grapefruit with the given information. So, the final solution table with the unknown hobby is:

#############

Lv8-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person who bakes is not to the left of the goat owner. So, we can place the baking hobby and goat pet in columns 2 and 1 respectively.

2. From rule 2, the goat owner is to the left of the radish eater. So, the radish eater must be in column 2.

3. From rule 3, the soul music fan is to the left of the baker. Since the baker is in column 1, the soul music fan must be in column 2.

4. From rule 4, the hot-chocolate drinker is to the right of the radish eater. So, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in column 1.

5. From rule 5, the crime movie watcher is to the left of the adventure movie watcher. Since we have placed the radish eater (who watches adventure movies) in column 2, the crime movie watcher must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the remaining categories:

6. The remaining beverage is almond-milk. Since we have placed hot-chocolate in column 1, almond-milk must be in column 2.

7. The remaining food is artichoke. Since we have placed radish in column 2, artichoke must be in column 1.

8. The remaining hobby is baking (already placed in column 1).

9. The remaining movie-genre is adventure (already placed in column 2).

10. The remaining music-genre is funk. Since we have placed soul in column 2, funk must be in column 1.

11. The remaining pet is a goat (already placed in column 1).

12. The remaining pet is a rabbit. Since we have placed the goat in column 1, the rabbit must be in column 2.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the librarian is to the left of the fan of blues, and there are only two jobs, the librarian cannot be the fan of blues. So, the firefighter must be the fan of blues.

2. Similarly, since the fan of punk is to the left of the person watching zombie movies, and there are only two movie genres, the fan of punk cannot be watching zombie movies. So, the firefighter cannot be watching zombie movies. Therefore, the librarian must be watching zombie movies.

3. Now we know the librarian is watching zombie movies and the firefighter is a fan of blues. Since the fan of punk is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies, the librarian (who is watching zombie movies) cannot be the fan of punk. So, the firefighter must be the fan of punk.

4. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the librarian (who is watching zombie movies) cannot be the owner of the chinchilla (on the far right), the librarian must be the cyclist. Therefore, the firefighter is the soccer player.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far right. Since we know the librarian (cyclist) and the firefighter (soccer player, fan of punk) are not the pet owners, the pet owner must be the taxi driver.

6. Now we have all the information about the pets, sports, and movie genres. We can fill in the transport and job columns. Since the librarian is the cyclist and the firefighter is the soccer player, the taxi driver must be the boat driver.

Lv8-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items (beverage, food, hobby, music-genre, nationality, transport) and 2 of each. Let's label the positions from 1 to 6 horizontally and vertically (1-1, 1-2, 2-1, 2-2, 3-1, 3-2).

2. From the given clues, we can start by placing the nationalities:
   - The British cannot be in an even position (4, 6), so it must be in either 1 or 3. Let's place the British in position 1 (1-1).
   - Now, the Pakistani must be in an even position, so it's either 2, 4, or 6. Since the British is in position 1, the Pakistani cannot be in position 2 (as per rule 4). So, the Pakistani must be in position 6 (3-2).

3. Now let's place the hobbies:
   - The filmmaker cannot be to the right of the dubstep fan (2-1 or 2-2), so the filmmaker must be in position 1 (1-1, 1-2) or position 3 (3-1, 3-2). Since the British is in position 1, the filmmaker cannot be in position 1. So, the filmmaker is in position 3 (3-1).
   - The reader must be in the remaining position (1-2 or 3-2). Since the reader cannot be to the right of the pop fan (1-2), the reader must be in position 3-2.

4. Now let's place the music-genres:
   - The dubstep fan cannot be to the right of the boat driver (3-1 or 3-2), so the dubstep fan must be in position 1 (1-1, 1-2).
   - The pop fan must be in the remaining position (2-1 or 2-2). Since the pop fan is not to the right of the bike driver (2-1), the pop fan must be in position 2-2.

5. Now let's place the beverages:
   - The soy-milk drinker cannot be to the right of the mango eater (2-1 or 2-2), so the soy-milk drinker must be in position 1 (1-1, 1-2).
   - The lemonade drinker must be in the remaining position (3-1 or 3-2). Since the soy-milk drinker is in position 1, the lemonade drinker must be in position 3-1.

6. Finally, let's place the foods:
   - The mango eater cannot be to the right of the pop fan (1-2 or 2-2), so the mango eater must be in position 1 (1-1, 1-2) or position 3 (3-1, 3-2). Since the soy-milk drinker is in position 1, the mango eater cannot be in position 1. So, the mango eater is in position 3-2.
   - The lime eater must be in the remaining position (2-1 or 2-2). Since the mango eater is not to the right of the pop fan (2-2), the lime eater must be in position 2-1.

7. Now let's place the transports:
   - The bike driver cannot be to the right of the pop fan (2-1), so the bike driver must be in position 1 (1-1, 1-2) or position 3 (3-1, 3-2). Since the soy-milk drinker is in position 1, the bike driver cannot be in position 1. So, the bike driver is in position 3-1.
   - The boat driver must be in the remaining position (2-1 or 2-2). Since the bike driver is not to the right of the boat driver (3-1), the boat driver must be in position 2-1.

Lv8-6x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since we have 2 types of food, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, and 2 nationalities, we can assign each category a unique combination of 0 and 1.

4. From clue 2, the indian (0) is somewhere to the right of the fan of techno (1). Since the nationality is already assigned, the fan of techno must be on the left.

5. From clue 3, the person watching drama movies (0) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games (1). Since we already know the position of the person watching drama movies, the person with the hobby of video-games must be on the right.

Lv8-6x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two nationalities (Chinese and Turkish), we can place them in the Nationality column. Let's place Chinese in the first column and Turkish in the second column.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      |         |         |
   | Food          |         |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |
   | Sport         |         |         |

2. Since there are only two sports (sailing and surfing), we can place them in the Sport column. Let's place surfing in the first row and sailing in the second row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      |         |         |
   | Food          |         |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

3. Since there are only two beverages (almond-milk and Mirinda), we can place them in the Beverage column. Let's place Mirinda in the first row and almond-milk in the second row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          |         |         |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

4. Since there are only two types of food (peas and spinach), we can place them in the Food column. Let's place peas in the first row and spinach in the second row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Peas    | Spinach  |
   | Movie-Genre   |         |         |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

5. Now let's use the clues about movie-genres and music-genres. Since there are only two movie-genres (action and fantasy), we can place them in the Movie-Genre column. Let's place action in the first row and fantasy in the second row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Peas    | Spinach  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Fantasy  |
   | Music-Genre   |         |         |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

6. Since there are only two music-genres (d&b and trance), we can place them in the Music-Genre column. Since the fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, the only possible placement is trance in the first row and d&b in the second row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Peas    | Spinach  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Fantasy  |
   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | D&B      |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

7. Now let's use the remaining clues. The person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means the Peas row cannot be above the Almond-Milk row. Since the Food column is already filled, this means the Peas row must be the second row and the Spinach row must be the first row.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Spinach | Peas     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Fantasy  |
   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | D&B      |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

8. The chinese is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the Chinese is already in the first column, the person who's sport is surfing must be in the second column. This means the Turkish must be the one who's sport is sailing.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Spinach | Peas     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Fantasy  |
   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | D&B      |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

9. The chinese is on the left or right of the turkish. Since the Chinese is already in the first column, the Turkish must be in the second column. This means the Chinese is in the first column.

   |               | Chinese | Turkish |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
   | Food          | Spinach | Peas     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action  | Fantasy  |
   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | D&B      |
   | Sport         | Surfing | Sailing |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               | Chinese | Turkish |
| Beverage      | Mirinda | Almond-Milk |
| Food          | Spinach | Peas     |

Lv8-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two hobbies, chess and gardening, we can fill one row with one hobby and the other row with the other hobby. Let's assume the first row has Chess and the second row has Gardening.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           |           |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |           |
   | Music-Genre   |           |           |
   | Nationality   |           |           |
   | Transport     |           |           |

2. Similarly, since there are only two jobs, we can fill one row with one job and the other row with the other job. Let's assume the first row has Bartender and the second row has Musician.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |           |
   | Music-Genre   |           |           |
   | Nationality   |           |           |
   | Transport     |           |           |

3. Since there are only two movie genres, we can fill one row with one genre and the other row with the other genre. Let's assume the first row has Spy and the second row has Western.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   |           |           |
   | Nationality   |           |           |
   | Transport     |           |           |

4. Since there are only two music genres, we can fill one row with one genre and the other row with the other genre. Let's assume the first row has Electronic and the second row has Pop.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |

5. The person who watches spy movies is to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the spy movie is in the first row, the person driving the taxi must be in the second row. So, the Transport for the second row is Taxi.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |

   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |
   | Nationality   |           |           |
   | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

6. The fan of pop is the person driving the bike. So, the Nationality of the first row must be the one that prefers Pop. Since there are only two nationalities, the second row must have the other nationality.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |
   | Nationality   | Spanish   | Russian   |
   | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

7. The person who is a bartender is not to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the bartender is in the first row and the taxi driver is in the second row, the bartender cannot be in the second row. So, the Nationality of the first row cannot be Russian.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |
   | Nationality   | Spanish   | Russian   |
   | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

8. Now we know that the bartender is Spanish and the taxi driver is Russian. So, the Job of the first row is Bartender and the Job of the second row is Musician.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |
   | Nationality   | Spanish   | Russian   |
   | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

9. The person who is a gardener is to the left of the musician. Since the gardener is in the first row and the musician is in the second row, the gardener must be in the first row.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |
   | Job           | Bartender | Musician  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Western   |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic| Pop       |
   | Nationality   | Spanish   | Russian   |
   | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

10. Now we know that the gardener is Spanish and the chess player is Russian. Since the gardener is in the first row, the chess player must be in the second row.

    |               |     1      |     2     |
    | Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening |

    | Nationality   | Spanish   | Russian   |
    | Transport     | Bike      | Taxi      |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 jobs, 2 music-genres, 2 pets, and 2 sports. So, we have 6 variables and 6 positions in the table.

2. From rule 1, the owner of the dog cannot be to the right of the fan of country. This means the dog cannot be in column 2, as it would leave the fan of country in column 1. So, the dog is in column 1.

3. From rule 2, the fan of d&b cannot be to the left of the owner of the dog. This means the d&b fan cannot be in column 1. So, the d&b fan is in column 2.

4. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since we know the video-games fan is in column 2, the cricket fan must be in column 3.

5. From rule 4, the security-guard is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since we know the security-guard is in column 3, the person drinking tea must be in column 4.

6. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the fan of country. Since we know the video-games fan is in column 2 and the country fan is in column 1, this rule is already satisfied.

7. Now we have placed 5 people in the table, and we know the remaining person must be the fan of the remaining music-genre (which is country) and the owner of the remaining pet (which is fish). Since the dog and the fish cannot be in the same column (as there are only 2 pets), the fish cannot be in column 1 or 2. So, the fish is in column 3 or 4. But the fish cannot be in column 3 because the security-guard is already there. So, the fish is in column 4.

8. The remaining person (the fan of country) must be in column 1.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since they have 2 different hobbies, 2 jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and means of transport, we can fill in one cell of each category with a unique option. For example, let's start with the first row, first column: Hobby - Baking.

|               | Baking |                 |
| Hobby         |       |                 |

| Transport     |       |                 |

7. Now let's apply the given conditions:

   - The nurse is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we haven't filled the satire movie-genre yet, we can't place the nurse yet.

   - The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. We can't place them yet because we haven't placed the ship driver yet.

   - The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. We can't place the disco fan yet because we haven't placed the satire movie-genre yet.

   - The Australian is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. We can't place the Australian yet because we haven't placed the martial-arts movie-genre yet.

   - The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person driving the scooter. We can't place them yet because we haven't placed the ship driver yet.

8. Let's place the satire movie-genre in the second column. Since the nurse is on the right of the person watching satire movies, the nurse can't be in the first row. So, the second row, second column can be filled with Satire.

|               | Baking | Chef       | Satire   |
| Hobby         |       |            |          |
| Job           |       |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts|            |          |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient |            |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |          |

9. Now we can place the nurse in the second row, third column.

|               | Baking | Chef       | Satire   |
| Hobby         |       |   Nurse    |          |
| Job           |       |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts|            |          |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient |            |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |          |

10. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since the ship driver is not yet placed, we can't place the cook yet.

11. The fan of disco is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movie-genre is in the second row, the disco fan can't be in the third row. So, the fourth row, second column can be filled with Disco.

|               | Baking | Chef       | Satire   |
| Hobby         |       |   Nurse    | Disco    |
| Job           |       |            |          |

| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Disco      |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |          |

12. Now we can place the cook in the first row, second column.

|               | Baking | Cooking   | Satire   |
| Hobby         | Cooking|   Nurse    | Disco    |
| Job           |       |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts|            |          |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Disco      |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |          |

13. The Australian is not to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the martial-arts movie-genre is in the third row, the Australian can't be in the first or second row. So, the fifth row, first column can be filled with Australian.

|               | Baking | Cooking   | Satire   |
| Hobby         | Cooking|   Nurse    | Disco    |
| Job           |       |            |          |

| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Disco      |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter |            |          |

14. The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in the sixth row, first column, the ship driver can't be in the first five rows. So, the sixth row, second column can be filled with Ship.

|               | Baking | Cooking   | Satire   |
| Hobby         | Cooking|   Nurse    | Disco    |
| Job           |       |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts| Australian| Ship      |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Disco      |          |
| Nationality   | Indian  |            |          |
| Transport     | Scooter | Ship       |          |
