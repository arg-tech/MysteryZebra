Lv8-2x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the car is not to the left of the person driving the quad-bike, the car cannot be in the first column. So, the car must be in the second or third column.

2. The journalist is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the journalist cannot be in the first column and the quad-bike cannot be in the third column (as the journalist must be to its right). So, the quad-bike must be in the first or second column, and the car cannot be in the second column (as the quad-bike must be to its right).

3. The person driving the quad-bike is between the architect and the journalist. This means the quad-bike cannot be in the first column (as it must be to the right of the architect and the journalist). So, the quad-bike must be in the second column.

4. Now we know the quad-bike is in the second column. Since the journalist is to the right of the quad-bike, the journalist must be in the third column.

5. The car cannot be in the second column (as the quad-bike is there), so the car must be in the first column.

6. The architect cannot be to the left of the quad-bike (as per rule 3), so the architect must be in the third column.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking cola is between the person drinking tea and the owner of the chinchilla, we can't place the cola drinker at position 1 or 3. So, the cola drinker must be at position 2.

2. Now, let's place the tea drinker. Since the cola drinker is at position 2, the tea drinker can't be at position 1 (as per rule 1). So, the tea drinker must be at position 3.

3. Now, we know the positions of the tea and cola drinkers. The chinchilla owner must be on the left of the cola drinker (as per rule 1). So, the chinchilla owner must be at position 1.

4. Now, let's place the turtle owner. Since the turtle owner can't be to the right of the tea drinker (as per rule 2), the turtle owner can't be at position 3. So, the turtle owner must be at position 1.

5. Finally, let's place the rat owner. Since the rat owner can't be to the right of the cola drinker (as per rule 3), the rat owner can't be at position 2 or 3. So, the rat owner must be at position 1.

This results in a contradiction, as we have placed the turtle and the rat at position 1. This means the given rules cannot be satisfied with the given conditions.

So, the final solution table would be:

  |            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | turtle | cola | tea |
| Pet        | rat  | rat  | chinchilla |

Lv8-2x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the person driving the car, we can place the cauliflower eater to the right of the car driver. Let's place the cauliflower eater in the third column and the car driver in the second column.

2. Now, the person eating strawberry is somewhere between the person eating cauliflower and the person driving the bus. Since the cauliflower eater is in the third column, the strawberry eater must be in the second or third column. However, the strawberry eater is not to the left of the person driving the subway, so the strawberry eater cannot be in the first column. Therefore, the strawberry eater must be in the second column.

3. The person driving the bus must be to the left of the strawberry eater (since the strawberry eater is on the right of the bus driver). So, the bus driver goes in the first column.

4. The person driving the subway cannot be to the left of the strawberry eater, so the subway driver must be in the third column.

Now, let's put the food and transport in their respective columns:

|             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Food        | Bus      | Strawberry| Cauliflower |
| Transport   | Subway   | Car       |             |

However, we don't have information about the person driving the car's food preference. So, we can't definitively place the food for the car driver. But we know it's not cauliflower because the cauliflower eater is in the third column, and it's not strawberry because the strawberry eater is in the second column. So, the car driver could be eating nectarine.

Final solution table with the best guess for the car driver's food:

#############

Lv8-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs (analyst, architect, bartender) and three movie genres (adventure, horror, zombie). We'll use A for analyst, AH for architect-horror, AB for architect-adventure, BA for bartender-adventure, BH for bartender-horror, Z for zombie.

2. From the third rule, the person watching adventure movies is between the person watching horror movies and the analyst. This means either AH-Z-BA or BA-Z-AH.

3. From the second rule, the bartender is on the right of the analyst. This means BA-Z-AH or BA-AH-Z is not possible because the analyst would be to the left of the bartender in both cases. So, the only possible arrangement is AH-Z-BA.

4. From the first rule, the bartender is not to the right of the architect. This means the architect cannot be AH (because the bartender is to the right of the architect in the only possible arrangement we found). So, the architect must be A or Z. If the architect was Z, the only possible arrangement would be Z-AH-BA, which violates the first rule because the bartender would be to the right of the architect. So, the architect must be A.

5. Now we know the arrangement is A-Z-BA. The only movie genre left for the architect is horror (since the analyst is watching adventure and the bartender is watching adventure). So, the final arrangement is:

   |               |    1    |     2     |     3     |
   | Job           |  A      |  Z       |  BA      |

Lv8-2x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people (let's call them A, B, and C), and each person owns a different pet (H for hedgehog, T for turtle, and H for horse).

2. From point 1, we can deduce that A, B, and C are in the first, second, and third columns respectively, as there are only three columns.

3. Now, let's assign movie genres. We'll start with A (first column). Since A can't be watching adventure movies (point 3), they can only watch time-travel or thriller movies. Let's say A watches time-travel movies (T-T for Time-Travel in the first row).

4. Now, B (second column) must be watching either adventure or thriller movies, as they are to the right of A (who is watching time-travel movies). Since B can't be watching adventure movies (point 4), they must be watching thriller movies (T-A for Thriller in the second row).

5. Finally, C (third column) must be watching adventure movies (A- for Adventure in the third row), as they are to the right of B (who is watching thriller movies) and to the left of A (who is watching time-travel movies).

6. Now, let's assign pets. From point 5, we know that C owns the horse (H-A-H for Horse in the third row). Since the owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the turtle (point 6), A can't own the turtle. So, A must own the hedgehog (T-T-H-H for Turtle in the first row).

7. Lastly, the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog (point 6). This means B must own the turtle (T-A-H for Turtle in the second row).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the horse is to the left of the dancer, we can place the horse owner in the first or second column, and the dancer in the third column. Let's place the horse owner in the first column and the dancer in the third column for now.

   |       |      1       |   2    |       3        |

   | Pet   |              |       |                |

2. The owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the dancer. So, the chinchilla owner must be in the second or third column. Since the security-guard is not to the right of the chinchilla owner (rule 3), the chinchilla owner cannot be in the third column (where the dancer is). So, the chinchilla owner must be in the second column.

   | Pet   |              | Chinchilla    |                |

3. The photographer is on the left of the dancer. Since the dancer is in the third column, the photographer must be in the first or second column. Since the horse owner is already in the first column, the photographer must be in the second column.

   |       |      1       |   2    |       3        |
   | Job   | Horse Owner | Photographer | Dancer       |
   | Pet   |              | Chinchilla    |                |

4. Now we have the jobs, but we still need to assign the pets. Since the chinchilla is with the chinchilla owner (who is a photographer), the chinchilla goes in the second row and second column.

   |       |      1       |   2    |       3        |

5. The only pet left is the horse. Since the horse owner is in the first column, the horse goes in the first row and first column.

Lv8-2x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the writer is drinking almond-milk, so we can fill in the first row as follows:

| Beverage   | Almond-milk |  |  |
|-----------|-------------|---|---|
| Job        | Lawyer      |  |  |

2. Since the pilot is not to the left of the writer (who is drinking almond-milk), the pilot cannot be in the first two columns. So, the pilot must be in the third column.

| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea | Sprite |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Job        | Lawyer      | Pilot    |  |

3. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the writer (who is drinking almond-milk), so iced-tea must be in the third column as well.

| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea | Sprite |
|-----------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Job        | Lawyer      | Pilot    | Writer |

4. The pilot is between the writer and the person drinking sprite. Since the writer is in the middle, the pilot must be on the left, and the writer must be on the right. But we already have them in the correct order, so no need to change anything.

5. The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the writer, so our current arrangement satisfies this condition as well.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Dutch cannot be in the first position (as per rule 5), they must be in the third position. So, Nationality 3 is Dutch.

2. Since the Dutch are in the third position, their sport cannot be climbing (as per rule 2, because climbing is not to the right of swimming, and the Dutch are to the right of swimming). So, Sport 3 cannot be climbing.

3. Since the Dutch are in the third position and their sport is not climbing, their sport must be either skiing or swimming. But since the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the Dutch (rule 5), and the Dutch are in the third position, the Dutch cannot be skiing. Therefore, Sport 3 is swimming.

4. Now we know that the Dutch are in the third position and their sport is swimming. So, Nationality 1 must be the person who's sport is climbing (because climbing is not to the right of swimming, and the Dutch are to the right of swimming, as per rule 2 and our previous findings). So, Nationality 1 is Egyptian (as the remaining nationality is Turkish).

5. Since the Egyptian is not to the left of the person who's sport is swimming (rule 4), and we know that the Dutch are to the right of the swimmer, the Egyptian must be in the second position. So, Nationality 2 is Egyptian.

6. Since the Dutch are in the third position and their sport is swimming, the person in the first position must be the one who's sport is skiing (as per rule 5). So, Sport 1 is skiing.

2. From rule 4, the person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person eating pear. Since we know Action is on the far left, the only possible position for Drama is the second row and first column (Drama, Drama, _).

3. Now, we know that the person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since we have Drama in the second row first column, the only possible position for Pear is the second row second column (_, Drama, Pear).

However, since the person drinking sprite is in the middle, the person drinking mirinda cannot be in the first column. So, the person drinking mirinda must be in the second column.

3. Now we know the person drinking mirinda is in the second column and the person drinking sprite is in the third column. This means the person drinking juice must be in the first column.

4. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person drinking juice is in the first column and the person drinking sprite is in the third column, the person doing weightlifting must be in the second row.
