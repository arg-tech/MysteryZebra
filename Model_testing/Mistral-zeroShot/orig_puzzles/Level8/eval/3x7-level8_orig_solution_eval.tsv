Lv8-3x7-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. We know there are 7 items in each category (beverages, pets, sports), so we can label them from 1 to 7 in each row.

2. From rule 3, the rat owner must be in an odd position. So, the rat owner can be either 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the rat owner is person 3 (we'll check other possibilities later).

3. From rule 12, the person drinking cola cannot be on the right of the person playing basketball. Since basketball is on the far left (rule 26), the cola drinker cannot be in position 1, 2, or 6. So, the cola drinker is either 3, 4, 5, or 7. Let's assume the cola drinker is person 4 (we'll check other possibilities later).

4. From rule 1, the fish owner is either to the left or right of the cola drinker. If the fish owner is to the right of the cola drinker, then the fish owner cannot be in position 5 or 7 (since the rat owner is in position 3). So, the fish owner could be in position 1, 2, or 4. Let's assume the fish owner is person 2 (we'll check other possibilities later).

5. From rule 2, the surfing person is between the soy-milk and tea drinkers. Since the soy-milk drinker is not in position 1 (rule 28), the surfing person cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the surfing person is either 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume the surfing person is person 5 (we'll check other possibilities later).

6. From rule 4, the swimming person is not the water drinker. So, the swimming person is not in position 6.

7. From rule 5, the hedgehog owner is to the right of the chinchilla owner. Since the chinchilla owner is not in position 1 (rule 14), the hedgehog owner cannot be in position 2. So, the hedgehog owner is either 3, 4, 5, or 7. Let's assume the hedgehog owner is person 7 (we'll check other possibilities later).

8. From rule 6, the iced-tea drinker is not the fish owner. So, the iced-tea drinker is not in position 2.

9. From rule 10, the iced-tea drinker is not to the right of the goat owner. Since the goat owner is not in position 1 (rule 25), the iced-tea drinker cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5. So, the iced-tea drinker is either 1 or 7. But since the surfing person is in position 5 (our assumption), the iced-tea drinker cannot be in position 7. So, the iced-tea drinker is person 1.

10. Now we know the positions of the rat owner (3), cola drinker (4), fish owner (2), surfing person (5), and iced-tea drinker (1). We can continue solving the puzzle with the remaining rules.

After a long process of elimination and checking all possibilities, we can finally fill in the table:

```

Lv8-3x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the leftmost position and 7 being the rightmost position).

2. We know that the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position (#4), so the rabbit cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6. This means the rabbit can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

3. The person eating grapefruit is not to the right of the person eating strawberry (#8), so the grapefruit cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7. This means the grapefruit can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

4. The person eating grapefruit is not to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (#8), so the guinea-pig cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. This means the guinea-pig can only be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.

5. The owner of the rabbit is between the person who's sport is swimming and the owner of the guinea-pig (#22), so the rabbit cannot be in position 1, and the guinea-pig cannot be in position 7. This means the rabbit can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, and the guinea-pig can be in positions 5, 6, or 7.

6. The person eating strawberry is the owner of the cat (#17), so the cat is in position 5.

7. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person eating zucchini (#23), so the zucchini is not in position 5. This means the zucchini can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, or 7.

8. The owner of the cat is on the far left or far right (#24), so the cat cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 6. This means the cat can only be in positions 1, 2, or 7.

9. The owner of the cat is not the person eating grapefruit (#26), so the grapefruit is not in position 7. This means the grapefruit can be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. The owner of the horse is between the owner of the cat and the owner of the fish (#27), so the horse cannot be in position 1 or 7. This means the horse can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

11. The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position (#4), so the rabbit is in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the rabbit cannot be in position 1 (because the cat is there), the rabbit must be in position 3 or 5.

12. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the cat (#25), so the weightlifting cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. This means the weightlifting can only be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.

13. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the cat (#25), so the weightlifting cannot be in position 5 (because the rabbit is there). This means the weightlifting can be in positions 4, 6, or 7.

14. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the fish (#16), so the horse cannot be in position 4 (because the weightlifting is there). This means the horse can be in positions 1, 2, 5, 6, or 7.

15. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person eating plum (#18), so the snowboarding cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. This means the snowboarding can only be in positions 3, 5, or 7.

16. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left or far right (#19), so the snowboarding cannot be in position 5 (because the rabbit is there). This means the snowboarding can only be in positions 3 or 7.

17. The person eating watermelon is not the owner of the rabbit (#20), so the watermelon cannot be in position 3 (because the rabbit is there). This means the watermelon can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

18. The person who's sport is handball is not the person eating mango (#6), so the handball cannot be in position 3 (because the rabbit is there). This means the handball can be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

19. The person eating mango is not to the left of the owner of the goat (#7), so the mango cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. This means the mango can only be in positions 3, 5, or 7.

20. The person who's sport is swimming is not to the right of the owner of the fish (#2), so the swimming cannot be in positions 5, 6, or 7. This means the swimming can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4.

21. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the right of the person who's sport is badminton (#5), so the tennis cannot be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7. This means the tennis can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

22. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is handball (#13), so the badminton cannot be in position 3 (because the mango is there). This means the badminton can be in positions 1 or 2.

23. The person eating apricot is not to the right of the person eating plum (#1), so the apricot cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. This means the apricot can only be in position 1 or 7.

24. The person eating zucchini is not the person who's sport is weightlifting (#9), so the zucchini cannot be in position 4, 5, 6, or 7. This means the zucchini can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

25. The person who's sport is sailing is not mentioned in any other rule, so it can be in any position.

Now, let's put the information we've gathered into the table:

```
|         |      1       |     2      |     3      |     4      |     5     |    6     |       7       |
| Food    |   Apricot   |   Grapefruit| Mango     |   Plum     |   Strawberry|   Fish   |   Zucchini  |
| Pet     |     Cat      |             |   Rabbit  |             |             |   Fish   |   Goat      |
| Sport   |   Badminton  |   Swimming   |   Tennis  |   Handball  |   Sailing  |   Weightlifting|   Snowboarding|
```

Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact positions for all the elements, we can't fill in the rest of the table. However, we know that the rabbit is in position 3 or 5, the mango is in position 3, 5, or 7, the swimming is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, and the badminton is in position 1 or 2. The rest of the elements can be in any position.

Lv8-3x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the nationalities in the odd positions (1, 3, 5, 7) due to rule 4. Let's place the nationalities as follows:
   - 1: Brazilian
   - 3: Canadian
   - 5: Egyptian
   - 7: Indian (rule 23)

2. Since the Egyptian is not to the right of the Indian (rule 8), the Egyptian cannot be in position 6 or 4. So, the Egyptian must be in position 2.

3. Now, the Canadian is not to the right of the Egyptian (rule 13), so the Canadian cannot be in position 4 or 6. The Canadian must be in position 1 (already filled) or 3. But since the Canadian is in an odd position (rule 4), it must be in position 3.

4. The Brazilian is between the owner of the cat and the Egyptian (rule 13), so the cat cannot be in position 1 (already filled) or 7. The cat must be in position 5 or 6. But since the Brazilian is not to the left of the person eating lemon (rule 16), the cat cannot be in position 6. So, the cat is in position 5.

5. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog (rule 1), so the frog cannot be in position 7 (last position). The frog must be in position 6.

6. The owner of the frog is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 6), so the goldfish cannot be in position 7. The goldfish must be in position 6 or 5. But since the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 15), the goldfish cannot be in position 5. So, the goldfish is in position 6.

7. The owner of the goldfish is between the owner of the cat and the owner of the snake (rule 6), so the snake cannot be in position 1 (already filled) or 7. The snake must be in position 2 or 4. But since the Egyptian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish (rule 11), the snake cannot be in position 2. So, the snake is in position 4.

8. The owner of the cat is not to the left of the person eating lemon (rule 19), so the lemon cannot be in position 1 (already filled) or 3. The lemon must be in position 5 or 7. But since the person eating raspberry is on the left of the owner of the cat (rule 16), the lemon cannot be in position 7. So, the lemon is in position 5.

9. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the german (rule 5), so the german cannot be in position 7. The german must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the person eating raspberry is on the left of the owner of the cat (rule 16), the german cannot be in position 5. So, the german is in position 1.

10. The person eating cherry is not the canadian (rule 14), so the cherry cannot be in position 3. The cherry must be in position 1, 5, or 7. But since the person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating cherry (rule 9), the cherry cannot be in position 7. So, the cherry is in position 1 or 5. But since the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 15), the cherry cannot be in position 5. So, the cherry is in position 1.

11. The person eating peas is not to the left of the person eating cherry (rule 22), so the peas cannot be in position 2 or 4. The peas must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But since the Egyptian is not to the right of the person eating peas (rule 3), the peas cannot be in position 7. So, the peas are in position 3 or 5. But since the person eating lemon is not to the left of the person eating peas (rule 21), the peas cannot be in position 5. So, the peas are in position 3.

12. The person eating artichoke is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 20), so the artichoke cannot be in position 6 or 7. The artichoke must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the person eating raspberry is on the left of the owner of the cat (rule 16), the artichoke cannot be in position 5. So, the artichoke is in position 1 or 3. But since the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 15), the artichoke cannot be in position 1. So, the artichoke is in position 3.

13. The person eating carrot is not the canadian (not stated but implied since the canadian is filled), so the carrot cannot be in position 3. The carrot must be in position 1, 5, or 7. But since the person eating raspberry is on the left of the owner of the cat (rule 16), the carrot cannot be in position 5. So, the carrot is in position 1 or 7. But since the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 15), the carrot cannot be in position 1. So, the carrot is in position 7.

14. The person eating pumpkin is not to the right of the indian (rule 25), so the pumpkin cannot be in position 6 or 7. The pumpkin must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

Lv8-3x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the hobbies (1-7) and foods (1-7) for easier reference.

2. From rule 7, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in an even position. Since there are 7 people, an even position could be 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume filmmaking is in position 4 for now.

3. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the motorbike is in an odd position. So, the motorbike can't be in position 4 (filmmaking). Let's assume the motorbike is in position 3.

4. From rule 6, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person driving the boat. So, sudoku is in position 6 (boat).

5. From rule 24, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is the person eating carrot. So, writing is in position 1 (carrot).

6. From rule 18, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing is in position 1, card-games must be in position 5 (left of 1).

7. From rule 19, we know that the person eating apricot is not the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski can't be in position 1 (writing) or position 3 (motorbike), it must be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. But since the person driving the boat (sudoku) is in position 6, the jet-ski can't be in position 6. So, the jet-ski must be in position 2.

8. From rule 29, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. So, skydiving is in position 1.

9. From rule 13, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot. Since apricot is in position 2 (jet-ski), cooking can't be in position 1 (skydiving). So, cooking must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the person driving the boat (sudoku) is in position 6, cooking can't be in position 6. So, cooking must be in position 3 or 5.

10. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since filmmaking is in position 4, the skateboard can't be in position 3 (cooking) or position 2 (jet-ski). So, the skateboard must be in position 1 (skydiving), 5, or 6. But since the person driving the boat (sudoku) is in position 6, the skateboard can't be in position 6. So, the skateboard must be in position 1 (skydiving).

Lv8-3x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 7 people and positions are numbered from 1 to 7, an even position is either 2, 4, or 6. The person driving the trike is in position 4, so the person driving the car must be in position 2 (since the car is in the middle) and the person driving the van is in position 6.

2. Now we know the positions of the car and van. We can place the beverages and music genres around them. Let's place the person drinking lemonade in position 1 (since it's an odd position and to the left).

3. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking lemonade. Since the car is in position 2 and the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, the person drinking cola must be in position 3. So, the person drinking fanta is in position 5.

So, the fan of reggae is either in position 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 5, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 5. So, the fan of reggae is either in position 1, 3, or 7. Since the person drinking water is in position 2, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 2. So, the fan of reggae is either in position 1 or 7. Since the person driving the airplane is not the fan of reggae, the fan of reggae cannot be in position 1. So, the fan of reggae is in position 7.

8. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the fan of reggae (position 7). So, the person driving the airplane is in position 6.

9. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues (not yet placed). So, the fan of blues cannot be in position 7 (since the fan of reggae is there). The fan of blues cannot be in position 1, 2, or 6 (since the fans of pop, reggae, and airplane are there). So, the fan of blues is either in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 4, the fan of blues cannot be in position 4. So, the fan of blues is either in position 3 or 5. Since the person driving the car is in position 2, the fan of blues cannot be in position 2. So, the fan of blues is in position 5.

10. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues (position 5). So, the person driving the boat is in position 6 or 7. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 6, the person driving the boat is in position 7.

Since the person driving the van is in position 6, the person driving the taxi cannot be in position 6. So, the person driving the taxi is in position 4.

12. The fan of indie is on the far right. Since we know the positions of the fans of pop, reggae, and blues, the fan of indie must be in position 7.

13. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking coffee (position 7). So, the person drinking 7up is in position 6.

14. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking water (position 2). So, the person drinking cola is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 5, the person drinking cola is not in position 5. So, the person drinking cola is either in position 3, 4, or 6. Since the person driving the car is in position 2, the person drinking cola is not in position 2. So, the person drinking cola is either in position 4 or 6. Since the person driving the van is in position 6, the person drinking cola is in position 4.

15. The person drinking mirinda is the person driving the van (position 6).

16. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking cola (position 3) and the person drinking lemonade (position 1). So, the person drinking mirinda (the person driving the van) is to the right of the person drinking fanta (position 5).

17. The fan of house is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski (position 4). So, the fan of house is in position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

Since the person driving the boat is in position 7, the fan of house cannot be in position 7. So, the fan of house is either in position 1 or 3. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 6, the fan of house cannot be in position 6. So, the fan of house is in position 1.

Now, let's put everything together:

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Let's assume the fantasy movies are in position 4 (since the odd positions are left and the even positions are right). So, the documentaries are in position 5.

3. From rule 2, we know the chef is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the fantasy movies are in position 4, the chef must be in position 3.

4. From rule 3, we know the person watching romance movies is to the right of the Canadian. Since the Canadian can't be in position 1 (because the chef is in position 3), the Canadian must be in position 2. So, the romance movies are in position 6.

5. From rule 4, we know the project-manager is to the right of the bartender. Since the bartender can't be in position 7 (because the Polish is on the far right), the bartender must be in position 6. So, the project-manager is in position 7.

6. From rule 5, we know the fisherman is not to the right of the coach. Since the coach is in position 3, the fisherman can't be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, the fisherman must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But since the chef is in position 3, the fisherman can't be in position 3. So, the fisherman is in position 1.

7. From rule 6, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is the Italian. Since the Italian must be in an odd position (rule 7), the Italian is in position 1.

8. From rule 8, we know the coach is not to the right of the French. Since the French can't be in position 7 (because the Polish is on the far right), the French must be in position 6.

9. From rule 9, we know the polish is on the far right. Since the Italian is in position 1 and the coach is in position 6, the Polish must be in position 7.

10. From rule 10, we know the project-manager is on the far left or far right. Since the Polish is on the far right, the project-manager must be on the far left, so it's in position 1.

11. From rule 11, we know the chef is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movies are in position 3 (because the French is the person watching satire movies), the chef can't be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7. So, the chef must be in position 2.

12. From rule 12, we know the canadian is not to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in position 1 and the Canadian is in position 2, this rule is satisfied.

13. From rule 13, we know the person watching satire movies is in the middle. So, the French is in position 3.

14. From rule 14, we know the polish is on the left or right of the musician. Since the Polish is in position 7 and the Italian is in position 1, the musician can't be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the musician must be in position 6.

15. From rule 15, we know the Canadian is not the person watching disaster movies. Since the Canadian is in position 2, the disaster movies can't be in position 2. So, the disaster movies are either in position 1, 3, 5, or 6. But since the Italian is in position 1, the disaster movies can't be in position 1. So, the disaster movies are either in position 3, 5, or 6. But since the French is in position 3 (satire movies) and the Polish is in position 7, the disaster movies can't be in position 7. So, the disaster movies are in position 5.

16. From rule 16, we know the American is between the bartender and the musician. Since the bartender is in position 1 and the musician is in position 6, the American can't be in position 1 or 6. So, the American must be in position 2 or 5. But since the Canadian is in position 2, the American can't be in position 2. So, the American is in position 5.

17. From rule 17, we know the British is not to the right of the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian can't be in position 1 (because the bartender is in position 1), the Nigerian must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But since the Canadian is in position 2, the Nigerian can't be in position 2. Since the Italian is in position 1, the Nigerian can't be in position 1. Since the French is in position 3, the Nigerian can't be in position 3. Since the American is in position 5, the Nigerian can't be in position 5. So, the Nigerian is in position 4.

18. From rule 20, we know the bartender is on the right of the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is in position 4, the bartender must be in position 5.

19. From rule 19, we know the Canadian is not to the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is in position 1 and the Canadian is in position 2, this rule is satisfied.

20. From rule 21, we know the nigerian is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the Nigerian is in position 4 and the fisherman is in position 1, this rule is satisfied.

21. From rule 22, we know the chef is not to the right of the bartender. Since the bartender is in position 5 and the chef is in position 2, this rule is satisfied.

Now, we have the final solution:

|               |      1       |     2     |      3      |     4     |    5     |     6     |        7        |

| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Disaster | Satire      | Romance  | Martial-Arts | Fantasy | Animation |

Since the positions for movie-genres are not explicitly given, we can't determine the exact order of the movie-genres. However, we know that Documentary is in position 5, Disaster is in position 3, Satire is in position 3, Romance is in position 6, Martial-Arts is in position 1, Fantasy is in position 4, and Animation is in position 7. The exact order within these positions can't be determined with the given information.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign movie genres to the columns (left to right): Crime, Drama, Epic, Family, Horror, Musical, Romance.

2. Next, let's assign pets to the rows (top to bottom): Cat, Chinchilla, Ferret, Goldfish, Hedgehog, Horse, Mouse.

3. Now, let's assign sports to the cells where the movie genre and pet intersect. We'll use the given clues to place them.

4. Let's start with the sports that have more restrictions. For example, the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is basketball (clue 16), so they must be in the 6th or 7th row. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is also on the far right (clue 18), they must be in the 7th row.

5. The person who's sport is basketball cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is handball (clue 12), so they must be in the 5th or 6th row. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball (clue 16), the person who's sport is basketball must be in the 5th row.

6. The person who's sport is handball cannot be to the left of the person watching musical movies (clue 25), so they must be in the 4th or 5th row. Since the person who's sport is basketball is above the person who's sport is handball, the person who's sport is handball must be in the 4th row.

7. The person who's sport is swimming cannot be to the left of the person watching musical movies (clue 21), so they must be in the 3rd or 4th row. Since the person who's sport is handball is above the person who's sport is swimming, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the 3rd row.

8. The person who's sport is climbing cannot be to the left of the person watching drama movies (clue 27), so they must be in the 2nd or 3rd row. Since the person who's sport is climbing is not the person watching drama movies (clue 27), they must be in the 3rd row.

9. The person who's sport is golf cannot be to the right of the person watching musical movies (clue 20), so they must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. Since the owner of the cat is the person who's sport is golf (clue 24), the person who's sport is golf must be in the 1st column.

10. The person who's sport is baseball cannot be to the left of the person watching musical movies (clue 9), so they must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th column. Since the owner of the cat is not to the left of the person who's sport is baseball (clue 10), the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 6th column.

11. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person watching musical movies (clue 9), so the person who's sport is baseball must be in the 5th or 6th column.

12. The person who's sport is golf is in the 1st column, so the owner of the cat is in the 1st row.

13. The person who's sport is baseball is in the 5th column, so the owner of the cat is not in the 5th row.

14. The owner of the cat is not to the right of the person who's sport is handball (clue 13), so the owner of the cat must be in the 1st or 2nd row. Since the owner of the cat is the person who's sport is golf (clue 24), the owner of the cat must be in the 1st row.

15. The owner of the cat is in the 1st row, so the owner of the horse is in the 2nd row.

16. The owner of the cat is not to the right of the owner of the horse (clue 15), so the owner of the cat must be in the 1st column.

17. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 2), so the owner of the mouse is in the 2nd or 6th column. Since the owner of the cat is in the 1st column, the owner of the mouse must be in the 6th column.

18. The owner of the ferret is on the far right (clue 18), so the owner of the ferret is in the 7th row.

19. The person who's sport is climbing is in the 3rd row, so the person watching drama movies is in the 2nd column (since the person watching drama movies is the owner of the hedgehog, and the owner of the hedgehog cannot be to the left of the person who's sport is climbing, clue 27).

20. The person watching drama movies is in the 2nd column, so the person watching family movies is in the 3rd column.

21. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the person watching epic movies (clue 11), so the person watching family movies is in the 4th or 5th column. Since the person who's sport is baseball is in the 5th column, the person watching family movies is in the 4th column.

22. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person who's sport is handball (clue 25), so the person watching romance movies is in the 2nd or 3rd column. Since the person watching family movies is in the 4th column, the person watching romance movies is in the 3rd column.

23. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching musical movies (clue 17), so the person watching horror movies is in the 1st or 2nd column. Since the person watching drama movies is in the 2nd column, the person watching horror movies is in the 1st column.

24. The person watching crime movies is on the far right (clue 3), so the person watching crime movies is in the 7th column.

25. The person watching epic movies is not to the left of the person watching family movies (clue 28), so the person watching epic movies is in the 5th or 6th column. Since the person watching crime movies is in the 7th column, the person watching epic movies is in the 6th column.

26. The person watching romance movies is in the 3rd column, so the person watching horror movies is in the 1st column, and the person watching crime movies is in the 7th column.

27. The person watching drama movies is in the 2nd column, so the person watching family movies is in the 3rd column, the person watching epic movies is in the 6th column, and the person watching crime movies is in the 7th column.

28. The person watching horror movies is in the 1st column, so the person watching musical movies is in the 2nd column.

Lv8-3x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the even-numbered items (food, music-genre, and hot-chocolate) in the even positions (2, 4, 6).

2. We know that the fan of hip-hop is in an odd position (4), so it must be house. So, house is in position 4.

3. The fan of folk is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea and the person eating cabbage (7). Since house is in position 4, and we know that the fan of hip-hop is not to the left of the person eating cucumber (8), the fan of folk must be in position 5, making folk the music genre.

Since the person eating cranberry is in position 7, the person eating cucumber must be in position 5.

19. The person eating orange is in position 1, so it cannot be to the right of the person eating eggplant (1), which means it is not to the right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is on the right of the person eating eggplant (7), the person eating orange must be in position 2.

20. The person drinking tea is in position 6, so it cannot be to the right of the fan of reggae (7), which means it is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk (2). The person drinking almond-milk is in position 2, so the person drinking tea must be in position 1.

21. The person drinking iced-tea is in position 7, so it cannot be to the right of the fan of reggae (7), which means it is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk (2). The person drinking almond-milk is in position 2, so the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1 or 3.
