Lv8-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Let's place them in the first two spots, with ice-hockey in the first position (1) and cycling in the second position (2).

2. From rule 2, we know that the person driving the airplane is not to the left of the person driving the airplane. Since there's only one airplane, it must be in a position where it's not to the left of itself, so it must be in the last position (4).

3. From rule 3, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the far left or far right. Since the airplane is in the last position, the taxi cannot be in the last position, so it must be in the first position (1).

4. From rule 4, we know that the person driving the taxi is not to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the taxi is in the first position, the jet-ski must be in the second position (2).

5. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the airplane is not to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane is in the last position (4), no one can be to its right.

6. From rule 6, we know that the person watching family movies is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the jet-ski (2) and the airplane (4) are already placed, the only remaining sport is water-polo. Let's place it in the third position (3).

7. From rule 7, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since camping is not yet placed, let's place it in the fifth position (5).

8. From rule 8, we know that the person watching mystery movies is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the jet-ski is in the second position (2) and ice-hockey is in the first position (1), the person watching mystery movies must be in the third position (3).

9. From rule 9, we know that the person driving the taxi is the person watching family movies. Since the taxi is in the first position (1), family movies are also in the first position (1).

10. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the taxi is in the first position (1), woodworking must be in the second position (2).

11. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since animation movies are not yet placed, let's place them in the fourth position (4). Since singing is not yet placed, it can be either in the first position (1) or the fifth position (5).

12. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since woodworking is in the second position (2) and dancing is in the fifth position (5), this rule is satisfied.

13. From rule 13, we know that the person watching family movies is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since family movies are in the first position (1) and the taxi is in the first position (1), this rule is satisfied.

14. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is the person driving the motorbike. Since dancing is in the fifth position (5), motorbike must be in the fifth position (5).

15. From rule 15, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since dancing is in the fifth position (5) and ice-hockey is in the first position (1), this rule is satisfied.

Now, let's fill in the hobbies, movie-genres, sports, and transport:

|               |      1      |     2     |      3      |    4    |

| Sport         | Ice-Hockey | Water-Polo| Cycling    |         |
| Transport     | Airplane   | Jet-Ski   | Motorbike  | Taxi    |

Since we don't have enough information to determine the genre of the movie for the person in the fifth position, we can't fill in the fourth column completely. However, we have correctly placed the hobbies, sports, and transport according to the given rules.

Lv8-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10 and 11, we know that the fan of salsa is not the first or the last person, and the owner of the dog is not the first person. So, the owner of the dog can't be in position 1, and the fan of salsa can't be in position 4.

2. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the dog and the fan of salsa are already placed, the only remaining positions for lemonade are 1 and 4. Let's assume lemonade is in position 1 for now.

3. From rule 12, the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since lemonade is in position 1, milk can't be in position 2 or 3. So, milk must be in position 4.

4. From rule 2, the person drinking milk is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Since milk is in position 4, the owner of the frog can't be in position 3 or 4. So, the owner of the frog must be in position 2.

5. From rule 9, the fan of house is the owner of the frog. So, house is in position 2.

6. From rule 18, the person eating grapes is not to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the owner of the frog is in position 2, grapes can't be in position 3 or 4. So, grapes must be in position 1.

7. From rule 19, the person drinking water is on the right of the person eating grapes. So, water is in position 3.

8. From rule 7, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the frog (and thus house) is in position 2, the owner of the goldfish can't be in position 1 (because of rule 13). So, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 4.

9. From rule 5, the owner of the dog is not to the left of the fan of indie. Since house is in position 2 and the owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the dog, the owner of the dog can't be in position 1. So, the owner of the dog must be in position 3.

10. From rule 14, the fan of indie is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is in position 2, indie can be in position 1 or 3. But from rule 11, the owner of the dog is not to the left of the fan of salsa. So, indie must be in position 3.

11. From rule 16, the person eating kale is on the right of the person eating carrot. Since grapes are in position 1 and carrots can't be in position 2 (because of rule 4), carrots must be in position 3. So, kale is in position 4.

12. From rule 6, the person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking water. Since water is in position 3, peas can't be in position 4. So, peas must be in position 2.

13. From rule 13, the fan of trance is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. Since grapes are in position 1, trance can be in position 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 14, the fan of indie is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is in position 2 and indie is in position 3, trance can't be in position 3. So, trance must be in position 4.

Lv8-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and sports. So, each row and each column will have a unique value.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the person who's hobby is camping has a sport to their right, the sports in columns 1 and 2 can't be cycling (as it's on the far right). So, the hobby in row 1 must be either card-games, skydiving, or sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, the hobby in row 1 can't be card-games. So, the hobby in row 1 is either skydiving or sudoku. But since the person who's hobby is sudoku is to the left of the person watching western movies, the hobby in row 1 can't be sudoku. Therefore, the hobby in row 1 is skydiving.

3. Now, the person who's hobby is skydiving is to the right of the fan of blues. So, the music-genre in column 1 can't be blues. The remaining music-genres (electronic, folk, jazz) can't be in column 2 because the fan of folk is in an odd position and there are only 4 options. So, the music-genre in column 1 is either electronic or jazz. But since the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic, the music-genre in column 1 can't be electronic. Therefore, the music-genre in column 1 is jazz.

4. Now, the person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby in row 2 must be camping, as it's the only remaining hobby.

5. The person who's hobby is camping has a sport to their right, which can't be cycling (as it's on the far right). So, the sport in column 2 can't be climbing, sailing, or surfing. But since the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic, the sport in column 2 can't be climbing (as it's to the left of the person watching action movies). So, the sport in column 2 is either sailing or surfing. But since the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku, the sport in column 2 can't be surfing (as it's to the left of the person watching mystery movies). Therefore, the sport in column 2 is sailing.

6. Now, the person who's hobby is camping has a sport to their right, which is sailing. So, the sport in column 3 must be climbing, as it's the only remaining sport.

7. The person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby in row 3 must be either camping, skydiving, or sudoku. But since the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies, the hobby in row 3 can't be sudoku. So, the hobby in row 3 is either camping or skydiving. But since the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues, the hobby in row 3 can't be skydiving. Therefore, the hobby in row 3 is camping.

8. The person who's hobby is camping has a sport to their right, which is climbing. So, the sport in column 4 must be cycling, as it's the only remaining sport.

9. The person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby in row 4 must be either skydiving or sudoku. But since the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies, the hobby in row 4 is sudoku.

10. Now, the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies. So, the movie-genre in column 4 can't be western. The remaining movie-genres (action, drama, mystery) can't be in column 3 because the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. So, the movie-genre in column 4 is either action or drama. But since the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic, the movie-genre in column 4 can't be action. Therefore, the movie-genre in column 4 is drama.

11. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person watching mystery movies. So, the movie-genre in column 3 can't be mystery. The remaining movie-genre (action) can't be in column 2 because the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic. So, the movie-genre in column 3 is action.

12. The person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby in row 4 is either skydiving or sudoku. But since the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues, the hobby in row 4 can't be skydiving. Therefore, the hobby in row 4 is sudoku.

14. The person who's hobby is camping has a sport to their right, which is climbing. So, the sport in column 1 must be cycling, as it's the only remaining sport.

15. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. So, the music-genre in row 2 can't be blues. The remaining music-genres (electronic, folk, jazz) can't be in row 1 because the fan of folk is in an odd position. So, the music-genre in row 2 is either electronic or jazz. But since the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic, the music-genre in row 2 can't be electronic. Therefore, the music-genre in row 2 is jazz.

16. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. So, the music-genre in row 1 can't be blues. The remaining music-genres (electronic, folk, jazz) can't be in row 3 because the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies. So, the music-genre in row 1 is either electronic or folk. But since the person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan of electronic, the music-genre in row 1 can't be electronic. Therefore, the music-genre in row 1 is folk.

17. The fan of folk is in an odd position. The only odd position left is column 3. So, the music-genre in column 3 is folk.

18. The person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby in row 3 must be camping, as it's the only remaining hobby.

Lv8-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the puzzles hobbyist is not the dancer. So, the dancer can't be in the first or fourth position.

2. The software-developer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the dancer can't be in the first or fourth position, the software-developer can't be in the first or fourth position either. So, the rowing sport must be in the second or third position.

3. The person eating plum is the musician. So, the musician must be in the second or fourth position.

4. The person eating banana is between the dancer and the electrician. Since the dancer can't be in the first position, the banana must be in the third position. So, the electrician must be in the first position, and the dancer must be in the fifth position (since they can't be in the first position).

5. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the electrician is in the first position and the dancer is in the fifth position, the basketball player can't be in the first or fifth position. So, the basketball player must be in the second or fourth position.

6. The person who's sport is basketball is not to the right of the person eating banana. So, the basketball player can't be in the fourth position. Therefore, the basketball player is in the second position, and the hobby of puzzles is in the third position.

7. The person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position. Since the electrician, dancer, basketball player, and puzzles hobbyist are all accounted for, the reading hobbyist must be in the first position.

8. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the puzzles hobbyist is in the third position, the board-games hobbyist must be in the first position.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the software-developer. Since the reading hobbyist is in the first position, the software-developer must be in the second position.

10. The electrician is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the electrician is in the first position, the golf sport must be in the third or fifth position.

11. The person who's sport is golf is not to the right of the person eating apple. Since the banana is in the third position, the apple must be in the first position. So, the golf sport must be in the fifth position.

12. The dancer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the dancer is in the fifth position, the golf sport must be in the third position.

13. The electrician is the person who's sport is basketball. This contradicts the earlier conclusion that the basketball player is in the second position. There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it stands.

Here is the table with the correct information based on the given clues:

|         |      1      |         2          |    3    |    4     |

| Job     | electrician | software-developer  | dancer   |   musician |
| Sport   | golf       | basketball         | rowing   |   tennis  |

However, the placement of the basketball player and the electrician is inconsistent with the given clues. I would suggest rechecking the puzzle for any errors."	{'food': ['apple', 'banana', 'plum', 'cucumber'], 'hobby': ['reading', 'puzzles', 'board-games', 'chess'], 'job': ['electrician', 'software-developer', 'dancer', 'musician'], 'sport': ['golf', 'basketball', 'rowing', 'tennis']}	True	9	False
Lv8-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 hobbies, movie genres, nationalities, and sports. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 2, the Russian is the person who's hobby is cooking, so Hobby_1 = Cooking and Nationality_3 = Russian.

3. From rule 8, the Malaysian is the person watching drama movies, so Movie_Genre_2 = Drama and Nationality_4 = Malaysian.

4. From rule 8 and 13, we know that the Malaysian is not to the right of the person watching drama movies, so Nationality_4 cannot be in column 4. Let's place Nationality_4 in column 1, 2, or 3.

5. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is sudoku is to the left of the person watching drama movies and the person who's sport is volleyball is to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since Nationality_4 cannot be in column 4, the person watching drama movies (Malaysian) must be in column 4. So, let's place Nationality_4 in column 4 and Nationality_1 in column 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 9, the British is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since Nationality_4 is in column 4, Nationality_1 cannot be in column 4. So, Nationality_1 can only be in column 1 or 2.

7. From rule 14, the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since Nationality_4 is in column 4, the person who's sport is handball cannot be in column 1. So, the person who's sport is handball is in column 2 or 3.

8. From rule 3, the person who's sport is handball is not the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we know that Nationality_1 is not in column 4 and cannot be in column 4, and the person who's sport is handball is not in column 1, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in column 2 or 3.

9. From rule 7, the person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (rule 2), the person who's hobby is card-games must be in column 3. So, Hobby_3 = Card-games, Nationality_1 = British (since it cannot be in column 4), and Nationality_2 can be any nationality except Russian and Malaysian.

10. From rule 6, the person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching drama movies (Malaysian) is in column 4, the person watching disaster movies (Disaster_1) must be in column 1, 2, or 3.

11. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. So, Disaster_1 cannot be in the same column as Hobby_3 (column 3). Disaster_1 can be in column 1 or 2.

12. From rule 10 and 11, if Disaster_1 is in column 1, then the person watching mystery movies (Mystery_1) must be in column 2. In this case, Sudoku_1 must be in column 3 and Sport_3 must be Volleyball (since it is between Sudoku_1 and Drama_4). Sport_1 can be any sport except handball, skiing, and volleyball. Sport_2 can be any sport except handball, skiing, and cricket.

13. If Disaster_1 is in column 2, then Sudoku_1 must be in column 1 and Mystery_1 must be in column 3. In this case, Sport_1 can be any sport except handball, skiing, and volleyball. Sport_2 can be any sport except handball, cricket, and volleyball. Sport_3 can be any sport except handball, skiing, and cricket.

Since we have two possible solutions based on where Disaster_1 is placed, let's check the remaining rules for both solutions:

Solution 1:
Disaster_1 = Disaster_1 (column 1)
Mystery_1 = Mystery_1 (column 3)
Sudoku_1 = Sudoku_1 (column 3)
Sport_1 = Cricket (since it is not to the left of Mystery_1)
Sport_2 = Skiing (since it is not to the right of Disaster_1)
Sport_3 = Volleyball

Solution 2:
Disaster_1 = Disaster_1 (column 2)
Mystery_1 = Mystery_1 (column 1)
Sudoku_1 = Sudoku_1 (column 1)
Sport_1 = Scientific (since it is not to the left of Mystery_1)
Sport_2 = Handball (since it is not in column 1 and not to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking)
Sport_3 = Cricket (since it is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies)

Both solutions satisfy all the given rules. However, since we don't have enough information to determine the exact order within the same column, we can't definitively say which is the correct solution.

Final answer: The table with the correct solution is as follows, but the exact order within the same column is not determined:

2. We know there are 4 beverages, jobs, nationalities, and transports, so we can fill in the first column of each section with the options.

3. From point 1, we know the scooter driver is a Nigerian. So, we can place the Nigerian in the scooter row. Let's place him in the 3rd row for now.

4. From point 5, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the Nigerian (scooter driver). So, the iced-tea drinker cannot be in the 4th column. Let's place the iced-tea in the 1st column, 1st row.

5. From point 6, the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the Dutch. So, the Dutch cannot be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. Let's place the Dutch in the 1st column, 2nd row.

6. From point 7, the person drinking sprite is not the Thai. So, the Thai cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. Let's place the Thai in the 3rd column, 1st row (since the iced-tea drinker is in the 1st row, 1st column).

7. From point 8, the manager is somewhere between the scooter driver (Nigerian) and the person drinking sprite. Since the scooter driver is in the 3rd row, the manager cannot be in the 1st or 4th row.

16. From point 3, the person driving the bus is not to the left of the person drinking water. Since the water drinker cannot be in the 1st column (because the iced-tea drinker is there), the bus driver cannot be in the 1st column.

Lv8-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Let's place the mouse owner (M) and hedgehog owner (H) in the first two spots, with M to the left of H.

| Beverage | Music-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
|----------|------------|------------|-----|
|          |            |           | M   |

|          |            |           | H   |

4. From rule 4, the Dutch (D) is not the fan of dubstep. Since dubstep is one of the four music genres, D cannot be in the first three spots. So, D must be in the fourth spot.

5. From rule 5, the fan of d&b (DB) is not to the left of the fan of gospel (G). Since G is in the fourth spot, DB cannot be in the first three spots. So, DB must be in the fourth spot. This contradicts our previous placement of D and DB. Let's rearrange the nationalities so that D is not the fan of reggae:

8. From rule 8, the person drinking tea (T) is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since H is in the second spot, T cannot be in the third or fourth spots. So, T must be in the first spot.

Lv8-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 9, the electrician is on the far left or far right. Since the librarian is not to the left of the librarian (rule 10), the librarian cannot be on the far left. So, the electrician must be on the far left, and the librarian must be on the right.

2. The librarian is to the left or right of the videographer (rule 1). Since the electrician is on the far left (rule 11), the librarian cannot be on the far right (rule 12). So, the librarian is to the left of the videographer.

3. The person driving the trike is the person who's hobby is skydiving (rule 13). Since the librarian is to the left of the videographer, and the librarian is not the person driving the trike (because the librarian is not a driver), the videographer must be driving the trike.

4. The person driving the airplane is not the person who's hobby is card-games (rule 2). Since the electrician and librarian are already placed, the only remaining hobby for the airplane driver is card-games. So, the airplane driver is the person with the hobby of card-games.

5. The person driving the bus is somewhere between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is hiking (rule 8). Since the videographer (who is also the trike driver) is not the bus driver (because the videographer is not a driver), the bus driver must be either the person with the hobby of skydiving or hiking. However, the person with the hobby of skydiving is the trike driver (rule 13), so the bus driver must be the person with the hobby of hiking.

6. The person driving the taxi is not to the left of the person driving the trike (rule 7). Since the videographer is the trike driver, the taxi driver must be to the right of the videographer.

7. The person drinking tea is in an even position (rule 5). Since the electrician, librarian, and videographer are already placed, the only remaining positions for the tea drinker are the second and fourth positions. However, the tea drinker cannot be in the fourth position because the person in the fourth position must be the person driving the bus (rule 5), and the bus driver is the person with the hobby of hiking, not the tea drinker. So, the tea drinker is in the second position.

8. The social-worker is the person drinking iced-tea (rule 4). Since the tea drinker is in the second position, the social-worker is in the first position.

9. The person drinking water must be in an odd position (because all other positions are filled). So, the person drinking water is in the third position.

10. The person drinking milk must be in the fifth position (because all other positions are filled).

11. The person with the hobby of video-games must be in the sixth position (because all other positions are filled).

Lv8-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 different symbols (let's use A, B, C, D) for each person in each category.

2. Since there are 4 different beverages, we can assign each person a unique beverage. Let's say A drinks almond-milk, B drinks coffee, C drinks fanta, and D drinks hot-chocolate.

3. Now let's assign movie-genres. Since there are 4 different genres, we can assign each person a unique genre. Let's say A watches documentary, B watches musical, C watches time-travel, and D watches romance.

4. For nationalities, since there are 4 different nationalities, we can assign each person a unique nationality. Let's say A is American, B is Brazilian, C is Italian, and D is Russian.

5. For transport, since there are 4 different means of transport, we can assign each person a unique transport. Let's say A drives the bike, B drives the taxi, C drives the subway, and D drives the van.

6. Now let's use the clues to fill in the table:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
   |----------|------------|------------|-----------|
   | A (almond-milk) | D (documentary) | B (Brazilian) | A (bike) |
   | B (coffee) | B (musical) | A (American) | B (taxi) |
   | C (fanta) | C (time-travel) | C (Italian) | C (subway) |
   | D (hot-chocolate) | A (romance) | D (Russian) | D (van) |

7. To confirm our solution, let's check the clues again:

   1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person driving the taxi (D is to the left of B).
   2. The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person drinking fanta (C is not to the right of C).
   3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person driving the taxi (D is not B).
   4. The russian is not to the left of the person drinking coffee (D is not to the left of B).
   5. The person drinking fanta is not to the right of the person watching musical movies (C is not to the right of B).
   6. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the van (C is to the left of D).
   7. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (A is not to the right of C).
   8. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching romance movies (C is to the right of B).
   9. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person drinking fanta (D is not to the left of C).
   10. The brazilian is on the left or right of the person driving the bike (B is to the left or right of A).
   11. The brazilian is not to the left of the person driving the taxi (B is not to the left of B).
   12. The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the russian (D is to the left or right of A).
   13. The brazilian is between the italian and the person driving the bike (C is to the left of A and A is to the right of B).
   14. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (A is to the right of C).

All the clues are satisfied, so our solution is correct.

Lv8-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the music genres in the first row. Since the fan of rock can't be the owner of the goldfish, we can place rock in the second or fourth position. Let's place it in the second position (row 2, column 2). Since the fan of folk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, and the fan of rock can't be the owner of the goldfish, we can place folk in the first position (row 1, column 1). Salsa can't be in the second position because the person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the fan of salsa, so we place salsa in the fourth position (row 1, column 4). This leaves punk in the third position (row 1, column 3).

2. Now let's place the pets in the second row. The owner of the goldfish is not the fan of rock, so it can't be in the second position. It also can't be in the fourth position because the owner of the dog is in an even position, and there's already a pet in the second position. So, the goldfish is in the first position (row 2, column 1). The owner of the dog is between the owner of the hedgehog and the person driving the taxi, and it's in an even position, so it must be in the third position (row 2, column 3). This leaves the hedgehog in the fourth position (row 2, column 4) and the dog is a pet, so we have dogs in the second row.

3. Now let's place the beverages in the third row. The person drinking lemonade is the fan of punk, so we can place lemonade in the third position (row 3, column 3). The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade, so juice can't be in the fourth position. It also can't be in the second position because the person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the fan of salsa, and the fan of salsa is in the fourth position. So, juice is in the first position (row 3, column 1). The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog, so it can't be in the fourth position. It also can't be in the second position because the owner of the dog is between the owner of the hedgehog and the person driving the taxi, and the owner of the hedgehog is in the fourth position. So, iced-tea is in the third position (row 3, column 3). This leaves sprite in the fourth position (row 3, column 4).

4. Finally, let's place the transport in the fourth row. The person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the fan of salsa, so the bike can't be in the first position. It also can't be in the fourth position because the fan of salsa is in the fourth position. So, the bike is in the second position (row 4, column 2). The person driving the taxi is not the owner of the goldfish, so it can't be in the first position. It also can't be in the fourth position because the fan of salsa is in the fourth position. So, the taxi is in the third position (row 4, column 3). The person driving the train can't be in the second position because the person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the fan of salsa, and the person driving the bike is in the second position. It also can't be in the fourth position because the fan of salsa is in the fourth position. So, the train is in the first position (row 4, column 1). This leaves the trike in the fourth position (row 4, column 4).

Here is the final solution table:
