Lv8-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we can label them A to E from left to right.

2. Let's assign movie genres:
   - A: Crime (C)
   - B: Documentary (D)
   - C: Disaster (E)
   - D: Time-Travel (T)
   - E: Horror (H)

3. Now let's assign nationalities:
   - A: Argentine (A)
   - B: Brazilian (B)
   - C: German (G)
   - D: Russian (R)
   - E: British (B) (Note: We have two Britons, but we'll assign this one for now and adjust later)

4. Let's assign transport:
   - A: Airplane (A)
   - B: Jet-ski (J) (Since the Russian is driving the jet-ski)
   - C: Car (C)
   - D: Helicopter (H)
   - E: Quad-bike (Q)

5. From rule 1, C is not to the right of D. So, D cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since D is Documentary, it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 6. If D were in position 1, A (Crime) would be to the right of D, which violates rule 3. So, D cannot be in position 1. If D were in position 2, A (Crime) would be to the left of D, which is correct. So, D is in position 2.

6. From rule 2, J is to the left of B. So, B cannot be in positions 4 or 5. Since B is Brazilian, it must be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 6. If B were in position 1, J would be to the left of B, which is correct. So, B is in position 1.

7. From rule 3, A (Crime) is not to the right of D (Documentary). So, A cannot be in positions 4, 5. Since A is Argentine, it must be in positions 1, 2, 3. If A were in position 3, it would violate rule 1. So, A is not in position 3. If A were in position 2, D would be in position 1, which is correct. So, A is in position 2.

8. From rule 4, C is somewhere between G and A. Since A is in position 2, C cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, C is in position 3.

9. From rule 5, T is on the left of A (Argentine). Since A is in position 2, T must be in position 1.

10. From rule 6, R is driving the jet-ski (J). Since J is in position 1, R must be in position B (which is the jet-ski driver).

11. From rule 7, E (Disaster) is on the right of A (Argentine). Since A is in position 2, E must be in position 4 or 5. If E were in position 4, it would violate rule 10. So, E is in position 5.

12. From rule 8, B is not to the left of Q. Since B is in position 1, Q cannot be in position 2. So, Q is in position 3.

13. From rule 9, B is not to the left of Q. Since Q is in position 3, B cannot be in position 2. So, B is in position 4.

14. From rule 11, H is somewhere to the right of B (Brazilian). Since B is in position 4, H can be in positions 5 or 6. If H were in position 5, it would violate rule 12. So, H is in position 6.

15. From rule 12, Q is not to the left of J. Since J is in position 1, Q cannot be in position 2. So, Q is in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the classical fan cannot be to the left of the person eating cauliflower. This means that the classical fan can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, we know that the person eating cucumber is not a fan of house. This means that the cucumber cannot be in position 5 (since the fan of house is house).

3. From rule 3, we know that the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This means that the cauliflower cannot be in position 1 (since the hedgehog cannot be to the right of the cauliflower).

4. From rule 4, we know that the owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the bird. This means that the turtle cannot be in position 5 (since the bird cannot be to the right of the turtle).

5. From rule 5, we know that the owner of the pony is between the fan of house and the person eating cauliflower. Since we know the positions of the fan of house (not 5) and the person eating cauliflower (not 1), the pony can only be in position 2, 3, or 4.

6. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the person eating grapes. This means that the hedgehog cannot be in position 5 (since the grapes cannot be to the right of the hedgehog).

7. From rule 7, we know that the person eating pepper is the fan of house. Since we know the position of the fan of house, we know the position of the person eating pepper.

8. From rule 8, we know that the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since we know the position of the fan of house, we know that the fan of electronic cannot be in position 1 (since the fan of house is not in position 1).

9. From rule 9, we know that the person eating blueberry is on the left or right of the person eating pepper (who is the fan of house). Since we know the position of the person eating pepper, we know that the person eating blueberry cannot be in position 1 (since the fan of house is not in position 1).

10. From rule 10, we know that the person eating cucumber is not to the right of the fan of house. Since we know the position of the fan of house, we know that the person eating cucumber cannot be in position 2, 3, or 4 (since the pony, cauliflower, and electronic fan are in these positions).

11. From rule 11, we know that the person eating blueberry is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we know the position of the hedgehog, we know that the person eating blueberry cannot be in position 4 or 5.

12. From rule 12, we know that the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we know the position of the hedgehog, we know that the bird cannot be in position 5.

13. From rule 13, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of indie. Since we know the position of the fan of indie, we know that the turtle cannot be in position 5.

Lv8-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating eggplant is not the first person (since there's no one to the right of the garlic eater). So, the garlic eater can't be in the first position.

2. From rule 2, the lime eater is not the Dutch. Since the Dutch can't be the first person (from rule 1), the lime eater can't be the second person.

3. From rule 3, the garlic eater is not the second person either (since the Dutch can't be the second person and the garlic eater is to the left of the Dutch).

4. From rule 4, the lime eater can't be the third person (since the motorbike driver can't be the first person, and the lime eater is to the right of the motorbike driver).

5. From rule 5, the lemon eater is either the first or second person (since the German can't be the first person, and the lemon eater is on the left of the German). If the lemon eater is the first person, then the German must be the second person. If the lemon eater is the second person, then the German can be any position to the right of the lemon eater.

6. From rule 6, the trike driver can't be the first person (since the Mexican can't be the first person, and the trike driver is to the right of the Mexican).

7. From rule 7, the train driver can't be the second person (since the trike driver can't be the first person, and the train driver is to the right of the trike driver).

8. From rule 8, the German can't be the second or third person (since the Mexican can't be the first person, and the German is to the left of the Mexican).

9. From rule 9, the strawberry eater can't be the first person (since the eggplant eater can't be the first person, and the strawberry eater is to the right of the eggplant eater).

10. From rule 10, the American is the skateboard driver.

11. From rule 11, the eggplant eater can't be the second person (since the lemon eater is on the left of the German, and the German can't be the second person).

13. From rule 13, the trike driver can't be the fourth person (since the Mexican can't be the fifth person, and the trike driver is to the right of the Mexican).

14. From rule 14, the Italian must be the fifth person.

15. From rule 15, the motorbike driver can't be the fifth person (since the Italian is on the far right).

17. From rule 17, the garlic eater can't be the fourth person (since the American is the skateboard driver, and the American can't be the second person).

Now we have the following information:
- The lemon eater is the first person.
- The German is the second person.
- The skateboard driver (American) is the third person.
- The lime eater is the fourth person.
- The Italian is the fifth person.

Since the motorbike driver can't be the fifth person, the motorbike driver must be the second person (since the lemon eater is the first person, the German is the second person, and the Italian is the fifth person).

Since the motorbike driver can't be the fourth person, the motorbike driver must be the fifth person (since the lemon eater is the first person, the German is the second person, the American is the third person, the Dutch is the fourth person, and the Italian is the fifth person).

Now we have:
- The lemon eater is the first person (eating lemon).
- The German is the second person (eating garlic).
- The skateboard driver (American) is the third person (driving skateboard).
- The Dutch is the fourth person (nationality).

- The lemon eater is the second person (eating lemon).
- The German is the third person (eating garlic).
- The skateboard driver (American) is the fourth person (driving skateboard).
- The Dutch is the fifth person (nationality).

Since the trike driver can't be the first or fifth person, the trike driver must be the second person (since the train driver is the first person, the lemon eater is the second person, the German is the third person, and the Dutch is the fifth person).

Now we have:
- The train driver (nationality) is the first person (driving train).
- The lemon eater is the second person (eating lemon).
- The German is the third person (eating garlic).
- The skateboard driver (American) is the fourth person (driving skateboard).

Now we have:
- The train driver (nationality) is the first person (driving train).

- The lime eater is the third person (eating lime).
- The skateboard driver (American) is the fourth person (driving skateboard).

Now we have:
- The train driver (nationality) is the first person (driving train).
- The lemon eater is the second person (eating lemon).
- The lime eater is the third person (eating lime).
- The strawberry eater is the fourth person (eating strawberry).

Lv8-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since soy-milk is to the left of cola and there are only 5 positions, we can place soy-milk in the first position and cola in the second position.

2. The horse owner cannot be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, so iced-tea cannot be in the first four positions. Let's place iced-tea in the fifth position.

3. Coffee cannot be to the right of the Spanish, so coffee cannot be in the last three positions. Since the brazilian is in an odd position, coffee cannot be in the first position either. So, coffee can be in the third position.

4. The Spanish is not to the left of the Thai, so the Thai cannot be in the last two positions. Let's place the Thai in the sixth position.

5. The Canadian is on the right of the person drinking cola, so the Canadian cannot be in the first four positions. The Canadian cannot be in the sixth position because the Thai is there. So, the Canadian can be in the seventh position.

6. The brazilian is in an odd position, so the brazilian cannot be in the sixth position (since the Thai is there). The brazilian cannot be in the first position (since coffee is there), and the brazilian cannot be in the seventh position (since the Canadian is there). So, the brazilian can be in the fifth position.

7. The Spanish is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the guinea-pig owner cannot be in the sixth or seventh positions. The guinea-pig owner cannot be in the first position (since coffee is there), and the guinea-pig owner cannot be in the fifth position (since the brazilian is there). So, the guinea-pig owner can be in the fourth position.

8. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the snake cannot be in the fourth position (since the guinea-pig owner is there). The snake cannot be in the first position (since coffee is there), and the snake cannot be in the seventh position (since the Canadian is there). So, the snake can be in the sixth position.

9. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, so juice cannot be in the first position (since soy-milk is there). The person drinking juice cannot be in the seventh position (since the Canadian is there). So, juice can be in the second position.

10. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking juice, so iced-tea cannot be in the fifth position (since the brazilian is there). The person drinking iced-tea cannot be in the first position (since soy-milk is there). So, iced-tea can be in the third position.

11. The canadian is on the far right, so the nationalities are in the order: Thai, Spanish, Brazilian, Canadian.

12. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the Spanish, so the turtle can be in the fifth position.

13. The person drinking cola is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so cola cannot be in the fourth position (since the guinea-pig owner is there). The person drinking cola cannot be in the first position (since soy-milk is there), and the person drinking cola cannot be in the seventh position (since the Canadian is there). So, cola can be in the sixth position.

14. The final table is:

Lv8-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in the middle, we know that positions 2, 3, and 4 are occupied by sports other than climbing. Let's assume the sport in position 2 is swimming, position 3 is soccer, and position 4 is badminton (odd positions for swimming and badminton).

2. Now, let's place the person who's hobby is cooking in position 1 (odd position). This means the hobbies in positions 2, 3, and 4 are collecting, filmmaking, and puzzles (in that order).

3. The person who's hobby is photography cannot be in position 1 (left of lemon), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5. However, it cannot be in position 2 (left of lemon), so it must be in position 3 or 5. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left or far right, it cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 3. This means the hobby in position 5 is puzzles.

4. The person who's hobby is collecting cannot be in position 1 (left of raspberry), so it must be in position 2 or 4. However, it cannot be in position 4 (odd position), so it must be in position 2. This means the hobby in position 4 is filmmaking.

5. The person who's hobby is puzzles is to the right of the person eating strawberry. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, the person eating strawberry must be in position 5.

6. The person who's hobby is photography is not to the left of the person eating raspberry, so it must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, it cannot be in position 1 (left of lemon), so it must be in position 3 or 5. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, the person eating raspberry must be in position 5.

7. The person eating raspberry is in an odd position (position 5), so the person eating lemon must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 4. However, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the person eating lemon (rule 8), so the person eating lemon must be in position 4.

8. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in position 3, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 5. However, the person who's hobby is collecting is to the left of the person eating raspberry (rule 7), so it must be in position 1.

9. The person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 2. The person who's hobby is cooking is in position 1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 4. The person who's hobby is collecting is in position 1. The person who's hobby is photography is in position 3. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person eating raspberry, so the person eating raspberry must be in position 5. The person who's hobby is puzzles is to the right of the person eating strawberry, so the person eating strawberry must be in position 3.

10. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating avocado. The only person left to the left of position 3 is the person in position 1 (collecting). So, the person eating avocado must be in position 2.

11. The person who's sport is soccer is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. The only person to the right of position 1 is the person in position 2 (avocado). So, the person who's sport is soccer is in position 3.

12. The person who's sport is badminton is in position 4.

13. The person who's sport is climbing is in position 5 (middle).

14. The person eating apple is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person eating lemon. The only position between position 1 (collecting) and position 4 (lemon) is position 2 (avocado). However, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating avocado, so the person eating apple must be in position 4 (lemon).

15. The person eating strawberry is in position 3.

16. The person eating raspberry is in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the disco fan is on the far left, let's place Disco in the first column (1).
2. The person eating corn is not to the left of the person eating radish, so radish can't be in the second column (2). Let's place Radish in the third column (3).
3. The person eating tomato is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the Disco fan is on the far left, Tomato can't be in the first column (1). Let's place Tomato in the fifth column (5).
4. The person eating radish is in an odd position. Since we've placed Radish in the third column (3), the remaining positions are even. So, let's place Corn in the second column (2) and Lime in the fourth column (4).
5. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the person driving the jet-ski and the person eating lime. Since Lime is in the fourth column (4), the quad-bike can't be in the first, second, or fifth columns. Let's place Quad-bike in the third column (3).
6. The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the person eating corn. Since Corn is in the second column (2), let's place Reggae in the fourth column (4).
7. The person driving the van is not to the right of the person eating lime. Since Lime is in the fourth column (4), the van can't be in the fifth column (5). Let's place Van in the first column (1).
8. The fan of ambient is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance. Since Reggae is in the fourth column (4), Ambient can't be in the fourth column. Let's place Ambient in the fifth column (5).
9. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the fan of reggae. Since Reggae is in the fourth column (4), the bike can't be in the first, second, or third columns. Let's place Bike in the fifth column (5).
10. The person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae. Since Reggae is in the fourth column (4), Tomato can't be in the fifth column (5). Let's place Tomato in the second column (2).
11. The person driving the quad-bike is not the fan of techno. Since Quad-bike is in the third column (3), Techno can't be in the third column.
12. The person eating lime is not the fan of disco. Since Lime is in the fourth column (4), Disco can't be in the fourth column.
13. The person eating garlic is not to the left of the fan of ambient. Since Ambient is in the fifth column (5), Garlic can't be in the first, second, or fifth columns. Let's place Garlic in the third column (3).
14. The person driving the jet-ski is in an odd position. Since Van is in the first column (1), Jet-ski can't be in the first column. Let's place Jet-ski in the third column (3).
15. The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person eating garlic. Since Garlic is in the third column (3), the quad-bike can't be in the first or second columns.
16. The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance. Since Reggae is in the fourth column (4) and Trance can't be in the fourth column, Trance must be in the second column (2). This means Corn can't be in the first column (1). So, Corn must be in the fifth column (5).
17. The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the person eating corn. Since Corn is in the fifth column (5), Garlic can't be in the first column (1).
18. The person driving the bike is not to the left of the person eating garlic. Since Garlic is in the third column (3), the bike can't be in the first or second columns.
19. The fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since Quad-bike is in the third column (3), Reggae can't be in the first or second columns.
20. The fan of techno is not to the right of the person driving the bike. Since Bike is in the fifth column (5), Techno can't be in the fifth column.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |   5    |
| Food          | Van    | Corn     | Quad-bike| Reggae | Bike   |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient| Trance   | Disco    | Techno  | Tomato |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|           |         |        |        |

However, we still need to place the remaining food and transport. Since the person eating lime is not the fan of disco (Disco is in the first row), Lime can't be in the first column (1). Let's place Lime in the second column (2). Since the person driving the trike is not between the person eating tomato and the person eating lime (Tomato is in the second column (2) and Lime is in the second column (2)), the trike must be in the fifth column (5).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |   5    |
| Food          | Van    | Corn     | Quad-bike| Reggae | Bike   |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient| Trance   | Disco    | Techno  | Tomato |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|           |         |        | Trike  |
| Food          |           | Lime     |         |        |        |

But we still need to place the remaining food. Since the person eating garlic is not to the left of the person eating corn (Corn is in the fifth column (5)), the only remaining food, Radish, must be in the first column (1).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |   5    |
| Food          | Radish  | Corn     | Quad-bike| Reggae | Bike   |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient| Trance   | Disco    | Techno  | Tomato |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|           |         |        | Trike  |
| Food          | Lime    |           |         |        |        |

And that's the final solution!

Lv8-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, movie genres, and sports are different for each person, so we can fill in the table with unique symbols for each category. Let's use different letters for hobbies, different numbers for movie genres, and different animals for sports.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person with puzzles can't be next to climbing. So, let's assume that puzzles is in the middle (position 3).

3. From rule 2, we know that climbing is either to the left or right of video-games. Since puzzles is in the middle, video-games can't be in the middle, so it must be in position 1 or 5. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

4. From rule 3, we know that photography is not to the left of family movies. Since puzzles is in position 3, family movies can't be in positions 1 or 3. So, family movies must be in position 5.

12. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since basketball can't be in position 1, 2, or 4, puzzles can't be in position 1 or 2 either. So, puzzles must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since golf can't be in position 1, 2, or 4, and puzzles can't be in position 1 or 2, basketball can't be in position 1. So, basketball must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

14. From rule 13, we know that basketball can't be in position 1. So, if puzzles is in position 3, then basketball must be in position 5. If puzzles is in position 4 or 5, then basketball must be in position 1 or 3.

15. From rule 14, we know that the person watching mystery movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since puzzles can't be in position 1, mystery movies can't be in position 2. So, mystery movies must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

16. From rule 15, we know that mystery movies can't be in position 2. So, if puzzles is in position 3, then mystery movies must be in position 4 or 5. If puzzles is in position 4 or 5, then mystery movies must be in position 1 or 3.

17. From rule 16, we know that if puzzles is in position 3, then mystery movies can't be in position 4 or 5. So, mystery movies must be in position 1.

24. From rule 23, we know that if puzzles is in position 4, then mystery movies must be in position 5, and photography must be in position 3. So, fishing can't be in position 2 (since that would place fishing to the left of photography). So, fishing must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 6.

25. From rule 24, we know that if puzzles is in position 4, then fishing can't be in position 2. So, if puzzles is in position 4, then fishing must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 6. But we already know that fishing can't be in position 1 (since that would place fishing to the left of photography), and fishing can't be in position 3 (since that would place fishing to the left of puzzles). So, fishing must be in position 4 or 6.

26. From rule 25, we know that if puzzles is in position 4, then fishing can't be in position 1 or 3. So, if puzzles is in position 4, then fishing must be in position 6. But that would place fishing to the left of handball (which is in position 3). So, puzzles can't be in position 4.

27. From rule 26, we know that puzzles can't be in position 4. So, puzzles must be in position 5.

28. From rule 27, we know that puzzles is in position 5. So, mystery movies must be in position 1, and photography must be in position 3.

29. From rule 28, we know that mystery movies are in position 1, and photography is in position 3. So, fishing can't be in position 2 (since that would place fishing to the left of photography). So, fishing must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 6.

30. From rule 29, we know that fishing can't be in position 2. So, if puzzles is in position 5, then fishing must be in position 4 or 6. But we already know that fishing can't be in position 1 (since that would place fishing to the left of photography), and fishing can't be in position 3 (since that would place fishing to the left of puzzles). So, fishing must be in position 6.

31. From rule 30, we know that fishing is in position 6. So, the only remaining position for golf is position 3.

32. From rule 31, we know that golf is in position 3. So, the only remaining position for handball is position 4.

33. From rule 32, we know that handball is in position 4. So, the only remaining position for climbing is position 2.

34. From rule 33, we know that handball is in position 4. So, the only remaining position for time-travel movies is position 2.

35. From rule 34, we know that time-travel movies are in position 2. So, the only remaining position for basketball is position 1.

Lv8-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is to the right of the Brazilian. Let's place the Brazilian in the first position (1). Since the hobbies are different, the hobby of the Brazilian can't be camping, so it must be one of the remaining four hobbies (cooking, dancing, fishing, skydiving). Let's assume the Brazilian's hobby is cooking (1, Cooking).

2. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is camping is between the musician and the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the Brazilian is already in position 1 and his hobby is cooking, the only possible positions for camping and fishing are (2, Camping) and (3, Fishing).

3. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is dancing is the German. Since the Brazilian is in position 1 and his hobby is cooking, the German must be in position 5 (5, Dancing).

4. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the right of the chef. Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the chef must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the chef in position 2 (2, Chef). Now, the only possible position for skydiving is 5 (5, Skydiving).

5. From rule 11, the thai is on the left or right of the chef. Since the chef is in position 2, the thai can be in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the thai in position 3 (3, Thai).

6. From rule 17, the coach is the Thai. This contradicts our previous placement of the Thai in position 3, so the Thai must be in position 5 (5, Thai). Now, the coach must be in position 3 (3, Coach).

7. From rule 7, the coach is somewhere to the left of the chef. This means the chef must be in position 4 (4, Chef).

8. From rule 16, the indonesian is on the left of the British. Since the British can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the Indonesian can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the Brazilian), the Indonesian must be in position 1 (1, Indonesian).

9. From rule 19, the British is on the left or right of the firefighter. Since the Indonesian is in position 1, the British can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the British in position 2 (2, British).

10. From rule 5, the musician is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the skydiving person is in position 5, the musician can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the musician in position 1 (1, Musician).

11. From rule 15, the musician is not to the right of the Brazilian. This means the Brazilian must be in position 1 (1, Cooking) and the musician must be in position 3 (3, Musician).

12. From rule 20, the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the left of the musician. This means the musician must be in position 3 (3, Musician) and the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 5 (5, Cooking).

13. From rule 4, the chef is not to the left of the German. Since the German is in position 5 and the chef is in position 4, the hobby of the person in position 3 must not be cooking (it's the musician). The only remaining hobby for position 3 is fishing (3, Fishing).

14. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in position 2, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 1 (1, Camping).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |

| Nationality   | Indonesian|             |         |          |         |

  1. We still need to fill the jobs and nationalities. From rule 14, we know that the German is the dancer, so the dancer must be in position 5 (5, Dancing).

  2. From rule 17, the coach is the Thai, so the Thai is the coach (3, Coach).

  3. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is camping is to the right of the coach. Since the coach is in position 3, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 4 (4, Coach).

  4. From rule 10, the British is on the left or right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in position 2, the British can be in positions 1 or 2. Let's place the British in position 1 (1, British).

  5. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is dancing is the German. Since the German is in position 5, the job of the person in position 1 must be the job that's not the coach (chef, manager, or musician). Let's assume the job of the person in position 1 is a chef (1, Chef).

  6. From rule 8, the musician is not to the right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in position 1 and the musician is in position 3, the job of the person in position 2 must be the job that's not the firefighter (chef, manager, or musician). Let's assume the job of the person in position 2 is a manager (2, Manager).

  7. From rule 16, the Indonesian is on the left of the British. Since the British is in position 1, the Indonesian must be in position 2 (2, Indonesian).

  8. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the right of the chef. Since the chef is in position 1, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 5 (5, Skydiving).

  9. From rule 11, the thai is on the left or right of the chef. Since the chef is in position 1, the thai can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the thai in position 4 (4, Thai).

Now, let's put the final solution table with jobs and nationalities:

Lv8-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the American is in an odd position (4), they cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5. So, they must be in position 2 or 4.

2. The Chinese is in an even position (4) and is the baker. Since the American is not to the left of the baker (4), the American cannot be in position 2. So, the American is in position 4.

3. Now we know the American is in position 4. Since the American is to the left of the baker (Chinese), the Chinese must be in position 2.

4. The Chinese is the baker and is between the person drinking lemonade and the Japanese (7). Since the American is in position 4, the Japanese cannot be in position 1, so the Japanese must be in position 5.

5. The Japanese is in position 5, so the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.

6. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the American (5), so they cannot be in position 2 or 4. They must be in position 1 or 3. Since the Japanese is to the right of the person drinking lemonade, they cannot be in position 1. So, the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, and the person drinking tea is in position 3.

7. The Dutch is not to the left of the Chinese (2), so they must be in position 4 or 5. Since the Dutch cannot be to the left of the baker (2), they must be in position 5.

8. The person who's hobby is cooking is between the Dutch and the person who's hobby is fishing (7). Since the Dutch is in position 5, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 4, and the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the Chinese (2). Since the Chinese is in position 2, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks can be in position 1 or 3. However, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, so the person who's hobby is magic-tricks cannot be in position 1. So, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in position 3.

10. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (3), so they must be in position 4 or 5. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the person drinking 7up, they cannot be in position 4. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 5.

11. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (3), so they cannot be in position 1 or 3. They must be in position 2 or 4. Since the turkish is on the right of the person drinking tea, they cannot be in position 2. So, the person drinking tea is in position 4.
