Lv8-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From the given information, we know that there are 6 different items for each category (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Transport). Since there are only 2 people, each person must have 1 item from each category.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. Since there are 2 different beverages, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2. Let's assign Coffee to Person 1 and Iced-Tea to Person 2.

3. Now let's move to the Food column. Since there are 2 different foods, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2 as well. Let's assign Raspberry to Person 1 and Strawberry to Person 2.

4. Next, let's move to the Hobby column. Since there are 2 different hobbies, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2. Let's assign Board-Games to Person 1 and Singing to Person 2 (since Person 1 already has Raspberry, which is associated with Board-Games).

5. Now we have a conflict with rule 3, which states that the person who's hobby is singing is not the person watching drama movies. Since we have assigned Singing to Person 2 and there are only 2 movie genres, the other genre (Drama) must be assigned to Person 1.

6. Now let's move to the Job column. Since there are 2 different jobs, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2. Let's assign Dancer to Person 1 and Mechanic to Person 2 (since Person 1 already has Coffee and Raspberry, and Person 2 has Iced-Tea and Strawberry).

7. Now we have a conflict with rule 2, which states that the mechanic is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since we have assigned Mechanic to Person 2, the person driving the roller must be Person 1. So, let's assign the remaining job (which is not Dancer) to Person 1. The only job left is Tram, so Person 1 drives the Tram.

8. Now we have a conflict with rule 5, which states that the mechanic is not to the left of the person driving the roller. Since we have assigned Mechanic to Person 2 and Roller to Person 1, Person 2 cannot be to the left of Person 1. So, Person 2 must be to the right of Person 1.

9. Now let's move to the Nationality column. Since there are 2 different nationalities, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2. Let's assign Italian to Person 1 and Thai to Person 2 (since Person 1 already has Coffee, Raspberry, Board-Games, and Dancer/Tram, and Person 2 has Iced-Tea, Strawberry, Singing, and Mechanic).

10. Finally, let's move to the Transport column. Since there are 2 different means of transport, they must be assigned to Person 1 and Person 2. Since Person 1 already has all other items, the remaining transport (Roller) must be assigned to Person 2.

The final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Coffee     | Iced-Tea    |

Lv8-7x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the hiking person is not to the left of the mystery movie person. So, let's place the hiking person in the second column (column 2) and the mystery movie person in the first column (column 1).

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      |               |               |

   | Sport         |               |               |

2. From rule 2, the hot-chocolate drinker is to the left of the social-worker. Since the hiking person is already in the second column, the social-worker must be in the first column. So, let's place the hot-chocolate drinker in the first column and the social-worker in the second column.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Social-Worker |

   | Sport         |               |               |

3. From rule 3, the italian is to the right of the british. Since we have already placed the social-worker (who could be either nationality), let's assume the social-worker is British for now. This means the italian must be in the second column.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Social-Worker |

   | Sport         |               |               |

4. From rule 4, the hiking person is not the lemon eater. Since we have already placed the hiking person, the lemon eater must be in the second column.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Social-Worker |
   | Food          |               | Lemon        |
   | Hobby         | Hiking        |               |

   | Movie-Genre   | Mystery      |               |
   | Nationality   | Italian      |               |
   | Sport         |               |               |

5. From rule 5, the adventure movie person is on the left of the water-polo player. Since we have already placed the hot-chocolate drinker and the social-worker, the adventure movie person must be in the first column.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Social-Worker |

   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure   | Mystery      |
   | Nationality   | Italian     |               |
   | Sport         |               | Water-Polo   |

6. Now, we have only one beverage left, sprite. Since we have already placed hot-chocolate, the remaining person must be drinking sprite. Let's place sprite in the second column.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Sprite       |

   | Sport         |               | Water-Polo   |

7. The remaining category is sport. Since we have already placed water-polo, the remaining sport must be baseball. Let's place baseball in the second row, under the sport category.

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Sprite       |

   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure   | Mystery      |
   | Nationality   | Italian     |               |

8. Now, we have filled all the categories. The final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |       2       |
   | Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Sprite       |

Lv8-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two options for each category, we can start by filling in one cell with the unique option. Let's start with the Beverage column, as we know there are two different beverages: cola and water. We'll place water in the first row since it's on the left according to the first rule.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water     | cola      |

2. Now we know the person drinking water is in the first row, so the person drinking cola must be in the second row.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water     | cola      |
| Food          | cucumber  | pear      |

3. The person eating pear cannot be on the left of the person drinking water (according to the first rule), so the person eating pear must be in the second row.

| Beverage      | water     | cola      |
| Food          | cucumber  | pear      |

4. Now we know the positions of the person drinking water and the person eating pear. Since there are only two types of food, the person eating cucumber must be in the first row.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | water     | cola      |

Lv8-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 movie genres, 2 music genres, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, and 2 means of transport. This means that each row in the table represents a different category.

2. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - Sprite and soy-milk are in different columns (different beverages). Let's label the columns A and B for these beverages.
   - Gardening and photography are in different rows (different hobbies). Let's label the rows 1 and 2 for these hobbies.
   - Adventure and spy are in different rows (different movie genres). Let's label the rows 1 and 2 for these movie genres as well (since we've already assigned row 2 to photography).
   - Electronic and metal are in different columns (different music genres). Let's label the columns A and B for these music genres.
   - Indonesian and Turkish are in different rows (different nationalities). Let's label the rows 1 and 2 for these nationalities.
   - Goat and rat are in different columns (different pets). Let's label the columns A and B for these pets.
   - Taxi and van are in different rows (different means of transport). Let's label the rows 1 and 2 for these means of transport.

3. Now let's use the clues to fill in the table:
   - The person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening is in row 2, sprite cannot be in column A of row 2. So, sprite must be in column B of row 1 or 2.
   - The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the right of the indonesian. Since Indonesian is in row 1, gardening must be in column A of row 2 or higher.
   - The fan of electronic is on the far left. Since electronic is in column A, it must be in row 1.
   - The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since taxi is in row 1, adventure must be in column B of row 2 or higher.
   - The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat. Since goat is in column A, soy-milk must be in column B of row 1 or lower.

4. Now we have some possible positions for each category:
   - Beverage: Sprite in column B of row 1 or 2, Soy-milk in column B of row 1 or lower
   - Hobby: Gardening in column A of row 2 or higher
   - Movie-Genre: Adventure in column B of row 2 or higher, Spy in row 2
   - Music-Genre: Electronic in row 1, Metal in column A of row 1 or 2
   - Nationality: Indonesian in row 1, Turkish in row 2
   - Pet: Goat in column A, Rat in column B
   - Transport: Taxi in row 1, Van in row 2

5. To find the exact positions, we can use the remaining clues:
   - Since the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening, sprite cannot be in row 1. So, sprite is in column B of row 2.
   - Since the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the right of the indonesian, gardening must be in row 3 or higher. But since sprite is in row 2, gardening must be in row 3.
   - Since the fan of electronic is on the far left, and the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening, electronic cannot be in row 2. So, electronic is in row 1.
   - Since the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person driving the taxi, and the person drinking sprite is not in row 1, adventure must be in row 3 or higher. But since gardening is in row 3, adventure must be in row 4.
   - Since the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat, and the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person driving the taxi, soy-milk cannot be in row 2 or 3. So, soy-milk is in row 1.

6. Now we have the final solution:

   |               |      1      |     2     |     3     |     4     |
   | Beverage      | Soy-milk   | Sprite    |           |           |
   | Hobby         |           |           | Gardening  |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |           |           | Adventure  |
   | Music-Genre   | Electronic  | Metal     |           |           |
   | Nationality   | Indonesian | Turkish   |           |           |
   | Pet           |           | Rat       |           | Goat      |
   | Transport     | Taxi       | Van       |           |           |

Lv8-7x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 different items for each category (beverage, food, job, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport). Since there are 2 for each, we can fill in the first two columns with the following:

   |               |     1     |       2       |
   | Beverage      | coffee    | cola         |
   | Food          | lettuce   | peas         |
   | Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep   | trance       |
   | Nationality   | canadian  | thai         |
   | Pet           | goldfish  | pony         |
   | Sport         | snowboarding| surfing      |

2. From point 1, the social-worker is Thai, so we know the Thai is in the second row. Since the social-worker is on the right of the person eating peas, the person eating peas must be in the first column. So, the table now looks like:

   |               |     1     |       2       |
   | Beverage      | coffee    | cola         |
   | Food          | lettuce   | peas         |
   | Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep   | trance       |
   | Nationality   | canadian  | thai         |
   | Pet           | goldfish  | pony         |
   | Sport         | snowboarding| surfing      |

3. From point 3, the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the fan of trance. Since the Thai (social-worker) is in the second column, the goldfish owner must be in the first column. So, the table now looks like:

   |               |     1     |       2       |
   | Beverage      | coffee    | cola         |
   | Food          | lettuce   | peas         |
   | Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep   | trance       |
   | Nationality   | canadian  | thai         |
   | Pet           | goldfish  | pony         |
   | Sport         | snowboarding| surfing      |

4. From point 4, the person drinking coffee is on the far right. Since the Thai (social-worker) and the goldfish owner are already in the second and first columns respectively, the person drinking coffee must be in the third column. So, the table now looks like:

   |               |     1     |       2       |
   | Beverage      | coffee    | cola         |
   | Food          | lettuce   | peas         |
   | Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep   | trance       |
   | Nationality   | canadian  | thai         |
   | Pet           | goldfish  | pony         |
   | Sport         | snowboarding| surfing      |

5. From point 5, the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since the goldfish owner (first column) and the person drinking coffee (third column) are already placed, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in the second column. So, the table now looks like:

   |               |     1     |       2       |
   | Beverage      | coffee    | cola         |
   | Food          | lettuce   | peas         |
   | Job           | paramedic | social-worker|
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep   | trance       |
   | Nationality   | canadian  | thai         |
   | Pet           | goldfish  | pony         |
   | Sport         | snowboarding| surfing      |

Now, the table is filled correctly according to the given conditions.

Lv8-7x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 items in each row, and we have 7 conditions. This means one condition will be redundant, so we can ignore it (#6 in this case).

2. Let's start by placing the nationalities. Since the Indonesian is not watching disaster movies (#5), they can't be in the second column. So, the first column must contain the American.

3. Now, let's place the jobs. The bartender is to the right of the person watching disaster movies (#2), so they can't be in the first column. The second column can't have the Indonesian, so the bartender must be in the third column.

4. The person watching sports movies can be in either the first or third column, but not the second (because of the Indonesian and the bartender). Let's place them in the first column for now.

5. The person watching disaster movies can't be the Indonesian (#5), so they must be in the second column.

6. The person drinking soy-milk can't be to the left of the person playing badminton (#3), so they can't be in the first column. The second column is occupied by the person watching disaster movies, so the person drinking soy-milk must be in the third column.

7. The person playing badminton can't be to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (#3), so they must be in the first column.

8. The owner of the lizard can't be to the left of the American (#4), so they must be in the second or third column. Since the first column is occupied by the person playing badminton and the second column by the person watching disaster movies, the owner of the lizard must be in the third column.

9. The owner of the turtle can't be to the right of the owner of the lizard (#1), so they must be in the first column.

10. The only food left is pumpkin, so it must be in the second column.

11. The only movie genre left is sports, so it must be in the first column (as it was placed earlier).

12. The only pet left is a lizard, so it must be in the third column.

13. The only sport left is water-polo, so it must be in the second column.

14. The only beverage left is 7up, so it must be in the first column.

The final solution table is:

Lv8-7x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the architect is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. This means the architect can only be in position 1 (left) or 2 (top). Let's assume the architect is in position 1 (left).

2. From rule 5, the architect is to the right of the Dutch person. So, the Dutch person must be in position 2 (top).

3. From rule 3, the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the architect (who could be watching satire movies) is in position 1, and the hedgehog owner cannot be the Dutch person (who is in position 2), the satire movie watcher must be in position 2 (top). This means the hedgehog owner is in position 1 (left).

4. From rule 4, the person watching drama movies is somewhere to the right of the writer. Since the writer is the Dutch person (in position 2), the drama movie watcher must be in position 3 (bottom left) or 4 (bottom right).

5. From rule 6, the person eating nectarine is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we know the positions of the architect, Dutch, satire movie watcher, and hedgehog owner, the only remaining person who could be eating nectarine is the one in position 3 (bottom left). So, the sport of the person in position 3 must be something other than lacrosse.

6. Now, let's consider the hobbies. We know the hobby of the person in position 1 (left) is not baking (because the architect is not to the right of the baker), so the hobby of the person in position 1 must be sudoku. This means the hobby of the person in position 2 (top) must be baking.

7. For the jobs, the architect is in position 1 (left), and the writer is in position 2 (top). So, the job of the person in position 3 (bottom left) must be the other job, which is architect (since the architect cannot be in position 3). This means the job of the person in position 4 (bottom right) must be writer.

8. For the food, since the architect is eating nectarine (in position 3), the food of the person in position 1 (left) must be blueberry. The food of the person in position 2 (top) is the remaining food, which is nectarine.

9. For the pets, since the hedgehog owner is in position 1 (left), the pet of the person in position 2 (top) must be the other pet, which is a turtle.

10. For the movie-genres, since the satire movie watcher is in position 1 (left), the genre of the person in position 2 (top) must be drama. The genre of the person in position 3 (bottom left) is the other genre, which is satire.

11. For the sport, since the person in position 3 (bottom left) is the architect (who cannot play lacrosse), the sport of the person in position 4 (bottom right) must be lacrosse.

Lv8-7x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the Japanese is not the person doing weightlifting, so they can be in any of the other positions. Let's assume the Japanese is in position 1 (nationality).

2. From rule 2, the person eating mango is not watching family movies, so they can't be in position 2 (Food). This means the mango eater is in position 1. So, the person eating nectarine is in position 2 (Food).

3. From rule 3, the punk fan is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the Japanese is in position 1 and we know the punk fan can't be the Japanese (from rule 6), the punk fan must be in position 2 (Job). This means the job of the person in position 1 is not punk, so it must be either fisherman or pilot. Since the pilot is to the right of the punk fan (rule 6), the person in position 1 is a fisherman.

4. From rule 4, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person watching family movies. Since the family movie watcher is the mango eater (rule 7), the snowmobile driver can't be in position 2 (Transport). So, the snowmobile driver is in position 1 (Transport). This means the person driving the ship is in position 2 (Transport).

5. From rule 5, the snowmobile driver is not to the right of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is in position 1, the snowmobile driver can't be in position 2. So, the snowmobile driver is in position 1 (Sport). This means the weightlifter is in position 2 (Sport).

6. From rule 7, the person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating mango. So, the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 1 (Movie-Genre). This means the family movie watcher is in position 2 (Movie-Genre).

7. From rule 8, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person watching family movies. Since the family movie watcher is in position 2 (Movie-Genre), the snowmobile driver is in position 1 (Transport). This is a contradiction, as we already placed the snowmobile driver in position 1. This means our initial assumption that the Japanese is in position 1 is incorrect. Let's try placing the Japanese in position 2 instead.

8. With the Japanese in position 2 (Nationality), the mango eater must be in position 1 (Food), and the nectarine eater is in position 2 (Food). The punk fan is still in position 2 (Job), and the fisherman is in position 1 (Job). The family movie watcher is in position 1 (Movie-Genre), and the martial-arts movie watcher is in position 2 (Movie-Genre). The snowmobile driver is in position 1 (Transport), and the person driving the ship is in position 2 (Transport). This arrangement satisfies all the rules.

Lv8-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two types of food, two hobbies, two jobs, two movie-genres, two music-genres, two sports, and two means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 2 for each category.

2. From point 1, we can fill in the first row (Food) as follows:
   | Food          | Carrot | Cauliflower |

3. From point 2, we can fill in the second row (Hobby) as follows:
   | Hobby         | Magic-tricks | Fishing |

4. From point 3, we know that the person who does magic-tricks is not to the right of the person who does handball. Since the person who does fishing is on the far right (point 5), the person who does handball must be in the first column. So, we can fill in the second column as follows:
   | Hobby         | Magic-tricks | Fishing |
   |              | 2           | 1       |

5. From point 4, we know that the person who watches documentaries is not to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the person who does handball (point 6) drives the airplane, the person who watches documentaries must be in the first column. So, we can fill in the first column as follows:
   | Hobby         | Magic-tricks | Fishing |
   | Documentary  | 2           | 1       |

6. From point 6, we know that the person who does handball drives the airplane. So, we can fill in the Transport row as follows:
   | Transport     | Airplane | Taxi |
   |              | 2       | 1    |

7. From point 5, we know that the person who does handball is not to the right of the dressmaker. Since the person who does fishing is on the far right, the person who does handball must be in the first column. The only remaining job is pilot, so we can fill in the Job row as follows:
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Pilot |
   |              | 1         | 2    |

8. From point 7, we know that the person who does fishing is not to the left of the person who likes hip-hop. Since the person who does magic-tricks is in the first column, the person who likes hip-hop must be in the second column. So, we can fill in the Music-Genre row as follows:
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop | Rock |
   |              | 2      | 1   |

9. From point 8, we know that the person who likes rock is not to the left of the person who does cauliflower. Since the person who does fishing is in the second column, the person who does cauliflower must be in the first column. So, we can fill in the Food row as follows:
   | Food          | Carrot | Cauliflower |
   |              | 1      | 2          |

10. From point 6, we know that the person who does handball is the person who drives the airplane. Since the person who does handball is in the first column, the person who does handball must be in the first row. So, we can fill in the Sport row as follows:
    | Sport         | Handball | Tennis |
    |              | 1       | 2      |

11. From point 1, we know that there are two types of food. Since we have already filled in the Food row, the second type of food must be Tennis. So, we can fill in the Movie-Genre row as follows:
    | Movie-Genre   | Animation | Documentary |
    |              | 1        | 2          |

Lv8-7x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two types of food, two hobbies, two jobs, two movie-genres, two music-genres, two nationalities, and two sports. So, we can fill the first row with the two food options, the second row with the two hobby options, the third row with the two job options, the fourth row with the two movie-genre options, the fifth row with the two music-genre options, the sixth row with the two nationality options, and the seventh row with the two sport options.

2. From the first constraint (the person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the doctor), we can place the doctor and the person with the hobby of photography in such a way that the doctor is not to the right of the photography column. Since there are only two columns, the doctor cannot be in the second column, so he must be in the first column. Let's place the doctor in the first row, first column (Food). This leaves the second row, first column for the person with the hobby of photography.

3. From the second constraint (the colombian is not to the left of the person eating asparagus), we know that the colombian cannot be in the first column (since the doctor is there). So, the colombian must be in the second column. Since the doctor is in the first row, first column, the person eating asparagus must be in the first row, second column. This leaves the second row, second column for the colombian.

4. From the third constraint (the person eating carrot is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus), we know that the person eating carrot must be in the first column. Since the doctor and the colombian are already placed, the person eating carrot must be in the first row, first column (Food).

5. From the fourth constraint (the person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the doctor), we know that the adventure movies column cannot be to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in the first row, first column, the adventure movies column must be in the second row, first column (Hobby). This leaves the second row, second column for the disaster movies.

6. From the fifth constraint (the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of indie), we know that the indie music column must be to the left of the disaster movies column. Since the adventure movies column is already placed, the indie music column must be in the second row, second column (Hobby). This leaves the second row, first column for the reggae music.

7. From the sixth constraint (the doctor is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling), we know that the cycling sport must be to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in the first row, first column, the cycling sport must be in the first row, second column (Hobby). This leaves the first row, second column for the biathlon sport.
