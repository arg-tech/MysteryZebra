Lv8-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), we can rule out position 2 and 4 for sudoku.

2. The person eating radish is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling can't be in position 4 (as radish can't be in position 1), the cyclist must be in position 1. So, radish can only be in position 2, 3, or 5.

3. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the skiing person can't be in position 2, 3, or 4. So, skiing must be in position 5.

4. The person who's sport is cycling is not the person eating radish. Since the cyclist is in position 1, radish can't be in position 1. So, radish can only be in position 2 or 3.

5. The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating apple. Since the cyclist is in position 1 and the radish eater can't be in position 1, the apple eater must be in position 1. So, pepper can only be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the sudoku person can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the sudoku person must be in position 4 or 5. Since the sudoku person is in an odd position, it must be in position 1 or 3. But we already placed the cyclist and radish eater in positions 1 and 2, so the sudoku person must be in position 5.

7. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the left of the person eating kale. Since the skiing person is in position 5, the kale eater can't be in position 4. So, the kale eater must be in position 2 or 3.

8. The person eating kale is not the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the volleyball player can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the volleyball player must be in position 4 or 5.

9. The person eating apple is not the person who's hobby is writing. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the writing person can't be in position 1. So, the writing person must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person who's hobby is writing. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the ice-hockey player can't be in position 1. So, the ice-hockey player must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already placed the cyclist, radish eater, and skiing person, so the ice-hockey player must be in position 4.

11. The person eating kale is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the skiing person is in position 5, the kale eater can't be in position 3 or 5. So, the kale eater must be in position 2.

12. The person eating kale is in an even position. Since the kale eater is in position 2, this condition is satisfied.

13. The person eating radish is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the cyclist is in position 1, the volleyball player can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the volleyball player must be in position 4.

14. The person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the skiing person is in position 5 and the sudoku person is in position 5, this condition is satisfied.

Now, let's put the final solution:

Lv8-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the librarian is not to the right of the pilot. This means the Librarian cannot be in columns 3 or 4.

2. The person drinking milk is on the far left, so it must be in column 1. Let's place it there and mark the job of the person drinking milk (M).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the librarian and pilot are already placed, the only possible positions for badminton and ice-hockey are columns 2 and 3. Let's place badminton in column 2 (B) and ice-hockey in column 3 (I).

4. The person drinking water is the freelancer (F). Since the librarian and pilot are already placed, and the person drinking milk is in column 1, the only possible position for the freelancer is column 4 (W).

5. The electrician is not the person drinking milk (M). Since the person drinking milk is in column 1, the electrician cannot be in column 1. The only remaining columns for the electrician are 2 and 3. However, since the person drinking milk is to the left of the electrician (according to rule 7), the electrician cannot be in column 3 (I). So, the electrician must be in column 2 (E).

6. The person drinking coffee (C) must be in column 1, 2, or 4, as it is to the left of the person drinking water (W) and to the right of the person doing weightlifting (L) (according to rule 8 and 10). Since the librarian (L) is already in column 3, and the electrician (E) is in column 2, the only possible position for coffee is column 1.

7. Now we know the positions of all the people and their jobs. The sports can be placed based on the rules given. For example, since the person doing badminton (B) is to the right of the person drinking coffee (C), the person doing weightlifting (L) must be to the right of the person doing badminton (B), and the person doing ice-hockey (I) must be to the right of the person doing weightlifting (L). So, the sports can be placed as B-L-I.

Lv8-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different hobbies, music-genres, and means of transport. Let's assign a number from 1 to 4 to each of them for each category.

   Hobbies: [1: card-games, 2: filmmaking, 3: reading, 4: sudoku]
   Music-Genres: [1: blues, 2: country, 3: d&b, 4: techno]
   Transport: [1: airplane, 2: roller, 3: tram, 4: van]

2. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person driving the van. So, let's place the van driver (V) and the card-games person (C) in positions 1 and 2 or 3 and 4. Since the hobbies are different, we can't have them in the same row. Let's place them in positions 1 and 2:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | C       |            |        |            |
   | Music-Genre   |          |            |        |            |
   | Transport     | V       |            |        |            |

3. From rule 2, the person driving the roller (R) is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram (T). Since the transport is different, R can't be in position 1 or 4. So, let's place T in position 1 and R in position 3:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | C       |            | R      |            |
   | Music-Genre   |          |            |        |            |
   | Transport     | V       | T          |        |            |

4. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the fan of techno (T). Since the hobbies are different, the card-games person (C) can't be in position 1 or 4. So, let's place the techno fan (T) in position 1:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | T       | C          | R      |            |
   | Music-Genre   | techno  |            |        |            |
   | Transport     | V       |            | T      |            |

5. From rule 4, the fan of country (Cn) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van (V). Since the transport is different, Cn can't be in position 4. So, let's place Cn in position 2:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | T       | Cn         | R      |            |
   | Music-Genre   | techno  | country    |        |            |
   | Transport     | V       |            | T      |            |

6. From rule 5, the person driving the airplane (A) is not the fan of blues (B). Since the music-genres are different, A can't be in position 1 or 4. So, let's place B in position 1:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | B       | Cn         | R      |            |
   | Music-Genre   | blues   | country    |        |            |
   | Transport     | V       |            | T      |            |

7. From rule 6, the fan of blues (B) is on the left of the person driving the van (V). So, B must be in position 1 and V in position 2:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | B       | V          | R      |            |
   | Music-Genre   | blues   |            |        |            |
   | Transport     |        |            | T      |            |

8. From rule 7, the fan of blues (B) is not to the right of the fan of techno (T). So, T can't be in position 3 or 4. Since T is already in position 3, B can't be in position 4. So, B must be in position 2:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | B       | V          | T      |            |
   | Music-Genre   | blues   |            | techno  |            |
   | Transport     |        |            |        |            |

9. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is sudoku (S) is on the left of the fan of d&b (D). Since the hobbies are different, S can't be in position 1 or 4. So, let's place D in position 1:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | D       | V          | T      | S          |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b    |            | techno  |            |
   | Transport     |        |            |        |            |

10. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is filmmaking (F) is in an even position. The only even positions left are 2 and 4. Since F can't be in position 4 (because of rule 8), F must be in position 2:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | D       | F          | T      | S          |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b    | filmmaking | techno  |            |
   | Transport     |        |            |        |            |

11. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is sudoku (S) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller (R). Since the transport is different, S can't be in position 4. So, S must be in position 3:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | D       | F          | R      | S          |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b    | filmmaking | techno  | sudoku     |
   | Transport     |        |            |        |            |

Now, we have filled all the positions with the given conditions. However, we still need to fill the missing Transport, Music-Genre columns. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact positions for these, we can't fill them completely.

The final table with the filled hobbies looks like this:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | D       | F          | R      | S          |
   | Music-Genre   | ######## | ########  | ######## | ######## |
   | Transport     | ######## | ########  | ######## | ######## |

The final table with the filled hobbies and the known conditions is:

   |               |    1     |     2      |   3    |     4      |
   | Hobby         | D       | F          | R      | S          |
   | Music-Genre   | blues   | filmmaking | techno  | sudoku     |
   | Transport     | airplane| roller    | tram    | van        |

However, the Music-Genre and Transport columns are still incomplete due to insufficient information."	{}	False	0	False
Lv8-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different movie-genres (crime, horror, mystery, thriller) and 4 different music-genres (dubstep, folk, jazz, pop). There are also 4 different nationalities (chinese, colombian, german, thai).

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the columns:
   - Column 1: Chinese
   - Column 2: Colombian
   - Column 3: German
   - Column 4: Thai

3. Now let's assign the movie-genres to the rows:
   - Row 1: Crime (since it's on the far left)
   - Row 2: (We don't know yet)
   - Row 3: Thriller (since the german is watching it)
   - Row 4: (We don't know yet)

4. Let's assign the music-genres to the rows:
   - Row 1: (We don't know yet)
   - Row 2: Folk (since the colombian is not to the left of it)
   - Row 3: (We don't know yet)
   - Row 4: Pop (since the person watching horror movies is on the left of the fan of pop)

5. Now let's fill in the remaining movie-genres:
   - Row 1: Horror (since the person watching horror movies is not to the right of the colombian and the colombian is in column 2)
   - Row 3: Mystery (since the fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies and the fan of jazz is not assigned yet)

6. Now let's fill in the remaining music-genres:
   - Row 1: Dubstep (since it's somewhere to the right of the fan of folk and the fan of folk is in column 2)
   - Row 3: Jazz (since it's somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies and the person watching thriller movies is in column 3)

7. Now we have filled all the cells with the correct information:

|               |     Chinese    |     Colombian    |      German      |     Thai     |
| Movie-Genre   |         |          |           |         |

| Movie-Genre   | Crime    | Horror  | Thriller | Mystery |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Folk    | Jazz     | Pop     |
| Nationality   |         |         |         |         |

8. However, we still don't know the nationality of the person watching mystery movies. Since the fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies and the german is watching thriller movies, the person watching mystery movies must be chinese.

9. So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different hobbies, movie genres, and sports. So, each row and each column must contain one unique item from each category.

2. From rule 3, the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right. Since there are only 4 columns, this means Fantasy is in the rightmost column.

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. So, Gardening must be in the leftmost column.

4. From rule 5, the person watching western movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. So, Western is in the second column from the right.

5. From rule 6, the person watching western movies is not the person who's hobby is hiking. Since Western is in the second column from the right and there are only 4 columns, Hiking must be in the third column.

6. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since Basketball can't be in the first column (because Gardening is there), it must be in the second column. This means Card-games is in the first column.

7. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since Hiking is in the third column, Reading must be in the fourth column.

8. From rule 8, the person watching scientific movies is the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since Lacrosse can't be in the first three columns (because we've placed other sports there), it must be in the fourth column. This means Scientific movies are in the second row.

9. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is card-games is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we've placed Lacrosse in the fourth column, Card-games must be in one of the first three columns. But it can't be in the second column because that's where Basketball and Scientific movies are. So, Card-games must be in the first column.

10. From rule 10, the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we've placed Hiking in the third column, Snowboarding must be in the third row.

11. From rule 9, the person watching sports movies is not to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since Card-games is in the first column, Sports movies can't be in the second, third, or fourth columns. So, Sports movies must be in the first row.

12. The only sport left is baseball. Since it can't be in the first row (because Sports movies are there), it must be in the second row. But the second row is already filled with Scientific movies and Lacrosse. So, there seems to be a contradiction with rule 8 (Lacrosse is Scientific movies) and rule 11 (Sports movies is not to the right of Card-games). This puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved as stated.

Final solution table (with the inconsistency):

Lv8-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating plum is not to the left of the person watching action movies. Let's place the action movies and plum in the last two columns (2 and 4) to ensure this condition is met.

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Food          |             |           |        |           |

   | Nationality   |             |           |        |           |

2. From rule 2, we know that the person watching horror movies is not the Brazilian. Since we placed action movies and plum in the last two columns, the only remaining genre for the Brazilian is crime (in column 2). So, let's place the Brazilian in column 2, watching crime movies.

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Food          |             | crime    |        | plum     |

   | Nationality   |             | brazilian|        |           |

3. From rule 3, we know that the Colombian is somewhere between the person eating grapes and the person watching horror movies. Since we placed the Brazilian and the person watching horror movies, the Colombian must be either eating grapes or in column 3. Let's place the Colombian in column 3, watching action movies (as per rule 6).

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |

   | Nationality   | colombian  | brazilian|        |           |

4. From rule 5, we know that the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person eating potato. Since the Colombian is watching action movies, the potato can only be in column 1 or 4. Let's place the potato in column 1.

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |

   | Nationality   | colombian  | brazilian|        |           |

5. From rule 7, we know that the person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since we have placed all the other foods, the only remaining food for the person watching documentary movies is blueberry (in column 3).

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |

   | Nationality   | colombian  | brazilian|           |           |

6. From rule 8, we know that the Dutch is between the person eating blueberry and the Colombian. Since the Colombian is in column 3 and the blueberry is in column 3, the Dutch must be in column 2.

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Food          | potato     | dutch    | blueberry| plum     |

   | Nationality   | colombian  | dutch     |           |           |

7. From rule 9, we know that the person watching horror movies is not to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since we have placed the Dutch and the blueberry, the American must be in column 1 (as per rule 11).

   |               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |
   | Food          | potato     | dutch    | blueberry| plum     |
   | Movie-Genre   | american  |           | documentary | horror  |
   | Nationality   | colombian  | dutch     |           | brazilian|

8. From rule 10, we know that the person eating plum is not to the right of the person eating potato. Since we have placed the potato in column 1 and the plum in column 4, this condition is already met.

Now, let's check rule 4 again, which states that the American is somewhere to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since we have placed the American in column 1 and the Brazilian (watching crime movies) in column 2, this condition is also met.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, each watching a different movie genre, so we can fill in the Movie-Genre column with A (Adventure), M (Musical), S (Scientific), and S' (Spy, since we've used S for Scientific).

2. Similarly, there are 4 nationalities, so we can fill in the Nationality column with C (Chinese), I (Indonesian), M' (Malaysian, since we've used M for Musical), and P (Polish).

3. There are 4 means of transport, so we can fill in the Transport column with C (Car), T (Taxi), T' (Train, since we've used T for Tram), and T'' (Tram, since we've used T' for Train).

Now let's solve the clues:

1. A is to the right of M'.
2. C is not S'.
3. C is between M' and T'.
4. S' is to the right of T.
5. A is to the left or right of M'.
6. T' is to the right of T.
7. T' is not P.
8. S is not to the right of P.
9. P is not to the left of T'.
10. T is somewhere to the right of T''.
11. S is not to the left of P.
12. S' is not to the left of T.
13. S' is somewhere to the right of T.

From clue 5, we know A and M' are not adjacent, so A cannot be in the first or last position. Since A is to the right of M', A can only be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

From clues 1, 5, and 13, we know A cannot be in the 4th position. So, A must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

From clue 3, if A is in the 2nd position, C must be in the 1st position, and M' in the 4th position. But this violates clue 10, as T' would be to the left of T. So, A must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 1, A is to the right of M', so M' must be in the 2nd position.

From clue 3, C is between M' and T', so C must be in the 1st position.

From clue 2, C is not S', so S' cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. So, S' must be in the 4th position.

From clue 4, S' is to the right of T, so T must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 6, T' is to the right of T, so T' must be in the 4th position.

From clue 7, T' is not P, so P cannot be in the 4th position. So, P must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. But P cannot be in the 1st position because of clue 9 (P is not to the left of T'). So, P must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

From clue 11, S is not to the left of P, so S cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, S must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 8, S is not to the right of P, so P must be in the 2nd position.

From clue 12, S' is not to the left of T, so T cannot be in the 1st position. So, T must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 10, T is somewhere to the right of T'', so T'' must be in the 1st position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 5, we know that the person eating lime is to the right of the person drinking fanta. Let's place lime in the fourth column and fanta in the third column.

2. From point 8, we know that the person eating lime is between the fan of rock and the person drinking fanta. So, the fan of rock must be in the second column. Let's place rock in the second column.

3. From point 9, we know that the person eating lime is to the left of the fan of rock. This means that fanta must be in the first column.

4. From point 1, we know that the person eating cucumber is to the right of the person eating lime. So, cucumber must be in the fifth column.

5. From point 2, we know that the person eating asparagus is between the person eating lime and the person eating cucumber. So, asparagus must be in the second or third column. Since it can't be in the second column (because rock is there), it must be in the third column.

6. From point 6, we know that the person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that iced-tea must be in the first, second, or fifth column. Since it can't be in the first column (because fanta is there) and it can't be in the fifth column (because cucumber is there), it must be in the second column.

7. From point 3, we know that the fan of pop is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since soy-milk hasn't been placed yet, it can only be in the first, second, or fourth column. Since it can't be in the first column (because fanta is there) and it can't be in the fourth column (because lime is there), it must be in the second column. But this contradicts the fact that iced-tea is in the second column. So, pop must be in the fourth column.

8. From point 4, we know that the fan of pop is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since soy-milk is in the second column, pop must be in the first column. But this contradicts the fact that pop is in the fourth column. There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the person drinking soy-milk is actually in the third column instead of the second column (which is not explicitly stated in the puzzle), then the puzzle can be solved:

| Beverage      | fanta | iced-tea | soy-milk | pop |
| Food          | lime  | asparagus | cucumber |   |
| Music-Genre   | rock  | jazz     |   | house |

In this solution, the person eating lime is the fan of jazz, the person eating asparagus is somewhere between the person eating lime and the person eating cucumber, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the fan of pop (which is now in the first column), the fan of pop is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk (which is now in the third column), the person eating lime is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta, and the person eating cucumber is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime."	{'beverage': ['fanta', 'iced-tea', 'soy-milk', 'pop'], 'food': ['lime', 'asparagus', 'cucumber', ''], 'music-genre': ['rock', 'jazz', '', 'house']}	True	2	False
Lv8-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 hobbies, nationalities, and means of transport. Let's assign a number from 1 to 4 to each hobby, nationality, and transport. We'll use the same number for each category.

2. From rule 4, the person driving the helicopter is on the far left, so Hobby1 (let's say magic-tricks) is in column 1.

3. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right. Since Hobby1 is on the far left, Hobby3 (let's say drawing) must be in column 4.

4. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right. Since Hobby3 is in column 4, Hobby2 (let's say fishing) must be in column 1, and Hobby4 (let's say woodworking) must be in column 2 or 3.

5. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. So, Hobby2 (fishing) cannot be in column 2 or 3. Therefore, Hobby2 (fishing) is in column 1.

6. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the right of the person driving the car. Since Hobby1 (magic-tricks) is in column 1, the person driving the car must be in column 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 4, the person driving the helicopter is in column 1, so the person driving the car cannot be in column 1. Therefore, the person driving the car is in column 2, 3, or 4.

7. From rule 7, the pakistani is on the left or right of the german. Since the german cannot be in column 1 (because the person driving the helicopter is there), the german must be in column 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 6, the person driving the car is in column 2, so the german cannot be in column 2. Therefore, the german is in column 3 or 4.

8. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since Hobby2 (fishing) is in column 1, the person driving the subway must be in column 2, 3, or 4. But from rule 4, the person driving the helicopter is in column 1, and the person driving the car is in column 2, so the person driving the subway cannot be in column 1 or 2. Therefore, the person driving the subway is in column 3 or 4.

9. From rule 13, the german is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since Hobby2 (fishing) is in column 1, and the german is in column 3 or 4, the german must be in column 3.

10. From rule 11, the german is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the german is in column 3, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in column 4.

11. From rule 10, the person driving the ship is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since Hobby2 (fishing) is in column 1, and the person who's hobby is woodworking is in column 4, the person driving the ship must be in column 2 or 3. But from rule 6, the person driving the car is in column 2, so the person driving the ship cannot be in column 2. Therefore, the person driving the ship is in column 3.

12. From rule 2, the pakistani is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the malaysian. Since the person driving the subway is in column 3 and the malaysian must be in column 4 (because the person who's hobby is woodworking is in column 4), the pakistani must be in column 2.

13. Now we have filled all the columns:

Lv8-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the mechanic drinks iced-tea (from rule 3), so we can place the iced-tea in the third row. Let's assume it's in column 3 for now.

2. Since the coach is not the person drinking almond-milk (rule 2), almond-milk can't be in the same column as the mechanic (iced-tea). So, almond-milk can't be in column 3. Let's place it in column 1 or 2.

3. The coach watches epic movies (rule 6), so the coach must be in a column where the corresponding row has 'epic' as the movie genre. Since the coach is not to the left of the person drinking milk (rule 8), the coach can't be in column 1. So, the coach is in column 2 or 4.

4. The coach is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies (rule 9), and the coach is not to the right of the bartender (rule 10). This means the coach can't be in column 4. So, the coach is in column 2.

5. Now we know the coach is in the second row and second column. Since the coach watches epic movies, the second row must have 'epic' as the movie genre.

6. The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the architect (rule 5). Since the coach is in the second column and the coach is to the left of the person watching comedy movies (rule 9), the architect must be in the first column.

7. The architect is not the person drinking iced-tea (rule 11), so the architect can't be in the third column. So, the architect is in the first column.

8. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left or right of the coach (rule 4). Since the coach is in the second column, the person drinking juice can be in the first or third column.

9. The bartender is not to the right of the coach (rule 7), so the bartender can't be in the third column. So, the bartender is in the first column.

10. The person drinking milk can't be in the third column because the coach is in that column (rule 3). So, the person drinking milk can be in the first or second column.

11. Since the bartender is in the first column and the coach is in the second column, the person drinking milk can't be in the second column (because the coach is drinking iced-tea). So, the person drinking milk is in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the movie genres:

Since the coach watches epic movies, the second row must have 'epic' as the movie genre.
Since the architect is in the first column, the first row must have a different movie genre. Let's assume it's 'comedy'.
Since the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the architect (rule 5), the third row must have 'comedy' as the movie genre.
Since the bartender is not to the right of the coach (rule 7), the fourth row must have a different movie genre. Let's assume it's 'adventure'.
