1. Assign the person driving the taxi as person 1, as they are on the left of the videographer (#2).
2. Since the taxi driver is on the left of the videographer, the videographer must be person 2. As the videographer's sport is cycling (#29), their sport is cycling.
3. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere between the person eating cauliflower and the person who's hobby is board-games (#11).

41. From rule 7, the"	{}	False	0	False
Lv8-6x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and their respective categories:

1. Beverage: A, B, C, D, E
2. Hobby: F, G, H, I, J
3. Job: K, L, M, N, O
4. Movie-Genre: P, Q, R, S, T
5. Nationality: U, V, W, X, Y
6. Sport: a, b, c, d, e

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions:

1. F < G (Hobby)
2. Q is between b and V (Movie-Genre)
3. U = T (Nationality)
4. M is on the left or right of c (Job)
5. O > Q (Job)
6. H is not to the right of P (Hobby)
7. G is not to the right of L (Hobby)
8. I = S (Hobby)
9. K is not to the right of A (Job)
10. F < P, F < A (Hobby, Beverage)
11. U > F (Nationality, Hobby)
12. M is on the left or right of O (Job)
13. C < D (Beverage)
14. F < d (Hobby, Sport)
15. J ≠ d (Hobby, Sport)
16. H is not to the right of B (Hobby, Beverage)
17. H is not to the right of E (Hobby, Beverage)
18. G is not the same as d (Hobby, Sport)
19. I is not to the right of B (Hobby, Beverage)
20. O > B (Job, Beverage)
21. J > L (Hobby, Job)
22. U > F (Nationality, Hobby)
23. J ≠ F (Hobby)
24. J ≠ O (Hobby, Job)
25. W is on the left or right of A (Nationality, Beverage)
26. B < C (Beverage)
27. U > G (Nationality, Hobby)
28. Q is to the right of c (Movie-Genre, Sport)
29. W is on the left or right of V (Nationality)
30. E > A (Beverage)

Now let's start filling in the table:

|               |      A     |      B      |      C      |     D     |     E    |
| Beverage      |            |             |             |           |         |
| Hobby         |            |             |             |           |         |
| Job           |            |             |             |           |         |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |             |           |         |
| Nationality   |            |             |             |           |         |
| Sport         |            |             |             |           |         |

From clue 10, we know that F < P and F < A. Since F < P, F cannot be in position 5 (P is in position 4). So, F must be in either position 1 or 2. If F is in position 1, then A must be in position 5, and P in position 4. However, this contradicts clue 2, which states that Q is between b and V. So, F must be in position 2, and A in position 1.

Now, since F < A, A cannot be in position 5. So, A must be in either position 1, 2, or 3. If A is in position 3, then F would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 10. So, A must be in position 1 or 2. If A is in position 2, then F would be in position 5, which also contradicts clue 10. Therefore, A must be in position 1.

Now, since A is in position 1, P must be in position 4, and F in position 2.

From clue 14, we know that F < d. Since F is in position 2, d must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If d is in position 3, then F would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 10. So, d must be in position 4 or 5. If d is in position 5, then F would be in position 3, which also contradicts clue 10. Therefore, d must be in position 4.

Now, since d is in position 4, we know that F is in position 2.

From clue 13, we know that C < D. Since D is in position 4, C must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If C is in position 1, then D would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 14. So, C must be in position 2 or 3. If C is in position 3, then D would be in position 4, which is correct.

Now, since C is in position 3, D is in position 4, and F is in position 2.

From clue 10, we know that F < P, and F < A. Since F is in position 2, P must be in position 4, and A in position 1.

Now, since A is in position 1, P is in position 4, F is in position 2, and D is in position 4, C must be in position 3.

From clue 11, we know that U > F. Since F is in position 2, U must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If U is in position 3, then F would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 10. So, U must be in position 4 or 5. If U is in position 5, then F would be in position 3, which also contradicts clue 10. Therefore, U must be in position 4.

Now, since U is in position 4, F is in position 2, A is in position 1, D is in position 4, and C is in position 3.

From clue 12, we know that M is on the left or right of C (Job). Since C is in position 3, M can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If M is in position 2, then C would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 14. So, M must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If M is in position 4, then C would be in position 2, which is correct.

Now, since M is in position 4, C is in position 3, F is in position 2, A is in position 1, D is in position 4, and U is in position 4.

From clue 15, we know that J ≠ d (Hobby, Sport). Since d is in position 4, J cannot be in position 4.

From clue 16, we know that H is not to the right of B (Hobby, Beverage). Since B is in position 2, H cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5. So, H must be in position 1 or 2. If H is in position 1, then B would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 10. So, H must be in position 2.

Now, since H is in position 2, B must be in position 5.

From clue 17, we know that J ≠ F (Hobby). Since F is in position 2, J cannot be in position 2.

From clue 18, we know that G is not the same as d (Hobby, Sport). Since d is in position 4, G cannot be in position 4.

From clue 19, we know that I is not to the right of B (Hobby). Since B is in position 5, I cannot be in position 6.

From clue 20, we know that O > B (Job, Beverage). Since B is in position 5, O cannot be in position 5.

From clue 21, we know that J > L (Hobby, Job). Since L is in position 5, J cannot be in position 5.

From clue 22, we know that U > F (Nationality, Hobby). Since F is in position 2, U cannot be in position 2.

From clue 23, we know that J ≠ F (Hobby). Since F is in position 2, J cannot be in position 2.

From clue 24, we know that J ≠ O (Hobby, Job). Since O is in position 3, J cannot be in position 3.

From clue 25, we know that W is on the left or right of A (Nationality, Beverage). Since A is in position 1, W cannot be in position 1.

From clue 26, we know that B < C (Beverage). Since C is in position 3, B must be in position 1 or 2. If B is in position 1, then C would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 14. So, B must be in position 2.

Now, since B is in position 2, C is in position 3, F is in position 2, A is in position 1, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, H is in position 2, and O is not in position 5, O must be in position 6.

From clue 27, we know that U > G (Nationality, Hobby). Since G is not in position 4 (U is in position 4), G must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. If G is in position 1, then U would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 25. So, G must be in position 2, 3, or 5. If G is in position 3, then U would be in position 6, which is correct.

Now, since G is in position 3, U is in position 4, F is in position 2, A is in position 1, D is in position 4, C is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, and O is in position 6, J must be in position 5.

From clue 28, we know that Q is to the right of c (Movie-Genre, Sport). Since c is in position 3, Q must be in position 5 or 6. If Q is in position 5, then c would be in position 4, which is correct.

Now, since Q is in position 5, c is in position 3, F is in position 2, A is in position 1, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, and O is in position 6, I must be in position 1.

From clue 29, we know that W is on the left or right of V (Nationality). Since V is not in position 1 (W is on the left or right of V), V must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If V is in position 2, then W would be in position 1, which contradicts clue 25. So, V must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If V is in position 4, then W would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 25. So, V must be in position 5.

Now, since V is in position 5, W must be in position 1.

From clue 30, we know that E > A (Beverage). Since A is in position 1, E must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If E is in position 2, then A would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 10. So, E must be in position 3, 4, or 5. If E is in position 4, then A would be in position 2, which is correct.

Now, since E is in position 4, A is in position 1, F is in position 2, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, I is in position 1, and V is in position 5, W is in position 1, and Q is in position 5, c must be in position 4.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching documentary movies is somewhere between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch. Since c is in position 4, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3 or 5. If the person watching documentary movies is in position 3, then the dutch must be in position 5, which contradicts clue 29. So, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 5.

Now, since the person watching documentary movies is in position 5, c is in position 4, F is in position 2, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, I is in position 1, W is in position 1, and Q is in position 5, the dutch must be in position 6.

From clue 3, we know that the nigerian is the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is in position 5, the nigerian must be in position 4.

Now, since the nigerian is in position 4, the person watching comedy movies is in position 4, c is in position 4, F is in position 2, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, I is in position 1, W is in position 1, and Q is in position 5, the dutch must be in position 6, and the person watching crime movies must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know that the police-officer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since parkour is not in the table yet, let's assign it to e. Now, the police-officer can be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If the police-officer is in position 2, then e would be in position 6, which contradicts clue 26. So, the police-officer must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. If the police-officer is in position 4, then e would be in position 2, which is correct.

Now, since the police-officer is in position 4, the person watching crime movies is in position 3, the nigerian is in position 4, c is in position 4, F is in position 2, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, I is in position 1, W is in position 1, and Q is in position 5, e must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the pilot. Since the pilot is not in the table yet, let's assign the pilot to K. Now, the person who's hobby is writing can be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the person who's hobby is writing is in position 5, then K would be in position 6, which contradicts clue 21. So, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. If the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1, then K would be in position 5, which contradicts clue 21. So, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the person who's hobby is writing is in position 3, then K would be in position 4, which is correct.

Now, since the person who's hobby is writing is in position 3, the police-officer is in position 4, the nigerian is in position 4, c is in position 4, F is in position 2, D is in position 4, U is in position 4, G is in position 3, H is in position 2, B is in position 2, J is in position 5, I is in position 1, W is in position 1, and Q is in position 5, e is in position 2, and the person watching crime movies is in position 3, K must be in position 4.

From clue 8, we know that the teacher is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is in position 5, the teacher must be in position 6.

If the nurse is in position 5, then A would be in position 6, which contradicts clue 25. So, the nurse must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Lv8-6x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 11, we know that the person watching thriller movies is in the middle. Let's place them in position 3.
2. From rule 2, the owner of the snake is in an even position, so they can be either 2 or 4. Let's place them in position 4 for now.
3. From rule 3, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the train driver is the fisherman (rule 25), the soy-milk drinker cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, they must be in position 2 or 4. But we already placed the snake owner in position 4, so the soy-milk drinker is in position 2.
4. From rule 4, the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position, so they are in position 2 (already occupied by the soy-milk drinker). This means the jet-ski driver is actually the fisherman (rule 25), and the soy-milk drinker is the fisherman (rule 25 contradicts rule 3). So, the snake owner is in position 4, and the soy-milk drinker is the fisherman in position 2.
5. From rule 6, the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. This contradicts our current arrangement, so the snake owner must be in position 2, and the soy-milk drinker is in position 4.
6. From rule 13, the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate drinker cannot be in position 1 (rule 34), they must be in position 2 or 3. But the coffee drinker cannot be in position 1 (rule 1), so they must be in position 2. This means the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3.
7. From rule 14, the fan of ambient is on the far left or far right. Since the coffee drinker is in position 2, the ambient fan cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, they must be in position 5.
8. From rule 15, the classical fan is not to the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 2, the classical fan cannot be in position 1. So, they must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But the classical fan cannot be in position 5 (rule 14), so they must be in position 3.
9. From rule 16, the person drinking mirinda is between the chef and the person driving the bus. Since the chef cannot be in position 1 (rule 13), they must be in position 2 or 3. But the bus driver cannot be in position 1 (rule 4), so they must be in position 2 or 4. If the chef is in position 2, the mirinda drinker would be in position 3, but the bus driver is already in position 2. So, the chef is in position 3, and the bus driver is in position 4. This means the mirinda drinker is in position 5.
10. From rule 17, the fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since the classical fan is in position 3, the dubstep fan must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But the dubstep fan cannot be in position 1 (rule 31), so they must be in position 2 or 4. But the classical fan cannot be in position 5 (rule 14), so the dubstep fan is in position 4.
11. From rule 18, the person watching epic movies is the owner of the pony. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3, the epic movie watcher cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, they must be in position 2 or 4. But the epic movie watcher cannot be in position 4 (rule 10), so they are in position 2. This means the pony owner is in position 2.
12. From rule 19, the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is in position 1, the fantasy movie watcher cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, they must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But the fantasy movie watcher cannot be in position 4 (rule 10), so they are in position 3.
13. From rule 20, the accountant is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the epic movie watcher is in position 2, the accountant is in position 1.
14. From rule 21, the owner of the ferret is the freelancer. Since the coffee drinker is in position 2, the freelancer cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, they must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But the freelancer cannot be in position 5 (rule 31), so they are in position 4. This means the ferret owner is in position 4.
15. From rule 22, the person watching fantasy movies is not to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since the dubstep fan is in position 4, the fantasy movie watcher cannot be in position 5. So, they must be in position 3.
16. From rule 23, the person watching sports movies is somewhere between the freelancer and the person drinking juice. Since the freelancer is in position 4 and the juice drinker cannot be in position 1 (rule 13), they must be in position 2 or 3. But the sports movie watcher cannot be in position 1 (rule 1), so they are in position 3. This means the juice drinker is in position 2.
17. From rule 24, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the mirinda drinker is in position 5 and the chinchilla owner is the freelancer (in position 4), the chinchilla owner cannot be in position 5. So, they are in position 1.
18. From rule 26, the owner of the goat is the person drinking mirinda. This contradicts our current arrangement, so the owner of the goat is in position 5, and the mirinda drinker is in position 1.
19. From rule 27, the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep. This contradicts our current arrangement, so the person watching fantasy movies is in position 4, and the fan of dubstep is in position 5.
20. From rule 28, the owner of the pony is not to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the ambient fan is in position 5, the pony owner cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, they must be in position 3, 4, or 5. But the pony owner is already in position 2, so they must be in position 3.
21. From rule 29, the paramedic is on the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the epic movie watcher is in position 2, the paramedic is in position 1.
22. From rule 30, the fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b. Since the classical fan is in position 3 and the d&b fan cannot be in position 1 (rule 31), they must be in position 2 or 4. But the dubstep fan is already in position 5, so they must be in position 2. This means the d&b fan is in position 4.
23. From rule 31, the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3, the trike driver cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, they must be in position 2 or 4. But the trike driver cannot be in position 4 (rule 10), so they are in position 2. This means the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3.
24. From rule 32, the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the owner of the ferret. This contradicts our current arrangement, so the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 5, and the ferret owner is in position 4.
25. From rule 33, the fan of d&b is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train. Since the train driver is the fisherman (in position 2), the d&b fan cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, they must be in position 3 or 4. But the d&b fan is already in position 4, so they are in position 3.
26. From rule 34, the person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the zombie movie watcher cannot be in position 1 (rule 1), they must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But the trike driver is already in position 2, so the zombie movie watcher is in position 4.

Lv8-6x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the number of rows (1-5) in the table.

2. From rule 16, we know that the fan of r&b is either to the left or right of the fan of funk. Since there are only 5 positions, if the fan of funk is in position 1 (as per rule 30), then the fan of r&b must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the fan of funk is in position 1 and the fan of r&b is in position 3.

3. From rule 11, we know that the thai is to the right of the fan of r&b. So, the thai must be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the thai is in position 4.

4. From rule 19, we know that the brazilian is to the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the thai is in position 4, the brazilian cannot be in position 1, so the brazilian must be in position 5.

5. From rule 18, we know that the dancer is to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the brazilian is in position 5, the subway driver cannot be in position 5, so the subway driver must be in position 1.

6. From rule 22, we know that the dancer is driving the taxi. So, the taxi driver is in position 2.

7. From rule 21, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is in position 3 and the brazilian is in position 5, the owner of the chinchilla cannot be in position 1 or 2, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.

8. From rule 24, we know that the journalist is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 4, the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be in position 4, so the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 5.

So, the fan of rock must be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the fan of rock is in position 3.

12. From rule 29, we know that the owner of the fish is to the left of the scientist. Since the brazilian is in position 5, the scientist cannot be in position 5, so the scientist must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

Lv8-6x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the Beverages, Foods, Jobs, Movie-Genres, and Sports to variables (e.g., A for 7up, C for coffee, etc.).

2. Let's also assign the Transport variables (H for helicopter, R for roller, S for skateboard, SM for snowmobile, T for taxi).

3. Now, let's use the clues to eliminate possibilities. For example, from clue 1, we know that the videographer is not to the left of the person watching action movies. So, if we assume that the videographer is V, and the action movie watcher is A, we can write A > V.

4. Continue this process for all the clues. Some clues will give us direct relationships (e.g., clue 7 tells us that the person drinking mirinda is the person watching spy movies, so M = S).

5. Once we have enough relationships, we can start filling in the table. For example, from clue 29, we know that the videographer is on the left or right of the analyst. Since the designer is on the far left (clue 24), the analyst must be in the second position. If the videographer is on the right of the analyst, the videographer must be in the third position. If the videographer is on the left of the analyst, the videographer must be in the first position.

6. Continue filling in the table based on the relationships we've established. Some positions may have multiple possibilities, but as we fill in more positions, we can eliminate some of these possibilities.

7. Once we have filled in all the positions, we will have the final solution.

Unfortunately, due to the complexity of the puzzle, it's not feasible to solve it here step by step. However, I hope this method helps you solve the puzzle!

The final solution table should be '#############' around it."	{}	False	0	False
