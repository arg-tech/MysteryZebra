Lv8-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is camping is in an odd position. So, the positions for camping, board-games, collecting, and skydiving (hobbies with 4 unique options) must be 1, 3, 5, and 7 (or their reversed order). Let's assume the order is 1, 3, 5, 7 for now.

2. From rule 11, the person watching epic movies is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the positions for hobbies are decided, the only possible position for the fish owner is 4. So, the movie-genre for position 4 is epic.

Since the hobby of collecting is in position 3, the person who's hobby is photography must be in position 1 or 2.

If photography is in position 2, then lacrosse must be in position 3 and the hobby of collecting in position 4.

18. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the sport of handball can't be in position 1 (as the hobby of singing is in position 2), the hobby of collecting can't be in position 3 (as the person who's hobby is photography is in position 1). So, the hobby of collecting can be in position 4.

Lv8-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 4 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, sports, and transport, we can fill in one of each in the first row. Let's start with hobbies:

|               | Baking  | Cooking | Magic-tricks | Sudoku  |
| Hobby         |       1 |        |              |         |
| Job           |        |        |              |         |
| Music-Genre   |        |        |              |         |
| Sport         |        |        |              |         |
| Transport     |        |        |              |         |

2. Since the social-worker is on the left of the engineer, we can place the social-worker in the first column and the engineer in the second column:

|               | Baking  | Cooking | Social-worker | Engineer |
| Hobby         |       1 |        |              |          |
| Job           |        |        |              |          |

| Sport         |        |        |              |          |
| Transport     |        |        |              |          |

3. The person driving the boat is not the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since skateboarding is on the left of baking, the boat driver cannot be in the first three columns. So, let's place the boat driver in the fourth column:

|               | Baking  | Cooking | Social-worker | Engineer |
| Hobby         |       1 |        |              |          |

   - Column 3: Fishing (since it's to the right of sudoku)
   - Column 4: Skydiving (since it's to the right of camping and not to the left of soul)

3. Now let's fill in the jobs:

   - Column 2: Lawyer (since the software-developer is not to the left of it in the job column)
   - Column 3: Librarian (since it's not to the right of the fan of soul and not to the right of the person watching documentary movies)
   - Column 4: Manager (since it's not in the first three columns)

4. Now let's fill in the movie-genres:

   - Column 3: Family (since it's not to the right of swimming and not the person watching family movies)
   - Column 4: Musical (since it's not to the right of the librarian)

5. Now let's fill in the music-genres:
   - Column 1: Classical (since it can be on the far left or far right)
   - Column 2: Hip-hop (since it's the job of the first person)
   - Column 3: Salsa (since it's not to the right of the fan of soul)
   - Column 4: Soul (since it's not to the left of the fan of hip-hop and not to the left of skydiving)

   - Column 4: Weightlifting (since it's not in the first three columns)

The final solution table is:

Lv8-5x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's arrange the nationalities according to the given conditions:
   - The Dutch is in an odd position, so it can be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's place the Dutch in position 1 (D).
   - The Polish is on the far right, so it must be in position 4 (P).
   - The Nigerian is to the left of the person watching musical movies, so it can't be in positions 3 or 4. It must be in position 2 (N).
   - The Italian can't be to the right of the person playing basketball, so it can't be in positions 3, 4, or 5. It must be in position 2 (I).

2. Now, let's arrange the sports according to the given conditions:
   - The person playing basketball is to the left of the person owning the ferret. Since the Italian is the person playing basketball and the Dutch is not the owner of the ferret, the ferret can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. It must be in position 4 (F).
   - The person playing rugby is to the left of the person playing baseball. Since the Italian is not the person playing rugby, the rugby player can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4. It must be in position 3 (R).
   - The person playing soccer is to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the Dutch is not the person watching action movies, the action movie watcher can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4. It must be in position 5 (A).
   - The person playing baseball can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 because the Italian is not to the right of the person playing baseball. It must be in position 6 (B).
   - The person playing soccer can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 because the Dutch is not to the left of the person playing soccer. It must be in position 7 (S).

3. Now, let's arrange the pets according to the given conditions:
   - The owner of the lizard is to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the Dutch is not the owner of the ferret and the Polish is on the far right, the lizard owner can't be in positions 4 or 7. It must be in position 3 (L).
   - The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in position 1, the frog owner can't be in positions 1 or 2. It must be in position 5 (Fg).
   - The owner of the rat is somewhere between the fan of pop and the person who's sport is soccer. Since the pop fan can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7, and the soccer player is in position 7, the rat owner can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. It must be in position 6 (Rt).

4. Finally, let's arrange the movie genres and music genres according to the given conditions:
   - The fan of pop is not to the right of the nigerian, the fan of funk, or the fan of classical. Since the Nigerian is in position 2, the fan of pop can't be in positions 3, 4, or 5. It must be in position 1 (Pp).
   - The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the fan of funk can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It must be in position 7 (Fu).
   - The fan of soul is between the fan of classical and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the fan of classical can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the person playing basketball is in position 2, the fan of soul can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It must be in position 7 (So).
   - The person watching musical movies is somewhere between the Dutch and the owner of the frog. Since the Dutch is in position 1 and the frog owner is in position 5, the musical movie watcher can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It must be in position 7 (Mm).
   - The person watching scientific movies can't be to the right of the pop fan. Since the pop fan is in position 1, the scientific movie watcher can't be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It must be in position 7 (Sc).
   - The person watching thriller movies can be in position 1 or 7 because it can be on the far left or far right. Let's place it in position 7 (Th).

The final solution table is:

Lv8-5x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can number them from 1 to 4.

2. Let's assign the nationalities first:
   - The Indonesian (15) watches scientific movies, so they must be in position 1, 3, or 4. Since the Indonesian can't be to the right of the person watching scientific movies (2), they must be in position 1.
   - The Japanese (14) eats zucchini, and they can't be to the left of the person eating zucchini (5), so they must be in position 4.
   - The Dutch (11) can't be to the right of the person eating strawberry (19), so they must be in position 2 or 3.
   - The Malaysian (16) is to the right of the person eating zucchini (14), so they must be in position 3 or 4.

3. Let's assign the pets:
   - The owner of the ferret (1) is to the right of the person watching scientific movies (15), so the person watching scientific movies can't be in position 1. They must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the Indonesian is in position 1, the person watching scientific movies can't be in position 2 (because the Indonesian can't be to the right of the person watching scientific movies). So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3 or 4. But the Malaysian can't be in position 4 (because the Malaysian is to the right of the person eating zucchini, and the person eating zucchini is the Japanese in position 4). So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3. This means the ferret owner is in position 2.
   - The owner of the rat (2, 3, or 4) can't be to the right of the person watching scientific movies (2), so the rat owner can't be in position 3 or 4. They must be in position 2.
   - The owner of the snake (12) can't be the person playing tennis (12), so they can't be in position 1 or 3. They must be in position 2 or 4. But the snake owner can't be to the right of the person watching documentary movies (8), so they can't be in position 4. So, the snake owner is in position 2. This means the person playing tennis is in position 1.
   - The owner of the chinchilla (18) is to the right of the person eating radish (6), so the person eating radish can't be in position 1 or 4. They must be in position 2 or 3. But the person eating radish can't be to the left of the Indonesian (13), so they can't be in position 2. So, the person eating radish is in position 3. This means the owner of the chinchilla is in position 4.

4. Let's assign the sports:
   - The person playing badminton (7) is the Indonesian (1), so they are in position 1.
   - The person playing rowing can't be the person eating radish (3), so they can't be in position 3. They must be in position 2 or 4. But the person playing rowing can't be the person watching sports movies (10), because the person watching sports movies is between the rat owner (2) and the ferret owner (2), and the person playing rowing can't be in position 2 (because the person playing rowing can't be the person eating radish). So, the person playing rowing is in position 4.
   - The person playing skiing can't be to the left of the person playing rowing (17), so they can't be in position 1 or 2. They must be in position 3 or 4. But the person playing skiing can't be the person eating radish (3), so they can't be in position 3. So, the person playing skiing is in position 4.
   - The person playing tennis can't be the owner of the snake (12), so they can't be in position 2. They must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But the person playing tennis can't be to the left of the person playing rowing (17), so they can't be in position 1. So, the person playing tennis is in position 4.

5. Let's assign the movies:
   - The person watching sports movies (10) is between the rat owner (2) and the ferret owner (2), so they can't be in position 1 or 4. They must be in position 2 or 3. But the person watching sports movies can't be to the right of the person watching documentary movies (8), so they can't be in position 3. So, the person watching sports movies is in position 2.
   - The person watching documentary movies (8) is to the right of the person watching scientific movies (3), so they can't be in position 1 or 3. They must be in position 2 or 4. But the person watching documentary movies can't be to the left of the person watching sports movies (10), so they can't be in position 2. So, the person watching documentary movies is in position 4.
   - The person watching musical movies can't be the person watching scientific movies (15), so they can't be in position 1. They must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But the person watching musical movies can't be to the right of the person watching sports movies (10), so they can't be in position 4. So, the person watching musical movies is in position 2 or 3. But the person watching musical movies can't be to the left of the person eating strawberry (19), so they can't be in position 3. So, the person watching musical movies is in position 2.
   - The person watching scientific movies (15) is the Indonesian (1), so they are in position 1.

6. Let's assign the foods:
   - The person eating strawberry (19) is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 2 or 4. They must be in position 1 or 3. But the person eating strawberry can't be to the right of the Dutch (11), so they can't be in position 1. So, the person eating strawberry is in position 3.
   - The person eating radish (6) can't be to the left of the Indonesian (13), so they can't be in position 1 or 3. They must be in position 2 or 4. But the person eating radish can't be the person playing rowing (4), so they can't be in position 4. So, the person eating radish is in position 2.
   - The person eating zucchini (14) is the Japanese (4), so they are in position 4.
   - The person eating scientific movies can't be the person eating radish (6), so they can't be in position 2. They must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But the person eating scientific movies can't be to the left of the person eating strawberry (19), so they can't be in position 1. So, the person eating scientific movies is in position 4.

Lv8-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 people, so we can label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. Let's start with the sports:
   - A plays tennis (from 6) so B must play something else. Let's say B plays badminton (from now on, we'll mark the sport of each person in parentheses).
   - C plays snowboarding (from 6).
   - D plays something else.

3. Now let's place the sports according to the given conditions:
   - Tennis is on the left of cucumber (1), so A eats cucumber.
   - Badminton is not to the right of milk (2), so B cannot be in the last position.
   - Snowboarding is not to the right of fanta (14), so C cannot be in the first position.
   - Handball is somewhere to the right of badminton (5), so D plays handball.

4. Let's place the food according to the given conditions:
   - Cucumber is eaten by A (already placed).
   - Eggplant is on the right of snowboarding (9), so it must be eaten by D.
   - Papaya is eaten by B or D (from 18), but not by A (from 3), so it's eaten by D.
   - Plum is the remaining food, so it's eaten by B.

5. Let's place the music-genres according to the given conditions:
   - Classical is not to the right of papaya (3), so it's either A or B. Since B cannot be A (from 2), classical is A's preference.
   - D&B is the owner of the mouse (10), so it's B's preference.
   - Electronic is somewhere between snowboarding and the owner of the guinea-pig (11), so it's C's preference.
   - Salsa is somewhere between the owner of the mouse and milk (16), and on the left of milk (17), so it's D's preference.

6. Let's place the pets according to the given conditions:
   - The owner of the cat is not to the left of salsa (8), so it's A or C. Since A cannot be the owner (from 17), C is the owner of the cat.
   - The owner of the guinea-pig is between electronic and snowboarding (11), not to the left of fanta (12), and on the left or right of papaya (18), so it's B.
   - The owner of the mouse is the fan of D&B (10), so it's B.
   - The remaining pet is the hedgehog, so it's D.

7. Finally, let's place the beverages according to the given conditions:
   - The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking tennis (13), so A drinks juice.
   - The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking cucumber (15), so D drinks lemonade.
   - The person drinking fanta is not to the right of snowboarding (14), so C drinks fanta.
   - The remaining beverage is milk, so it's B.

Lv8-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From point 13, the project-manager (eating eggplant) is not watching satire movies, so they can't be in positions 1 or 3. Let's assume the project-manager is in position 4 (D).

3. From point 11, the project-manager is eating eggplant, so positions 1, 2, and 3 are filled with carrot, cauliflower, and cherry respectively (in that order from left to right).

4. From point 14, the indian (dressmaker) is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the project-manager is not the person watching satire movies, the only option for fantasy movies is position 2. So, the indian (dressmaker) is in position 1 (A) or 3 (C).

5. From point 5, the indian is on the far left, so the indian is in position 1 (A).

6. From point 15, the person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cherry and the turkish. Since the indian is the person eating cherry, the person eating cauliflower is in position 2 (B) and the turkish is in position 4 (D).

7. From point 16, the indonesian is on the far right, so the indonesian is in position 4 (D).

8. From point 18, the nigerian is not to the right of the indonesian, so the nigerian is in position 3 (C).

9. From point 12, the person eating carrot is not to the left of the turkish, so the person eating carrot is in position 2 (B).

10. From point 10, the person eating cauliflower is not the person driving the roller, so the person driving the roller is in position 1 (A).

11. From point 7, the architect is not to the left of the person driving the trike, so the architect is in position 4 (D).

12. From point 17, the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the indian, so the person driving the helicopter is in position 3 (C).

13. From point 9, the person watching fantasy movies is between the architect and the person driving the bike. Since the architect is in position 4 (D) and the person driving the bike can't be the person eating cauliflower (position 2), the person watching fantasy movies is in position 3 (C).

14. From point 6, the project-manager is the person eating eggplant, so the person driving the bike is in position 1 (A).

15. From point 19, the person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating carrot is in position 2 (B), the person watching disaster movies is in position 4 (D).
