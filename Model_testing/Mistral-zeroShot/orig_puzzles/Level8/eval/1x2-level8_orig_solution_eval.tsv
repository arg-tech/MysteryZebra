Lv8-1x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different music genres: d&b and funk. Let's denote the person who prefers d&b as D and the person who prefers funk as F.

2. The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of funk. This means that D is to the right of F in the table. So, the arrangement could be:

   |               |   F  |   D  |
   | Music-Genre   |      |     |

3. The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of funk. This means that F cannot be in the second column (since D is to the right of F). So, the arrangement must be:

   |               |   D  |   F  |
   | Music-Genre   |      |     |

4. To ensure that the genres are different in each column, the first column must have a different genre. Since we already have d&b in the second column, the first column must have funk.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |   F  |   D  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk | d&b |

Lv8-1x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people watching two different genres: musical and satire.

2. The person watching musical movies is on the far right, which means the genre on the left must be satire. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |   1    |    2    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire | Musical |

3. The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies. This means the musical person cannot be in position 1, because if they were, the satire person would be to their left. So, the final table is:

   |               |   1    |    2    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire | Musical |

   However, the positions don't matter in this case, as we only know the genres, not the people. So, the final solution is:

  #############
   |               |   1    |    2    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Satire | Musical |

Lv8-1x2-3	"Let's break down the given information:

1. The owner of the goldfish is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
2. The owner of the hedgehog can be either to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
3. The owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish (which means the goldfish owner must be on the left).

From point 3, we know that the goldfish owner must be in the first column. Now, let's consider point 2. Since the goldfish owner is already in the first column, the hedgehog owner must be in the second column to satisfy the condition that the hedgehog owner is not to the left of the goldfish owner.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Goldfish  | Hedgehog |
#############
```

This means the goldfish is in the first column and the hedgehog is in the second column."	{}	False	0	False
Lv8-1x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, one driving a scooter and the other driving a train.

2. The person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the scooter##8. This means that the person driving the scooter cannot be in the second column (since the number 2 represents the right position). So, the scooter must be in the first column.

3. The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in the first column, the train must be in the second column.

The final solution table is:

  |             |    1    |   2   |
| Transport   | Scooter | Train |

So, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of hiking is on the far right, we can fill the rightmost cell with 'Hiking'.

|         |      1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | Hiking     |       |

2. Now, we know that the person with the hobby of video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. This means the person with the hobby of video-games must be on the left.

|         |      1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | Hiking     | Video-Games|

So, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the owner of the goldfish is in an odd position, they can only be in the second position (as the first position is even). So, the goldfish is in position 2.

2. Now, let's consider the possible positions for the rat. If the rat were in position 1, the goldfish would have to be in position 2, which contradicts the first rule (the owner of the goldfish is in an odd position). So, the rat cannot be in position 1.

3. This means the rat must be in position 2, as the only remaining position for the goldfish is position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```

|       |    1     |  2  |
| Pet   | Goldfish | Rat |

Lv8-1x2-7	"Let's break down the information given in the puzzle:

1. The people use 2 different means of transport: jet-ski and train.
2. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train (1).
3. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski (8).

From point 1, we know that there are two people, one driving a jet-ski and the other driving a train.

From point 2, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the person driving the train. This means the arrangement could be either:

- Train -> Jet-ski

However, from point 3, we know that the person driving the train cannot be to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This contradicts the arrangement we found in point 2.

So, the information given in points 2 and 3 cannot both be true. This means there is a contradiction in the puzzle, and it cannot be solved as it is currently stated.

Final solution table:

```
#############
|             |   1   |    2    |
| Transport   |       |         |

This table represents an unsolvable puzzle due to the contradiction in the given information."	{'transport': ['', '']}	True	0	False
Lv8-1x2-8	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The person with the hobby of chess is to the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks.
2. The person with the hobby of chess is not to the right of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks.

From these conditions, we can infer that the person with the hobby of chess must be in the first column (column 1), and the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be in the second column (column 2).

The final solution table would look like this:

```
#############
|   1   |      2       |
| Chess  | Magic-tricks |

So, the person with the hobby of chess is in the first column (column 1), and the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is in the second column (column 2)."	{'1': ['2'], 'chess': ['magic-tricks']}	False	0	False
Lv8-1x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food: asparagus and plum. Let's denote A for asparagus and P for plum.

2. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating plum. This means that if we denote the positions as (A, P), then A > P.

3. The person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating asparagus. This means that A cannot be in the first position, so A > 1.

4. Now, let's consider the case where A is in the second position. If A is in the second position, then P must be in the first position. This satisfies both conditions: A > P (since A is in the second position) and A is not in the first position (since P is in the first position).

5. So, the final solution is:

```
#############
|    P      | A  |
#############
```

This means that the person eating plum is in the first position and the person eating asparagus is in the second position."	{}	False	0	False
Lv8-1x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people and they use two different means of transport: car and skateboard.

2. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person driving the car. This means that the arrangement of vehicles can only be either:
   - Car -> Skateboard (1st row)
   - Skateboard -> Car (2nd row)

3. The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the car. This means that the arrangement of people cannot be:
   - Car (Person A) -> Skateboard (Person B) (1st row) because if Person A was driving the car, they would be to the right of themselves, which violates the condition.

4. So, the only possible arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:
   - Skateboard (Person B) -> Car (Person A) (2nd row)

The final solution table is:

  |             |  1  |     2      |
  | Transport   | Car | Skateboard |
