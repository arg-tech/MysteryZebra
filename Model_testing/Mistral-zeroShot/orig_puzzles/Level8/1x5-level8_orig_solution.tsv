Lv8-1x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the subway is to the right of the van, so we can place them in columns 2 and 3, with the subway in column 3 (since the tram can't be in column 1).

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
   |-----|------|-----|--------|------|-------|
   | Transport |     |     |        |      |       |

   | van     |     | van  |        |      |       |

2. The tram is not to the left of the bike, so the bike can't be in column 1. Let's place it in column 4.

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |

   | van     |     | van  |        |      |       |

3. The tram is between the subway and the trike. Since the subway is in column 3 and the tram is not in column 1, the trike must be in column 1.

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
   |-----|------|-----|--------|------|-------|
   | Transport | trike|     | tram   | bike |       |
   | bike    |     |     |        |      |       |

   | van     |     | van  |        |      |       |

4. The subway is somewhere between the tram and the bike. Since the tram is in column 2 and the bike is in column 4, the subway must be in column 3.

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
   |-----|------|-----|--------|------|-------|
   | Transport | trike| tram | subway| bike |       |
   | bike    |     |     |        |      |       |
   | subway  |     |     | tram   |      |       |
   | van     |     | van  |        |      |       |

5. The tram is not to the left of the van, so the van can't be in column 2. Let's place it in column 5.

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
   |-----|------|-----|--------|------|-------|
   | Transport | trike| tram | subway| bike | van   |

   | subway  |     |     | tram   |      |       |
   | van     |     |     |        |      |       |

6. Now we have all the transport in their correct positions, so the final solution is:

   |     |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
   |-----|------|-----|--------|------|-------|

Lv8-1x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of traveling cannot be to the left of the person with the hobby of magic-tricks or sudoku, they must be in the last three positions.

2. The person with the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in the first position because they are to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku. So, the hobby of magic-tricks can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The person with the hobby of traveling must be in the middle (position 3) because of rule 6.

4. Now we know that the hobby of traveling is in position 3. So, the hobby of traveling cannot be to the left of the person with the hobby of sudoku, which means the hobby of sudoku must be in position 1 or 2.

5. The hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 1 because it is to the right of the person with the hobby of sudoku, and the hobby of traveling is in position 3. So, the hobby of magic-tricks can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

6. The hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 5 because it is to the right of the person with the hobby of traveling, and we know that the hobby of traveling is in position 3. So, the hobby of magic-tricks can only be in position 2 or 4.

7. The hobby of singing can be in any position except for position 3 (where traveling is) and to the left of photography. So, the hobby of singing can be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.

8. Since the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 5, the hobby of singing must be in position 5.

9. Now we know that the hobby of singing is in position 5. So, the hobby of photography must be in position 1 or 2.

10. Since the hobby of magic-tricks cannot be in position 1, the hobby of photography must be in position 1, and the hobby of magic-tricks in position 2.

11. Finally, the hobby of sudoku must be in position 4.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv8-1x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of house is to the left of the fan of techno. Let's place the house fan in the second position (2).

2. From rule 2, we know that the fan of pop is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of house. Since house is at position 2, hip-hop must be at position 1 or 3. If hip-hop were at position 1, then pop would have to be at position 3, but that would violate rule 5 (techno can't be to the left of house). So, hip-hop must be at position 3. This means pop is at position 2.

3. From rule 3, we know that the fan of hip-hop is between the fan of ambient and the fan of techno. Since hip-hop is at position 3, techno must be at position 5. This also means ambient must be at position 1.

4. From rule 4, we know that the fan of pop is to the left of the fan of house. This is already satisfied since pop is at position 2 and house is at position 3.

5. From rule 5, we know that the fan of techno is not to the left of the fan of house. This is already satisfied since techno is at position 5 and house is at position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv8-1x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 4 and 5, we know that neither the person drinking cola nor the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking lemonade.

2. From point 6, we know that the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.

3. Since the person drinking cola is not to the right of the person drinking 7up (point 2), and it's also on the left of the person drinking lemonade (point 6), we can place cola in the first position.

4. From point 1, we know that the person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the person drinking sprite. Since cola is in the first position, and 7up can't be to the right of lemonade (point 4), the only remaining positions for 7up are the second and third positions. However, if 7up were in the second position, it would be to the right of the person drinking lemonade, which contradicts point 4. So, 7up must be in the third position.

5. From point 3, we know that the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since 7up is in the third position, the only remaining positions for sprite are the fourth and fifth positions. However, if sprite were in the fifth position, it would be to the right of the person drinking tea, which contradicts the fact that 7up is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking sprite (point 1). So, sprite must be in the fourth position.

6. Finally, the only remaining position for lemonade is the second position.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |  1  |  2  |  3   |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage   | cola| lemonade| 7up | sprite | tea   |

Lv8-1x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 different movie-genres, and we have 5 columns. So, each column represents a different genre.

2. The person watching satire movies is on the far right, so the last column (column 5) represents satire.

3. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the satire is on the far right, the musical must be on the far left (column 1). So, column 1 is musical.

4. Now, we know that the satire is on the right of the musical, so column 2 is a possible location for the musical. However, since the satire is already in the last column, the musical cannot be in the second column. So, column 2 is not musical.

5. This leaves us with only one possibility for the musical, which is column 1. So, column 1 is musical and column 5 is satire.

6. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching romance movies. Since the satire is on the far right and the musical is on the far left, the only possible positions for scientific and romance are columns 3 and 4.

7. The person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the person watching mystery movies. This means that the scientific cannot be in column 3, as that would place the mystery to its left. So, column 3 is romance and column 4 is scientific.

8. Now, we know that the mystery is between the scientific and the romance. Since the scientific is in column 4 and the romance is in column 3, the mystery must be in column 2.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Musical  |   Mystery  |   Romance  |   Scientific  |   Satire    |

Lv8-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 4, we know the horse is not to the left of the turtle. So, the possible positions for the horse are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, the owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. If the horse is in position 2, then the mouse can be in position 1 or 2. If the horse is in position 3, then the mouse can be in position 2 or 3. If the horse is in position 4, then the mouse can be in position 3 or 4. If the horse is in position 5, then the mouse can be in position 4 or 5.

3. From rule 3, the owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. So, if the horse is in position 2, the mouse must be in position 1. If the horse is in position 3, the mouse can be in position 2 or 3. If the horse is in position 4, the mouse can be in position 3 or 4. If the horse is in position 5, the mouse must be in position 4.

4. From rule 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the lizard and the owner of the horse. If the horse is in position 2, the guinea-pig must be in position 1 (since the lizard is to the right of the guinea-pig). If the horse is in position 3, the guinea-pig can be in position 2 or 3. If the horse is in position 4, the guinea-pig can be in position 3. If the horse is in position 5, the guinea-pig must be in position 4.

5. From rule 6, the owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. So, if the guinea-pig is in position 1, the lizard can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the guinea-pig is in position 2, the lizard can be in position 3, 4, or 5. If the guinea-pig is in position 3, the lizard can be in position 4 or 5. If the guinea-pig is in position 4, the lizard can be in position 5.

Now, let's put it all together:

- If the horse is in position 2, the arrangement is: Guinea-pig, Lizard, Horse, Mouse, Turtle
- If the horse is in position 3, the arrangement is: Lizard, Guinea-pig, Horse, Mouse, Turtle or Lizard, Mouse, Guinea-pig, Horse, Turtle
- If the horse is in position 4, the arrangement is: Lizard, Mouse, Guinea-pig, Horse, Turtle
- If the horse is in position 5, the arrangement is: Lizard, Mouse, Turtle, Guinea-pig, Horse

Since the horse cannot be in position 1 (rule 1), the only possible arrangement is: Lizard, Mouse, Guinea-pig, Horse, Turtle

So, the final solution table is:

1. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, we can deduce that almond-milk cannot be in the far left or far right positions. So, almond-milk must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. Since the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade, and the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade, fanta cannot be in the far right position. So, fanta must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

3. Since the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, lemonade cannot be in the far left or far right positions. So, lemonade must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

4. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, and almond-milk cannot be in the far left position, almond-milk must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. If almond-milk is in position 2, then lemonade must be in position 1, which contradicts the fact that lemonade is not to the right of lemonade. So, almond-milk cannot be in position 2. If almond-milk is in position 3, then lemonade must be in position 4, and fanta can be in any of the remaining positions. But if fanta is in position 1, then the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 5, which contradicts the fact that hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right. So, fanta cannot be in position 1. Therefore, almond-milk must be in position 3, lemonade in position 4, and fanta in position 2.

5. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, it must be in position 1 or 5. If hot-chocolate is in position 1, then sprite must be in position 2, and soda must be in position 3. But this contradicts the fact that the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade, as fanta is in position 2 and lemonade is in position 4. So, hot-chocolate must be in position 5.

6. Now, the only remaining position for sprite is position 2, and the only remaining position for soda is position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know that the genres are blues, funk, hip-hop, house, and jazz.

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop is to the right of the fan of funk. So, let's place funk in the first or second position, and hip-hop in the third, fourth, or fifth position.

3. From point 2, we know that the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. Since funk is to the right of hip-hop, funk cannot be in the first position. So, funk must be in the second position, and hip-hop can be in the third, fourth, or fifth position.

4. From point 3, we know that the fan of house is not to the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since funk is in the second position and hip-hop is to its right, house cannot be in the first position. So, house can be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.

5. From point 4, we know that the fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of jazz. Since funk is in the second position, jazz can be in the first or third position.

6. From point 5, we know that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. Since hip-hop is in the third, fourth, or fifth position, house cannot be in the first position. So, house can be in the second, fourth, or fifth position.

7. From point 6, we know that the fan of hip-hop is in an even position. Since hip-hop can be in the third, fourth, or fifth position, it must be in the fourth position.

8. Now we know that funk is in the second position, and hip-hop is in the fourth position. So, house cannot be in the second position (because of point 3). Therefore, house must be in the fifth position.

9. Since jazz can be in the first or third position, and funk is in the second position, jazz must be in the first position.

10. Finally, since blues is the only genre left, it must be in the third position.

1. From rule 1, we know that the Argentine is not in the first position (1) because the Brazilian must be somewhere between the Dutch and the Argentine. So, the Argentine can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, if the Argentine is in position 2, then the Brazilian must be in position 1. But this contradicts rule 6, as the Dutch must be to the right of the Turkish, and the Turkish can't be in position 1. So, the Argentine can't be in position 2.

3. If the Argentine is in position 3, then the Brazilian must be in position 2. This doesn't violate any rules, so the Argentine can be in position 3.

4. Now, the Brazilian is in position 2. The Dutch can't be in position 1 (rule 6), so the Dutch must be in position 4 or 5.

5. The Indonesian can't be to the left of the Dutch (rule 3), so the Indonesian can't be in position 1 or 2. The Indonesian can't be in position 5 (rule 5), so the Indonesian must be in position 3 or 4.

6. If the Indonesian is in position 4, then the Turkish must be in position 1 (rule 6). But this contradicts rule 7, as the Dutch must be to the right of the Turkish. So, the Indonesian can't be in position 4.
