Lv8-1x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three different sports and the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right, we can fill the rightmost column with 'Climbing'.

   |         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
   | Sport   | Climbing    |         |          |

2. Now, the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. This means that the 'Sailing' cannot be in the rightmost column. Let's place 'Sailing' in the second column.

   |         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
   | Sport   | Climbing    | Sailing |          |

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. So, 'Weightlifting' must be in the first or second column. Since 'Climbing' is in the rightmost column, 'Weightlifting' cannot be in the rightmost column. Therefore, it must be in the first column.

   |         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
   | Sport   | Weightlifting| Sailing | Climbing |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
| Sport   | Weightlifting| Sailing | Climbing |

Lv8-1x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of sudoku is in the middle, we know that the hobbies in the first and third columns cannot be sudoku. So, we can fill the first and third columns with either chess or skydiving.

2. Now, let's consider the first column. If it were chess, then the second column would have to be sudoku (since the person with the hobby of sudoku is in the middle). But this would violate the condition that the person with the hobby of sudoku is not to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. So, the first column cannot be chess.

3. Therefore, the first column must be skydiving, and the second column must be sudoku. The third column can be either chess or skydiving, but since we already have skydiving in the first column, the third column must be chess.

Here is the final solution:

```
#############
| Skydiving | Sudoku | Chess  |

Lv8-1x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three beverages: juice, soy-milk, and tea.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice. This means that soy-milk cannot be in the rightmost column (column 3) because if it were, juice would have to be in the leftmost column (column 1), and that would violate the second condition. So, soy-milk can only be in column 1 or column 2.

3. If soy-milk is in column 1, then juice must be in column 2. But this would mean that tea must be in column 3, which is the rightmost column, violating the second condition. So, soy-milk cannot be in column 1.

4. Therefore, soy-milk must be in column 2. This means juice must be in column 3 and tea in column 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|    Tea     | Juice | Soy-Milk |
#############"
Lv8-1x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola, we can rule out the possibility of almond-milk being in the first column (as it would have to be to the right of cola in the second column). So, the first column cannot be almond-milk.

2. Now, let's consider the second column. If it were cola, then according to the second rule, almond-milk would have to be in the third column, which contradicts our first conclusion that the first column cannot be almond-milk. So, the second column cannot be cola.

3. This leaves us with lemonade for the second column. According to the first rule, the person drinking cola cannot be to the left of the person drinking lemonade. This means the first column must be cola, and the third column must be almond-milk.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |     Cola     |   Lemonade   |       Almond-Milk      |
  | Beverage   |              |              |                         |

Lv8-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are 3 nationalities and the Colombian is in an even position, the Colombian must be either in position 2 or 4.

2. If the Colombian were in position 2, then the Brazilian would have to be in position 1 (since there are only 3 nationalities), and the Malaysian would have to be in position 3. However, this arrangement violates rule 2, as the Malaysian would be to the right of the Colombian.

3. Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 4. This means the Brazilian must be in position 1 and the Malaysian in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|           |     1     |     2     |     3     |
| Nationality| Brazilian | Colombian| Malaysian|

Lv8-1x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing, we can place 'reading' in the first column and 'writing' in the second column. Let's assume the order is Reading - Writing.

2. Now, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. So, video-games cannot be in the second or third column.

3. If video-games were in the first column, it would be to the left of both reading and writing, which contradicts the second rule. So, video-games must be in the third column.

Here is the final solution table:

|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Reading    | Writing | Video-games |

So, the final solution is:

Lv8-1x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are three people and they prefer three different music genres (funk, pop, soul), each person must prefer one of these genres.

2. From the second rule, the fan of soul is in an even position. Since there are three positions, the only even position is the middle one (position 2). So, the fan of soul prefers the genre in the second row and second column (Soul).

3. Now, we know that the fan of soul is in the middle. From the first rule, the fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of soul. This means the fan of funk cannot be in the third column (since the fan of soul is in the second column). So, the fan of funk must be in the first column (Funk).

4. Now, we only have two genres left (Pop and Funk are taken). The fan of pop must be in the third column (Pop).

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Funk    | Soul | Pop  |
#############

This table represents the final arrangement of the music genres according to the preferences of the three people."
Lv8-1x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the three music genres are electronic, techno, and trance, and there are three people who prefer these genres.

2. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of techno. This means that the arrangement could be Trance - Techno - Electronic or Techno - Trance - Electronic. But since we'll be filling the table from left to right, let's assume the arrangement is Trance - Techno - Electronic for now.

3. Now, let's see the second condition: the fan of techno is not to the right of the fan of electronic. This means that Techno cannot be in the last position (since it is to the right of Electronic in our current arrangement). So, the arrangement must be Trance - Techno - Electronic.

4. Now we have our final arrangement: Trance in the first position, Techno in the second position, and Electronic in the third position.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Trance    | Techno | Electronic |

Lv8-1x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three beverages: fanta, lemonade, and milk.

2. Since the person drinking milk is not to the left of the person drinking fanta, we can rule out the possibility of the order being Milk-Lemonade-Fanta. This leaves us with two possible orders: Lemonade-Fanta-Milk and Fanta-Lemonade-Milk.

3. Now, the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk. This means that in the order Lemonade-Fanta-Milk, fanta is in the second position, and in the order Fanta-Lemonade-Milk, fanta is in the middle position (the second or third, but we know it's not the first).

4. However, since fanta is between the lemonade and the milk, it cannot be in the third position (as that would place it to the right of the milk, which we know is not possible). So, fanta must be in the second position, which means the order is Fanta-Lemonade-Milk.

5. Now we can fill in the table:

   |            |    1     |   2   |  3   |
   | Beverage   |          |       |      |
   |------------|----------|-------|------|
   | fanta      |          | X     |      |

   | milk       |          |       |      |

6. To find the exact positions of lemonade and milk, we know that fanta is in the second position, so lemonade must be in the first position, and milk in the third position.

7. So, the final solution table is:

   |            |    1     |   2   |  3   |
   | Beverage   | fanta    | lemonade | milk |

This is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv8-1x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different sports: cycling, surfing, and water-polo.

2. Since there are only three people and three sports, each person must have a unique sport.

3. Let's assign the sports to the people based on the given conditions:

   - We can't place water-polo at the first position because it can't be to the left of cycling (according to the second condition). So, let's place cycling at the first position.

   - Now, if we place surfing at the third position, it would be to the right of water-polo (according to the first condition), but it would also violate the second condition because water-polo would be to the left of cycling. So, surfing can't be at the third position.

   - Therefore, surfing must be at the second position. This means water-polo must be at the first position and cycling at the third position.

4. Here is the final solution table:

   |         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
   | Sport   |         |            |         |
   |--------|---------|-----------|---------|
   | Cycling |         |           | Cycling |
   | Water-polo | Surfing |         |         |

   However, since the table format requires each row to have a sport, we'll fill the missing information with the corresponding sport names:

   |         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
   | Sport   | Cycling | Water-polo | Surfing |

   So, the final solution table is:

   |         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
   | Sport   | Cycling | Water-polo | Surfing |
