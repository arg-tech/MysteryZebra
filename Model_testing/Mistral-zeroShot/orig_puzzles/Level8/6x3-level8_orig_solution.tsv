Lv8-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the lawyer is not in the first position (as the fisherman must be there). So, the lawyer can be in the second or third position.

2. From rule 2, the fan of disco cannot be in the third position (as the person watching spy movies must be there). So, the fan of disco can be in the first or second position. Let's assume the fan of disco is in the first position. This means the person watching spy movies is in the third position.

3. From rule 3, the person eating orange cannot be in the second position (as the person watching satire movies must be there). So, the person eating orange can be in the first or third position. Let's assume the person eating orange is in the third position. This means the person eating cucumber is in the first position and the person eating cranberry is in the second position.

4. From rule 4, the person watching crime movies is the polish. So, the polish is in the second position.

5. From rule 5, the pakistani is to the right of the person driving the airplane. As the polish (who is the lawyer) is in the second position and the person driving the airplane cannot be in the first position (from rule 11), the pakistani must be in the third position.

6. From rule 6, the person driving the train can be in any position. Let's assume the person driving the train is in the first position. This means the german is in the second position.

7. From rule 7, the fan of disco is to the right of the polish (who is in the second position). So, the fan of reggae must be in the first position.

8. From rule 8, the person driving the train is to the right of the person eating cucumber (who is in the first position). So, the person driving the train cannot be in the first position. This means our assumption about the train driver's position was incorrect. Let's assume the person driving the train is in the third position. This means the german is in the first position and the fan of reggae is in the second position.

9. From rule 9, the lawyer (who is the polish) is to the left of the person eating orange (who is in the third position). So, our previous assumption about the lawyer's position was incorrect. Let's assume the lawyer is in the third position. This means the fan of reggae is in the first position and the german is in the second position.

10. From rule 10, the person driving the train (who is in the third position) is not to the left of the fan of reggae (who is in the first position). So, our previous assumption about the train driver's position was correct.

11. From rule 11, the person driving the trike is in the first position.

12. From rule 12, the fan of trance is not to the right of the lawyer (who is in the third position). So, the fan of trance must be in the second position.

13. From rule 13, the fan of trance is between the person watching spy movies (who is in the third position) and the person eating cranberry (who is in the second position). So, the person eating cranberry must be in the first position.

Lv8-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column will have unique values.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Egyptian is the sailor (rule 2), let's place him in the second row (row 2) to make it easier to follow the other rules. So, the Nationality column looks like this:

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2 (Egyptian) | 3 |
   |--------------|-----|--------------|----|

3. Since the Egyptian is not the fan of house (rule 9), the house fan must be in the first or third row. Let's place the house fan in the first row (row 1) for now. So, the Music-Genre column looks like this:

   | Nationality   | 1   | 2 (Egyptian) | 3 |
   |--------------|-----|--------------|----|
   | Music-Genre  | House|             | Trance |

   |--------------|----------|--------------|----|
   | Music-Genre  | House|             | Trance |
   | Job          |        |             | Dancer|

6. Since the Italian is not the fan of house (implied from rule 9, as there's only one house fan), the Italian must be the fan of either trance or metal. Let's place the Italian in the third column (column 3) for now, so the Nationality column looks like this:

   | Nationality   | Brazilian | Egyptian | Italian |
   |--------------|----------|----------|---------|
   | Music-Genre  | House|             | Trance |
   | Job          |        |             | Dancer|

Lv8-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pear is the one with the hobby of baking, let's place the pear under the baking hobby. This means the pear is either in the first or third column.

2. The firefighter is on the far left or far right. Since the firefighter can't be in the first column (because the pear is there), the firefighter must be in the third column. This means the job of accountant and police-officer are in the first and second columns, respectively.

3. The person watching fantasy movies is the one who's sport is rugby. Since the rugby player can't be in the first column (because the firefighter is there), the rugby player must be in the second column. This means the sport of biathlon is in the third column.

4. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the rugby player is in the second column, the mystery movies must be in the first column.

5. The Italian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the rugby player is in the second column and the mystery movies are in the first column, the Italian can't be in the first column. So, the Italian is in the third column, which means the nationality of the person in the first column is American.

6. The person watching spy movies is not to the right of the Russian (who is the accountant). Since the Russian is in the first column and the mystery movies are in the first column, the spy movies must be in the second or third column. However, since the Italian is in the third column, the spy movies must be in the second column.

7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in the third column, the skydiving hobby must be in the second or third column. But since the spy movies are in the second column, the skydiving hobby must be in the third column.

8. The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the Russian (who is the accountant). Since the accountant is in the first column, the carrot can't be in the first column. So, the carrot is in the third column.

9. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the mystery movies are in the first column, the pomegranate must be in the second column.

10. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the accountant (who is the Russian). Since the Russian is in the first column, the biathlon sport must be in the second column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1      |     2      |       3        |

Lv8-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people (3 beverages, 3 foods, 3 movie-genres, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 pets). So, each row and column represents one person.

2. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking mirinda is in the middle, so we can place it in the second row and third column.

3. From rule 12, we know that the Egyptian is on the left of the Italian. Since the Italian cannot be in the first row (because the person drinking mirinda is in the middle), the Egyptian must be in the first row. Let's place the Egyptian in the first row and first column.

4. From rule 10, we know that the person eating artichoke is to the right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies cannot be in the first column (because the Egyptian is there), the person eating artichoke must be in the first row or second row. However, from rule 6, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the fan of folk, and since the Egyptian is the fan of folk, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in the first row. So, the person eating artichoke must be in the second row. Let's place the artichoke in the second row and second column.

5. From rule 2, we know that the person eating peas is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in the second row and third column, the person eating peas must be in the second row and second or first column. However, from rule 11, we know that the person eating kiwi is not the fan of hip-hop, and since the person eating artichoke is the fan of hip-hop (because it's in the second row), the person eating peas cannot be in the second column. So, the person eating peas must be in the second row and first column. Let's place the peas in the second row and first column.

6. From rule 5, we know that the person watching satire movies is not the fan of folk. Since the Egyptian is the fan of folk, the person watching satire movies cannot be the Egyptian. So, the person watching satire movies must be in the first row. However, from rule 1, we know that the three beverages are 7up, lemonade, and mirinda, and we've already placed mirinda in the second row. So, the person watching satire movies must be the fan of 7up. Let's place the satire in the first row and third column.

7. From rule 4, we know that the Thai is watching musical movies. Since the person watching musical movies cannot be in the first column (because the Egyptian is there), the Thai must be in the second column. However, from rule 8, we know that the Thai owns the goldfish, and since the goldfish cannot be in the second row (because the person drinking mirinda is there), the Thai must be in the first row. But we've already placed the satire in the first row and third column. So, the Thai must be in the first row and second column. Let's place the musical in the second row and third column.

8. From rule 3, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is the Egyptian (in the first row and first column), the owner of the hedgehog must be in the first row and either the first or second column. However, from rule 6, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the fan of folk, and since the Egyptian is the fan of folk, the person drinking lemonade cannot be in the first column. So, the owner of the hedgehog must be in the first row and second column. Let's place the hedgehog in the first row and second column.

9. Now we have placed all the elements except for the food, music-genre, and pet for the third person. Since the person drinking mirinda is in the second row and third column, the food for the third person cannot be peas (because the person eating peas is in the second row and first column). Similarly, the music-genre for the third person cannot be satire (because the person watching satire movies is in the first row and third column). The only remaining music-genre is folk, and the only remaining pet is the horse. So, the third person must be the fan of folk and the owner of the horse. Let's place the folk in the third row and third column and the horse in the third row and first column.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Egyptian   | Peas   | Artichoke |
| 7up       | Egyptian | Hedgehog   |
| Mirinda   | Kiwi    | Folk       |

Lv8-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables (Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet) and 6 unique values for each (3 for beverages, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and 3 for pets).

2. Let's start with the pets:
   - Since the turtle owner is between the musical movie watcher and the jazz fan, we can place the turtle owner in the middle (position 2). Let's say the turtle owner is the person watching sports movies (job 2).
   - The person on the left of the turtle owner (position 1) keeps a mouse (pet 1).
   - The person on the right of the turtle owner (position 3) keeps a rat (pet 3).

3. Now let's place the jobs:
   - The designer is not to the right of the fan of rock (position 7), so the designer cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4. The designer must be in position 1.
   - The designer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (position 6), so the accountant (job 3) must be in position 4.
   - The accountant is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (position 5), so the cola drinker (beverage 1) must be in position 1. The job of the cola drinker is accountant (job 3).
   - The designer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola (position 1), so the designer is in position 2.
   - The designer is not to the right of the fan of rock (position 7), so the fan of rock (music-genre 3) must be in position 3.
   - The fan of dubstep (music-genre 1) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite (beverage 2), so the fan of dubstep is in position 1.

4. Now let's place the remaining variables:
   - The person watching sports movies (job 2) is in the middle (position 2).
   - The person watching musical movies (movie-genre 2) is to the left of the fan of jazz (music-genre 4), so the musical movie watcher is in position 1.
   - The person watching western movies (movie-genre 3) is to the right of the fan of rock (music-genre 3), so the western movie watcher is in position 3.
   - The canadian (nationality 1) is not to the left of the turkish (nationality 3), so the canadian is in position 2 (since the turtle owner is the canadian).
   - The colombian (nationality 2) is not to the left of the turkish (nationality 3), so the colombian is in position 3.
   - The person drinking sprite (beverage 2) is not the fan of dubstep (music-genre 1), so the sprite drinker is in position 3.

Final solution table:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |

Lv8-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities. Since the Indonesian is to the right of the Pakistani (7), let's place the Indonesian in column 3. The Pakistani must be in either column 1 or 2, let's place them in column 1 for now.

2. The person who's sport is rowing (rowing is between biathlon and parkour, and not to the right of the Pakistani, so it can't be in column 3) must be in either column 1 or 2. Let's place them in column 1 for now.

3. The owner of the goldfish (not to the right of the owner of the goldfish who does parkour) must be to the left of the person doing parkour (column 1 or 2). Since the rower is in column 1, the goldfish owner must be in column 2.

4. The person driving the boat is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish, so it can't be in column 3. Since the rower is in column 1, the boat driver must be in column 2.

Lv8-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 items (food, movie-genre, nationality, pet, sport, transport). Each person can have only one item from each category.

2. From rule 8, we know the person eating watermelon is the person driving the bus. So, let's place the watermelon under Transport and the bus driver under Sport.

Let's place the quad-bike driver under Transport (Quad-bike).

10. From rule 3, the person watching time-travel movies is the owner of the turtle. Since we've placed the Polish (lemon) and the American (not a movie-genre), time-travel must be one of the remaining movie-genres. Let's place time-travel under Movie-Genre.

11. From rule 2, the person watching time-travel movies is the owner of the turtle. Since we've placed the Thai (nationality), the American (not a pet), and the quad-bike driver (transport), the turtle must be one of the remaining pets. Let's place the turtle under Pet.
