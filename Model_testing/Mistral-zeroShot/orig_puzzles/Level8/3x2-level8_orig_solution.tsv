Lv8-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are only two people and they have two different hobbies, gardening and skydiving, we can assign the hobbies to the two people as follows:
   - Person 1: Gardening
   - Person 2: Skydiving

2. Similarly, since they have two different movie-genres, documentary and zombie, we can assign the movie-genres as follows:
   - Person 1: Documentary
   - Person 2: Zombie

3. Now, let's consider the transport. Since they have two different means of transport, helicopter and quad-bike, we can assign the transport as follows:
   - Person 1: Helicopter (We'll place this person first as the puzzle doesn't specify the order for transport)
   - Person 2: Quad-bike

4. Now, let's check the conditions:
   - The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since we placed the helicopter driver first, this condition is satisfied.
   - The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. In our current arrangement, the gardener (Person 1) is on the right of the documentary watcher (Person 2), so this condition is also satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |  Gardening  |  Skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   |  Documentary|  Zombie   |
| Transport     |  Helicopter |  Quad-bike |

Lv8-3x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 different nationalities, and 2 different means of transport, we can assign each of them a unique position (1, 2) in the table.

2. From point 1, we know that Mirinda is in position 1 or 2 for the Beverage column. Similarly, American is in position 1 or 2 for the Nationality column, and Jet-ski is in position 1 or 2 for the Transport column.

3. From point 2, the person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the American. This means the Jet-ski cannot be in position 2 for the Transport column. So, Jet-ski is in position 1.

4. From point 3, the American is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda. Since the Jet-ski is in position 1, the American cannot be in position 2. So, the American is in position 1.

5. Now, we know that the American is in position 1, so the person driving the Jet-ski is also in position 1. This means the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 2.

6. For the remaining Beverage and Nationality positions, the only option left is Water and Spanish. So, the person drinking Water is in position 1 (since the American is already in position 1), and the Spanish person is in position 2.

7. For the Transport position, since Jet-ski is already in position 1, the only option left for position 2 is Snowmobile.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Mirinda  |     Water   |
| Nationality   |   American|     Spanish  |

Lv8-3x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 different jobs, and 2 different nationalities. So, we can fill in the first row with the 3 different options for each category:

   |               |    1    |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta   | Water           |
   | Job           | Manager | Project-Manager |
   | Nationality   | Australian | French |

2. Now let's analyze the clues:

   a. The person drinking fanta is not to the right of the french. This means the fanta cannot be in column 2. So, the fanta must be in column 1.

   b. The project-manager is not the french. This means the project-manager must be in column 1 (since the french is in column 2). So, the project-manager is the Manager.

   c. The manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since the project-manager (Manager) is in column 1 and water is in column 2, the Manager must be in row 1, and the person drinking water must be in row 2.

3. Now we can fill in the final solution:

   |               |    1    |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta   | Water           |
   | Job           | Manager | Project-Manager |
   | Nationality   | Australian | French |

   So, the final solution is:

Lv8-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, and 2 different nationalities. So, each row and each column must have unique values.

2. Let's start with the Nationality column. Since there are only two nationalities, we can fill one cell with Dutch and the other with Spanish. Let's assume Dutch is in the first column and Spanish is in the second column.

   | Nationality | Dutch | Spanish |
   |------------|-------|---------|

3. Now, let's fill the Job column. Since there are two jobs, each person must have a unique job. If the Dutch person is an architect (A), the Spanish person must have a different job, say, a dressmaker (D).

   | Nationality | Dutch  | Spanish |
   |------------|-------|---------|
   | Job        | Architect | Dressmaker |

4. Now, let's fill the Hobby column. Since there are two hobbies, each person must have a unique hobby. If the Dutch person's hobby is card-games (C), the Spanish person must have a different hobby, say, singing (S).

   | Nationality | Dutch  | Spanish |
   |------------|-------|---------|
   | Job        | Architect | Dressmaker |
   | Hobby      | Card-games | Singing |

5. Now, we have the condition that the architect is on the left of the Spanish. Since the architect is Dutch, it is already on the left of the Spanish.

6. The last condition is that the person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the Dutch. In our table, the Dutch person is in the first column and their hobby is card-games. So, the person with the hobby of singing (Spanish) must not be in the second column. But since we have already placed the Spanish in the second column, this condition is not satisfied.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given conditions, and the puzzle cannot be solved as stated.

Final solution table (with the contradiction):

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Singing   |
| Job           | Architect  | Dressmaker |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Spanish   |

However, the puzzle cannot be solved as stated due to the last condition."
Lv8-3x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since they have 2 different hobbies, we can fill the first column with either 'Chess' or 'Puzzles'. Let's say the first row is 'Puzzles'.

2. Since they have 2 different sports, the second row can't be 'Lacrosse' because it would mean the first person does both puzzles and lacrosse, which contradicts the given information. So, the second row is 'Parkour'.

3. Now, since they have 2 different means of transport, the third row can't be 'Scooter' because it would mean the first person does both puzzles, parkour, and scooter, which also contradicts the given information. So, the third row is 'Trike'.

4. Now we have a contradiction with the third condition: the person driving the trike is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. In our current arrangement, the trike is to the right of puzzles, so we need to swap the positions of the second and third rows.

5. So, the final arrangement is:

   |             |    1     |    2    |
   | Hobby       | Puzzles  | Chess   |

Lv8-3x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (cranberry and pineapple) and two movie genres (fantasy and scientific). Let's assign these to variables: F1 for the first food, F2 for the second food, M1 for the first movie genre, and M2 for the second movie genre.

2. We also know there are two nationalities (Italian and Mexican). Let's assign these to variables: N1 for the first nationality and N2 for the second nationality.

3. From the first rule, we know that the person eating cranberry (F1) is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (M1). This means that either F1 is to the right of M1 or they are in the same position (not next to each other).

4. From the second rule, we know that the Mexican (N2) is on the left of the person eating pineapple (F2). This means that F2 is not to the left of N2.

5. Now, let's try to arrange the variables based on the information we have. Since F1 can't be to the left of M1, and F2 can't be to the left of N2, the only possible arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:

   |               |     1     |     2      |
   | Food          | F2 (pineapple) | F1 (cranberry) |

Lv8-3x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are only two types of food, let's assume the person eating apple is in column 1. So, the person eating pomegranate is in column 2.

2. Similarly, since there are only two types of sports, let's assume the person playing cricket is in row 1. So, the person playing ice-hockey is in row 2.

3. Now, let's consider the transport. Since there are only two types of transport, let's assume the person driving the taxi is in row 1. So, the person driving the snowmobile is in row 2.

4. Now, let's apply the clues:

   - The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating apple (row 2 is not to the right of row 1 in any column). So, the arrangement in the first column must be: Food (Apple), Sport (Cricket), Transport (Taxi).

   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi (row 2 is to the right of row 1 in the second column). So, the arrangement in the second column must be: Food (Pomegranate), Sport (Ice-Hockey), Transport (Snowmobile).

5. Putting it all together, the final solution table is:

   ```

Lv8-3x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different hobbies (puzzles, writing) and two different movie genres (superhero, western). Let's assign these to variables: H1 for the hobby of the person on the left, H2 for the hobby of the person on the right, M1 for the movie genre of the person on the left, and M2 for the movie genre of the person on the right.

2. We also know there are two different nationalities (Colombian, Japanese). Let's assign these to variables: N1 for the nationality of the person on the left, and N2 for the nationality of the person on the right.

3. From the first condition, we know that the person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian. This means N1 cannot be Colombian and M1 cannot be western. So, N1 = Japanese and M1 = superhero.

4. From the second condition, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Colombian. Since we already know N1 = Japanese, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be on the left, so H1 = puzzles.

5. Now we have filled one row:

   |               |     1     |     2     |
   | Hobby         | Puzzles  | Writing  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Superhero| Western  |
   | Nationality   | Japanese | Colombian|

6. Now we can fill the second row by process of elimination. Since H1 = Puzzles, H2 must be Writing. Since M1 = Superhero, M2 must be Western. Since N1 = Japanese, N2 must be Colombian.

Lv8-3x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres (epic and family), 2 different music-genres (classical and disco), and 2 different means of transport (train and van).

2. From the first condition, the person watching an epic movie is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. This means that either the epic movie is in column 2 and classical in column 1, or both are in column 2 (epic is to the right of classical).

3. From the second condition, the fan of classical is not to the left of the person driving the train. This means that the train cannot be in the first row (as classical would be to its left). So, the train must be in the second row.

4. Now, let's consider the case where both movie genres are in column 2. If that were the case, the train (which we know is in the second row) would have to be driving the van (since the other option, the epic movie, is to its right). But this would mean that the classical music fan is to the left of the train, which contradicts the second condition.

5. Therefore, the only remaining option is that the epic movie is in the first column and the family movie is in the second column. The classical music fan is in the first row, and the disco music fan is in the second row. The train is driving the van in the second row.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv8-3x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 6 variables: Food (F1, F2), Pet (P1, P2), Transport (T1, T2). We know there are 2 of each, so we can represent them as F1 = lime or pomegranate, P1 = goat or hamster, T1 = car or motorbike, F2, P2, T2 are the remaining options.

2. From the first rule, we know that the owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the goat. This means P1 cannot be in the rightmost column, and P2 cannot be in the leftmost column.

3. From the second rule, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person driving the car. This means P2 is in a column to the left of T1.

4. From the third rule, we know that the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position. Since there are 3 columns and 2 rows, the pomegranate eater must be in the middle column (F2).

5. Now we know that F2 = pomegranate, P2 = (goat or hamster), and T1 = (car or motorbike). Since P2 is to the left of T1, P2 cannot be the goat (as goat is in the rightmost column). So, P2 = hamster.

6. Since P2 = hamster, P1 = goat. Now we know that P1 is not in the rightmost column, so P1 = goat must be in the leftmost column.

7. Since F2 = pomegranate is in the middle column, F1 must be lime (as the other food option, pomegranate, is already taken).

8. Since T1 is in the rightmost column (as P1 is in the leftmost column), T1 = motorbike.

9. Now we have one remaining variable, T2. Since there are only 2 options left (car and motorbike), T2 = car.
