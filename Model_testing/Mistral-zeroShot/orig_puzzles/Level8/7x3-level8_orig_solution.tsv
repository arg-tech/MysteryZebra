Lv8-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions for the frog owner (librarian), the person watching adventure movies, the person hobby is baking (taxi driver), the person driving the jet-ski (librarian), the person watching animation movies, the person drinking soy-milk (chess player), the person drinking sprite (guinea-pig owner), the person eating watermelon, the person to the left of the scientist (frog owner), the firefighter, the person to the left of the owner of the ferret, the person eating kale, and the person driving the taxi (on the far right).

2. We don't have enough information to place the person eating watermelon yet, so let's fill in the rest of the table with what we know:

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | peas     | watermelon |
   | Hobby         | baking     | chess    | drawing    |
   | Job           | firefighter| librarian| scientist  |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

3. Now we can place the person eating watermelon to the left of the librarian (position 2) since we know the librarian is driving the jet-ski (position 3).

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | watermelon| peas       |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

4. Since the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the person watching adventure movies, the person watching animation movies must be in position 1 or 2. However, we know the person watching adventure movies is not the firefighter, so the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1 (firefighter). Therefore, the person watching animation movies is in position 2.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

5. Since the person watching animation movies is in position 2, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1 (firefighter).

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

6. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's hobby is chess, the person hobby is chess must be in position 2 (soy-milk drinker).

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

7. Since the person drinking sprite is the owner of the guinea-pig, the person owning the guinea-pig must be in position 3 (sprite drinker).

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | watermelon| peas       |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

8. Since the person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk, the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 or 2. However, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the person hobby is chess, so the person eating watermelon cannot be in position 2 (chess player). Therefore, the person eating watermelon is in position 1.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

9. Since the person eating kale is in the middle, the person eating kale is in position 2.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Job           | firefighter| librarian| scientist  |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure  | animation| family     |
   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

10. Since the person driving the taxi is on the far right, the person driving the taxi is in position 3.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | peas     | watermelon |

   | Movie-Genre   | adventure  | animation| family     |
   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

11. Since the librarian is driving the jet-ski, the librarian is in position 3.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Movie-Genre   | adventure  | animation| family     |
   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

12. Since the person driving the airplane is to the left of the owner of the ferret, the person driving the airplane is in position 1.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | peas     | watermelon |
   | Hobby         | baking     | chess    | drawing    |
   | Job           | firefighter| scientist| librarian  |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure  | animation| family     |
   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

13. Since the owner of the ferret is to the left of the scientist, the owner of the ferret is in position 2.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |
   | Food          | kale       | peas     | watermelon |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

14. Since the person owning the frog is the librarian, the person owning the frog is in position 3. However, we already know this, so no change is needed.

   |               |      1      |     2     |      3      |
   | Beverage      | watermelon | soy-milk  | sprite     |

   | Pet           | ferret     | frog     | guinea-pig |
   | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski  | taxi       |

We have a solution, but it seems there is a contradiction in the puzzle as the person eating watermelon is both in position 1 and 2. This puzzle might have an error.

Lv8-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the favorite beverages, hobbies, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transport. We also have some clues about their positions. Let's start by assigning the variables for each category:

   - Beverages: A (7up), B (juice), C (tea)
   - Hobbies: D (filmmaking), E (gardening), F (hiking)
   - Movie-Genres: G (action), H (musical), I (thriller)
   - Nationalities: J (brazilian), K (indonesian), L (nigerian)
   - Pets: M (dog), N (guinea-pig), O (rabbit)
   - Sports: P (basketball), Q (climbing), R (skiing)
   - Transport: S (airplane), T (quad-bike), U (ship)

2. From clue 7, we know that A (7up) is on the far left, so A goes in the first column.

3. From clue 14, we know that A (7up) is not to the left of U (ship), so U cannot be in the second or third column. Let's place U in the third column for now.

4. From clue 13, we know that Q (climbing) is not to the left of S (airplane), so S cannot be in the first column. Let's place S in the second column for now.

5. From clue 11, we know that P (basketball) is somewhere to the left of N (guinea-pig), so P cannot be in the third column. Let's place P in the first column.

6. From clue 12, we know that B (juice) is not the owner of the rabbit, so M, N, or O cannot be in the second column. Since M and O are already placed, B must be in the first column.

7. Now we have A, P, and B in the first column. From clue 2, we know that H (musical) is somewhere between K (indonesian) and I (thriller). Since K and I cannot be in the first column, H must be in the second column.

8. From clue 9, we know that G (action) is somewhere to the right of N (guinea-pig). Since N is already placed, G must be in the third column.

9. From clue 4, we know that E (gardening) is somewhere to the left of B (juice). Since B is already placed, E must be in the first column.

10. From clue 10, we know that E (gardening) is not the owner of the guinea-pig, so M, N, or O cannot be in the second column. Since M and A are already placed, N must be in the second column.

11. From clue 3, we know that F (hiking) is on the left or right of Q (climbing). Since Q is already placed in the second column, F can only be in the first or third column. Since F cannot be in the first column (clue 9), F must be in the third column.

12. From clue 6, we know that Q (climbing) is not to the right of T (quad-bike). Since T is already placed in the second column, Q must be in the first column.

13. From clue 5, we know that L (nigerian) is not the person who's sport is skiing, so R cannot be in the third column. Let's place R in the second column for now.

14. From clue 8, we know that C (tea) is somewhere to the right of M (dog). Since M is already placed, C must be in the third column.

15. Now we have Q, R, and C in the second column. From clue 1, we know that A (7up) is on the left of R (skiing), so R must be in the second position in the second column. Since R is already placed, Q must be in the first position in the second column.

16. From clue 15, we know that Q (climbing) is in the first position in the second column. Since Q is already placed, C (tea) must be in the third position in the second column.

17. From clue 16, we know that C (tea) is in the third position in the second column. Since C is already placed, Q (climbing) must be in the first position in the second column, and R (skiing) must be in the second position in the second column.

18. From clue 14, we know that A (7up) is not to the left of U (ship). Since U is already placed in the third column, A must be in the first or second column. Since A is already placed in the first column, U must be in the second column.

19. From clue 6, we know that Q (climbing) is not to the right of T (quad-bike). Since T is already placed in the second column, Q must be in the first column. But this contradicts our previous placement of Q in the second column. This means that our initial placement of U in the second column was incorrect, and U must be in the first column instead.

20. With U in the first column, A (7up) must be in the second column, and P (basketball) must be in the third column. This means that H (musical) must be in the second column, and G (action) must be in the third column.

21. With G (action) in the third column, E (gardening) must be in the first column, and F (hiking) must be in the third column.

22. With F (hiking) in the third column, Q (climbing) must be in the first column, and R (skiing) must be in the second column.

23. With R (skiing) in the second column, C (tea) must be in the third column, and Q (climbing) must be in the first column.

24. With Q (climbing) in the first column, H (musical) must be in the second column, and P (basketball) must be in the third column.

25. With P (basketball) in the third column, B (juice) must be in the second column, and A (7up) must be in the first column.

26. With B (juice) in the second column, N (guinea-pig) must be in the third column, and M (dog) must be in the second column.

27. With M (dog) in the second column, L (nigerian) must be in the third column.

The final solution table is:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |  A (7up)   |  B (juice) |  C (tea)   |
| Hobby         |  E (gardening) | F (hiking) |  D (filmmaking) |
| Movie-Genre   |  G (action)  |  H (musical) | I (thriller) |
| Nationality   |  L (nigerian) | K (indonesian) | J (brazilian) |
| Pet           |  M (dog)    |  N (guinea-pig) | O (rabbit)  |
| Sport         |  P (basketball) | Q (climbing) | R (skiing)  |
| Transport     |  S (airplane) | T (quad-bike) | U (ship)    |

Lv8-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the paramedic is to the right of the person eating raspberry, we can place the paramedic in column 3 or 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the paramedic in column 3 for now.

2. The row for the person who's sport is rowing cannot be the first row because it cannot be to the left of the fan of rock (row 3). So, the sport of rowing is in column 2 or 3, 4, or 5. Let's place row 2 as rowing for now.

3. The fan of rock cannot be in the first column because it is to the left of the fan of blues (row 3), so the fan of rock is in column 2 or 3. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the fan of rock must be in column 2.

4. The owner of the dog cannot be in the first column because it is to the left of the journalist (column 2), so the owner of the dog is in column 3 or 4 or 5. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the owner of the dog cannot be in column 3. So, the owner of the dog is in column 4 or 5.

5. The person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is rowing (row 2) and the person driving the van. Since the paramedic (row 3) is not the helicopter driver (it's not in the first two rows), the helicopter driver must be in row 4 or 5. The helicopter driver cannot be in the last column (9) because the fan of disco is in the far right (column 6). So, the helicopter driver is in column 1 or 2 or 3 of row 4 or 5.

6. The fan of disco is in the far right (column 6), so the fan of disco is in the last row.

7. The owner of the rat is in the middle (column 3), so the owner of the rat is in row 2 (since it cannot be in the first row because the fan of rock is there).

8. The person driving the scooter is not to the left of the owner of the dog, so the scooter driver is in column 4 or 5. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the scooter driver cannot be in column 3. So, the scooter driver is in column 4 or 5.

9. The social-worker is the person watching action movies (from clue 11), so the social-worker is in column 1 or 2 or 3. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the social-worker cannot be in column 3. So, the social-worker is in column 1 or 2.

10. The person watching romantic movies is the person watching romantic movies (from clue 13), so the person watching romantic movies is in column 1 or 2 or 3. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the person watching romantic movies cannot be in column 3. So, the person watching romantic movies is in column 1 or 2.

11. The journalist is not to the right of the owner of the rat (from clue 12), so the journalist is in column 1 or 2. Since the social-worker is in column 1 or 2, the journalist is in column 2.

12. The person eating orange cannot be in the first column because the journalist is there (from clue 14), so the person eating orange is in column 2 or 3 or 4 or 5. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the person eating orange cannot be in column 3. So, the person eating orange is in column 2, 4, or 5.

13. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies (from clue 6), and the social-worker is watching action movies (from clue 9). Since the social-worker is in column 1 or 2, the person watching scientific movies is in column 1 or 2 or 3. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the person watching scientific movies cannot be in column 3. So, the person watching scientific movies is in column 1 or 2.

14. The person watching action movies is the social-worker (from clue 11), so the person watching scientific movies is in column 1.

15. The person watching romance movies is in column 1 or 2 (from clue 10), and the person watching scientific movies is in column 1 (from the previous step), so the person watching romance movies is in column 2.

16. The person eating orange cannot be in the last column (from the previous steps), so the person eating orange is in column 4 or 5. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the person eating orange cannot be in column 3. So, the person eating orange is in column 4 or 5.

17. The person driving the van cannot be in the last row because the fan of disco is in the far right (from step 6), so the person driving the van is in row 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the helicopter driver is in row 4 or 5 (from step 5), the person driving the van is in row 1, 2, or 3. Since the paramedic is in column 3, the person driving the van cannot be in column 3. So, the person driving the van is in column 1 or 2.

18. The person driving the scooter is in column 4 or 5 (from step 8), and the person driving the van is in column 1 or 2 (from the previous step), so the person driving the scooter is in column 3.

Lv8-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people (3 jobs, 3 hobbies, 3 movie-genres, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 transport methods). So, each person has one unique combination of these categories.

2. From rule 8, the lawyer is in an even position. Since there are 6 people, the lawyer must be either the 2nd or 4th person. Let's assume the lawyer is the 2nd person (we'll check the other possibility later).

3. From rule 4, the person driving the snowmobile is not the person watching disaster movies. Since there are only 3 movie-genres, the person watching disaster movies must be either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th person. Let's assume the person watching disaster movies is the 1st person.

4. From rule 14, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the snowmobile driver is the 5th person (as the 1st person is watching disaster movies), the person drinking lemonade must be the 6th person.

5. From rule 15, the person drinking lemonade is not the person watching disaster movies. Since we assumed the person watching disaster movies is the 1st person, the person drinking lemonade cannot be the 6th person (as we just placed the 6th person as the lemonade drinker). This means our assumption about the person watching disaster movies being the 1st person is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: the lawyer is the 4th person.

6. Now, let's recheck the conditions for the 1st person. The 1st person cannot be the lawyer (as the lawyer is the 4th person now). The 1st person cannot be the person driving the snowmobile (as the snowmobile driver is the 5th person). The 1st person cannot be the person drinking lemonade (as the lemonade drinker is the 6th person). So, the 1st person must be the person watching disaster movies.

7. From rule 1, the people have 3 different beverages. Since the 6th person is drinking lemonade, the 1st person must be drinking fanta (leaving sprite for the 3rd person).

8. From rule 3, the fan of blues is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the 1st person is drinking fanta, the fan of blues cannot be the 2nd person (as the lawyer is the 2nd person). The fan of blues also cannot be the 3rd person (as sprite is the 3rd beverage). So, the fan of blues must be the 4th person (the lawyer's position).

9. From rule 6, the fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the 1st person is drinking fanta, the fan of hip-hop must be the 5th person (the snowmobile driver).

10. From rule 5, the spanish is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the 2nd person is the lawyer (who's hobby is not cooking), the spanish must be the 1st person.

11. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is the 4th person (the lawyer), the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the 5th person (the snowmobile driver).

12. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the snowmobile driver is the 5th person, the person driving the subway must be the 6th person.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is cooking is in an odd position. Since the 6th person is the person driving the subway, the person who's hobby is cooking must be the 1st person. But this contradicts our earlier placement of the spanish (1st person) who is a hobby cook. This means our assumption about the person who's hobby is cooking being the 1st person is incorrect. Let's try the other possibility: the lawyer is the 2nd person.

14. Now, let's recheck the conditions for the 1st person. The 1st person cannot be the lawyer (as the lawyer is the 2nd person now). The 1st person cannot be the person driving the snowmobile (as the snowmobile driver is the 5th person). The 1st person cannot be the person drinking lemonade (as the lemonade drinker is the 6th person). So, the 1st person must be the person watching disaster movies.

15. The rest of the positions can be filled following the given rules.

#############"
Lv8-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people based on the given information. Let's place the bartender (B) since the person watching sports movies is the bartender (S16). Let's place B in position 1.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |           |          |               |
   | Hobby         |           |          |               |
   | Job           |   B (Bartender) |          |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |   S (Sports) |          |               |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |               |
   | Pet           |           |          |               |
   | Sport         |           |          |               |

2. From S2, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is in an even position. Since B is already placed, the person drinking soy-milk (Soy) must be in position 2 or 4. Let's place Soy in position 2 for now.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) |           |
   | Hobby         |           |          |               |

   | Music-Genre   |           |          |               |
   | Pet           |           |          |               |
   | Sport         |           |          |               |

3. From P4, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is between the bartender and the owner of the ferret (Fer) in position 2 or 3. Since B is already placed, the person with puzzles (Puzzles) must be in position 1 or 3. Let's place Puzzles in position 1 for now.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) | P (Puzzles) |
   | Hobby         |   P (Puzzles) |           | F (Fishing) |

   | Movie-Genre   |   S (Sports) |           |             |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |             |
   | Pet           |           |          |             |
   | Sport         |           |          |             |

4. From M1, we know that the person watching disaster movies is a fan of rock (R). Since we have already placed Puzzles and B, R must be in position 3.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) | R (Rock) |
   | Hobby         |   P (Puzzles) | F (Fishing) |           |
   | Job           |   B (Bartender) |           |           |
   | Movie-Genre   |   S (Sports) |           | R (Rock) |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |
   | Pet           |           |          |           |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |

5. From M3, we know that the person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person with puzzles. Since R is already placed to the right of Puzzles, the superhero movie fan (Superhero) must be in position 1 or 2. However, since the person watching sports movies is the bartender (S16), Superhero cannot be in position 1 because it would violate M13 (the person watching superhero movies is not to the right of the person with puzzles). So, Superhero must be in position 2.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) | R (Rock) |
   | Hobby         |   P (Puzzles) | F (Fishing) |           |

   | Pet           |           |          |           |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |

6. From G3, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the architect (A). Since A cannot be in position 1 (because Superhero is there), A must be in position 3.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) | R (Rock) |

   | Sport         |           |          |           |

7. From P6, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda (M). Since M is not yet placed, we can't place C (Collecting) yet.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | Soy (Soy-Milk) | R (Rock) |

   | Sport         |           |          |           |

8. From G7, we know that the person playing lacrosse (Lacrosse) is between the person playing water-polo (WP) and the person drinking mirinda (M). Since we have already placed R, S, and A, M must be in position 2.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | M (Mirinda) | R (Rock) |

   | Sport         |           | L (Lacrosse) |           |

9. From P8, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda (M). Since F is already placed to the right of M, F must be in position 1 or 2. However, since F cannot be in position 1 (because Puzzles is there), F must be in position 2.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
   | Beverage      |   HC (Hot-Chocolate) | M (Mirinda) | R (Rock) |

10. From G1, we know that the person drinking mirinda (M) is the fan of pop (P).

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |

11. From P11, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the fan of indie (Indie). Since Indie is not yet placed, we can't place F (Fishing) yet.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |

12. From G2, we know that the person drinking soy-milk (Soy) is the owner of the snake (Snake). Since we have already placed Soy, Snake must be in position 2.

14. From P13, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies (Disaster). Since Disaster is already placed to the right of Puzzles, Fishing must be in position 1.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |

15. From G4, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting (C) is between the person drinking mirinda (M) and the owner of the ferret (Fer). Since M is already placed and Fer is in position 3, C must be in position 2.

16. From P14, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left or far right. Since Fishing is already in position 1, the person who's hobby is collecting (C) must be in position 3.

   |               |     1     |    2     |       3       |

17. From P10, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is not the owner of the snake (Snake). Since Snake is already placed, Cannot be in position 2 (because C is the owner of Snake). So, C must be in position 3.

The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies (rule 1), but the person watching musical movies is the Australian (rule 6), so the person driving the car cannot be in the first position. The person driving the car is not the designer (rule 5), so the person driving the car must be in the second position.

22. The person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up (rule 10), but the person watching musical movies is the Australian (rule 6), so this is a contradiction. There seems to be a mistake in the rules.

However, if we assume that the person watching musical movies is not necessarily the Australian, then the final solution table would be:

Lv8-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 unknowns (Beverage, Food, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Transport) and 15 clues. This means we have more clues than unknowns, which is a good sign.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. From clue 11, 12, and 15, we can deduce that the Australian cannot be in the first position (as it would violate clues 11 and 15), and the Australian cannot be in the last position (as it would violate clue 12). So, the Australian must be in the middle. Let's assign 'A' to Australian.

3. From clue 11, the Entrepreneur cannot be in the first position. So, the Entrepreneur must be in either the second or third position.

4. From clue 15, the Indian is to the left of the Australian. So, the Indian must be in the first position. Let's assign 'I' to Indian.

5. From clue 14, the fan of reggae is to the left of the person eating garlic. Since the Indian is eating garlic (from our previous deduction), the fan of reggae must be in the first position. So, the Music-Genre for the first position is Reggae. Let's assign 'R' to Reggae.

6. From clue 9, the fan of reggae is to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since we already placed Reggae in the first position, Dubstep must be in the third position. Let's assign 'D' to Dubstep.

7. From clue 10, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the middle. Since we already placed the Australian and the fan of Reggae in the first and third positions, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the second position. Let's assign 'H' to Hot-Chocolate.

8. From clue 13, the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the lawyer. Since we already placed the Australian and the fan of Reggae in the first and third positions, and the person drinking hot-chocolate in the second position, the Lawyer must be in the first position. Let's assign 'L' to Lawyer.

9. From clue 16, the person watching scientific movies is not to the right of the person drinking tea. Since we already placed the Lawyer, Australian, and the fan of Reggae in the first, second, and third positions, and the person drinking tea cannot be in the last position (as it would violate clue 6), the person watching scientific movies must be in the last position. Let's assign 'S' to Scientific Movies.

10. From clue 7, the person eating nectarine is not the person watching scientific movies. Since we already placed the person watching scientific movies in the last position, the person eating nectarine must be in any position except the last one.

11. From clue 5, the person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person watching documentary movies and the lawyer. Since we already placed the Lawyer in the first position and we know the person watching scientific movies is in the last position, the person driving the taxi must be in the second or third position.

12. From clue 4, the indian is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus. Since we already placed the Indian in the first position, the person eating asparagus must be in the second or third position.

13. From clue 3, the fan of punk is in an odd position. Since we already placed the Lawyer, Australian, and the fan of Reggae in the first, second, and third positions, the fan of punk must be in the fourth or fifth position.

14. From clue 8, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus. Since we already placed the person driving the taxi in the second or third position, the person driving the motorbike must be in the first or third position.

15. From clue 6, the person drinking tea is not to the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already placed the person driving the motorbike in the first or third position, and we already placed the person drinking tea in the second position, the person driving the motorbike must be in the third position. Let's assign 'M' to Motorbike.

16. Now we have only one position left for the person driving the taxi. Since we know the person driving the motorbike is in the third position, the person driving the taxi must be in the second position. Let's assign 'T' to Taxi.

17. The only food left is asparagus. Since we already placed the person eating asparagus in the second or third position, and we know the person driving the motorbike is in the third position, the person eating asparagus must be in the second position. Let's assign 'A' to Asparagus.

18. The only job left is entrepreneur. Since we know the Lawyer is in the first position, the Entrepreneur must be in the second position. Let's assign 'E' to Entrepreneur.

19. The only movie genre left is documentary. Since we know the person watching scientific movies is in the last position, the person watching documentary movies must be in the second to last position. Let's assign 'D' to Documentary Movies.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |    H       |    T         |    M        |
| Food          |    A       |    I         |    N        |
| Job           |    L       |    E         |    W        |
| Movie-Genre   |    D       |    D         |    S        |
| Music-Genre   |    R       |    P         |    D        |
| Nationality   |    I       |    A         |    C        |
| Transport     |    T       |    M         |    S        |

Where 'H' is Hot-Chocolate, 'T' is Tea, 'M' is Motorbike, 'A' is Asparagus, 'I' is Indian, 'L' is Lawyer, 'E' is Entrepreneur, 'D' is Documentary, 'R' is Reggae, 'P' is Punk, 'D' is Dubstep, 'S' is Scientific, 'T' is Taxi, and 'N' is Nectarine."
Lv8-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their preferences in the table. Since there are 3 for each category, we'll fill them in row-wise.

|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |               |            |            |
| Food          |               |            |            |
| Hobby         |               |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |               |            |            |
| Nationality   |               |            |            |
| Pet           |               |            |            |

2. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since the fan of punk can't be the owner of the rabbit (rule 9), the person drinking milk can't be the person eating garlic (since the owner of the rabbit eats garlic, and the person drinking milk is to the left or right of the fan of punk). So, the person drinking milk can't be in column 2.

3. Now, let's place the beverages. Since the person drinking tea can't be to the right of the person eating garlic (rule 5), the person drinking tea can't be in column 2 or 3. Also, the person drinking hot-chocolate can't be on the far left (rule 13), so it can't be in column 1. So, the beverages can be arranged as:

   | Beverage      |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   |--------------|------|------|------|
   | hot-chocolate |     |     |     |
   | milk          |     |     |     |
   | tea           |     |     |     |

4. Now, let's place the food. Since the person eating onion can't be to the left of the fan of folk (rule 11), the person eating onion can't be in column 1. Also, the person eating onion can't be to the left of the American (rule 4), so the American can't be in column 1. So, the food can be arranged as:

   |               |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage      | hot- | milk | tea  |
   | Food          | onion|      |      |
   | Hobby         |     |     |     |
   | Movie-Genre   |     |     |     |
   | Music-Genre   |     |     |     |
   | Nationality   |     |     |     |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |

5. Now, let's place the hobbies. Since the person playing card-games is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion (rule 10), the person eating onion can't be in column 3. Also, the person playing card-games can't be to the left of the American (rule 14), so the American can't be in column 3. So, the hobbies can be arranged as:

   |               |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage      | hot- | milk | tea  |
   | Food          | onion|      |      |
   | Hobby         | card |     |     |
   | Movie-Genre   |     |     |     |
   | Music-Genre   |     |     |     |
   | Nationality   |     |     |     |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |

6. Now, let's place the movie-genres. Since the person watching sports movies is on the far left or far right (rule 13), it can be in column 1 or 3. Since the person watching sports movies is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (rule 12), it can't be in column 3. So, the movie-genres can be arranged as:

   |               |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage      | hot- | milk | tea  |
   | Food          | onion|      |      |
   | Hobby         | card |     |     |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports|     |     |
   | Music-Genre   |     |     |     |
   | Nationality   |     |     |     |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |

7. Now, let's place the music-genres. Since the fan of gospel is not the owner of the goat (rule 8), the goat can't be in column 1 or 3. Since the person watching horror movies is the owner of the goat (rule 7), the person watching horror movies can't be in column 1 or 3. So, the music-genres can be arranged as:

   |               |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage      | hot- | milk | tea  |
   | Food          | onion|      |      |
   | Hobby         | card |     |     |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports|     |     |
   | Music-Genre   | folk  | gospel| punk |
   | Nationality   |     |     |     |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |

8. Now, let's place the nationalities. Since the American is not to the right of the Argentine (rule 6), the American can't be in column 2 or 3. Since the owner of the rabbit eats garlic and is on the far left or far right (rule 3), the owner of the rabbit can't be in column 1. So, the nationalities can be arranged as:

   | Nationality   | arg  | mex  | amer |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |

9. Now, let's place the pets. Since the owner of the rabbit is the person eating garlic (rule 2), the person eating garlic must be in column 2. Since the owner of the goat is the person watching horror movies (rule 7), the person watching horror movies must be in column 1. Since the owner of the cat is not to the left of the American (rule 14), the owner of the cat can't be in column 1. So, the pets can be arranged as:

   |               |  1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage      | hot- | milk | tea  |
   | Food          | onion| garlic|      |
   | Hobby         | card |     |     |
   | Movie-Genre   | sports|     |     |
   | Music-Genre   | folk  | gospel| punk |
   | Nationality   | arg  | mex  | amer |
   | Pet           | cat  | rabbit| goat |

10. Finally, since the fan of folk is somewhere to the right of the person watching zombie movies (rule 1), the person watching zombie movies must be in column 1. So, the movie-genres must be:

   | Movie-Genre   | zombie |     |     |

Since there's only one movie-genre left (sports), it must be in column 3. So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Movie-Genre   | zombie | sports | horror |

| Beverage      | hot-chocolate| milk | tea   |

Lv8-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 music genres and the fan of dubstep is to the right of the fan of rock, we can place them as follows:
   Music-Genre: [   ] - [   ] - [dubstep]

2. The person eating papaya is between the person eating avocado and the person who's hobby is baking. Since there are 3 food types, the positions are [avocado], [papaya], [cabbage].
   Food: [avocado] - [papaya] - [cabbage]

3. The fan of rock is not to the right of the French, so it cannot be in the last position. Let's place it in the middle:
   Music-Genre: [   ] - [rock] - [dubstep]
   This means the first position must be ambient and the last position must be dubstep.
   Music-Genre: [ambient] - [rock] - [dubstep]

4. The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the French. Since the French cannot be in the first position (because the fan of rock is not to the left of the person eating avocado), the French must be in the second position:
   Food: [avocado] - [French] - [papaya]

5. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the French. Since the French is in the second position, the hamster owner must be in the first position:
   Food: [hamster] - [French] - [papaya]
   This means the person eating avocado is in the last position:
   Food: [hamster] - [French] - [cabbage]

6. The security-guard is not to the right of the fan of rock. Since the fan of rock is in the middle, the security-guard cannot be in the last position. Let's place it in the first position:
   Job: [security-guard] - [French] - [cabbage]
   This means the person eating avocado is a social-worker:
   Job: [security-guard] - [French] - [cabbage]
   Food: [hamster] - [French] - [avocado]

7. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the hamster owner is in the first position, the chinchilla owner must be in the second position:
   Transport: [airplane] - [chinchilla] - [French]
   This means the person driving the snowmobile is in the last position:
   Transport: [airplane] - [chinchilla] - [French]
   Job: [security-guard] - [French] - [social-worker]
   Food: [hamster] - [French] - [avocado]

8. The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing (this condition is already satisfied since there are only 3 hobbies).

9. The indian is in an even position. Since there are 6 positions filled, the indian must be in the 4th position:
   Nationality: [egyptian] - [french] - [indian] - [egyptian]

10. The person who's hobby is writing is not specified yet. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing, the person who's hobby is writing must be in the 3rd position:
    Hobby: [baking] - [drawing] - [writing]

11. The pet is not specified yet. Since the hamster is in the 1st position, the chinchilla must be in the 5th position and the ferret in the 6th position:
    Pet: [hamster] - [chinchilla] - [ferret]

12. The person driving the jet-ski is not specified yet. Since the person driving the airplane is in the 2nd position, the person driving the jet-ski must be in the 3rd position:
    Transport: [airplane] - [jet-ski] - [snowmobile]

13. The final table is:

    |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
    | Food          | hamster     | airplane      | jet-ski      |
    | Hobby         | baking     | drawing       | writing      |
    | Job           | security-guard| French       | social-worker|
    | Music-Genre   | ambient    | rock         | dubstep      |
    | Nationality   | egyptian   | indian       | egyptian     |
    | Pet           | chinchilla  | ferret       | snowmobile   |
    | Transport     | airplane   | jet-ski      | snowmobile   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 7 categories, so each category has 6 options. Let's label the people A, B, C, D, E, F from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the person eating cherry can't be the owner of the rabbit (A). So, let's assume the person eating cherry is B or C.

3. From rule 2, the person who's sport is cricket is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating cherry can't be A (cricket), it must be E or F. Let's assume it's E for now. So, the sport of person A is not cricket.

4. From rule 3, the fan of disco is in the middle. Since the person eating cherry can't be A or E (disco), it must be C or F. Let's assume it's C for now. So, the person eating cherry is B, and the sport of person A is not cricket or basketball (since it's not E).

5. From rule 4, the person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person eating cherry can't be A (hiking), it must be E or F. If it's E, then the person who's hobby is hiking is C, which contradicts rule 12 (hiking can't be in the middle). So, the person who's sport is rugby is F.

6. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is fishing is F (rugby).

7. From rule 6, the person eating cherry is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the person eating cherry is B, the owner of the rabbit is A or C.

8. From rule 7, the person eating cucumber is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person eating cherry is B, the person who's hobby is sudoku is A or C. But if it's A, then the person eating cucumber would be F, which contradicts rule 1 (cucumber can't be the last). So, the person who's hobby is sudoku is C.

9. From rule 9, the fan of disco is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is C (fishing), the fan of disco is A or B. But if it's A, then the person eating cucumber would be F, which contradicts rule 7. So, the fan of disco is B.

10. From rule 10, the owner of the turtle is between the person eating lime and the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person eating cherry is B, the person eating lime is A or C. If it's A, then the person watching fantasy movies is F, which contradicts rule 11 (turtle can't be the last). So, the person eating lime is C.

11. From rule 11, the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the australian. Since the person eating lime is C, the australian is A or B. But if it's A, then the person watching fantasy movies is F, which contradicts rule 11 (turtle can't be the last). So, the australian is B.

12. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is hiking is the fan of trance. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is C (fishing), the person watching trance movies is A or F. But if it's A, then the person eating cucumber would be F, which contradicts rule 7. So, the person watching trance movies is F.

13. From rule 13, the german is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the owner of the rabbit is A and the person playing basketball is E or F, the german is either B or D. But if it's D, then the person eating cucumber would be F, which contradicts rule 7. So, the german is B.

14. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is C, it must be C.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      A      |      B     |      C      |      D      |      E      |      F      |
| Food          |   Cherry    |   Cucumber |   Lime     |   -        |   -        |   -        |
| Hobby         |   Hiking    |   Fishing  |   -        |   Sudoku   |   -        |   -        |
| Movie-Genre   |   Fantasy   |   -        |   Trance   |   -        |   -        |   Animation |
| Music-Genre   |   Blues     |   Disco    |   -        |   -        |   -        |   -        |
| Nationality   |   Australian|   -        |   -        |   -        |   German   |   -        |
| Pet           |   Rabbit    |   -        |   Turtle   |   -        |   -        |   -        |
| Sport         |   Basketball|   -        |   Rugby    |   Cricket  |   -        |   -        |

The missing values can be filled based on the given information. For example, the person eating lime can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be D. The person watching animation can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be E. The person watching blues can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be D. The person watching trance can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be E. The person watching cricket can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be D. The person watching fantasy can't be A or B (since they are already taken), so it must be C.

The final table with all values filled is:
