Lv8-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 jobs and 6 music genres, so each row and each column represents a unique combination of a job and a music genre.

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan of jazz is on the left of the lawyer. Let's place the lawyer and the fan of jazz in the first two spots. We can fill the first row as follows:
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Lawyer| Jazz       |
   |      |           |

3. From rule 2, the manager is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since the lawyer is already on the left, the manager must be on the right of the fan of house. Let's place the fan of house in the third spot of the second row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Lawyer| Jazz       |
   |      |           |
   | Manager| House     |

4. From rule 3, the manager is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. Since the manager is already in the second row, the fan of classical must be in the first row. Let's place the fan of classical in the first spot of the first row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Classical|           |
   | Lawyer| Jazz       |
   | Manager| House     |

5. From rule 4, the fan of soul is not to the left of the nurse. Since the nurse must be on the right of the fan of jazz (rule 13), the fan of soul cannot be in the first four spots. Let's place the fan of soul in the fifth spot of the third row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Classical|           |
   | Lawyer| Jazz       |
   | Manager| House     |
   |       | Soul      |

6. From rule 5, the security-guard is somewhere to the right of the fan of rock. Since the fan of soul is already in the fifth spot of the third row, the fan of rock must be in the sixth spot of the third row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Classical|           |
   | Lawyer| Jazz       |
   | Manager| House     |
   |       | Soul      |
   |       | Rock      |

7. From rule 6, the fan of rock is somewhere between the fan of jazz and the security-guard. Since the fan of rock is already in the third row, the security-guard must be in the fourth spot of the fourth row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |

   |       | Rock      |
   |       |           |

8. From rule 7, the fan of house is not in the first three spots of the second row. Since the manager is already in the second spot of the second row, the fan of house must be in the fourth or sixth spot of the second row. However, if it were in the sixth spot, it would violate rule 8 (the pilot is on the left or right of the fan of house), so the fan of house must be in the fourth spot of the second row.
   | Job   | Music-Genre |
   |-------|------------|
   | Classical|           |

   |       | Rock      |
   | Pilot|           |

9. From rule 9, the security-guard is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the security-guard is already in the fourth spot of the fourth row, the pilot must be in the fifth or sixth spot of the fourth row. However, if it were in the sixth spot, it would violate rule 16 (the pilot is not the fan of r&b), so the pilot must be in the fifth spot of the fourth row.

   | Pilot| R&B      |
   | Security-Guard|       |

10. From rule 10, the fan of classical is not to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic must be on the right of the fan of jazz (rule 13), the fan of classical cannot be in the first four spots. Let's place the paramedic in the fifth spot of the fifth row and the fan of classical in the first spot of the fifth row.

    | Security-Guard|       |
    |       |           |
    | Paramedic|         |

11. From rule 11, the fan of rock is somewhere to the right of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is already in the fifth row, the fan of rock must be in the sixth spot of the fifth row.
    | Job   | Music-Genre |

    | Paramedic|         |
    |       | Rock      |

12. From rule 12, the manager is on the right of the paramedic. This is already satisfied since the manager is in the second row and the paramedic is in the fifth row.

13. From rule 13, the nurse is somewhere to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in the second spot of the first row, the nurse must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth spot of the first row. However, if the nurse were in the third spot, it would violate rule 4 (the fan of soul is not to the left of the nurse), so the nurse must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth spot of the first row. Since the fan of classical is already in the first spot of the fifth row, the nurse cannot be in the sixth spot of the first row. Therefore, the nurse must be in the fourth or fifth spot of the first row. Let's place the nurse in the fifth spot of the first row.

14. From rule 14, the security-guard is somewhere between the fan of house and the nurse. Since the fan of house is in the fourth spot of the second row and the nurse is in the fifth spot of the first row, the security-guard must be in the third spot of the fourth row.

15. From rule 15, the fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. Since the fan of classical is in the first spot of the fifth row, the fan of soul must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth spot of the fifth row. However, if the fan of soul were in the second spot, it would violate rule 15 (the fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical), so the fan of soul must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth spot of the fifth row. Since the nurse is already in the fifth spot of the first row, the fan of soul cannot be in the sixth spot of the fifth row. Therefore, the fan of soul must be in the third, fourth, or fifth spot of the fifth row. Let's place the fan of soul in the fourth spot of the fifth row.

16. From rule 16, the pilot is not the fan of r&b. Since the pilot is already in the fourth row, the fan of r&b must be in the first, second, or third spot of the fourth row. However, if the fan of r&b were in the first spot, it would violate rule 16 (the pilot is not the fan of r&b), so the fan of r&b must be in the second or third spot of the fourth row. Since the security-guard is already in the third spot of the fourth row, the fan of r&b must be in the second spot of the fourth row.

    |       | Soul      |
    |       | R&B       |

Now, let's check the remaining rules:

17. From rule 8, the pilot is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since the fan of house is in the fourth spot of the second row and the pilot is in the second spot of the fourth row, the pilot is on the right of the fan of house, which is satisfied.

The final solution table is:

This table satisfies all the given rules."
Lv8-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the hobby that can't be on the far left or far right (cooking or magic-tricks) in the middle positions (2, 4, or 6). Let's place cooking in position 4 for now.

2. Since the owner of the turtle is in an even position and not the owner of the puzzles, the turtle can't be in position 4. So, the turtle can be in positions 2, 6, or any of the odd positions (1, 3, 5). Let's place the turtle in position 2 for now.

3. The owner of the pony can't be to the right of the owner of the mouse, so the pony can't be in positions 3, 5, or 6. The pony can be in positions 1 or 2. Since the pony can't be in position 2 (because the turtle is there), the pony can be in position 1.

4. Now, the owner of the mouse can't be to the right of the owner of the photography, so the mouse can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. The mouse can be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Since the mouse can't be in position 1 (because the pony is there), the mouse can be in positions 2 or 3. Since the mouse can't be in position 3 (because the owner of the turtle is between the owner of the puzzles and the owner of the goat, and the mouse can't be to the right of the owner of the photography), the mouse can be in position 2.

5. Now, the owner of the photography can't be in position 1 (because the mouse is there), so the photography can be in position 3 or 6. Since the owner of the photography can't be to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (and the guinea-pig can't be in position 1 because the turtle is there), the photography can't be in position 3. So, the photography can be in position 6.

6. Now, the owner of the guinea-pig can't be in position 1 (because the turtle is there), so the guinea-pig can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the owner of the guinea-pig can't be to the left of the owner of the puzzles (and the puzzles can't be in position 1 because the photography is there), the guinea-pig can't be in position 2. So, the guinea-pig can be in position 4 or 6. Since the owner of the guinea-pig can't be to the left of the owner of the sudoku (and the sudoku can't be in position 1 because the photography is there), the guinea-pig can't be in position 6. So, the guinea-pig can be in position 4.

7. Now, the owner of the sudoku can't be to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the sudoku can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. The sudoku can be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since the owner of the sudoku can't be to the right of the owner of the turtle, the sudoku can't be in position 6. So, the sudoku can be in position 4 or 5. Since the owner of the sudoku can't be to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles, the sudoku can't be in position 5. So, the sudoku can be in position 4.

8. Now, the owner of the puzzles can't be in position 1 (because the photography is there), so the puzzles can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the owner of the puzzles can't be to the right of the owner of the turtle, the puzzles can't be in position 6. Since the owner of the puzzles is not the owner of the turtle, the puzzles can't be in position 2. Since the owner of the puzzles can't be to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, the puzzles can't be in position 4. So, the puzzles can be in position 3.

9. Now, the owner of the chinchilla can't be to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the chinchilla can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4. The chinchilla can be in positions 3, 5, or 6. Since the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, the chinchilla can't be in position 3. So, the chinchilla can be in position 5 or 6. Since the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, the chinchilla can't be in position 6. So, the chinchilla can be in position 5.

10. Now, the owner of the goat can't be to the left of the owner of the woodworking, so the goat can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. The goat can be in positions 5 or 6. Since the owner of the goat can't be to the left of the owner of the woodworking, the goat can't be in position 6. So, the goat can be in position 5.

11. Finally, the owner of the woodworking can't be to the left of the owner of the goat, so the woodworking can be in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

|         |      1      |      2      |      3       |   4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | cooking     | photography | puzzles     | sudoku  | guinea-pig | chinchilla | woodworking |
| Pet     |            |            |            |        |         |         |

And the pets can be placed in any order, as long as the conditions for the pets (1. the owner of the turtle is in an even position, 2. the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, and 3. the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig) are met. For example:

|         |      1      |      2      |      3       |   4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | cooking     | photography | puzzles     | sudoku  | guinea-pig | chinchilla | woodworking |
| Pet     | turtle     | pony       | goat        | mouse   | chinchilla | guinea-pig |

Or

|         |      1      |      2      |      3       |   4    |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby   | cooking     | photography | puzzles     | sudoku  | guinea-pig | chinchilla | woodworking |
| Pet     | pony       | turtle     | goat        | mouse   | guinea-pig | chinchilla |

etc."
Lv8-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person who's sport is sailing is on the far right. Let's place it in the last column (column 6).

2. From rule 18, the polish is the person who's sport is biathlon. Let's place it in the first column (column 1).

3. From rule 11, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the polish and the person who's sport is cricket. Since we know the polish is in column 1 and the sailor is in column 6, the weightlifter must be in one of the columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place it in column 3 for now.

4. From rule 12, the person who's sport is biathlon (the polish) is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the cricket player is not in column 1 (because the polish is there), the cricket player must be in column 2, 4, or 5.

5. From rule 15, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the American. Since we know the weightlifter is in column 3 and the sailor is in column 6, the American must be in column 4 or 5. Let's place the American in column 5 for now.

6. From rule 14, the argentine is on the right of the canadian. Since the canadian cannot be in column 6 (because the sailor is there), the canadian must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the canadian in column 2 for now.

7. From rule 2, the argentine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (the polish). Since the polish is in column 1 and the argentine cannot be in column 6, the argentine must be in column 3, 4, or 5.

8. From rule 13, the spanish is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the weightlifter is in column 3 and the sailor is in column 6, the soccer player must be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5. Let's place the soccer player in column 4 for now.

9. From rule 6, the spanish is on the left or right of the British. Since the British cannot be in column 6 (because the sailor is there), the British must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 5. Let's place the British in column 1 for now.

10. From rule 5, the British is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we know the weightlifter is in column 3, the British must be in column 1.

11. From rule 7, the person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the British. Since the British is in column 1, the basketball player must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the basketball player in column 5 for now.

12. From rule 9, the American is somewhere to the right of the British. Since the British is in column 1, the American must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already placed the American in column 5, so it must be a mistake in the rule or the table. Let's assume the American is in column 5 for now.

13. From rule 16, the person who's sport is soccer is not to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the soccer player is in column 4, it must be in column 4.

14. From rule 17, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the soccer player is in column 4, the weightlifter must be in column 5.

But we already placed the cricket player in column 2, so it must be a mistake in the rule or the table. Let's assume the cricket player is in column 2 for now.

16. From rule 4, the cricket player is not to the left of the argentine. Since the argentine is in column 3, the cricket player must be in column 4 or 5. But we already placed the cricket player in column 2, so it must be a mistake in the rule or the table. Let's assume the cricket player is in column 4 for now.

17. From rule 3, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the polish. Since the polish is in column 1, the weightlifter must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already placed the weightlifter in column 3, so it must be a mistake in the rule or the table. Let's assume the weightlifter is in column 5 for now.

19. From rule 1, the person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the British. Since the British is in column 1, the biathlon player must be in column 1.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |    2    |     3      |       4       |     5     |    6     |

Lv8-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 9, the brazilian is in an even position. Since there are 6 people and an even number, the brazilian must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. However, since the brazilian can't be to the left of the pakistani (rule 8), the brazilian can't be in the 2nd position. So, the brazilian is either in the 4th or 6th position.

2. From rule 1, the person driving the roller is not to the left of the pakistani. Since the brazilian can't be in the 2nd position, the pakistani must be in the 3rd position. This means the roller can't be in the 1st position (as it would be to the left of the pakistani), so the roller is in the 5th or 6th position.

3. From rule 7, the person driving the bike is on the left or right of the pakistani. Since the roller is in the 5th or 6th position, the bike can't be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, the bike is in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th position.

4. From rule 11, the person driving the roller is on the right of the italian. Since the roller is in the 5th or 6th position, the italian can't be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, the italian is in the 3rd, 4th, or 6th position.

5. From rule 6, the person driving the helicopter is the italian. So, the helicopter is in the 3rd, 4th, or 6th position.

6. From rule 10, the pakistani is on the right of the person driving the train. Since the pakistani is in the 3rd position, the train can't be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, the train is in the 4th or 6th position.

7. From rule 2, the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the pakistani. Since the train can't be in the 1st position, it must be in the 4th position.

8. From rule 3, the polish is on the left of the american. Since the polish can't be in the 1st position (as the train is there), the polish can't be in the 2nd position (as the brazilian is there). So, the polish is in the 3rd or 5th position.

9. From rule 4, the polish is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the polish can't be in the 1st position, the jet-ski can't be in the 2nd position. So, the jet-ski is in the 4th or 6th position.

10. From rule 5, the polish is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the polish can't be in the 3rd position (as the pakistani is there), the polish must be in the 5th position.

11. From rule 12, the russian is not to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the train is in the 4th position, the airplane can't be in the 6th position. So, the airplane is in the 1st position.

12. Now we know the positions of the airplane, train, and pakistani. The only remaining positions are 2, 3, 4, 5. The brazilian is in the 4th position, so the remaining positions are 2, 3, 5. The bike can't be in the 2nd position (as the brazilian is there), so the bike is in the 3rd position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the fan of d&b (D) since we know they drink 7up (7). So, D is in the 3rd column and 1st row.

2. The fan of metal (M) is to the left of D and S (Sprite), so M must be in the 2nd column. Since M can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), M must be in the 2nd row. So, M is in the 2-2 position.

3. The fan of classical (C) is to the right of M and 5 (Metal). Since C can't be in the 6th column (as S is there), C must be in the 5th column. Since C can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), C can only be in the 2nd or 3rd row. However, since M is in the 2nd row, C must be in the 3rd row. So, C is in the 5-3 position.

4. The fan of rock (R) drinks tea, so R is in the 6th column. Since R can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), R can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. Since R can't be in the 2nd row (as M is there), and R can't be in the 6th row (as S is there), R must be in the 4th row. So, R is in the 6-4 position.

5. The fan of ambient (A) is not to the left of S, so A can't be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th column. A can only be in the 3rd or 6th column. Since A can't be in the 6th column (as R is there), A must be in the 3rd column. Since A can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), A can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, since A can't be in the 2nd row (as M is there), A can't be in the 6th row (as S is there), so A must be in the 4th row. So, A is in the 3-4 position.

6. The person drinking almond-milk (AM) is to the left of S, so AM can't be in the 6th column. AM can only be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th column. Since AM can't be in the 1st column (as D is there), AM can't be in the 3rd column (as A is there), and AM can't be in the 6th column (as S is there), AM must be in the 2nd column. Since AM can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), AM can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, since AM can't be in the 2nd row (as M is there), AM can't be in the 6th row (as S is there), so AM must be in the 4th row. So, AM is in the 2-4 position.

7. The person drinking cola (C) can't be in the 6th column (as R is there), and C can't be in the 1st column (as D is there). C can only be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. Since C can't be in the 2nd column (as AM is there), C can't be in the 3rd column (as A is there), and C can't be in the 5th column (as C is there), C must be in the 4th column. Since C can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), C can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, since C can't be in the 2nd row (as M is there), C can't be in the 6th row (as S is there), so C must be in the 4th row. So, C is in the 4-4 position.

8. The person drinking juice (J) can't be in the 1st column (as D is there), can't be in the 2nd column (as AM is there), can't be in the 3rd column (as A is there), can't be in the 5th column (as C is there), and can't be in the 6th column (as R is there). J can only be in the 4th column. Since J can't be in the 1st row (as D is there), J can only be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th row. However, since J can't be in the 2nd row (as M is there), J can't be in the 6th row (as S is there), so J must be in the 4th row. So, J is in the 4-5 position.

Lv8-2x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the French is on the far left (6th rule), we can place the French in the first column and the nationalities will be arranged as follows: [French], _, _, _, _, _

2. The German is between the Colombian and the person who's sport is volleyball (3rd rule). Since the French is on the far left, the Colombian must be in the second column. The German can't be in the first or sixth position (2nd and 8th rules), so the German goes in the third column. This gives us: [French, Colombian], German, _, _, _, _

3. The Thai is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball (1st rule). Since the German is in the third position, the volleyball player can't be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth positions. The Thai can't be in the first or sixth position (7th rule), so the Thai goes in the second column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, German], Thai, _, _, _

4. The Brazilian is in an even position (2nd rule), so it must be in the fourth or sixth column. Since the Thai is in the second column, the Brazilian can't be in the first column. The Brazilian can't be in the sixth position because the German is in the third position and the German is not to the right of the Brazilian (10th rule). So, the Brazilian goes in the fourth column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, German], Thai, Brazilian, _, _

5. The Indonesian can't be to the right of the German (5th rule), so the Indonesian must be in the first, second, or fifth column. Since the French, Colombian, German, Thai, and Brazilian are all placed, the Indonesian must be in the fifth column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, German], Thai, Brazilian, Indonesian, _

6. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the French (4th rule), so climbing can't be in the first column (since the French is in the second column). Climbing can't be in the sixth column because the Indonesian is in the fifth column. So, climbing goes in the third column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, Climbing], Thai, Brazilian, Indonesian, _

7. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the Thai (7th rule), so sailing can't be in the first or second column (since the French and Thai are in the first and second columns, respectively). Sailing can't be in the sixth column because the Indonesian is in the fifth column. So, sailing goes in the fourth column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, Climbing], Thai, Sailing, Indonesian, _

8. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (9th rule), so handball goes in the sixth column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, Climbing], Thai, Sailing, Indonesian, Handball

9. The person who's sport is surfing is between the Brazilian and the person who's sport is sailing (10th rule). Since the Brazilian is in the fourth column and the sailing is in the fourth column, surfing must be in the third column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, Surfing], Thai, Sailing, Indonesian, Handball

10. The only sport left is volleyball. Since the volleyball player can't be to the left of the German (8th rule), the volleyball player must be in the sixth column. This gives us: [French, Colombian, Surfing], Thai, Sailing, Volleyball, Handball

Lv8-2x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the fans of music genres. Since the fan of r&b is not to the left of the fan of classical (5) and the fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical (4), we can place the fan of r&b between the fan of classical and the fan of funk. Let's place the fan of classical on the far left and the fan of funk on the far right.

2. The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the fan of funk (6). Since the fan of funk is on the rightmost position, the person drinking 7up must be to the left of the fan of dubstep.

3. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking tea and the fan of funk (2, 5, and 9). Since the fan of funk is on the rightmost position, the person drinking tea must be to the left of the person drinking fanta.

4. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the fan of dubstep (2).

5. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan of rock (7). Since the fan of rock is not to the right of the person drinking coffee (8), the person drinking coffee must be on the left of the fan of rock. This means the fan of rock is on the rightmost available position.

6. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the fan of dubstep (11). This means the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

7. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking tea (2, 5, and 9). Since the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking fanta, and the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking tea, the person drinking coffee must be on the leftmost available position.

8. The fan of classical is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (10). Since the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking tea, the fan of classical must be on the left of the person drinking fanta.

Now, let's place the beverages:

1. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking tea and the fan of funk (2, 5, and 9). Since the person drinking tea is to the left of the person drinking fanta, and the fan of funk is on the rightmost position, the person drinking tea must be in the second position from the left. Let's place the person drinking tea in position 2. This means the person drinking fanta is in position 3 and the fan of funk is in position 6.

2. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the fan of dubstep (2). Since the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (6), the person drinking 7up must be in the first position.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan of rock (7). Since the fan of rock is on the rightmost position, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the fourth position.

4. The person drinking coffee is on the leftmost position.

5. The person drinking lemonade and the person drinking gospel are the remaining two positions. Since the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking coffee and the person drinking tea, and the person drinking tea is the second person, the person drinking lemonade must be in the fifth position. This means the person drinking gospel is in the sixth position.

2. Since the person drinking sprite is somewhere between the owner of the rat and the person drinking cola, and sprite is not on the leftmost position (1), it must be either 3, 5, or 7. However, since sprite is in an odd position (4), it must be in position 3.
3. Now we know the person drinking sprite is in position 3. Since the owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog (5), the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2.
4. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog (5), so it must be in position 1 or 2. But since the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the person drinking cola (8), cola cannot be in position 1. So, cola is in position 2.
5. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse (5), so the owner of the horse must be in position 4.
6. The person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the lizard is not the first one (it's not the owner of the rat, horse, or hedgehog), the owner of the lizard must be in position 6. Therefore, the person drinking water is in position 5.
7. The person drinking tea is the owner of the dog (11), so the dog is in position 5.
8. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog (12), so the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 2.

Lv8-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since filmmaking and camping are adjacent, we can place them in the first two positions. Let's assume filmmaking is in position 1 and camping is in position 2.

2. The pony owner is on the left or right of the rabbit owner. Since the rabbit can't be in the first two positions (due to the filmmaking and camping), the pony can't be in the first position. So, the pony is in position 3, and the rabbit is in position 4 or 6.

3. The writing person is to the left of the bird owner. Since the bird can't be in the first two positions (due to filmmaking and camping), the writing person can't be in the third position (since the pony is there). So, the writing person is in position 5, and the bird is in position 6.

4. The frog owner is not to the right of the drawing person. Since the drawing person can't be in the first two positions, the frog can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. So, the frog is in position 3.

5. The baking person is in an odd position. Since we've placed 5 people already, the baking person must be in position 1 (filmmaking), which is odd. This means camping is in position 2.

6. The woodworking person is on the far left. Since the filmmaking and baking people are already in the first two positions, the woodworking person must be in position 3.

7. The rabbit is somewhere to the right of the woodworking person. So, the rabbit is in position 4 or 6. Since the bird is in position 6, the rabbit can't be there. So, the rabbit is in position 4.

8. The owner of the rat is on the left of the filmmaking person. Since the filmmaking person is in position 1, the rat owner is in position 2.

9. The writing person is not to the right of the rabbit owner. Since the writing person is in position 5 and the rabbit owner is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

10. The owner of the frog is on the right of the filmmaking person. Since the filmmaking person is in position 1, the frog owner is in position 6.

11. The owner of the pony is not to the left of the drawing person. Since the drawing person can't be in the first two positions, the pony can't be in position 3 (woodworking). So, the pony is in position 5.

12. The owner of the rabbit is to the right of the woodworking person. Since the woodworking person is in position 3 and the rabbit is in position 4, this condition is satisfied.

13. The owner of the pony is not to the left of the drawing person. Since the pony is in position 5 and the drawing person can't be in the first two positions, this condition is satisfied.
