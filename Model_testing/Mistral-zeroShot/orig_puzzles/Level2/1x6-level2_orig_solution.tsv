Lv2-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the pony owner is on the left of the hamster owner, and the hamster owner is on the far right. This means the pets in positions 1, 2, and 5 cannot be the pony or the hamster. So, let's place the pony in position 6 and the hamster in position 2.

   |       |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4  |  5   |    6    |
   | Pet   |       |   Ham |       |     |      |   Pony  |

2. The owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the pony is in position 6, the cat cannot be in position 6 either. The cat cannot be in position 1 because the hamster is in position 2, and the hamster's owner is on the far right. So, let's place the cat in position 3.

   |       |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4  |  5   |    6    |
   | Pet   |   Cat  |   Ham |       |     |      |   Pony  |

3. The owner of the horse is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the rabbit. Since the hamster is in position 2, the horse cannot be in position 1 or 2. The horse cannot be in position 6 because the pony is already there. So, let's place the horse in position 4.

   |       |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4  |  5   |    6    |
   | Pet   |   Cat  |   Ham |   Horse|   Rab|   Fer|   Pony  |

4. The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. This means the rabbit cannot be in position 4. So, let's place the rabbit in position 5.

   |       |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4  |  5   |    6    |
   | Pet   |   Cat  |   Ham |   Horse|   Fer|   Rab|   Pony  |

5. Now, we have placed all the pets according to the given conditions. So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of electronic. Let's place them in the table:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    |     4      |  5   |    6    |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock   | Electronic |   |   |   |   |

2. The fan of funk is between the fan of reggae and the fan of trance. Since we don't have enough spaces yet, let's place reggae and trance for now:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Reggae | Trance |  5   |    6    |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock   | Electronic | Funk |   |   |   |   |

3. The fan of ambient is on the far right. Since we have only 6 spots and we've filled 5, ambient can't be placed:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Reggae | Trance |  5   | Ambient |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock   | Electronic | Funk |   |   |   |   |

4. The fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of rock. But we've placed ambient on the far right, which contradicts this rule. Let's swap rock and ambient:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Ambient | Trance |  5   | Reggae |
   | Music-Genre   | Ambient | Electronic | Funk |   |   |   |   |

5. The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of reggae. Let's swap electronic and reggae:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Ambient | Trance | Reggae | Funk  |
   | Music-Genre   | Ambient | Reggae | Electronic |   |   |   |   |

6. The fan of funk is between the fan of trance and the fan of reggae. Since we've already swapped reggae and electronic, funk must be between trance and electronic:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Ambient | Trance | Reggae | Funk  |
   | Music-Genre   | Ambient | Reggae | Electronic | Funk  |   |   |   |

7. Now we can fill the remaining spot with the last genre, which is funk:

   |               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Ambient | Trance | Reggae | Funk  | Electronic |
   | Music-Genre   | Ambient | Reggae | Electronic | Funk  | Trance |   |   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |   1    |  2   |   3    | Ambient | Trance | Reggae | Funk  | Electronic |

Lv2-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating cranberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person eating spinach. This means that either cabbage-cranberry-spinach or cranberry-cabbage-spinach is a possible arrangement. Let's assume the first possibility for now (we'll check later if the second one works).

2. The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the person eating cabbage, so in our current arrangement, cauliflower must be either in position 2 or 3.

3. The person eating grapefruit is on the far right, so it must be in position 6.

4. The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since cauliflower is either in position 2 or 3, grapefruit cannot be in position 1. So, grapefruit must be in position 6, and cauliflower must be in position 2.

5. Now, we check the first assumption (cabbage-cranberry-spinach). The person eating cranberry is on the right of the person eating cabbage, so cranberry must be in position 3. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating cranberry, so spinach must be in position 1.

6. Now, let's check the second assumption (cranberry-cabbage-spinach). If this was the case, cauliflower would have to be in position 4, and grapefruit in position 5. But this would mean that cauliflower is not on the right of the person eating cabbage, which contradicts the second rule. So, our initial assumption was correct.

The final solution table is:

  |        |     1      |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |     6      |
| Food   | cabbage   | cauliflower| cranberry | spinach |   ######## | grapefruit |

So, the final solution is:

  |        |     1      |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |     6      |
| Food   | cabbage   | cauliflower| cranberry | spinach |   ######## | grapefruit |

This arrangement satisfies all the given rules."
Lv2-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the goldfish is not on the far right (since the turtle is there). So, the goldfish cannot be in column 6.

2. Similarly, the owner of the lizard cannot be in column 1 because the goldfish is to the right of the lizard.

3. Now, let's place the lizard and goldfish in the remaining columns (2, 3, 4, or 5) such that the goldfish is to the right of the lizard. This can only be possible if the lizard is in column 2 and the goldfish is in column 3, 4, or 5.

4. Since the owner of the turtle is on the far right and to the right of the goat, the goat cannot be in column 6. So, the goat can be in columns 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. If the goat is in column 1, then the turtle must be in column 6, which contradicts the fact that the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the goat. So, the goat cannot be in column 1.

6. If the goat is in column 2, then the turtle must be in column 4, and the lizard in column 1. But this would mean the goldfish is to the left of the lizard, which is not possible. So, the goat cannot be in column 2 either.

7. If the goat is in column 3, then the turtle must be in column 5, and the lizard in column 1. This is possible because the goldfish can be placed in column 4 or 5, and the bird can be placed between the goldfish and the goat.

8. If the goat is in column 4, then the turtle must be in column 6, and the lizard in column 1. Again, the goldfish can be placed in column 2 or 3, and the bird can be placed between the goldfish and the goat.

So, both options 7 and 8 are possible solutions. Here are the two possible solutions:

Solution 1:
|       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
| Pet   | lizard | goldfish | bird | goat | turtle |  |

Solution 2:
|       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
| Pet   | lizard | goldfish | turtle | goat | bird |  |

Both solutions are valid as per the given conditions. However, without additional information, we cannot determine which one is the correct solution. So, the final solution table would be:

1. We know that the time-travel person is to the right of the martial-arts person. Let's place them in positions 2 and 3 respectively.

2. The scientific person is between time-travel and comedy. Since time-travel is in position 2, and comedy can't be in position 1 (as it must be between scientific and adventure), let's place scientific in position 4.

   |               |      1       |      2      |     3      |   4    |     5     |    6    |

4. Adventure is to the left of romance. Since romance can't be in position 1 (as it must be to the right of adventure), let's place adventure in position 6.

5. Now, we know that the person watching romance is in position 1. Since romance can't be to the left of adventure (as per point 5), it must be in position 1.

   |               | Romance     |      2      |     3      |   4    | Comedy   | Adventure|

6. Finally, we know that the scientific person is on the right of the time-travel person (point 4). Since time-travel is in position 2, let's place scientific in position 5.

Lv2-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Canadian is on the far right, we can place them in the last column (column 6).
2. The Russian is to the right of the Colombian, so the Colombian must be in one of the first five columns. Let's place them in column 1 for now.
3. The German is between the Canadian and the Argentine. Since the Canadian is in the last column, the German must be in one of the first five columns. If the German were in column 1, it would be between the Colombian and the Canadian, which contradicts rule 3. So, the German must be in one of columns 2 to 5. Let's place the German in column 2 for now.
4. The Russian is to the left of the Italian. Since the Russian is in column 1 and the Italian can't be in column 6 (because the Canadian is there), the Italian must be in one of columns 1 to 5. If the Italian were in column 1, it would be to the left of the Russian, which contradicts rule 4. So, the Italian must be in one of columns 2 to 5. Let's place the Italian in column 3 for now.
5. Now, the only place left for the Colombian is column 5.
6. The Argentine must be to the left of the German, so the Argentine can only be in columns 1 to 4. If the Argentine were in column 1, it would be to the left of the Colombian, which contradicts the placement of the Colombian in step 5. If the Argentine were in column 2, it would be next to the German, which contradicts rule 3. So, the Argentine must be in column 4.

The final solution table is:

Nationality   | Colombian | German  | Italian | Argentine |   ---   | Canadian |

However, we still need to find the nationality for column 6. Since the only nationalities left are russian and canadian, and the Canadian is already in column 6, the Russian must be in column 5.
