Lv2-7x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. Let's start with the beverages:
   - Since there are 4 different beverages, each person must have a unique drink. Let's assign them as follows: A drinks coffee, B drinks fanta, C drinks iced-tea, and D drinks mirinda (as the lizard owner).

3. Now let's assign the food:
   - From the clues, we know that the person eating blueberry is on the right of the person drinking coffee (A). So, A cannot eat blueberry. Let's assign B as the person eating blueberry, C as the person eating cherry, D as the person eating cucumber, and A or B as the person eating radish (we don't know the exact position yet).

4. Let's assign the hobbies:
   - The person with the hobby of baking is on the left of the owner of the cat (A or B). Since A cannot be the owner of the cat (from the pet assignment), B must be the person with the hobby of baking. A has the hobby of singing (from the transport assignment), C has the hobby of camping, D has the hobby of rock-climbing, and B has the hobby of baking.

5. Let's assign the pets:
   - The owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking (B). So, A must be the owner of the cat. The owner of the lizard is D (from the beverage assignment). The owner of the horse is B (from the hobby assignment), and the owner of the fish is C (from the sport assignment).

6. Let's assign the sports:
   - The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person driving the trike (we don't know the position yet). So, C must be the person who's sport is climbing. The person who's sport is snowboarding is the owner of the fish (C). The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A). The person who's sport is swimming is not yet assigned.

7. Let's assign the transport:
   - The person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is singing (A). The person driving the bike is the person eating cherry (C). The person driving the roller is not yet assigned. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person eating radish (not yet assigned) and on the right of the person who's sport is climbing (C). So, B must be the person driving the trike. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person eating blueberry (B) and on the left of the person eating cucumber (D). So, D must be the person driving the roller.

8. The person eating radish is watching mystery movies (from the movie-genre assignment). The person eating cucumber is not yet assigned a movie-genre.

9. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard (D). So, A or B must be watching scientific movies. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (C). So, D must be watching epic movies.

10. The person watching mystery movies is the person eating radish (already assigned). The person watching sports movies is not yet assigned.

11. The person eating blueberry is on the right of the person drinking coffee (A). So, B must be eating blueberry. The person eating cucumber is driving the roller (D).

12. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A). So, A must be watching sports movies.

13. The person watching epic movies is D (already assigned). The person watching mystery movies is B (already assigned). The person watching scientific movies is A (just assigned). The person watching sports movies is A (just assigned).

14. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person drinking coffee (A). So, B must be the person who's sport is sailing.

15. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person eating radish (B). So, the person eating radish is on the right of the person driving the trike (B).

Final solution table:

Lv2-7x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 items in each row (beverage, job, movie-genre, music-genre, pet, sport), so each person must have one of each.

2. From rule 12, the dancer is on the left of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is between the fan of ambient and the person drinking juice (rule 2), the dancer cannot be in the first three positions. So, the dancer is either in position 4, 5, or 6.

3. From rule 13, the videographer is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the owner of the fish is on the left of the fan of ambient (rule 4) and the owner of the fish is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 6), the videographer cannot be in the first three positions. So, the videographer is either in position 4, 5, or 6.

4. From rule 11, the person watching western movies is on the far right. Since the person watching western movies is not the person driving the motorbike (rule 8), the person watching western movies is in position 6.

5. From rule 10, the person watching romance movies is the person playing badminton. Since the person watching western movies is on the far right (rule 4), the person watching romance movies is in position 5.

6. Now we know the person watching romance movies is in position 5, so the person playing badminton is in position 5. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the person driving the motorbike (rule 8), the person watching comedy movies is in position 1, 2, or 3.

7. From rule 7, the owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies. So, the owner of the bird is in position 6 or 7. But since the person watching western movies is in position 6 (rule 4), the owner of the bird is in position 7.

8. From rule 3, the fan of reggae is between the person watching comedy movies and the owner of the bird. So, the person watching comedy movies is in position 2 and the owner of the bird is in position 3.

9. From rule 14, the person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the person driving the motorbike is the person drinking almond-milk (rule 8), the person driving the trike cannot be in position 6 (since the person watching western movies is in position 6). So, the person driving the trike is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But since the person driving the motorbike is in position 3 (rule 8), the person driving the trike is not in position 3. So, the person driving the trike is in position 1, 4, or 5.

22. From rule 1, the people have 4 different beverages. We have already placed 4 beverages (almond-milk, iced-tea, juice, milk). So, the remaining beverage must be juice.

23. From rule 16, the person playing lacrosse is the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in position 1, the person playing lacrosse is drinking juice.

24. From rule 8, the person drinking almond-milk is the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3.

25. From rule 19, the person watching western movies is on the right of the fan of ambient. We know the fan of ambient is in position 2 and the person watching western movies is in position 6. So, the person drinking milk is in position 4.

Lv2-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill the first row with the 4 different beverages, the second row with the 4 different foods, the third row with the 4 different hobbies, the fourth row with the 4 different movie-genres, the fifth row with the 4 different music-genres, the sixth row with the 4 different pets, and the seventh row with the 4 different means of transport.

2. From rule 15, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the far left. So, let's place 'fantasy' in the first column of the movie-genre row.

3. From rule 2, the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. So, let's place 'camping' in the second column of the hobby row.

4. From rule 16, the person drinking mirinda is between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the pony. Since we know the position of the person watching fantasy movies (first column), and the person drinking mirinda is to the right of the person watching fantasy movies, the person drinking mirinda must be in the third column. Also, the owner of the pony is to the right of the person drinking mirinda (rule 16), so the owner of the pony must be in the fourth column. This means the owner of the hamster must be in the second column. So, let's place 'hamster' in the second column of the pet row and 'pony' in the fourth column.

5. From rule 14, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person eating cranberry. Since we know the position of the person drinking mirinda (third column), the person drinking almond-milk must be in the first column. So, let's place 'almond-milk' in the first column of the beverage row and 'cranberry' in the second column of the food row.

6. From rule 8, the person eating carrot is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. So, let's place 'carrot' in the third column of the food row.

7. From rule 11, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching crime movies.

So, let's place 'crime' in the second column of the movie-genre row.

8. From rule 9, the person driving the taxi is the person drinking coffee. Since we know the position of the person drinking mirinda (third column), the person drinking coffee must be in the fourth column. So, let's place 'coffee' in the fourth column of the beverage row.

9. From rule 10, the fan of country is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the person watching fantasy movies (first column) and the person watching crime movies (second column), the person watching disaster movies must be in the third column. So, let's place 'disaster' in the third column of the movie-genre row.

10. From rule 6, the person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the fish. Since we know the position of the owner of the hamster (second column) and the owner of the pony (fourth column), the owner of the fish must be in the third column. So, let's place 'fish' in the third column of the pet row.

11. From rule 7, the person drinking juice is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we know the position of the person drinking almond-milk (first column) and the owner of the hamster (second column), the person who's hobby is collecting must be in the third column. So, let's place 'collecting' in the third column of the hobby row. This means the person drinking juice must be in the fourth column. So, let's place 'juice' in the fourth column of the beverage row.

12. From rule 13, the fan of electronic is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we know the position of the person who's hobby is camping (second column), the fan of electronic must be in the third column. So, let's place 'electronic' in the third column of the music-genre row.

So, let's place 'writing' in the second column of the hobby row.

14. From rule 1, the person drinking mirinda is the person driving the subway. Since we know the position of the person drinking mirinda (third column), the person driving the subway is also in the third column. So, let's place 'subway' in the third column of the transport row.

15. From rule 12, the person eating spinach is between the owner of the hamster and the person eating cranberry. Since we know the position of the owner of the hamster (second column) and the person eating cranberry (fourth column), the person eating spinach must be in the third column. So, let's place 'spinach' in the third column of the food row.

16. From rule 4, the person driving the subway is the fan of jazz. Since we know the position of the person driving the subway (third column), the fan of jazz is also in the third column. So, let's place 'jazz' in the third column of the music-genre row.

The final solution table is:

Lv2-7x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of items for each category, so we can fill in the number of items in each row.

| Sport         |            baseball| cycling  | parkour   | snowboarding |

2. From point 10, we know the musician is on the far left. So, the musician must be bartender (1), and the beverage he drinks is milk (5).

3. From point 8, we know the person drinking milk is the musician. So, the musician is in row 1 and column 3.

4. From point 11, we know the owner of the pony is the person eating cauliflower. So, the person eating cauliflower must be in column 4.

5. From point 13, we know the owner of the frog is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the musician is the bartender and he drinks milk, the person drinking 7up (1,1) must be the owner of the frog.

6. From point 14, we know the teacher is between the person drinking tea and the person eating cauliflower. Since the teacher can't be in column 4 (as the cauliflower eater is there), the teacher must be in column 2 or 3. If the teacher was in column 2, the person drinking tea would have to be in column 4, but that would mean the sport of the person in column 4 is cycling (12), which is not possible as the cyclist is between the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the frog (12). So, the teacher must be in column 3.

7. From point 15, we know the chef is on the left of the spanish. Since the teacher is in column 3, the chef must be in column 1.

8. From point 9, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person drinking 7up (the frog owner). Since the frog owner is in row 1 and column 1, the cyclist must be in row 1 and column 2.

9. From point 7, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the chef is in column 1, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in column 2. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in column 4.

10. From point 3, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in column 4, the person who's hobby is singing must be in column 3.

11. From point 4, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. So, the person who's hobby is singing is in column 3.

12. Now we have filled all the hobbies, jobs, nationalities, pets, and sports. The only thing left is the food. Since the person eating apple is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing, the person eating apple must be in column 4. The only food left for column 1 is cauliflower (as the pony owner is there), for column 2 is pumpkin (as the cyclist is there), and for column 3 is tomato (as the teacher is there). So, the person eating apple must be eating tomato.

Lv2-7x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 7 positions (one for each category plus one for nationality). Since the Thai is on the left of the horse owner, the horse owner cannot be in the first position. So, the Thai cannot be in the second position either, as it would mean the horse owner is in the first position, which is not possible. Therefore, the Thai must be in the third position.

2. Since the Thai is in the third position, the horse owner must be in the fourth position.

3. The manager is on the far left, so he must be in the first position.

4. The British is on the right of the Colombian, so the Colombian must be in the second position, and the British in the fifth position.

5. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left, so they must be in the first position (as the manager is already there).

6. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the manager is already in the first position and the Thai is in the third position, the only possible position for the taxi driver is the sixth position. The person who's hobby is writing must be in the seventh position.

7. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the taxi driver is in the sixth position and the Thai is in the third position, the only possible position for the person watching disaster movies is the fourth position. The person watching thriller movies must be in the fifth position.

8. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the taxi driver is in the sixth position and the person who's hobby is writing is in the seventh position, the person driving the bus must be in the eighth position.

9. The nurse is the person who's sport is rowing. Since the horse owner is in the fourth position, the only possible position for the nurse is the second last position (ninth).

10. The owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the roller. Since the taxi driver is in the sixth position, the only possible position for the roller driver is the ninth position.

11. The person who's sport is sailing is the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching thriller movies is in the fifth position, the person who's sport is sailing must be in the sixth position.

12. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the manager is in the first position, the only possible position for the person who's hobby is card-games is the second position. The person who's hobby is reading must be in the third position.

13. The russian is on the far left. Since the manager is already in the first position, the russian must be in the second position.

14. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person watching thriller movies is in the fifth position (who's sport is sailing), the only possible position for the person who's sport is weightlifting is the sixth position. The person who's sport is water-polo must be in the seventh position.

15. The person who's hobby is board-games is not yet determined. Since the Thai is in the third position, the only possible position for board-games is the eighth position.

Lv2-7x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know there are 4 types of food, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transport. Let's label them A, B, C, D for each category.

3. From the clues, we can start by placing the British (B) next to the Animation (A) movie-goer. So, we have:

   |               | A (Animation) |  |  |  |
   | Food          |               |   |   |   |
   | Job           |               |   |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre   | A (Animation) |   |   |   |
   | Nationality   | B (British)   |   |   |   |
   | Pet           |               |   |   |   |
   | Sport         |               |   |   |   |
   | Transport     |               |   |   |   |

4. The Egyptian (C) is on the right of the taxi driver, so the taxi driver must be someone other than B or C. Let's place the taxi driver as D. Now, we have:

   |               | A (Animation) | D (Taxi) |  |  |
   | Food          |               |         |   |   |
   | Job           |               |         |   |   |
   | Movie-Genre   | A (Animation) | D (Taxi) |   |   |
   | Nationality   | B (British)   | C (Egyptian) |   |   |
   | Pet           |               |         |   |   |
   | Sport         |               |         |   |   |
   | Transport     |               | D (Taxi) |   |   |

5. The person watching adventure movies (B) is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (D). Since we don't know the sport of the Egyptian (C), we can't place B yet. Let's move on to the next clue.

6. The person watching satire movies (A or C) is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the sport of the Egyptian (C) and the British (B) is already placed, A must be the satire movie-goer. Now, we have:

   |               | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Egyptian) |  |
   | Food          |               |         |             |   |
   | Job           |               |         |             |   |
   | Movie-Genre   | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Egyptian) |   |
   | Nationality   | B (British)   |         |             |   |
   | Pet           |               |         |             |   |
   | Sport         |               |         |             |   |
   | Transport     |               | D (Taxi) |             |   |

7. The person eating cauliflower (A or B or C or D) is on the right of the owner of the ferret (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the food of the Egyptian (C) and the British (B) is already placed, let's place the ferret owner for now. We'll come back to this later. Now, we have:

   |               | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Egyptian) | A (Ferret) |
   | Food          | C (Cauliflower) |         |             |         |
   | Job           |               |         |             |         |

   | Pet           | A (Ferret)   |         |             |         |
   | Sport         |               |         |             |         |
   | Transport     |               | D (Taxi) |             |         |

8. The person watching satire movies (A) is between the french (A or B or C or D) and the person driving the helicopter (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the nationality of the helicopter driver and the Egyptian (C) and the British (B) are already placed, let's place the helicopter driver for now. We'll come back to this later. Now, we have:

   |               | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Egyptian) | A (Ferret) | H (Helicopter) |

   | Movie-Genre   | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Egyptian) | A (Ferret) | H (Helicopter) |

   | Pet           | A (Ferret)   |         |             |         |         |
   | Sport         |               |         |             |         |         |
   | Transport     |               | D (Taxi) |             |         | H (Helicopter) |

9. The doctor (A or B or C or D) is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the nationality of the helicopter driver and the Egyptian (C) and the British (B) are already placed, let's place the helicopter driver as the doctor for now. Now, we have:

   | Food          | C (Cauliflower) |         |             |         |         |         |
   | Job           | D (Doctor)   |         |             |         |         |         |

   | Pet           | A (Ferret)   |         |             |         |         |         |
   | Sport         |               |         |             |         |         |         |
   | Transport     |               | D (Taxi) |             |         | D (Doctor) | H (Helicopter) |

10. The person who's sport is climbing (A or B or C or D) is the police-officer (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the sport of the Egyptian (C) and the British (B) are already placed, let's place the police-officer as the climber. Now, we have:

15. The person driving the trike (T) is on the right of the owner of the lizard (A or B or C or D). Since we don't know the nationality of the lizard owner and the British (B) is already placed, let's place the lizard owner as the person eating pineapple (A or B or C or D). Now, we have:

16. The person eating pomegranate (A or B or C or D) is on the right of the owner of the goat (S). Since we have already placed the goat owner, let's place the pomegranate eater. Now, we have:

    |               | A (Satire)   | D (Taxi) | C (Writer) | A (Ferret) | D (Doctor) | H (Helicopter) | L (Lawyer) | T (Trike) | P (Police) | S (Ship) | P (Pineapple) | G (Goat) |

17. The person driving the ship (S) is the owner of the goat (G). Since we have already placed the goat owner, the table is complete.

Lv2-7x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, sports, and transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From point 11, we know that the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the doctor. Since the doctor can't be on the first position (as there are 4 different nationalities), the doctor must be in position 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the doctor is in position 2. So, golf is in position 3 or 4.

3. From point 13, we know that the person who's sport is golf is driving the taxi. Since the bus driver is watching comedy movies (point 4), the taxi driver can't be in the first position. So, the taxi driver is in position 2, 3, or 4. But the taxi driver can't be in the same position as the doctor (as golf is to the right of the doctor), so the taxi driver is in position 3 or 4. Let's assume the taxi driver is in position 4. So, golf is in position 3.

4. From point 12, we know that the Dutch is the sailor. Since the Dutch can't be in the first position, the Dutch is in position 2, 3, or 4. But the Dutch can't be in the same position as the doctor or the taxi driver (as golf is to the right of the doctor and the taxi driver is in position 4), so the Dutch is in position 2. So, sailing is in position 1.

5. From point 9, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the Thai. Since the bus driver is watching comedy movies (point 4), the surfing person can't be in the first position. So, surfing is in position 2, 3, or 4. But the surfing person can't be in the same position as the Dutch (as sailing is in position 1), so surfing is in position 2 or 4. Let's assume surfing is in position 2. So, the Thai is in position 3.

6. From point 8, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since the bus driver is in position 4, the cook is in position 1, 2, or 3. But the cook can't be in the same position as the Dutch (as sailing is in position 1) or the Thai (as surfing is in position 2), so the cook is in position 3.

7. From point 14, we know that the Indonesian is the coach. Since the Indonesian is the fan of folk (point 3), the coach is in position 1 (as the cook is in position 3). So, the nationalities are: 1 - Indonesian, 2 - Dutch, 3 - Thai, 4 - unknown.

8. From point 10, we know that the fan of folk is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the cook is in position 3, the video-games person is in position 4.

9. From point 15, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the bus driver is in position 4, the time-travel person is in position 1, 2, or 3. But the time-travel person can't be in the same position as the Indonesian (as they are in position 1) or the Dutch (as sailing is in position 1), so the time-travel person is in position 2.

10. From point 6, we know that the person driving the bus is in position 4. So, the bus driver's job, movie-genre, music-genre, and sport are in positions 4, 4, 4, and 2 respectively.

11. From point 5, we know that the Thai is in position 3. So, the Thai's job, movie-genre, music-genre, and sport are in positions 3, 3, 3, and 2 respectively.

12. From point 2, we know that the fan of indie is between the fan of punk and the project-manager. Since the fan of punk is to the left of the project-manager (as the project-manager is the one watching scientific movies, which is to the right of the fan of punk), the fan of indie is to the left of the project-manager. Since the Indonesian is in position 1 and the Thai is in position 3, the fan of indie must be in position 2. So, the fan of indie's job, movie-genre, music-genre, and hobby are in positions 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively.

13. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different jobs. Since the Indonesian is the coach (in position 1), the job of the person in position 2 is not coach. The job of the person in position 2 is either doctor, entrepreneur, or project-manager. But the doctor is in position 2 (as golf is in position 3), so the job of the person in position 2 is either entrepreneur or project-manager. But the project-manager is watching scientific movies (which is to the right of the fan of punk), so the job of the person in position 2 is entrepreneur. So, the entrepreneur's job, movie-genre, music-genre, and hobby are in positions 2, 2, 2, and 1 respectively.

14. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different movie-genres. Since the bus driver is watching comedy movies (which is in position 4), the movie-genre of the person in position 1 is not comedy. The movie-genre of the person in position 1 is either mystery, scientific, time-travel, or unknown. But the Thai is watching mystery movies (which is in position 3), so the movie-genre of the person in position 1 is not mystery. The movie-genre of the person in position 1 is either scientific, time-travel, or unknown. But the project-manager is watching scientific movies (which is to the right of the fan of punk), so the movie-genre of the person in position 1 is not scientific. The movie-genre of the person in position 1 is either time-travel or unknown. But the fan of time-travel movies is to the right of the person driving the trike (as per point 9), so the movie-genre of the person in position 1 is unknown. So, the movie-genres are: 1 - unknown, 2 - 2, 3 - mystery, 4 - comedy.

15. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different music-genres. Since the bus driver is not a fan of folk (as the Indonesian is the fan of folk), the music-genre of the person in position 4 is not folk. The music-genre of the person in position 4 is either indie, punk, rock, or unknown. But the fan of indie is in position 2, so the music-genre of the person in position 4 is not indie. The music-genre of the person in position 4 is either punk, rock, or unknown. But the fan of punk is to the left of the project-manager (as the project-manager is the one watching scientific movies), so the music-genre of the person in position 4 is not punk. The music-genre of the person in position 4 is either rock or unknown. But the fan of rock is not specified, so the music-genre of the person in position 4 is unknown. So, the music-genres are: 1 - folk, 2 - 2, 3 - unknown, 4 - unknown.

16. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different hobbies. Since the Indonesian is the fan of cooking (as per point 3), the hobby of the person in position 1 is not cooking. The hobby of the person in position 1 is either filmmaking, photography, video-games, or unknown. But the fan of filmmaking is to the right of the person watching scientific movies (as per point 5), so the hobby of the person in position 1 is not filmmaking. The hobby of the person in position 1 is either photography, video-games, or unknown. But the fan of photography is not specified, so the hobby of the person in position 1 is unknown. So, the hobbies are: 1 - unknown, 2 - video-games, 3 - photography, 4 - cooking.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      1      |      2      |      3       |        4        |
