Lv2-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From condition 6, the American is the pilot. Let's place the pilot (P) in the first row and the American (A) in the sixth row.

2. From condition 7, the security-guard (S) is on the left of the American (P). So, the security-guard must be in the first row, and the firefighter (F) must be in the second row (since the firefighter is on the right of the security-guard).

3. From condition 8, the Spanish (E) is on the left of the firefighter (F). So, the Spanish must be in the second row, and the nurse (N) must be in the third row (since the nurse is on the right of the Spanish).

4. From condition 1, the pilot (P) is on the left of the nurse (N). So, the pilot must be in the third row, and the nurse must be in the fourth row.

5. From condition 5, the Mexican (M) is between the Russian (R) and the Argentine (Arg). Since the Argentine is on the left of the social-worker (SW), the Argentine must be in the fifth row. The Mexican can't be in the first four rows, so it must be in the sixth row.

6. From condition 4, the Russian (R) is between the social-worker (SW) and the American (A). Since the American is the pilot (P), the Russian must be in the fifth row.

7. From condition 2, the Argentine (Arg) is on the left of the social-worker (SW). Since the Mexican (M) is on the right of the Argentine (Arg), the social-worker must be in the fourth row.

8. From condition 9, the security-guard (S) is on the right of the social-worker (SW). So, the security-guard must be in the sixth row.

Now, let's put the nationalities in the appropriate jobs:

Lv2-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 8, we know that the person driving the roller is on the far right, so we can place the roller in the 6th column and the person eating kale (who is driving the roller) in the 6th row. Let's mark this as K for kale.

2. From point 5, we know that the person eating broccoli is the person driving the bike. Since we know where the roller is, the only remaining option for the bike is the 1st column. Let's mark this as B for broccoli.

3. From point 1, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is between the person driving the bike (B) and the person eating pomegranate. Since the quad-bike cannot be in the 1st or 6th column (as the bike and roller are already placed), it must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. If it were in the 2nd column, it would be to the left of B, which contradicts point 2. If it were in the 5th column, it would be to the right of B, but then it would be too far from the person eating pomegranate. So, the quad-bike must be in the 3rd or 4th column. If it were in the 3rd column, the person eating pomegranate would have to be in the 1st column, but then the person driving the trike (which is to the right of the person driving the bike) would have to be in the 2nd column, and the only food left for the trike would be pomegranate, which contradicts point 2 (the person driving the quad-bike should be between B and the person eating pomegranate). Therefore, the quad-bike must be in the 4th column, and the person eating pomegranate must be in the 5th column. Let's mark P for pomegranate in the 5th row and Q for quad-bike in the 4th row.

4. From point 7, we know that the person eating corn is on the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since corn cannot be in the 1st column (as the bike is there), it must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. If it were in the 2nd column, it would be to the left of P, but then it would be too far from Q. If it were in the 4th column, it would be to the right of B, which contradicts point 1 (the person driving the roller is to the right of the person driving the bike). So, the person eating corn must be in the 3rd column. Let's mark C for corn in the 3rd row.

5. From point 3, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the taxi cannot be in the 1st column (as the bike is there), it must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th column. If it were in the 2nd column, it would be to the left of C, but then it would be too far from the person eating grapefruit. If it were in the 6th column, it would be to the right of K, which contradicts point 1 (the person driving the roller is to the right of the person driving the bike). So, the person driving the taxi must be in the 4th column. Since the person eating grapefruit must be to the right of the taxi, it can only be in the 5th or 6th column. If it were in the 5th column, it would be to the right of P, which contradicts point 2 (the person driving the quad-bike is between B and the person eating pomegranate). Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be in the 6th column. Let's mark G for grapefruit in the 6th row.

6. From point 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is the person eating corn. Since we already know where the person eating corn is, the scooter must be in the 3rd row. Let's mark S for scooter in the 3rd row.

7. From point 6, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since the trike cannot be in the 6th column (as the roller is there), it must be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th column. If it were in the 1st column, it would be to the left of B, which contradicts point 2. If it were in the 5th column, it would be to the right of P, which contradicts point 2. If it were in the 4th column, it would be to the left of Q, which contradicts point 2. Therefore, the person driving the trike must be in the 2nd column. Let's mark T for trike in the 2nd row.

The final solution table is:

Lv2-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Let's place them as follows:
   |   | Disaster | Satire |  |  |  |  |

2. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since we don't know the position of cycling yet, let's place family movies for now:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family |  |  |  |  |

3. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we don't know the position of golf yet, let's place biathlon for now:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon |  |  |  |

4. The person watching drama movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching sports movies. Since we don't know the position of sports movies yet, let's place drama movies:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Drama |  |  |

5. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since we already placed satire and cycling, this condition is satisfied.

6. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since we don't know the position of golf yet, let's place soccer:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Drama | Soccer |  |

7. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since we don't know the position of western movies yet, let's place badminton:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Drama | Soccer | Badminton |

8. The person watching sports movies is on the far right. Since we already placed all the other movies, sports movies must be in the last position:
   | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Drama | Soccer | Badminton | Sports |

Now, let's fill in the missing movie genres:

- The only genre left is western. Since it's on the far left and badminton is on its left, western must be in the first position:
   | Western | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Drama | Soccer | Badminton | Sports |

- The only sport left is golf. Since soccer is on its right and golf must be on the right of biathlon, golf must be in the 6th position:
   | Western | Disaster | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Golf | Drama | Soccer | Badminton | Sports |

- The only genre left is cycling's neighbor on the left. Since family is on the right of cycling and cycling is on the right of satire, the only option left for cycling's neighbor on the left is drama:
   | Western | Disaster | Drama | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Golf | Drama | Soccer | Badminton | Sports |

Now we have a complete table:

| Western | Disaster | Drama | Satire | Family | Biathlon | Golf | Drama | Soccer | Badminton | Sports |

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating grapefruit. Since we don't know the position yet, let's mark it as 'G' for now:

3. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person eating pepper. Since we don't know the position of the person eating pepper yet, let's mark it as 'P' for now:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | P   | ... | ... |

4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far right. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is board-games to the right of the person eating pepper, the person eating pepper must be in the 5th position:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | P   | ... | ... |

5. The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is traveling in the 2nd position, the person eating grapefruit must be in the 3rd position:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | P   | ... | ... |

6. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is eating cauliflower (from rule 9), let's place the person eating strawberry to the right of the person eating cauliflower:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | P   | C   | S | ... |
   (C stands for cauliflower, S stands for strawberry)

7. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person eating strawberry. So, we know that the person's hobby is dancing.

8. The person eating nectarine is between the person eating orange and the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we already placed the person who's hobby is woodworking (G) in the 3rd position and the person eating grapefruit (G) in the 2nd position, the person eating nectarine must be in the 4th position:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | N   | C   | S | ... |
   (N stands for nectarine)

9. The person eating orange must be in the 5th position, as it's between the person eating nectarine and the person who's hobby is woodworking:
   |         | Board-games | Traveling | G   | N   | O   | C   | S | ... |
   (O stands for orange)

10. Finally, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the 1st position, as it's on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling:

Lv2-2x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the roller is the same person (since the first row says ""the person driving the roller is the person driving the roller""). So, we can fill the first row with ""Roller"" in the column corresponding to the person driving the roller.

2. Since the person driving the van is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (row 2), and the person driving the roller is not the person driving the van (from point 1), the person driving the van must be in the first three positions. As the person driving the roller is already placed, the van must be in the first column. So, we can fill the second row with ""Van"" in the first column.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is hiking (row 3). As the person driving the van is the hiker (from point 2), the person who's hobby is chess must be in the third column. So, we can fill the third row with ""Chess"" in the third column.

4. The person who's hobby is hiking is the person driving the van (from point 2), so we have already placed this information.

5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking (row 5). As the hiker is already placed, the skydiver must be in the second column. So, we can fill the sixth row with ""Skydiving"" in the second column.

6. The person who's hobby is reading is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram (row 6). As the roller is already placed, the reader must be in the fourth column. So, we can fill the fifth row with ""Reading"" in the fourth column.

7. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the bike (row 7). As the roller is already placed, the bike must be in the second column. So, we can fill the first row with ""Bike"" in the second column.

8. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the roller (row 8). As the roller is already placed in the third column, the cook must be in the sixth column. So, we can fill the fifth row with ""Cooking"" in the sixth column.

9. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (row 9). As we have not placed the gardener yet, the gardener must be in the first column. So, we can fill the third row with ""Gardening"" in the first column.

Now, let's check the consistency of the solution:
- The person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (row 9), and the gardener is in the first column. So, the boat must be in the second column. We can fill the fourth row with ""Boat"" in the second column.

- The person driving the tram has not been placed yet. As the reader is in the fourth column and the cook is in the sixth column, the tram must be in the fifth column. We can fill the first row with ""Tram"" in the fifth column.

- The solution is consistent, and we have placed all the hobbies and transports.

The final solution table is:

However, the table format does not allow for multiple entries in a row, so I've separated the hobbies and transports into two separate tables:

Hobbies:

  |             |     1     |    2    |    3    |    4    |    5     |    6    |

Lv2-2x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From conditions 1 and 2, we know that the order of music genres from left to right is: Gospel, Indie, Disco (or Gospel, Disco, Indie, but we'll assume the given order for now).

2. From condition 3, the fan of trance cannot be in the first three positions, so it must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. If it were in position 4, it would violate condition 6 (blues is to the left of trance), so it must be in positions 5 or 6. However, if it were in position 6, it would violate condition 9 (mechanic is to the right of disco), so trance must be in position 5.

3. Now we know that the order of jobs from left to right is: Designer, Journalist, Mechanic, Musician, Social-Worker, Teacher (or Designer, Social-Worker, Teacher, Journalist, Mechanic, Musician, but we'll assume the given order for now).

4. From condition 4, the musician is the fan of gospel, so the musician is in position 1 (since gospel is in position 1).

5. From condition 5, the mechanic is between the journalist and the social-worker. Since the musician is the first job and the social-worker is the last job, the mechanic must be in position 3.

6. Now we know that the order of jobs from left to right is: Designer, Journalist, Mechanic, Musician, Social-Worker, Teacher.

7. From condition 6, the fan of blues is to the left of the fan of trance, so the blues fan must be in position 2.

8. From condition 7 and 8, the social-worker is in position 6 and the teacher is in position 5.

9. From condition 9, the mechanic is to the right of the fan of disco, so the fan of disco must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |    2    |       3       |    4     |     5      |    6     |
| Job           | Designer | Musician| Mechanic    | Disco    | Social-Worker| Teacher  |
| Music-Genre   |          | Gospel  |              | Disco    |              | Blues    |

However, there is a contradiction in conditions 7 and 8, which state that the social-worker is both on the right of the teacher and on the left of the teacher. This puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved as stated."	{'job': ['designer', 'musician', 'mechanic', 'disco', 'social-worker', 'teacher'], 'music-genre': ['', 'gospel', '', 'disco', '', 'blues']}	True	0	False
Lv2-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person who's sport is skiing. Let's place them in the table:

2. The person who's sport is biathlon is between the person who's hobby is chess and the person who's sport is surfing. Since skiing is already in the second position, biathlon must be in the first position (to be between chess and surfing). Let's place biathlon in the first row:

   |         |    1    |    2     |     3      |   4    |   5    |       6       |

    | Sport   | chess  | skiing  | surfing  |         |         | skiing      |

So, the final solution table is:

   |         |    1    |    2     |     3      |   4    |   5    |       6       |

Lv2-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Let's denote D for documentary and H for horror. So, the arrangement could be D-X-H or X-D-H, where X represents any other genre.

2. The owner of the ferret is the person watching comedy movies. Let's denote C for comedy. So, we know that C = F (Ferret owner).

3. The person watching horror movies is the owner of the rabbit. So, H = R (Rabbit owner).

4. The person watching comedy movies is the owner of the ferret. So, C = F.

5. The person watching comedy movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching documentary movies. Since we already know the positions of C and D, this means that the family movies must be to the left of C and to the right of D. Let's denote F for family. So, the arrangement could be D-F-C-X-H or F-D-C-X-H.

6. The owner of the snake is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since we know that H = R (Rabbit owner) is on the far right, the snake owner (S) must be to the right of H. So, the arrangement cannot be D-F-C-X-H, and it must be F-D-C-X-H-R-S.

7. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Let's denote S for satire and G for goldfish. Since we know the positions of F, D, C, H, R, and S, the only place left for G is between C and H. So, the final arrangement is F-D-C-S-G-H-R-S.

8. The person watching satire movies is between the person watching family movies and the owner of the bird. Since we already know the positions of F, D, C, S, H, R, and G, the only place left for B (Bird) is to the right of S. So, the final arrangement is F-D-C-S-G-H-R-SB.

Here is the final solution table:
