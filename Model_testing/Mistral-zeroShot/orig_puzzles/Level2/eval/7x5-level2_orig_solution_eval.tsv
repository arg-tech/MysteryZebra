1. We know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, music-genres, sports, and means of transport. Let's assign them to the rows and columns.

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

2. From point 1, we know the architect is Australian (point 2), so the Australian is in the first row (column 1).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

3. The thai is between the person eating onion and the photographer (point 3), so the thai is in the third or fourth column. Since the architect is in the first column, the thai cannot be in the fourth column. So, the thai is in the third column (column 3).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

4. The person driving the motorbike is the person eating lemon (point 4), so the lemon is in the third row (row 3).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

5. The person who's sport is badminton is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (point 5), so the badminton is in the second row (row 2).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

6. The person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is volleyball (point 6), so the cucumber is in the fifth row (row 5).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

7. The fan of reggae is on the right of the japanese (point 7), so the reggae is in the fourth or fifth column. Since the thai is in the third column, the reggae is in the fourth or fifth column. The architect is in the first column, the thai is in the third column, and the cucumber (volleyball) is in the fifth column, so the reggae must be in the fourth column (column 4).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

9. The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing (point 18), so the cucumber is in the second column (column 2).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

10. The person who's hobby is singing is the fan of reggae (point 17), so the reggae is in the second row (row 2).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |
   | Food          | asparagus     | broccoli  | cucumber     | lemon       | onion      |
   | Hobby         | baking       | drawing   | photography   | rock-climbing| reggae     |

   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

11. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person driving the bus (point 12), so the drawing is in the third or fourth column. Since the thai is in the third column, the drawing is in the fourth or fifth column. The architect is in the first column, the thai is in the third column, the cucumber (volleyball) is in the second column, and the reggae (singing) is in the second row, so the drawing must be in the fourth or fifth column. However, the person who's hobby is drawing cannot be in the fifth column because the person who's hobby is singing is already there. So, the drawing is in the fourth column (column 4).

   |               |       1        |     2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |
   | Food          | asparagus     | broccoli  | cucumber     | lemon       | onion      |
   | Hobby         | baking       | drawing   | photography   | rock-climbing| reggae     |
   | Job           | architect    | bartender | paramedic    | photographer | security-guard|
   | Music-Genre   | disco        | indie     | reggae       | rock        | soul       |
   | Nationality   | australian   | indonesian| italian      | japanese    | thai       |
   | Sport         | badminton    | lacrosse  | rowing       | skateboarding| volleyball  |
   | Transport     | bus          | helicopter| motorbike    | ship        | subway     |

12. The person who's hobby is drawing cannot be in the first column because the architect is there. The person who's hobby is drawing is not the thai (point 3), so the person who's hobby is drawing is in the second or third column. The architect is in the first column, the thai is in the third column, and the cucumber (volleyball) is in the second column, so the person who's hobby is drawing is in the first column. However, this contradicts the fact that the person who's hobby is drawing is not the thai. This is a contradiction, and there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table is incomplete due to the contradiction in the puzzle."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-7x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the mechanic is on the far right, so let's place him there. Let's assume Mechanic is in row 3.

2. The owner of the frog is on the left of the architect, so the architect can't be in the last column. Let's place the architect in the second-to-last column (column 4).

Since the Dutch is the person drinking hot-chocolate (row 2), and the Dutch is on the right of the software-developer (row 4), the only available position for the Dutch is position 4 (column 4). So, Hot-Chocolate goes in row 2. Now the subway can go in position 5 (column 5), so Subway goes in row 5.
   - The person driving the train is on the left of the engineer, so it must be in position 5 (column 5). However, we already placed the subway in position 5 (column 5). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given information.

The final solution table would look like this if the puzzle were correct:

Lv2-7x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of classical is between the person drinking sprite and the person watching musical movies. Let's place the fan of classical (C) in the 3rd position, the person drinking sprite (S) in the 2nd position, and the person watching musical movies (M) in the 4th position.

2. The project-manager (P) is the person eating kale (K), so we place K in the 2nd column and P in the row corresponding to the 3rd column (since there are 5 people).

3. The person watching action movies (A) is between the person watching scientific movies (Sc) and the owner of the rabbit (R). Since A is on the left of Sc and R, we can place A in the 1st column, Sc in the 4th column, and R in the 5th column.

4. The person watching musical movies (M) is on the left of the scientist (Sci). Since M is in the 4th column, Sci must be in the 3rd column.

5. The person watching water-polo (WP) is the fan of classical (C), so we can place WP in the same position as C (3rd column, 3rd row).

6. The person watching ice-hockey (IH) is in the middle, so it must be in the 3rd row. Since IH is not in the positions occupied by C, M, A, Sc, or WP, it must be in the 2nd column.

7. The person watching handball (H) is on the left of the person eating potato (Pot), so H must be in the 1st column and Pot in the 2nd column.

9. The person drinking sprite (S) is on the left of the fan of country (Co), so Co must be in the 5th column.

10. The person watching action movies (A) is on the left of the fan of country (Co), so A must be in the 1st column.

11. The fan of hip-hop (HH) is on the far right, so it must be in the 5th column.

12. The fan of r&b (R&B) is on the far left, so it must be in the 1st column.

14. The owner of the goat (Go) is the person who's sport is volleyball (V), so Go must be in the 5th column and V in the 4th column.

15. The electrician (E) is on the left of the project-manager (P), so E must be in the 2nd row. Since E is not in the positions occupied by S, M, A, Sc, or WP, it must be in the 1st column.

16. The person eating potato (Pot) is not in the positions occupied by S, M, A, Sc, WP, IH, H, T, Te, Co, HH, R&B, Apr, Go, V, E, or C, so it must be in the 3rd column.

17. The person drinking milk (Mi) is on the right of the owner of the horse (Ho), so Ho must be in the 4th column and Mi in the 5th column.

18. The person drinking milk (Mi) is on the far right, so it must be in the 5th column. Since Mi is not in the positions occupied by S, M, A, Sc, WP, IH, H, T, Te, Co, HH, R&B, Apr, Go, V, E, or C, it must be in the 5th row.

19. The person eating pumpkin (Pump) is on the far right, so it must be in the 5th column. Since Pump is not in the positions occupied by S, M, A, Sc, WP, IH, H, T, Te, Co, HH, R&B, Apr, Go, V, E, or C, it must be in the 1st row.

20. The person who's sport is water-polo (WP) is the fan of classical (C), so WP must be in the 3rd row, 3rd column.

21. The person who's sport is ice-hockey (IH) is in the middle, so it must be in the 3rd row. Since IH is not in the positions occupied by S, M, A, Sc, WP, H, T, Te, Co, HH, R&B, Apr, Go, V, E, or C, it must be in the 2nd column.

22. The person who's sport is handball (H) is on the left of the person eating potato (Pot), so H must be in the 1st column.

Lv2-7x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person eating banana is between the lawyer and the coach. Let's place the lawyer and coach first, then banana. Since the person eating banana is on the left of the fan of indie (10), the fan of indie can't be the lawyer or the coach. So, let's place the fan of indie next to the banana. Now, we have:

   |               |    1    |      2      |    3    |    4     |         5          |

   We know the dancer is on the left of the fan of pop (2), so the dancer can't be the fan of indie, lawyer, coach, or banana. Let's place the dancer in the remaining spot. Now, we have:

   |               |    1    |      2      |    3    |    4     |         5          |

   Now, the person eating lettuce is between the person eating kale and the fan of classical (3). Since the fan of classical can't be the dancer, lawyer, coach, or banana, let's place the fan of classical next to the kale. Now, we have:

   |               |    1    |      2      |    3    |    4     |         5          |

   Continuing with the given clues, we can fill in the rest of the table:

   |               |    1    |      2      |    3    |    4     |         5          |

21. From point 21, the owner of the ferret (Fe) is between the fan of techno (T) and the freelancer (Fr). Since we know the freelancer is already placed, let's place the owner of the ferret (Fe) and the fan of techno (T) in the table.

Lv2-7x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we can fill in the row and column headers with numbers from 1 to 5.

2. From rule 1, we know the owner of the pony is in the middle, so we can place the pony owner in the cell (3,3).

3. From rule 2, the Russian is on the left of the animation movie watcher. Since the pony owner is in the middle, the Russian must be in (2,2) and the animation movie watcher in (4,2).

4. From rule 3, the Pakistani is between the mechanic and the social worker. Since the pony owner is in the middle, the mechanic must be in (1,3) and the social worker in (4,3). This means the Pakistani is in (2,3) or (3,3), but since the pony owner is already there, the Pakistani must be in (2,3).

5. From rule 5, the social worker is the collector. So, the social worker is in (4,3) and the collection hobby is in (5,3).

6. From rule 6, the cola drinker is on the right of the tea drinker. Since the social worker (collector) is in (4,3), the tea drinker must be in (5,3) and the cola drinker in (5,4).

7. From rule 7, the rabbit owner is on the left of the pony owner. Since the pony owner is in (3,3), the rabbit owner must be in (2,3). From rule 14, we know the rabbit owner is the tea drinker, so the tea drinker is in (2,3) and the rabbit owner is in (2,3). This means the cola drinker is in (5,4).

8. From rule 8, the Canadian is the skiing person. Since the pony owner is in the middle, the skiing person must be in (1,1) or (5,5), but since the table is symmetric, we can place the Canadian in (1,1).

9. From rule 9, the dancer is on the right of the card-games person. Since the Canadian is in (1,1), the dancer must be in (2,1) and the card-games person in (3,1).

10. From rule 10, the lacrosse player is the spy movie watcher. Since the Canadian is in (1,1), the spy movie watcher must be in (5,5). This means the lacrosse player is in (5,5).

11. From rule 11, the drawing person is the crime movie watcher. Since the Russian is in (2,2) and the animation movie watcher in (4,2), the crime movie watcher must be in (3,2). This means the drawing person is in (3,2).

12. From rule 12, the water-polo player is on the right of the German. Since the Canadian is in (1,1), the German must be in (2,2). This means the water-polo player is in (3,2).

13. From rule 13, the Canadian is the horror movie watcher. Since the Canadian is in (1,1), the horror movie watcher is in (1,1).

14. From rule 15, the water-polo player is the horse owner. Since the water-polo player is in (3,2), the horse owner is in (3,2).

15. From rule 16, the animation movie watcher is between the mirinda drinker and the mechanic. Since the Russian is in (2,2) and the mechanic is in (4,3), the animation movie watcher must be in (3,2). This confirms our previous placement of the animation movie watcher.

16. From rule 17, the mechanic is on the right of the coffee drinker. Since the mechanic is in (4,3), the coffee drinker must be in (3,3).

17. From rule 18, the hot-chocolate drinker is the drawing person. Since the drawing person is in (3,2), the hot-chocolate drinker is in (3,2).

18. From rule 19, the collector is on the right of the pony owner. Since the pony owner is in (3,3), the collector is in (4,3).

19. From rule 20, the rabbit owner is between the pony owner and the traveler. Since the pony owner is in (3,3) and the traveler is yet to be placed, the rabbit owner must be in (2,3) and the traveler in (4,3).

20. From rule 21, the doctor is the chinchilla owner. Since the remaining pets are horse, pony, and rabbit, the chinchilla must be the first one listed, so the doctor is in (1,1).

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

Lv2-7x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of items for each category, so we can fill in the table with the given items. However, since we don't have any positional information yet, we'll just list the items for each category:

   |               |      7up      |   almond-milk   |  lemonade   |  sprite   |   tea     |
   | Beverage      |               |                 |            |          |           |
   | Food          |   artichoke   |   cabbage       |  kiwi       |  orange   |  strawberry|
   | Hobby         |   camping     |   cooking       |  dancing   |  rock-climbing| woodworking|
   | Music-Genre   |   blues       |   classical     |  metal     |  r&b      |  salsa    |
   | Nationality   |   egyptian    |   german        |  japanese  |  russian  |  turkish  |
   | Sport         |   rowing      |   sailing       |  skiing    |  soccer   |  tennis   |
   | Transport     |   boat        |   jet-ski       |  roller    |  skateboard|  train    |

2. Let's start with the positional information:

   1. The person eating orange is on the left of the japanese. This means orange must be in the first or second position. Since the japanese is eating strawberry (from point 4), strawberry cannot be in the first position. So, orange must be in the second position, and the japanese must be in the third position.
   2. The fan of metal is the egyptian. Since we know the Egyptian's position (third), metal must be in the third row.
   3. The turkish is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since camping is in the first column, the turkish must be in the fourth or fifth column.
   4. The japanese is the person eating strawberry, which we know is in the third position.
   5. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in the fifth column, dancing must be in the fourth column.
   6. The turkish is on the right of the german. Since we know the position of the turkish (fourth column), the german must be in the third column.
   7. The person driving the jet-ski is the fan of classical. Since we know the position of the fan of metal (third row), the fan of classical must be in the second row.
   8. The person who's sport is skiing is in the middle. Since we know the positions of the fans of metal and classical (second and third rows), skiing must be in the first row.
   9. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the japanese. Since we know the position of the japanese (third position), sprite must be in the second position.
   10. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since we know the position of the person drinking sprite (second position), the person driving the roller must be in the first position.
   11. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person eating kiwi. Since we know the position of the person drinking sprite (second position), the person eating kiwi must be in the fourth position.
   12. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the fan of metal. Since we know the position of the fan of metal (third row), the person who's sport is rowing must be in the fifth row.
   13. The turkish is the person who's sport is sailing. Since we know the position of the turkish (fourth column), sailing must be in the fifth row.
   14. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person eating artichoke. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is sailing (fifth row), the person eating artichoke must be in the fourth row.
   15. The person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person driving the boat. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is skiing (first row), it must be between rock-climbing (second column) and boat (fifth column). So, skiing must be in the third column.
   16. The fan of blues is the person driving the skateboard. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is skiing (first row, third column), the fan of blues must be in the second row.
   17. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since we know the position of the fan of classical (second row), the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in the first row.
   18. The fan of r&b is the person who's sport is sailing. Since we know the position of the person who's sport is sailing (fifth row), the fan of r&b must be in the fourth row.
   19. The person driving the train is on the far right. Since we know the positions of all other items, the person driving the train must be in the fifth column.
   20. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the turkish. Since we know the position of the turkish (fourth column), the person eating strawberry must be in the fifth column.
   21. The fan of blues is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know the position of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (first row, first column), the person drinking almond-milk must be in the second column.
   22. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person driving the roller. Since we know the position of the person who's hobby is cooking (first row), the person driving the roller must be in the first row.
   23. The japanese is the person drinking lemonade. Since we know the position of the japanese (third position), the person drinking lemonade must be in the third position.

3. Now we can fill in the table with the positional information:

   |               |      7up      |   almond-milk   |  lemonade   |  sprite   |   tea     |
   | Beverage      |               |                 |            |          |           |
   | Food          |   artichoke   |   cabbage       |  kiwi       |  orange   |  strawberry|
   | Hobby         |   camping     |   cooking       |  dancing   |  rock-climbing| woodworking|

   | Sport         |   rowing      |   sailing       |  skiing    |  soccer   |  tennis   |
   | Transport     |   boat        |   jet-ski       |  roller    |  skateboard|  train    |

And that's the final solution table:

Lv2-7x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of items for each category, so we can fill in the number of rows for each category in the table.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4      |      5      |

| Transport     | motor     |          |               |            |             |

2. From rule 19, we know that the person playing basketball is in the middle. Since there are 5 people, the person playing basketball must be in the 3rd position. So, we can fill in the sport for the 3rd row.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4      |      5      |

3. From rule 16, we know that the owner of the pony is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person playing basketball is in the 3rd position, the person playing climbing must be in the 1st or 2nd position. If the person playing climbing was in the 1st position, the owner of the pony would be in the 5th position, which is not possible because there are only 4 food items. So, the person playing climbing must be in the 2nd position. We can fill in the sport for the 2nd row.

4. From rule 18, we know that the person playing sailing is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the person playing climbing is in the 2nd position, the person playing sailing must be in the 1st position. We can fill in the sport for the 1st row.

5. From rule 17, we know that the person drinking juice is on the far right. Since there are 5 people, the person drinking juice must be in the 5th position. We can fill in the beverage for the 5th row.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4      |      5      |

| Transport     | motor     |          |               |            | tram        |

6. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far right. Since the person drinking juice is already in the 5th position, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the 4th position. We can fill in the beverage for the 4th row.

|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4      |      5      |

7. From rule 11, we know that the person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person playing sailing is in the 1st position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. If the owner of the chinchilla was in the 2nd position, the person driving the tram would be in the 1st position, which is already occupied by the person playing sailing. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. If the owner of the chinchilla was in the 5th position, the person driving the tram would be in the 4th position, which is already occupied by the person drinking iced-tea. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the 3rd position. We can fill in the pet for the 3rd row.

8. From rule 13, we know that the person driving the tram is the person watching drama movies. Since the person playing sailing is in the 1st position, the person watching drama movies must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. If the person watching drama movies was in the 5th position, the person driving the tram would be in the 4th position, which is already occupied by the person drinking iced-tea. So, the person watching drama movies must be in the 3rd position. We can fill in the movie-genre for the 3rd row.

24. From rule 6, we know that the person eating spinach is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the person eating spinach is in the 5th position, the owner of the lizard must be in the 4th position. However, we already filled in the pet for the 4th position. This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

The final solution table should be filled as follows:

|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4      |      5      |
