Lv2-3x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person watching satire movies on the far left (column 1).
2. The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. So, place golf in the second column, and comedy in the third column.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is between the fan of classical and the fan of blues. Since we already placed comedy and golf, classical must be in the fourth column, and blues in the fifth column. So, water-polo goes in the sixth column (since it's also the person watching comedy movies).
4. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we already placed comedy, golf, water-polo, classical, and blues, horror must be in the first column. So, volleyball goes in the seventh column.
5. The fan of classical is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since we already placed classical, disaster must be in the second column.
6. The person watching comedy movies is the person who's sport is water-polo, so this condition is already satisfied.
7. The fan of r&b is between the person who's sport is surfing and the person watching satire movies. Since we already placed water-polo, surfing must be in the third column, and satire in the fifth column. So, r&b goes in the fourth column.
8. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we already placed volleyball in the seventh column, tennis goes in the sixth column.
9. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since we already placed volleyball in the seventh column, climbing goes in the eighth column.
10. The person watching superhero movies is the fan of jazz. So, jazz goes in the first row, and superhero goes in the third column.
11. The person watching horror movies is the fan of rock. So, rock goes in the first row, and horror goes in the first column.
12. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we already placed superhero in the third column, fantasy goes in the fourth column.
13. The person who's sport is climbing is the fan of reggae. So, reggae goes in the eighth column.
14. The person watching scientific movies is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is water-polo. Since we already placed water-polo in the sixth column, scientific goes in the fifth column.

Lv2-3x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, sports, and transport, so we can start by assigning them to the table. Since we know the Canadian drives the car, we can place them in the table:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |

|              |              |              |
|              |              |              |

2. The person who's sport is sailing is the person who's sport is sailing, so we can place it in the table:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |

|              |              |              |

3. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we don't know the sport of the person on the right of the sailor yet, we can't place them yet.

4. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person driving the bus (Canadian). So, we know the person doing parkour is to the left of the sailor.

5. The person who's sport is badminton is the Thai. We can place it in the table:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |

|              |              |              |

6. The British is the person driving the scooter. We can place it in the table:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |

|              |              |              |

7. The British is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person driving the trike. Since we don't know the position of the soccer player yet, we can't place them yet.

8. The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the Indian. We can place it in the table:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |

| Indian       |              |              |

9. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we know the person doing parkour is to the left of the Canadian, we can place the soccer player to the left of the handball player:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |
|              | Sailing      |              |
|              | Parkour      |              |

| Soccer       |              |              |
| Indian       |              |              |

10. The colombian is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since we know the Canadian drives the car, the Colombian must be on the rightmost side.

11. The Indian is on the right of the British. Since we know the British is on the scooter, the Indian must be on the right of the scooter.

12. The Egyptian is on the left of the British. Since we know the British is on the scooter, the Egyptian must be on the left of the scooter.

13. The Egyptian is on the right of the person driving the train. Since we know the Canadian drives the car and the Colombian is on the rightmost side, the Egyptian must be on the right of the Colombian and left of the train.

14. The person driving the bus is the Canadian. We already know this.

15. The person driving the trike is to the right of the British and the soccer player. Since we know the British is on the scooter and the soccer player is to the left of the handball player, the trike driver must be to the right of the handball player and the British.

16. The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the Thai. Since we know the Thai is on badminton, the cricket player must be to the left of the badminton player.

Now, let's place the remaining people and sports:

| Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Canadian      |              | Car          |
|              | Sailing      |              |
|              | Parkour      |              |
| Thai         | Badminton    |              |
| British      |              | Scooter      |
| Handball     |              |              |
| Soccer       |              |              |
| Indian       |              |              |
| Egyptian     |              |              |
| Colombian    |              |              |
|              | Cricket      |              |
|              |              | Trike        |
|              |              | Train        |
|              | Parkour      | Bus          |
|              | Soccer       |              |
|              | Cricket      |              |

We still have some empty spots, but we have placed all the nationalities and sports according to the given conditions. Since the puzzle doesn't specify the exact order of the empty spots, we can't fill them uniquely.

However, we can make some educated guesses based on the given conditions:
- The person doing handball is likely to be on the leftmost side, as it's on the left of the Indian.
- The person doing cricket is likely to be on the left of the badminton player (Thai).
- The person driving the trike is likely to be on the right of the handball player and the British.
- The person driving the train is likely to be on the right of the Egyptian and the bus driver (Canadian).

So, the final solution table could look like this:

2. The journalist drives the taxi, so let's place the journalist in the second row, second column (since the jobs are in the second column). Since the accountant is on the left of the journalist, the journalist must be drinking a different beverage than coffee. Let's assume the journalist is drinking tea (T).

Since the van is on the far right and the photographer is not placed yet, the trike must be in the sixth row. Let's place the trike in the sixth row, fourth column (since the jobs are in the fourth column). Since the accountant is on the left of the journalist, the trike driver must be a different job than the journalist. Let's assume the trike driver is the analyst (A).

13. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the journalist. Since the journalist is already placed, let's place the coffee drinker in the first column, second row. Since the accountant is on the left of the journalist, the coffee drinker must be a different job than the accountant. Let's assume the coffee drinker is the manager (M).

1. The Italian is on the far left, so Italian is in the first column. Let's place it as Food-1.
2. The person eating cranberry watches scientific movies, and the Italian is not eating cranberry (since we placed the Italian already), so the person eating cranberry must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, or 6th row. Since the Italian is on the far left, the person eating cranberry cannot be in the 6th row (as it would violate rule 6). So, the person eating cranberry is either Food-2, Food-3, Food-5, or Food-7. Let's place cranberry in the 2nd row for now.
3. The French is watching drama movies, and the Italian is not French, so the French must be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th row. Since the Italian is on the far left, the French cannot be in the 6th row (as it would violate rule 4). So, the French is either Food-4, Food-5, or Food-6. Let's place the French in the 4th row for now.
4. The person watching adventure movies is on the far right, so it must be in the 7th column. Since the Italian is not eating radish, the person eating radish cannot be in the 7th column (as it would violate rule 5). So, the person eating radish is either Food-1, Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. Let's place radish in the 3rd row for now.
5. The American is on the right of the person eating radish, so the American is either Food-4, Food-5, or Food-7. Since the American is also eating pumpkin (rule 10), the American must be in the 5th or 7th row. But the American cannot be in the 7th row (as it would violate rule 6), so the American is in the 5th row.
6. The person eating blueberry is on the far right (rule 6), so it must be in the 7th column. Since the American is not eating blueberry, the person eating blueberry is either Food-1, Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. But the person eating blueberry cannot be in the 1st column (as it would violate rule 12), so the person eating blueberry is either Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. Let's place blueberry in the 2nd row for now.
7. The person eating apricot is in the middle (rule 7), so it must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th row. Since the American is not eating apricot, the person eating apricot is not in the 5th row. So, the person eating apricot is either Food-3 or Food-4. But the person eating apricot cannot be in the 4th row (as it would violate rule 8), so the person eating apricot is in the 3rd row.
8. The Mexican is watching action movies (rule 9), so the Mexican must be in the 7th column. Since the American is not Mexican, the Mexican is not in the 5th row. So, the Mexican is either Food-1, Food-2, Food-3, or Food-6. But the Mexican cannot be in the 1st column (as it would violate rule 12), so the Mexican is either Food-2, Food-3, or Food-6. Let's place the Mexican in the 6th row for now.
9. The person watching animation movies is the Turkish (rule 11), so the Turkish must be in the 7th column. Since the Mexican is not Turkish, the Turkish is not in the 6th row. So, the Turkish is either Food-1, Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. But the Turkish cannot be in the 1st column (as it would violate rule 11), so the Turkish is either Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. Since the Turkish cannot be in the 4th row (as it would violate rule 8), the Turkish is in the 2nd row.
10. The person watching zombie movies is between the person watching animation movies and the person watching drama movies (rule 14). Since the Turkish is watching animation movies and the French is watching drama movies, the person watching zombie movies is either Food-1, Food-3, or Food-5. But the person watching zombie movies cannot be in the 1st column (as it would violate rule 14), so the person watching zombie movies is either Food-3 or Food-5. Since the American is not watching zombie movies, the person watching zombie movies is not in the 5th row. So, the person watching zombie movies is in the 3rd row.
11. The person eating banana is the Italian (rule 12), so the Italian must be in the 1st column. Since the Italian is not in the 1st row (as it would violate rule 1), the Italian is in the 2nd row.
12. The Indian is on the far right (rule 13), so the Indian must be in the 7th column. Since the Mexican is not Indian, the Indian is not in the 6th row. So, the Indian is either Food-1, Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. But the Indian cannot be in the 1st column (as it would violate rule 12), so the Indian is either Food-2, Food-3, or Food-4. Since the American is not Indian, the Indian is not in the 5th row. So, the Indian is in the 4th row.

Lv2-3x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 10, we know that the Australian (A) is the person driving the tram.
2. From point 15, we know that the Freelancer (F) is on the left of the Australian (A). Since there are 7 jobs and F is the Chinese, F must be in the first column. So, F is in row 1 and has job '1' (French, since F is the 3rd nationality).
3. From point 11, we know that the Doctor (D) is on the right of the Firefighter (FF). Since FF is the person driving the scooter (S), FF must be in the 4th row. So, FF is in row 3 and has job '4' (Malaysian, since FF is to the left of the writer).
4. From point 8, we know that the Doctor (D) is driving the boat. Since D is on the right of FF, D must be in the 5th row. So, D is in row 6 and has job '8' (Indian, since D is the 4th nationality).

Lv2-3x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the security-guard, social-worker, and frog. Let's place them first:
   - Security-guard is on the left of the social-worker, so we can place them as follows: `######### | S | SW`
   - The owner of the frog is on the left of the security-guard, so we can place the frog owner next to the security-guard: `F | ######## | S | SW`

2. The librarian owns the mouse, so we can place the librarian next to the mouse: `L | M | ########`

3. The chef is in the middle, so we can place the chef in the third position: `C | L | M`

4. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we don't know the position of the almond-milk drinker yet, we can't place the lizard owner yet. But we know the lizard owner is to the left of the almond-milk drinker, so we can place a placeholder for the almond-milk drinker to the right of the librarian: `C | L | A | M`

5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the chef. Since the chef is in the third position, the iced-tea drinker should be to the left of the third position: `I | C | L | M`

6. The owner of the cat is between the dancer and the social-worker. Since the social-worker is the fourth position (SW), the dancer should be to the left of the fourth position, and the cat owner to the right of the fourth position. We don't know the position of the dancer yet, but we can place a placeholder for the dancer to the left of the social-worker: `D | I | C | L | M`

7. The person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is the ninth position (coffee), the water drinker should be to the right of the ninth position: `W | ######## | P`

8. The owner of the pony is the person drinking coffee. Since the water drinker is to the right of the pony, we can place the coffee drinker in the eighth position: `W | ######## | P | C`

9. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the coffee drinker is in the eighth position, the mouse owner should be in the ninth position: `W | ######## | P | C | M`

10. The analyst is the owner of the hedgehog. We don't have a place for the hedgehog yet, but we know the analyst should be to the left of the hedgehog, so we can place a placeholder for the hedgehog to the right of the analyst: `A | H | W | ######## | P | C | M`

11. The owner of the frog is on the right of the chef. Since the chef is in the third position, the frog owner should be to the right of the third position: `F | ######## | C | L | M`

12. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we don't know the position of the lemonade drinker yet, we can place a placeholder for the lemonade drinker to the left of the 7up drinker: `L | ######## | 7 | F | C | L | M`

13. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the librarian. Since the librarian is in the second position, the coffee drinker should be in the first position: `C | L | M` (This contradicts our initial placement of the coffee drinker as the pony owner. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.)

So, the puzzle seems to have an inconsistency, and it's not possible to solve it as it stands."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-3x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating strawberry is on the far right, we can place it in the last column (column 7).

2. The person driving the roller is in the middle, so it goes in the third column (column 3).

3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since we know the nectarine eater is the person who's hobby is writing (from point 6), we can place writing in the sixth hobby column (column 4). So, woodworking must be in the fifth hobby column (column 5).

4. The person eating radish is between the person eating cherry and the person eating grapes. Let's assume cherry is in column 1 and grapes in column 2. So, radish must be in column 2 or 3. Since the roller driver is in column 3, radish can't be there. So, radish is in column 2.

5. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person driving the train. Since the train driver is the cherry eater (point 7), camping can't be in the first column. So, camping is in the second column (column 2).

6. The person eating nectarine is the person who's hobby is writing (point 6), so it's in the fourth column (column 4).

7. The person eating cherry is the person driving the train (point 7), so it's in the first column (column 1).

8. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking (point 8). Since filmmaking is not placed yet, let's assume it's in the last hobby column (column 7). So, gardening is in the sixth hobby column (column 5).

9. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person driving the car. Since we don't know the car driver yet, let's assume the car driver is in the last column (column 7). So, zucchini is in the sixth column (column 6).

10. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person driving the train (point 11), so the bus driver is in the first column (column 1).

11. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the taxi (point 13), so the skateboard driver is in the second column (column 2). Since the skateboard driver is also the person who's hobby is hiking (point 14), hiking is in the second hobby column (column 2).

12. The person who's hobby is camping is in the middle (point 12), so it's in the third hobby column (column 3).

13. The person eating grapes is to the left of the person eating radish (point 4), so grapes is in the second column (column 2).

14. The person driving the taxi is to the right of the person driving the skateboard (point 13), so the taxi driver is in the fourth column (column 4).

15. The person eating kiwi is to the left of the person eating nectarine (since nectarine is in the fourth column, kiwi is in the third column, column 3).

Now, let's put the food in the table:

| Food        | Cherry   | Grapes  | Radish  | Strawberry | Zucchini  | Kiwi       |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Hobby      | Camping  | Gardening| Hiking  | Writing     | Film Making| Woodworking |
| Transport  | Bus     |         | Taxi   |            | Tram      | Roller    |

Since we didn't place the hobby for the person eating zucchini, we can't determine the hobby column for the filmmaking person. However, we can place the remaining transport:

| Food        | Cherry   | Grapes  | Radish  | Strawberry | Zucchini  | Kiwi       |
|------------|---------|--------|--------|------------|----------|-----------|
| Hobby      | Camping  | Gardening| Hiking  | Writing     | Film Making| Woodworking |

Lv2-3x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in the middle, we can place the hobby ""filmmaking"" in the 4th position.

2. The person eating pineapple is the person who's hobby is drawing, so we can place ""drawing"" in the position to the left of ""pineapple."" Let's place ""pineapple"" in the 6th position for now.

3. The person eating eggplant is on the left of the person eating papaya. Since we've placed ""pineapple"" in the 6th position, we can place ""eggplant"" in the 3rd position and ""papaya"" in the 5th position.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person eating apple. Since ""pineapple"" is in the 6th position, we can place ""video-games"" in the 2nd position and ""apple"" in the 7th position.

5. The doctor is on the left of the chef. Since ""papaya"" (the chef) is in the 5th position, we can place ""doctor"" in the 4th position.

6. The teacher is on the right of the writer. Since we've placed ""doctor"" in the 4th position, we can place ""writer"" in the 1st position and ""teacher"" in the 2nd position.

7. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person eating pineapple. Since we've placed ""writer"" in the 1st position and ""pineapple"" in the 6th position, we can place ""writing"" in the 1st position and ""pineapple"" in the 6th position.

8. The person eating papaya is the chef. We've already placed ""papaya"" in the 5th position, so the job ""chef"" goes in the 5th position as well.

9. The teacher is between the person eating pineapple and the person eating peas. Since ""teacher"" is in the 2nd position and ""pineapple"" is in the 6th position, the person eating peas must be in the 3rd position. Let's place ""peas"" there.

10. The person who's hobby is collecting is the person eating eggplant. We've already placed ""eggplant"" in the 3rd position, so the hobby ""collecting"" goes in the 3rd position as well.

11. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since ""drawing"" is in the 2nd position and ""pineapple"" (which is not garlic) is in the 6th position, the person eating garlic must be in the 4th position. Let's place ""garlic"" there.

12. The dancer is the person who's hobby is dancing. Since all other hobbies have been placed, the dancer must be in the remaining position. So, the hobby ""dancing"" goes in the 7th position and the job ""dancer"" goes in the last position.

13. The firefighter is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since ""firefighter"" is not yet placed, it must be in the 1st position. So, the hobby ""collecting"" goes in the 3rd position and the job ""firefighter"" goes in the 1st position.

14. The person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since ""writing"" is in the 1st position and we haven't placed ""hiking"" yet, ""hiking"" must be in the 2nd position. So, the hobby ""hiking"" goes in the 2nd position.

Lv2-3x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sprite drinker is in the middle, we can mark the middle row with 'sprite'.

2. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching drama movies and is also in the middle. This means the romance movie-watcher must be in the first or second position. Since the sprite drinker is in the middle, the romance movie-watcher must be in the first position. Let's mark the first row with 'romance'. The drama movie-watcher will be in the second or third position.

3. The firefighter is the person drinking juice. So, we can mark the fourth row with 'juice' and the third row with 'firefighter'.

4. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the coach. Since the firefighter is in the third row, the superhero movie-watcher must be in the second row. Let's mark the second row with 'superhero'. The coach will be in the fifth row.

5. The person drinking fanta is the person watching documentary movies. So, we can mark the sixth row with 'fanta' and the second row with 'documentary'.

6. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the romance movie-watcher is in the first position, the soy-milk drinker must be in the second or third position. However, the soy-milk drinker cannot be in the second position because the superhero movie-watcher is there. So, the soy-milk drinker must be in the third position. Let's mark the third row with 'soy-milk'.

7. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the sprite drinker is in the middle, the tea drinker must be in the first or second position. However, the tea drinker cannot be in the first position because the romance movie-watcher is there. So, the tea drinker must be in the second position. Let's mark the second row with 'tea'. This means the 7up drinker must be in the seventh position. Let's mark the seventh row with '7up'.

8. The coach is watching satire movies. So, we can mark the fifth row with 'satire' and the fifth column with 'coach'.

9. The architect is in the middle. Since the analyst, firefighter, and coach are already placed, the architect must be in the fourth position. Let's mark the fourth row with 'architect'.

10. The analyst is on the right of the scientist. Since the architect is in the fourth position, the scientist must be in the third position. Let's mark the third row with 'scientist'.

11. The engineer is on the right of the doctor. Since the architect is in the fourth position and the scientist is in the third position, the doctor must be in the second position. Let's mark the second row with 'doctor'. This means the engineer must be in the sixth position. Let's mark the sixth row with 'engineer'.

12. The analyst is between the person drinking coffee and the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in the third position and the analyst is in the third row, the coffee drinker must be in the first position. Let's mark the first row with 'coffee'.

13. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary movie-watcher is in the second position, the family movie-watcher must be in the fourth or fifth position. However, the family movie-watcher cannot be in the fifth position because the coach is there. So, the family movie-watcher must be in the fourth position. Let's mark the fourth row with 'family'.

14. The analyst is on the left of the firefighter. Since the analyst is in the third row and the firefighter is in the third column, the analyst must be in the second column.

Here is the final solution table:

In this table, the rows represent the jobs, and the columns represent the movie genres. The intersections of the rows and columns represent the favorite beverages."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-3x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the project-manager is to the right of the owner of the ferret. Let's place the project-manager (PM) and the ferret owner (F) in the table. Since the project-manager can't be on the far left (rule 4), we can place the PM in the second column and the F in the first column.

|     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Job |    | PM |    |    |    |    |    |
| Pet | F  |    |    |    |    |    |    |
| Sport|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

2. The owner of the lizard (L) is between the electrician (E) and the owner of the guinea-pig (GP). Since the PM is already in the second column, the L can't be in the first column. Let's place the L in the third column and the GP in the fourth column.

|     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Job |    | PM | L  | GP|    |    |    |
| Pet | F  |    |    |    |    |    |    |
| Sport|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

3. The person who's sport is golf (G) is on the left of the writer (W) and on the left of the owner of the lizard (L). Since the PM and L are already placed, we can place the G in the first column and the W in the second column.

|     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Job | G  | W  | L  | GP|    |    |    |

| Sport|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

4. The dressmaker (D) is on the right of the writer (W) and between the person who's sport is cricket (C) and the owner of the lizard (L). Since the W is already in the second column, we can place the D in the third column and the C in the first column.

|     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Job | C  | D  | W  | L  | GP|    |    |

| Sport|    |    |    |    |    |    |    |

5. The owner of the pony (P) is on the far left (rule 4), so we've already placed it. The sport of the P is surfing (rule 13).

| Pet | F  |    |    |    |    | P  |    |
| Sport| S  |    |    |    |    | T  |    |

6. The owner of the bird (B) is on the right of the owner of the ferret (rule 8). Since the F is in the first column, we can place the B in the second column.

|     | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4 | 5  | 6  | 7  |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Job | C  | B  | D  | W  | L  | GP| P  |

| Sport| S  | T  |    |    |    |    |    |

7. The owner of the guinea-pig (GP) is on the left of the chef (C). Since the C is already in the first column, we can place the GP in the sixth column.

9. The person who's sport is handball (H) is on the right of the chef (C) and on the right of the owner of the bird (B). Since the C and B are already in the first and second columns, we can place the H in the third column.

12. The tennis player (T) is on the right of the owner of the pony (P). Since the P is already in the sixth column, we can place the T in the seventh column.
