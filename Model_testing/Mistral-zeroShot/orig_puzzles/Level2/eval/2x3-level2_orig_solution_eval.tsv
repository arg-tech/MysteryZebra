Lv2-2x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different beverages and three different music genres. Let's assign the beverages to the rows and the genres to the columns.

   |               |    1     |    2     |   3   |
   | Beverage      | Juice    | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    | Folk     | Pop    |

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of folk is drinking Lemonade. So, let's mark that:

   |               |    1     |    2     |   3   |
   | Beverage      | Juice    | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    | Folk     | Pop    |
   |              | ------ | ------- | ------- |
   | Position      | 1      | 2       | 3      |

3. Now, the person drinking soy-milk is between the fan of pop and the person drinking lemonade. Since the fan of folk is the person drinking lemonade, the person drinking soy-milk must be either 1 (left of lemonade) or 3 (right of lemonade but left of pop). However, if it were 1, it would mean that the fan of pop is drinking juice, which contradicts the fact that there are three different beverages. So, the person drinking soy-milk must be 3.

   |               |    1     |    2     |   3   |
   | Beverage      | Juice    | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    | Folk     | Pop    |
   | Position      | 1      | 2       | 3      |
   | Assignments   | Juice   | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |

4. Finally, the person drinking juice is on the right of the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco is in position 1, the person drinking juice must be in position 3.

   |               |    1     |    2     |   3   |
   | Beverage      | Juice    | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |
   | Music-Genre   | Disco    | Folk     | Pop    |
   | Position      | 1      | 2       | 3      |
   | Assignments   | Juice   | Lemonade | Soy-Milk |
   |              | ------ | ------- | ------- |
   | Final Solution | Soy-Milk | Lemonade | Juice   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############

Lv2-2x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies and 3 different jobs, we can assign each hobby to one of the columns and each job to one of the rows. Let's start by assigning the hobbies:

   | Hobby   | Drawing | Rock-climbing | Sudoku  |
   |---------|---------|--------------|--------|

2. Now let's assign the jobs. From the second rule, we know that the social-worker is between the coach and the person who's hobby is drawing. So, the jobs must be arranged as follows:

   | Job     | Coach   | Social-worker | Dressmaker |
   |---------|---------|--------------|-----------|

3. Now we know that the person with the hobby of drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means that the hobbies must be arranged as follows:

   | Hobby   | Drawing | Rock-climbing | Sudoku  |
   |---------|---------|--------------|--------|
   | Job     | Coach   | Social-worker | Dressmaker |
   |         | Drawing1 |             |         |
   |         |         | Rock-climbing2 |       |
   |         |         |              | Sudoku3 |

4. To fill in the missing hobbies, we know that the hobbies are different, so we can assign them as Drawing1, Rock-climbing2, and Sudoku3.

   | Hobby   | Drawing | Rock-climbing | Sudoku  |
   |---------|---------|--------------|--------|
   | Job     | Coach   | Social-worker | Dressmaker |
   |         | Drawing1 | Rock-climbing2 | Sudoku3 |

5. Now we have the final solution:

   | Hobby   | Drawing1 | Rock-climbing2 | Sudoku3 |
   |---------|---------|--------------|--------|
   | Job     | Coach   | Social-worker | Dressmaker |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-2x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the dog is on the right of the person drinking cola. This means that the owner of the dog cannot be in the first column (since the owner of the dog must be to the right of the cola drinker). So, the owner of the dog must be in the second or third column.

2. The person drinking cola is between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking tea. This means that the cola drinker cannot be in the first column (since the cola drinker must be to the right of the ferret owner and left of the tea drinker). So, the cola drinker must be in the second or third row.

3. Since the cola drinker cannot be in the first column and the first row, the cola drinker must be in the second row and second or third column.

4. Now, let's place the cola drinker. Since the owner of the dog is to the right of the cola drinker, the cola drinker cannot be in the third column (since the third column is occupied by the owner of the dog). So, the cola drinker must be in the second column of the second row.

5. Now we know that the cola drinker is in the second column of the second row. Since the cola drinker is to the left of the tea drinker, the tea drinker must be in the third column.

6. The owner of the ferret must be to the left of the cola drinker. Since the cola drinker is in the second column of the second row, the ferret owner must be in the first column of the second row.

7. The owner of the dog is to the right of the cola drinker. Since the cola drinker is in the second column of the second row, the owner of the dog must be in the third column of the second row.

8. The only pet left is the goldfish, which must be in the first column of the third row.

9. The last beverage is mirinda, which must be in the first column of the first row (since all other positions are occupied).

10. The last beverage is tea, which must be in the third column of the third row (since all other positions are occupied).

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv2-2x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of funk is the owner of the bird, so we can fill in the first row and first column as follows:

   | Music-Genre | Funk |
   |------------|-----|
   | Pet        | Bird |

2. Since the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the bird, the goldfish cannot be in the last column. So, the goldfish can only be in the first or second column.

3. If the goldfish were in the first column, it would mean that the owner of the goldfish is the same as the owner of the bird, which contradicts the fact that they are different pets. So, the goldfish cannot be in the first column.

4. Therefore, the goldfish must be in the second column, and the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the bird, which means the fish must be in the first column.

5. Now we know that the fish is in the first column and the goldfish is in the second column. The owner of the fish is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the bird. Since the goldfish is in the second column, the owner of the fish must be in the first column (row 1).

6. The only music genre left is r&b, so the owner of the r&b music must be in the third column (row 3) and the pet of the r&b fan must be the remaining pet, which is the bird (row 3, column 3).

7. Finally, we can confirm that the soul fan must be in the second row (row 2) and the pet of the soul fan must be the fish (row 2, column 1).

The final solution table is:

   | Music-Genre | Funk   | R&B     | Soul   |

Lv2-2x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking, and the hobbies are different, we can place 'sudoku' in the first column and 'cooking' in the second column. Let's assume 'sudoku' is in the first row and 'cooking' in the second row for now.

   | Hobby   | 1   | 2   |
   | Pet     |    |    |
   |         | sudoku | cooking |

2. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the hobbies are different, the goat cannot be in the first row. Let's place the goat in the third row.

   | Hobby   | 1   | 2   |
   | Pet     |    |    |
   |         | sudoku | cooking |
   |         |       | goat   |

3. The owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the fish. Since the chinchilla cannot be in the first row (as it is not the goat), it cannot be in the second row either (as it is not the fish). So, the chinchilla must be in the third row.

   | Hobby   | 1   | 2   |
   | Pet     |    |    |
   |         | sudoku | cooking |

4. Now, we have only one pet left, the fish. Since it cannot be in the first row (as it is not the goat or the chinchilla), it must be in the first row.

   | Hobby   | 1   | 2   |
   | Pet     | fish |    |

Lv2-2x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three nationalities (Dutch, Egyptian, Indian) and three sports (Basketball, Rowing, Weightlifting).

2. From the first rule, we know that the person who prefers Basketball is between the Indian and the Dutch. This means that either Basketball is in the 1st or 3rd column and not in the 2nd column. Also, the Dutch cannot be in the 1st column because they are not the first person (Rowing is the sport of the first person, and the Dutch prefers Rowing). So, the Dutch must be in the 3rd column.

3. Now, we know that the Dutch prefers Rowing, so Rowing must be in the 3rd row.

4. Since the Dutch is in the 3rd column and prefers Rowing, the Basketball player must be in the 1st column.

5. The Egyptian cannot be in the 1st column because the Basketball player is there, and the Egyptian is not an adjacent neighbor to the Dutch (Egyptian is on the right of the Dutch). So, the Egyptian must be in the 2nd column.

6. The only sport left for the Egyptian is Weightlifting, so Weightlifting must be in the 2nd row.

7. Finally, the Indian must prefer Basketball, which is in the 1st column, so Basketball must be in the 1st row.

Lv2-2x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three types of food and three nationalities, so we can create a 3x3 table with each row representing a person and each column representing a food or nationality.

   |               |    1    |     2     |     3     |
   | Food          | Broccoli | Carrot   | Pineapple |
   | Nationality   |         |          |           |

2. Since the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating broccoli, we can fill the second column with carrot and the third column with pineapple.

   |               |    1    |     2     |     3     |
   | Food          | Broccoli | Carrot   | Pineapple |
   | Nationality   |         |          |           |

3. Now, the brazilian is between the person eating pineapple and the chinese. This means the brazilian cannot be in the first or third row (since there's no one to the left of the pineapple eater), and the chinese cannot be in the second row (since the brazilian must be to the left of the chinese).

   | Food          | Broccoli | Carrot   | Pineapple |
   | Nationality   | Dutch   | Brazil   | Chinese   |

4. Now we have filled the nationality column. To complete the food column, we know that the broccoli eater cannot be the Dutch (since the brazilian is to the left of the pineapple eater), so the broccoli eater must be the chinese.

Lv2-2x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are three different movie genres (comedy, satire, western) and three different nationalities (Brazilian, British, Mexican).

2. The Mexican watches satire movies, so we can place the Mexican in the second column and the satire genre in the second row. Let's mark it as follows:

   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy   | Satire | Western |
   | Nationality   | Brazil   | Mex    | Brit    |

3. The British is between the person watching satire movies and the person watching western movies. Since the Mexican is watching satire, the British cannot be in the first row (as there is no one to his left). Also, the British cannot be in the third row (as there is no one to his right). So, the British must be in the second row.

   | Movie-Genre   | Comedy   | Satire | Western |

4. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the Mexican is watching satire, the Brazilian must be watching comedy.

Lv2-2x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different sports (ice-hockey, swimming, weightlifting) and three different means of transport (bus, quad-bike, snowmobile).

2. From the first condition, the person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. This means that Swimming cannot be in the first column, so it must be in the second or third column.

3. Since there are only three sports and they are different, Ice-hockey and Weightlifting must be in the first and third columns respectively, as they are the only two left.

4. Now, let's consider the second condition: the person driving the bus is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike. This means that the bus cannot be in the first row (as it would be before weightlifting) or the third row (as it would be after the quad-bike). So, the bus must be in the second row.

5. Now we know that the bus is in the second row and to its left is swimming, so swimming must be in the second column.

6. Finally, the quad-bike must be in the third row, as it is after the bus and before weightlifting.

Lv2-2x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three jobs (fisherman, lawyer, social-worker) and three means of transport (car, motorbike, quad-bike), we can assign each job to each transport in 3! (3 factorial) = 6 ways. However, we have two constraints:

2. The person driving the car is on the right of the social-worker. This means that the social-worker cannot be in the first position (as there is no one to the left) and cannot be in the third position (as the car is on the right). So, the social-worker must be in the second position.

3. The lawyer is between the person driving the quad-bike and the fisherman. This means that the lawyer cannot be in the first position (as there is no one to the left of him), cannot be in the third position (as the fisherman is in the third position), and cannot be in the second position (as the social-worker is already there). So, the lawyer must be in the first position.

4. Now we know that the lawyer is driving a quad-bike, so the fisherman cannot be driving a quad-bike (as the lawyer is between him and the social-worker). The fisherman also cannot drive a car (as the social-worker is driving a car). So, the fisherman must drive a motorbike.

5. Finally, the person left (the social-worker) must drive a car.
