Lv2-1x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fans of the 4 different music-genres are arranged in a row, and there are no repeats. So, we can start by placing the fan of hip-hop on the far left (position 1).

   |  1  |  2   |  3   |   4   |
   |-----|------|------|-------|
   | hip-hop |     |     |       |

2. Since the fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal, and the fan of hip-hop is on the far left, the fan of jazz must be in position 2.

   |  1  |  2  |  3   |   4   |
   |-----|-----|------|-------|
   | hip-hop | jazz |     |       |

3. Now, the fan of metal is to the right of the fan of jazz, but not in the last position because the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of metal (according to the puzzle's statement 1). So, the fan of metal must be in position 3.

   |  1  |  2  |  3  |   4   |
   |-----|-----|-----|-------|
   | hip-hop | jazz | metal|       |

4. Finally, according to the puzzle's statement 1, the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of metal and to the right of the fan of jazz (who is already in position 2). So, the fan of soul must be in position 4.

   |  1  |  2  |  3  |  4   |
   |-----|-----|-----|------|
   | hip-hop | jazz | metal| soul |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4   |
|-----|-----|-----|------|
| hip-hop | jazz | metal| soul |

Lv2-1x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that Mirinda is to the right of Hot-Chocolate and to the left of Cola. So, Mirinda can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. If Mirinda was in position 2, then Cola would have to be in position 1 (since Iced-Tea is to the right of Cola). But this would mean there's no place for Hot-Chocolate, as it needs to be to the left of Mirinda. So, Mirinda can't be in position 2.

3. If Mirinda was in position 3, then Hot-Chocolate would have to be in position 1 and Cola in position 4. This satisfies all conditions. So, the arrangement in this case would be:

   |            |       1       |    2    |  3   |    4     |
   | Beverage   | hot-chocolate | iced-tea | mirinda | cola |

4. If Mirinda was in position 4, then Hot-Chocolate would have to be in position 1 and Cola in position 2. But this would mean Iced-Tea has no place to the right, which contradicts the given conditions. So, Mirinda can't be in position 4.

Therefore, the final solution is:

#############
|            |       1       |    2    |  3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | hot-chocolate | iced-tea | mirinda | cola |

Lv2-1x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the bird is on the far left, so the first row must be ""Bird"".
2. The owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle. Since the bird is on the far left, the only possible positions for the pony are the second or third row. However, if the pony were in the second row, there would be no room for the turtle to the right, violating the first condition. So, the pony must be in the third row, and the second row must be ""Ferret"".
3. Now, the only remaining pet for the second row is the turtle, as the pony and bird are already placed. This violates the first condition, as the turtle would be on the left of the bird, not the right.

There seems to be a contradiction in the given conditions, and it's not possible to arrange the pets according to the given rules.

However, if we make a slight adjustment to the first condition to say that the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the bird but not necessarily the immediate right, then the puzzle can be solved:

|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Ferret| Pony | Turtle |

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions. The owner of the bird is on the far left (1st row), the owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle (2nd and 3rd rows), and the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the bird (3rd row).

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Ferret| Pony | Turtle |
#############"	{'pet': ['bird', 'ferret', 'pony', 'turtle']}	True	2	False
Lv2-1x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating nectarine. So, strawberry cannot be in position 1 or 2.

2. Since strawberry is not in position 1 or 2, and the person eating papaya is between the person eating nectarine and the person eating asparagus (rule 1), papaya cannot be in position 4.

3. Now, if papaya is in position 3, then asparagus would have to be in position 1 and nectarine in position 2, which would mean strawberry is in position 4, but we already know that's not possible. So, papaya cannot be in position 3.

4. If papaya is in position 2, then asparagus would have to be in position 4 and nectarine in position 3. This would mean strawberry is in position 1, which is possible. So, the arrangement could be:

   |        |      Strawberry   |      Nectarine     |    Asparagus    |      Papaya     |
   | Food   |            |           |        |           |

5. However, if papaya is in position 1, then asparagus would have to be in position 3 and nectarine in position 2. This would mean strawberry is in position 4, which is also possible. So, another arrangement could be:

   |        |      Strawberry     |      Asparagus     |    Nectarine    |      Papaya     |
   | Food   |            |           |        |           |

6. Since both arrangements are possible with the given rules, we cannot definitively determine the exact order. However, we can say that the final solution table is one of the following:

   |        |      Strawberry   |      Nectarine     |    Asparagus    |      Papaya     |
   | Food   |            |           |        |           |
   |        |      Strawberry     |      Asparagus     |    Nectarine    |      Papaya     |

So, the final solution table is:

#############

Lv2-1x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating broccoli is on the far left, it must be in the first column (column 1).
2. Now we know that the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating carrot. So, the carrot must be in column 2 or column 3.
3. If the carrot were in column 2, then the onion would have to be in column 3 because the person eating onion is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating carrot. But this would mean that the raspberry would have to be in column 4, which contradicts the fact that the person eating onion is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating carrot (since onion is in column 3 and raspberry is in column 4).
4. Therefore, the carrot must be in column 3.
5. Now we know that the person eating onion is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating carrot. Since the carrot is in column 3, the onion must be in column 2 (to the left of carrot) and the raspberry must be in column 4 (to the right of carrot).

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Broccoli  |   |
|          | Carrot |
| Onion    |   |

Lv2-1x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fisherman is on the far right (column 4), we know that the jobs in columns 1, 2, and 3 must be different from fisherman. So, the jobs in columns 1, 2, and 3 are accountant, engineer, and lawyer (in any order).

2. Now, let's consider the condition that the lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman. Since the fisherman is on the far right, the lawyer cannot be in column 4. Also, the lawyer cannot be in column 1 because the lawyer cannot be before the engineer (as per the condition). So, the lawyer must be in column 2.

3. Now we know the lawyer is in column 2, so the engineer must be in column 1 and the fisherman in column 3.

The final solution table is:

|       |     1      |    2     |   3    |     4     |
| Job   | accountant | lawyer   | fisherman | engineer |

So, the final solution is:

Lv2-1x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking juice is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking fanta. This means that the order cannot be: Lemonade, Juice, Fanta, Soy-Milk or Lemonade, Soy-Milk, Juice, Fanta. So, the possible orders are: Fanta, Lemonade, Juice, Soy-Milk or Juice, Lemonade, Fanta, Soy-Milk.

2. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking fanta. This means that the order cannot be: Fanta, Lemonade, Juice, Soy-Milk. So, the possible order is: Juice, Lemonade, Fanta, Soy-Milk.

3. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking juice##2. This means that the order cannot be: Juice, Lemonade, Fanta, Soy-Milk. So, the possible order is: Juice, Fanta, Lemonade, Soy-Milk.

Now, let's put the beverages in the table:

Lv2-1x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the airplane is on the far left, we can fill the first column with 'Airplane'.

| Transport   | Airplane |     |     |
|------------|----------|-----|-----|

2. Now, we know that the person driving the scooter is between the airplane and the subway. Since the airplane is on the far left, the scooter must be in the second position.

| Transport   | Airplane | Scooter |     |
|------------|----------|---------|-----|

3. The only remaining transport is the quad-bike. Since there are only 4 different means of transport and we have filled 3 of them, the quad-bike must be in the third position.

| Transport   | Airplane | Scooter | Quad-bike |
|------------|----------|---------|----------|

4. The last position is for the subway. Since all other means of transport are filled, the subway must be in the fourth position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-1x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching time-travel movies is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Let's place time-travel in the first position and fantasy in the second position. So, the first two columns are filled: `| Time-Travel | Fantasy |`

2. The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies. Since we already placed time-travel and fantasy, we know that comedy must be on the left of fantasy and disaster on the right of fantasy. So, the third column is filled: `| Time-Travel | Fantasy | Comedy |`

3. Now, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since comedy is already in the third position, disaster must be in the fourth position. So, the final table is: `############# | Time-Travel | Fantasy | Comedy | Disaster |`

Lv2-1x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the volleyball player is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column:

|         | Volleyball |     |        |    |
| Sport   |           |     |        |    |

2. Since the parkour player is between the weightlifting player and the volleyball player, we can place parkour in the second column and weightlifting in the third column:

|         | Volleyball | Parkour | Weightlifting |    |
| Sport   |           |        |              |    |

3. Now, we have only skiing left. Since there are four different sports and we have filled three columns, skiing must be in the fourth column:

|         | Volleyball | Parkour | Weightlifting | Skiing |
| Sport   |           |        |              |        |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|         | Volleyball | Parkour | Weightlifting | Skiing |
| Sport   |           |        |              |        |
