Lv2-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different nationalities, so each nationality will be in a different row. Let's place them horizontally from left to right: Canadian, Colombian, Indonesian, Polish.

2. We know that the Colombian is the fan of techno, so we can place Techno in the second music-genre column under the Colombian row.

3. The Indonesian is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person watching mystery movies. Since we don't know their exact positions yet, let's assume the Indonesian is watching fantasy movies for now. This means the person watching mystery movies is to the right of the Indonesian. So, we can place Mystery in the fourth movie-genre column under the Indonesian row.

4. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since the bus driver is the Colombian (from point 3), the trike driver must be the Canadian or the Indonesian. However, the Canadian is on the far right (from point 8), so the trike driver must be the Indonesian. This means the Indonesian is driving the trike. So, we can place Trike in the fourth transport column under the Indonesian row.

5. Now, the Canadian is on the far right, so we can place Bus in the first transport column under the Canadian row.

6. The person driving the tram is the person watching fantasy movies (from point 6). Since we know the Indonesian is watching mystery movies and the Canadian is driving the bus, the only remaining person watching fantasy movies is the Polish. So, we can place Tram in the third transport column under the Polish row.

7. The fan of metal is on the left of the canadian (from point 5). Since the Canadian is in the first row, the fan of metal must be in the first column. However, we already have Techno in the second music-genre column under the Colombian row, so Metal must be in the first music-genre column.

8. The person watching comedy movies is on the far left (from point 9). Since we know the fan of metal is on the left of the Canadian, the person watching comedy movies must be in the first column and above the Canadian row. Since the only empty row is the first row, the person watching comedy movies must be in the first row. So, we can place Comedy in the first movie-genre column.

9. The fan of r&b is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (from point 7). Since the person watching mystery movies is in the fourth column, the fan of r&b must be in the second column. However, we already have Techno in the second music-genre column under the Colombian row, so R&B must be in the third music-genre column.

10. Finally, we have filled all the cells, so the final solution table is:

```
|               | Comedy  | R&B     | Salsa   | Techno  |
| Movie-Genre   |        |         |         |         |
| Music-Genre   | Metal   |         |         |         |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Colombian| Indonesian| Polish  |
| Transport     | Bus    |         | Trike    | Tram    |
```

However, we didn't place Salsa, Fantasy, and Jet-ski yet. Since we don't have enough information to determine their exact positions, we can't fill these cells. So, the final solution table with the unknown cells is:

```
#############
|               | Comedy  | R&B     | Salsa   | Techno  |
| Movie-Genre   |        |         |         |         |
| Music-Genre   | Metal   |         |         |         |
| Nationality   | Canadian| Colombian| Indonesian| Polish  |
| Transport     | Bus    |         | Trike    | Tram    |
#############
```

This table represents the final solution with the unknown cells marked by '...' to indicate that we don't have enough information to fill these cells."	{'movie-genre': ['', '', '', ''], 'music-genre': ['metal', '', '', ''], 'nationality': ['canadian', 'colombian', 'indonesian', 'polish'], 'transport': ['bus', '', 'trike', 'tram']}	True	3	False

Lv2-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the paramedic drives the motorbike, so we can place the paramedic in the third row and third column (P3). Since the motorbike is on the left of the pilot, the pilot must be in the fourth row and third column (P4).

2. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, so the helicopter driver must be in the fourth row and second column (H2).

3. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the motorbike, so the roller driver must be in the third row and second column (R2).

4. The person eating lemon is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography, so the photography hobby must be in the second row (H2). This means the photographer is in the second row and first column (H1).

5. The lawyer is the person who's hobby is traveling, so the traveling hobby must be in the fourth column (T4). This means the lawyer is in the fourth row and first column (L4).

6. The person eating mango is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography, so the mango eater must be in the second row and fourth column (M2).

7. The person eating artichoke is between the person who's hobby is camping and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we know the traveling hobby is in the fourth column (T4), and the artichoke eater must be to the left of the traveling hobby, the artichoke eater must be in the second column (A2). The only hobby left for the person in the second column is camping (C2).

8. The person who's hobby is camping is in the second row and second column (C2). This means the food for the person who's hobby is camping is artichoke (A2).

9. The person who's hobby is photography is between the person eating lemon and the lawyer. Since we know the photographer is in the second row and first column (H1), and the lawyer is in the fourth row and first column (L4), the only food left for the person in the first column is blueberry (B1).

Final solution table:

Lv2-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching disaster movies is on the far right, so let's place them in the rightmost column (column 4). Since they are a police officer (from rule 7), we can fill the fourth row with ""Police-Officer"".

2. The person watching scientific movies is the fisherman (from rule 2), so we can place the fisherman in the second column (column 2) and fill the second row with ""Fisherman"". Since they own a frog (from rule 5), we can place the frog in the second cell of the second row.

3. The owner of the bird is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball (from rule 3). Since the person watching disaster movies (police officer) is on the far right, the person with volleyball must be on the left of them. So, let's place volleyball in the first cell of the fourth row. Since the owner of the bird must be to the right of volleyball (from rule 3), we can place the bird in the third cell of the fourth row.

4. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching scientific movies (from rule 8). Since the fisherman (scientific movies) is in the second column, the action movie person must be in the third column. However, we don't know their job yet, so we can't fill the third row yet.

5. The person watching action movies cannot be the mechanic because the mechanic must be between the owner of the bird and the teacher (from rule 10). So, the action movie person cannot be in the first or third column. Therefore, they must be in the second column, but that's where the fisherman (scientific movies) is. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

Assuming there's an error in the puzzle, let's continue with the given information:

6. The person watching action movies cannot be in the second row because the fisherman (scientific movies) is already there (from rule 2). So, the action movie person must be in the first, third, or fourth row.

7. The person watching action movies cannot be in the fourth row because the police officer (disaster movies) is already there (from rule 7). So, the action movie person must be in the first or third row.

8. The person watching action movies cannot be in the first row because the mechanic must be between the owner of the bird and the teacher (from rule 10), and the bird and teacher haven't been placed yet. So, the action movie person must be in the third row.

9. The mechanic must be in the first or third column because they must be between the owner of the bird and the teacher (from rule 10). Since the bird is in the fourth column, the mechanic cannot be in the fourth column. So, the mechanic must be in the first column.

10. The teacher must be in the third column because the mechanic is in the first column and the teacher must be to the right of the mechanic (from rule 10).

11. The sport of the person in the first row (the mechanic) cannot be volleyball because the owner of the bird is to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the bird is in the fourth column. So, the mechanic's sport cannot be volleyball.

12. The sport of the person in the first row (the mechanic) cannot be ice-hockey because the owner of the pony is to the right of the person with ice-hockey (from rule 6), and the pony is in the fourth column. So, the mechanic's sport cannot be ice-hockey.

13. The sport of the person in the first row (the mechanic) cannot be soccer because the person with soccer must be to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the person with volleyball is in the first row. So, the mechanic's sport cannot be soccer.

14. The sport of the person in the first row (the mechanic) must be rugby because the fisherman (scientific movies) is to the left of the person with rugby (from rule 9), and the only remaining sport for the fisherman is rugby.

15. The sport of the person in the third row (the action movie person) cannot be volleyball because the owner of the bird is to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the bird is in the fourth column. So, the action movie person's sport cannot be volleyball.

16. The sport of the person in the third row (the action movie person) cannot be ice-hockey because the owner of the pony is to the right of the person with ice-hockey (from rule 6), and the pony is in the fourth column. So, the action movie person's sport cannot be ice-hockey.

17. The sport of the person in the third row (the action movie person) cannot be soccer because the person with soccer must be to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the person with volleyball is in the first row. So, the action movie person's sport cannot be soccer.

18. The sport of the person in the third row (the action movie person) must be rugby because the only remaining sport for the action movie person is rugby, and the fisherman (who is the only one left to be placed) cannot have rugby (from rule 9).

19. The sport of the person in the fourth row (the police officer) cannot be volleyball because the owner of the bird is to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the bird is in the fourth column. So, the police officer's sport cannot be volleyball.

20. The sport of the person in the fourth row (the police officer) cannot be ice-hockey because the owner of the pony is to the right of the person with ice-hockey (from rule 6), and the pony is in the fourth column. So, the police officer's sport cannot be ice-hockey.

21. The sport of the person in the fourth row (the police officer) cannot be soccer because the person with soccer must be to the right of the person with volleyball (from rule 3), and the person with volleyball is in the first row. So, the police officer's sport cannot be soccer.

22. The sport of the person in the fourth row (the police officer) must be rugby because the only remaining sport for the police officer is rugby, and the only remaining job for the police officer is rugby (from rule 7).

Now, let's fill the final solution table:

|               |     1      |    2    |      3       |       4        |

| Movie-Genre   |            | Scientific| Action          | Disaster       |
| Pet           | Bird       | Frog     |                |                |
| Sport         | Rugby      |         | Rugby           | Rugby          |

Since we don't have enough information to determine the pets for the action movie person and the police officer, we can't fill those cells. However, we can be sure that the action movie person and the police officer don't have birds or frogs because those pets are already assigned to the mechanic and the fisherman, respectively. The remaining pets (hamster and pony) can be assigned to the action movie person and the police officer, but we don't have enough information to determine which one gets which pet.

So, the final solution table with the unknown pets is:

Lv2-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the security-guard is eating garlic and is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing, we can place the security-guard in the first column (1) and the sailor in the fourth column (4).

3. The social-worker is on the left of the person eating asparagus, so the social-worker is in the first column (1) and the asparagus eater is in the third column (3).

4. The lawyer is watching epic movies, so the lawyer must be in the second column (2) since the first column (1) is occupied by the social-worker.

   |               |       1        |       2       |       3       |     4      |

5. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person eating peach, so the scientific movie watcher is in the first column (1) and the peach eater is in the fourth column (4).

6. The person watching adventure movies is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person eating lemon. Since the lemon eater is in the second column (2), the person watching adventure movies must be in the third column (3).

9. The person eating asparagus is on the left of the person eating peach, so the asparagus eater is in the first column (1) and the peach eater is in the fourth column (4). However, this contradicts our previous placement of the social-worker in the first column (1). Since we cannot have two people in the same column, we must swap the positions of asparagus and peach.

10. The person watching adventure movies is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person eating lemon. Since the lemon eater is in the second column (2), the person watching adventure movies must be in the third column (3).

Since we cannot have two people in the same column, we must swap the positions of social-worker and adventure movies.

Lv2-4x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 9, we know that the fan of funk is on the far left. Let's place it in the first column.

|     4 |            |            |               |

2. From point 2, we know that the freelancer is between the fan of folk and the Turkish. Since the fan of funk is already in the first column, the freelancer must be in the second column.

| Job   | Music-Genre | Nationality | Sport         |

3. From point 1, we know that the fan of folk is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of jazz. Since the fan of funk is in the second column, the fan of folk must be in the third column.

6. From point 3, we know that the Polish is between the person who's sport is cricket and the Dutch. Since the Dutch cannot be in the fourth column (because the nationalities are different), the Polish must be in the fourth column.

7. From point 6, we know that the Dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the sport of the person in the third row is already decided (sailing), the sport of the person in the second row (freelancer) must be cycling.

8. From point 6, we know that the Dutch is on the left of the analyst. Since the Dutch is already in the second row, the analyst must be in the first row.

Lv2-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so each row represents a person.

2. We know the movie genres, music genres, nationalities, and transport methods are all different for each person.

3. From point 10, we know the Dutch is driving the train. So, the Nationality in row 3 is ""British"" (since there are only 4 nationalities), and the Transport in row 3 is ""Train"".

4. From point 1, we know the person watching fantasy movies is Dutch. So, the Movie-Genre in row 3 is ""Fantasy"".

5. From point 3, we know the fan of dubstep is between the Dutch and the person driving the subway. Since the Dutch is in row 3, the fan of dubstep must be in row 2 or 4. If it were in row 2, the Transport in row 2 would have to be ""Train"" (since the Dutch is in row 3 and the train driver can't be in two places at once), but that would violate point 1 (different transport methods). So, the fan of dubstep is in row 4. Therefore, the Music-Genre in row 4 is ""Dubstep"".

6. From point 9, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the fantasy watcher is in row 3, the time-travel watcher must be in row 1 or 2. If it were in row 1, the Movie-Genre in row 1 would have to be ""Time-travel"" (since the fantasy watcher is in row 3 and can't be on both the left and right of the time-travel watcher), but that would violate point 1 (different movie genres). So, the time-travel watcher is in row 2. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in row 1 is ""Family"".

7. From point 6, we know the person watching time-travel movies is in row 2. Since the fan of dubstep is in row 4, the person watching fantasy movies is in row 3, and they are not on the same side, the person watching time-travel movies must be on the left. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in row 2 is ""Time-travel"".

8. From point 4, we know the fan of metal is the person driving the train (since there are only 4 music genres). So, the Music-Genre in row 3 is ""Metal"".

9. From point 5, we know the russian is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the Dutch is in row 3 and the fan of metal is in row 3, the person watching zombie movies must be in row 1 or 2. If it were in row 1, the Nationality in row 1 would have to be ""Russian"" (since the Dutch is in row 3 and the russian is on the left), but that would violate point 1 (different nationalities). So, the person watching zombie movies is in row 2. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in row 1 is ""Zombie"".

10. From point 8, we know the fan of soul is on the far right. Since the person watching zombie movies is in row 2, the fan of soul must be in row 4. Therefore, the Music-Genre in row 4 is ""Soul"".

11. From point 7, we know the person watching family movies is in row 1. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in row 3, the person watching time-travel movies is in row 2, and they are not on the same side, the person watching family movies must be on the left. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in row 1 is ""Family"".

12. From point 6, we know the person watching time-travel movies is in row 2. Since the person watching family movies is in row 1, the person watching time-travel movies must be on the right. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in row 2 is ""Time-travel"".

13. From point 1, we know there are 4 different nationalities. Since the Dutch is in row 3, the Argentine must be in row 1 (since the Russian is in row 2 and the russian is on the left of the person watching zombie movies). Therefore, the Nationality in row 1 is ""Argentine"".

14. From point 7, we know the argentine is the person driving the airplane. Therefore, the Transport in row 1 is ""Airplane"".

15. From point 8, we know the fan of soul is on the far right. Since the person watching zombie movies is in row 2, the fan of soul must be in row 4. Since the Dutch is in row 3, the British must be in row 1 (since there are only 4 nationalities). Therefore, the Nationality in row 4 is ""British"".

16. From point 14, we know the British is the person driving the subway. Therefore, the Transport in row 4 is ""Subway"".

17. From point 15, we know the Dutch is not the person driving the subway (since the Dutch is the train driver). Since the British is the subway driver, the Dutch must be the person driving the bike. Therefore, the Transport in row 3 is ""Bike"".

The final solution table is:

Lv2-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching drama movies is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the car. Let's place them in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the quad-bike driver is on the left of the water drinker (point 2), the water drinker must be in position 1 or 5. If the drama watcher was in position 2, the car driver would have to be in position 4, but that would violate point 4 because the juice drinker would be on the left of the car driver. So, the drama watcher is in position 3, the car driver is in position 4, and the quad-bike driver is in position 2.

2. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person drinking water, so the water drinker is in position 1.

3. The owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the cat owner is the person driving the car (from point 1), the horse owner must be in position 5, 6, or 7. If the horse owner was in position 5, the quad-bike driver would be in position 3, but that would violate point 2. So, the horse owner is in position 6. The cat owner is in position 4.

4. The person driving the car is on the left of the person drinking juice, so the juice drinker is in position 5.

5. The person driving the jet-ski is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person watching documentary movies. Since the quad-bike driver is in position 2 and the documentary watcher is in position 1 (from point 6), the jet-ski driver must be in position 3.

6. The person drinking lemonade is the person watching zombie movies. Since the water drinker is in position 1, the lemonade drinker must be in position 7.

7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking juice, so the iced-tea drinker is in position 5.

8. The person drinking water is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the water drinker is in position 1, the frog owner must be in position 2.

Lv2-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating lettuce is the fisherman. Let's place the fisherman in the 3rd row and any column (let's say column 1 for now). So, Fisherman = (3, 1).

2. The person eating tomato is the person who's sport is parkour. Since we don't know the position of parkour yet, we can't place the tomato eater yet.

3. The fisherman's sport is handball. Since we know the fisherman's position, we can place handball in the 3rd row, but we don't know the column yet.

4. The person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating tomato. Since we don't know the position of the tomato eater yet, we can't place the spinach eater yet.

5. The person eating grapefruit is the fan of metal. We don't have any information about grapefruit yet, so we can't place the metal fan yet.

6. The fan of indie is on the far left. Since we don't have any information about indie yet, we can't place the indie fan yet.

7. The designer is on the left of the fisherman. Since we know the position of the fisherman, we can place the designer in the 2nd row and any column to the left of (3, 1). Let's say (2, 2) for now.

8. The fan of house is on the far right. Since we don't have any information about house yet, we can't place the house fan yet.

9. The accountant is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is cycling. Since we don't know the positions of the social-worker, accountant, or the person who's sport is cycling yet, we can't place the accountant yet.

10. The person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating spinach. Since we know the position of the spinach eater (it's to the right of the tomato eater), we can place the tomato eater in the 4th column and any row below the 3rd row (since the fisherman is in the 3rd row). Let's say (4, 4) for now.

Now let's try to solve the remaining information:

11. Since the tomato eater is the parkour player, we can place parkour in the 4th row and 4th column.

12. Since the spinach eater is to the right of the tomato eater, we can place spinach in the 4th row and 3rd column.

13. Since the designer is to the left of the fisherman, we can place the designer in the 2nd row and 1st column.

14. Since the accountant is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is cycling, and the social-worker can't be in the 2nd row (since the designer is there), the accountant must be in the 2nd row. Since the person who's sport is cycling can't be in the 4th row (since parkour is there), the person who's sport is cycling must be in the 1st row. So, the accountant can be in the 2nd row and 2nd column, and the person who's sport is cycling can be in the 1st row and 1st column.

15. Since the fan of indie is on the far left, we can place indie in the 1st row and 2nd column.

16. Since the fan of house is on the far right, we can place house in the 4th row and 2nd column.

17. Since the person eating grapefruit is the fan of metal, we can place grapefruit in the 3rd row and 2nd column.

Now let's place the sports:

18. Since the fisherman's sport is handball, we can place handball in the 3rd row and 1st column.

19. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in the 1st row, we can place cycling in the 1st row and 3rd column.

20. Since the tomato eater is the parkour player, we've already placed parkour in the 4th row and 4th column.
