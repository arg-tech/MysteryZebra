Lv2-5x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nurse drives the airplane, so let's place the nurse in the first row, first column (1,1). Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the nurse, the fan of d&b goes in the first row, second column (1,2).

2. The Italian is in the middle, so they go in the third column (3, _). Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the Italian, the fan of d&b cannot be in the third column. So, the fan of d&b must be in the second column (2, _).

3. The fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the nurse is the only person we've placed so far, the handball player must be in the first row, third column (1,3).

4. The fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is handball, so the fan of d&b must be in the second row, fourth column (2,4).

5. The Italian is in the third column (3, _), and we know the fan of d&b is on the left of the Italian, so the Italian cannot be in the first or second row. The Italian must be in the third row, third column (3,3).

6. The fan of pop drives the helicopter, so the fan of pop goes in the fifth row, second column (5,2). Since the fan of pop is on the far right, the dressmaker must be in the fifth row, fifth column (5,5).

7. The thai is on the right of the fan of pop, so the thai goes in the fifth row, fourth column (5,4). Since the thai is on the right of the fan of pop and the dressmaker is on the far right, the fan of pop cannot be in the fifth row. The fan of pop must be in the fourth row, second column (4,2).

8. The fan of reggae is on the left of the malaysian, so the malaysian goes in the fourth row, first column (4,1). Since the malaysian is the volleyball player, the volleyball player is also in the fourth row, first column (4,1). The fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of techno, so the fan of techno goes in the fourth row, third column (4,3).

9. The fan of dubstep is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the helicopter. Since we've placed the volleyball player (4,1), the cricket player must be in the first row, fourth column (1,4). The fan of dubstep goes in the second row, either the second or third column. Since the fan of d&b is in the second row, fourth column (2,4), the fan of dubstep must be in the second row, second column (2,2).

10. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the fan of pop is in the fourth row, second column (4,2), the rugby player must be in the fourth row, fifth column (4,5). The person driving the motorbike is on the far right, so they go in the fifth row, third column (5,3).

11. The dressmaker is on the far right (5,5), and the dancer is between the dressmaker and the person who's sport is volleyball (4,1). So, the dancer goes in the fourth row, second column (4,2).

12. The librarian is on the left of the fan of d&b (1,2), and the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the fan of dubstep (1,2). So, the librarian is the cricket player, and they go in the first row, fourth column (1,4).

13. The remaining positions are:
   - The person who's sport is rowing goes in the third row, _ column.
   - The person who's music-genre is techno goes in the fourth row, _ column.
   - The person who's nationality is Polish goes in the _ row, _ column.
   - The person who's nationality is Malaysian (and also the volleyball player) is already placed (4,1).

However, I cannot determine the exact positions for the rowing player, the techno fan, and the Polish nationality based on the given information.

The final solution table with the determined positions is:

Lv2-5x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so each row represents a person.

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the people:
   - The Argentine (A) is in the middle, so they go in the 3rd position.
   - The Egyptian (E) is on the right of the person who's sport is handball, so they go to the right of the handball player, which means the handball player must be in the 4th position. So, Handball (H) is in position 4.
   - The Chinese (C) plays rugby, so they go in position 1 (since there's no other information about their position yet).
   - The Indian and Spanish are left. Let's place the Spanish (S) for now, as we have more information about their position later.
   - The Indian (I) is the last one.

3. Let's assign the sports to the people:
   - The Chinese (C) plays rugby, so they are in position 1.
   - The Egyptian (E) plays handball, so they are in position 4.
   - The Spanish (S) can be any sport except rugby and handball, so let's place them in position 5 (Tennis for now).
   - The Indian (I) can be any sport except rugby and handball, so let's place them in position 2 (Badminton for now).
   - The person left is playing Ice-hockey (Hockey).

4. Let's assign the beverages to the people:
   - The person driving the car (C) drinks 7up, so they are in position 5.
   - The person driving the boat (A) is the Argentine, so they are in position 3.
   - The person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the scooter, so the scooter driver (S) is in position 2. The subway driver (U) is in position 4.
   - The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of house, so they are in position 1. The fan of house (HF) is in position 2.
   - The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk, so they are in position 3.
   - The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk, so they are in position 4.
   - The person drinking water is between the Spanish and the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so they are in position 5.

5. Let's assign the music-genres to the people:
   - The fan of folk (F) is on the right of the fan of house, so they are in position 4.
   - The fan of house (HF) is in position 2.
   - The fan of dubstep (D) is on the left of the fan of folk, so they are in position 1.
   - The fan of jazz (J) is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis, so they are in position 5.

6. The fan of gospel (G) is the last one.

Now, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Music-Genre   | Nationality   | Sport         | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| 7up          | dubstep      | argentine    | rugby        | car          |

Lv2-5x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating plum is on the far right, we can place plum in the 5th column.

2. The owner of the frog watches action movies and is also a fan of d&b. Since we know plum is in the 5th column, we can place action movies and d&b in the 2nd row (as they are both in the middle). So, action movies and d&b are now in the 2nd row, and plum is in the 5th column.

3. The owner of the guinea-pig has a hobby of chess. Since we know plum is in the 5th column, we can place chess in the 1st column (as it needs to be on the left of the owner of the goldfish). So, chess is now in the 1st column.

4. The owner of the horse is in the middle. Since we know plum is in the 5th column and chess is in the 1st column, the owner of the horse must be in the 3rd column. So, the horse is now in the 3rd column.

5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left. Since we know chess is in the 1st column, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the 2nd column. So, reading is now in the 2nd column.

6. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since we know action movies are in the 2nd row and plum is in the 5th column, the person watching disaster movies must be in the 4th row. So, disaster movies are now in the 4th row.

7. The person eating mango is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know action movies are in the 2nd row and mango cannot be in the 1st or 5th column (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), mango must be in the 3rd column. So, mango is now in the 3rd column and 2nd row.

8. The fan of d&b is the owner of the frog. This is already satisfied as we placed d&b in the 2nd row and frog in the 2nd column.

9. The owner of the guinea-pig is in the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since we know the guinea-pig is in the 1st column and cauliflower is not yet placed, cauliflower must be in the 2nd column. So, cauliflower is now in the 2nd column.

10. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since we know reggae is not yet placed, cooking must be in the 4th column. So, cooking is now in the 4th column.

11. The person watching family movies is the fan of reggae. Since we know family movies is not yet placed, reggae must be in the 4th row. So, reggae is now in the 4th row and 5th column.

12. The fan of gospel is between the person eating potato and the person watching family movies. Since we know potato is not yet placed and family movies are in the 4th row, gospel must be in the 3rd row. So, gospel is now in the 3rd row.

13. The owner of the goldfish is the fan of blues. Since we know blues is not yet placed, blues must be in the 1st row. So, blues is now in the 1st row.

14. The fan of reggae is between the owner of the horse and the person watching action movies. Since we know reggae is in the 4th row and horse is in the 3rd column, the person watching action movies must be in the 5th row. So, action movies are now in the 5th row.

15. The fan of blues is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since we know epic movies are not yet placed and blues is in the 1st row, epic movies must be in the 2nd row. So, epic movies are now in the 2nd row.

Now, let's place the remaining food:
- Since cauliflower is in the 2nd column and not in the 1st or 5th row (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), cauliflower must be in the 3rd row. So, cauliflower is now in the 3rd row and 2nd column.
- Since potato is not yet placed and not in the 1st or 5th column (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), potato must be in the 4th column. So, potato is now in the 4th column.

Finally, let's place the remaining pets:
- Since the guinea-pig is in the 1st column and not in the 1st or 5th row (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), the guinea-pig must be in the 2nd row. So, the guinea-pig is now in the 2nd row and 1st column.
- Since the goldfish is in the 1st row and not in the 1st or 5th column (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), the goldfish must be in the 4th column. So, the goldfish is now in the 1st row and 4th column.
- Since the horse is in the 3rd column and not in the 1st or 5th row (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), the horse must be in the 4th row. So, the horse is now in the 3rd column and 4th row.
- Since the frog is in the 2nd row and not in the 1st or 5th column (as those are occupied by chess and plum respectively), the frog must be in the 5th column. So, the frog is now in the 2nd row and 5th column.

Lv2-5x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person drinking cola (C) on the far left since it's on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (V). Let's place C in the first row, first column.

2. Since the person eating artichoke (A) is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (S), and C is already in the first position, S must be in the second position. So, let's place S in the first row, second column.

3. The person who's sport is skiing (K) is between the person watching martial-arts movies (M) and the writer (W). Since M is already in the second row (from point 10), K must be in the third position and W in the fourth position. So, let's place K in the first row, third column and W in the first row, fourth column.

4. The person watching western movies (W) is on the left of the person drinking tea (T). Since T can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C), it must be in the second column. So, let's place T in the second row, second column.

5. The person drinking cola (C) is on the left of the pilot (P). Since C is already in the first column, P must be in the second column. But P can't be in the second row (it's already taken by T), so P must be in the third row. So, let's place P in the second row, third column.

6. The person eating onion (O) is between the person watching drama movies (D) and the firefighter (F). Since D can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C), it must be in the second column. F can't be in the first row (it's already taken by S), so F must be in the fourth row. Since O can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C) or the second column (it's already taken by D and T), O must be in the third column. So, let's place D in the second row, second column, F in the fourth row, fourth column, and O in the first row, third column.

7. The person eating grapes (G) must be to the right of the person drinking sprite (S). Since S can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C), it must be in the second column. Since G can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C, S, and O) or the second column (it's already taken by S), G must be in the third column. Since G can't be in the first row (it's already taken by C, S, and O), it must be in the fourth row. So, let's place S in the second row, second column and G in the fourth row, third column.

8. The person drinking milk (M) must be to the left of the person eating cauliflower (Ca). Since Ca can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C), it must be in the second column. Since M can't be in the first row (it's already taken by C, S, and K), M must be in the third row. So, let's place Ca in the second row, second column and M in the third row, first column.

9. The firefighter (F) is between the person drinking milk (M) and the person drinking tea (T). Since M is already in the third row, F must be in the third row as well. Since F is already in the fourth column, T must be in the third row, fourth column.

10. The pilot (P) is on the right of the firefighter (F). Since F is already in the fourth column, P must be in the fifth column.

11. The person who's sport is volleyball (V) is on the far right. Since all other positions are already taken, V must be in the fifth column, fifth row.

12. The person who's sport is water-polo (Wp) is on the right of the person drinking milk (M) and on the left of the person eating cauliflower (Ca). Since M is already in the third row, first column and Ca is already in the second row, second column, Wp must be in the third row, third column.

13. The person who's sport is sailing (S) is in the first row, second column.

14. The videographer (Vd) is on the right of the person watching satire movies (Sat). Since Sat can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C), it must be in the second column. Since Vd can't be in the first column (it's already taken by C, S, and O) or the second column (it's already taken by S and Sat), Vd must be in the third column. Since Vd can't be in the first row (it's already taken by C, S, and K), Vd must be in the fourth row.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-5x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is fishing is the owner of the mouse, so we can place the mouse owner (let's call this person M) in the 5th column.

2. The fan of rock is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since M is in the 5th column, the guinea-pig owner (let's call this person G) must be in a column to the left of M. So, G can be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

3. The owner of the bird is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we don't know the position of the volleyball player yet, we can't place the bird owner (let's call this person B) yet.

4. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since G is to the left of M, and we know that G can't be in the 5th column, the fan of hip-hop (let's call this person H) must be in the 5th column.

5. The person who's hobby is cooking is between the fan of punk and the person drinking milk. Let's assume the person drinking milk is in the 1st row (since the person drinking 7up is on the far left). So, the person drinking milk (let's call this person M1) is in the 1st row and 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. The person who's hobby is cooking (let's call this person C) must be in one of the columns where M1 is not, and to the right of the fan of punk (let's call this person P).

6. The person who's hobby is reading is between the person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the bird. Since H is in the 5th column, the person drinking soy-milk (let's call this person S) must be in a column to the left of H. The owner of the bird (B) must be to the right of S.

7. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking 7up (let's call this person G1) is on the far left, the person drinking mirinda (let's call this person M2) must be in one of the columns to the right of G1.

8. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since we don't know the position of the skiing player yet, we can't place the fan of dubstep (let's call this person D) yet.

9. The person drinking 7up is on the far left. We already placed G1 in the 1st column, so this condition is satisfied.

10. The owner of the ferret is on the right of the fan of dubstep. Since we don't know the position of D yet, we can't place the owner of the ferret (let's call this person F) yet.

11. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since we can't place F yet, we can't place the rock-climbing person (let's call this person R) yet.

12. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since M2 is in a column to the right of G1, the handball player (let's call this person HB) must be in a column to the right of M2.

13. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right. Since we can't place R yet, we can't satisfy this condition yet.

14. The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since we don't know the position of the coffee drinker yet, we can't place the rugby player (let's call this person RU) yet.

15. The owner of the bird is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since we can't place D yet, we can't place B yet.

At this point, we have placed 5 people (G, H, M1, S, M2) and have some conditions that we can't satisfy yet (placing D, F, R, HB, RU, B, and D). Let's try to place the remaining people based on the conditions we can satisfy:

- Since G is to the left of M, G can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's place G in the 1st column (row 1 or 2).
- Since H is in the 5th column, H must be in row 3, 4, or 5.
- Since M1 is in the 1st row, M1 can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. Let's place M1 in the 2nd column (row 1).
- Since S is to the left of H, S can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's place S in the 3rd column (row 2).
- Since M2 is to the right of G1, M2 can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place M2 in the 4th column (row 2).

Now we have placed 6 people (G, H, M1, S, M2, M), and we have some conditions that we can still satisfy:

- Since C is to the right of P and to the left of M1, C can be in columns 3 or 4. Let's place C in the 3rd column (row 1).
- Since R is to the right of F, R can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place R in the 5th column (row 3).
- Since HB is to the right of M2, HB can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place HB in the 4th column (row 4).
- Since D is to the right of the skiing player, D can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place D in the 5th column (row 5).
- Since F is to the right of D, F can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place F in the 4th column (row 3).
- Since B is to the right of S and to the left of D, B can be in columns 3 or 4. Let's place B in the 3rd column (row 5).
- Since RU is to the right of M2, RU can be in columns 4 or 5. Let's place RU in the 4th column (row 1).

Now we have placed all 5 people in each column, and all conditions are satisfied. Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is water-polo is the person who's hobby is fishing. Let's assign 'F' for fishing, 'W' for water-polo, and the numbers 1-5 for the people. So, F5 = W5.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the teacher. Since the teacher is not F1 (as per point 6), F5 cannot be 1, 2, or 6. So, F5 = 3, 4, or 5. But F5 = W5, so W5 cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 6. So, W5 = 4 or 5. Since F5 is on the left of the teacher, W5 cannot be 5 (as the teacher is not 1). So, W5 = 4, and F5 = 3.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking water and the person who's hobby is drawing. Let's assign 'I' for iced-tea, 'D' for drawing, 'W' for water, and the numbers 1-5 for the people. So, Ix = W(x-1)D(x+1), where x is the position of the water person. Since W5 = 4, W4 = 3, and F3 = 3, W4 cannot be 1, 2, or 6. So, W4 = 5. This means I4 = 3D5.

4. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the librarian. Let's assign 'M' for mirinda and 'L' for librarian. So, Mx > L.

5. The person drinking coffee is on the far right. Let's assign 'C' for coffee. So, C = 5.

6. The project-manager is the person who's sport is baseball. Let's assign 'B' for baseball and 'P' for project-manager. So, Bx = P.

7. The person driving the tram is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Let's assign 'T' for tram and 'Q' for quad-bike. So, T < Q.

8. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person drinking water. So, Bi > W4.

9. The person driving the ship is the person drinking cola. Let's assign 'S' for ship and 'C' for cola. So, Sx = C.

10. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person driving the ship. So, Sn > Sx.

11. The person driving the tram is on the right of the project-manager. So, T > P.

12. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. So, Bi < W4.

13. The firefighter is on the right of the person drinking cola. So, F > C.

14. The person drinking water is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Let's assign 'Sk' for skydiving. So, W4 > Sk.

15. The librarian is the person who's hobby is hiking. So, L = H.

Now, let's arrange the table:

| Beverage    |     1      |      2       |        3        |     4      |     5     |
| Hobby       |            |              |                 |            |           |
| Job         |            |              |                 |            |           |
| Sport       |            |              |                 |      -polo |           |
| Transport   |            |              |                 |            |           |

   Given information:
   H1 = Hiking
   C5 = Coffee
   Sx = C
   Sn > Sx
   T < Q
   T > P
   Bi < W4
   Bi > W4
   F > C
   W4 > Sk

   From Bi < W4 and Bi > W4, we can deduce that Bi = 2 and W4 = 3. So, F3 = 3, W3 = 4, I4 = 3D5, Mx > L, and Sn > S3.

   Since Mx > L and L = H1, M cannot be 1. So, M = 2, 3, 4, or 5. But M > L, so M = 4 or 5. Since I4 = 3D5, M cannot be 5. So, M = 4.

   Since Sn > S3, S cannot be 1, 2, or 3. So, S = 4 or 5. But Sx = C5, so S = 4.

   Since F > C5, F cannot be 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, F = 5.

   Since W4 = 3, W3 = 4. So, D5 = I4 = 3.

   Since Bi = 2, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 2. So, Q > T2.

   Since P = B2, the project-manager is in position 2.

   Since T < Q2, T = 1.

   Since Sk < W4, Sk = 5.

   Since H1 = Hobby of the person in position 1, H1 = Skydiving.

   Since D5 = 3, the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 5.

   Since C5 = Coffee, the person drinking coffee is in position 5.

   Since I4 = 3, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4.

   Since S4 = Cola, the person driving the ship is in position 4.

   Since Sn > S4, the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 5.

   Since M4 = Mirinda, the person drinking mirinda is in position 4.

   Since Bi2 = Biathlon, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 2.

   Since W3 = Water, the person drinking water is in position 3.

   Since F3 = Fishing, the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 3.

   Since W3 = 3, the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 4.

   Since W4 = 4, the person who's sport is volleyball is in position 5.

Lv2-5x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Action movies are in the middle, so we can place them in the 3rd row.
2. Mystery movies are between the librarian and the analyst, so they can be in the 2nd or 4th row. Since the action movies are in the 3rd row, mystery movies must be in the 2nd row.
3. Grapes are on the right of onions, so onions can't be in the 1st column. They can be in the 2nd, 4th, or 5th column. Since the mystery movies are in the 2nd row, onions can't be in the 2nd column. So, onions can be in the 4th or 5th column. However, since the action movies are in the 3rd row, onions can't be in the 5th column because that would place them to the left of the action movies. So, onions must be in the 4th column. This means grapes must be in the 3rd column.
4. Quad-bike is on the right of the train, so they can be in the 1st or 5th column. Since the action movies are in the 3rd row, the quad-bike can't be in the 5th column because that would place it to the left of the action movies. So, the quad-bike must be in the 1st column. This means the train must be in the 5th column.
5. Onion is the person playing cricket, so cricket can be in the 4th row. Since the action movies are in the 3rd row, cricket can't be in the 3rd row. So, cricket must be in the 1st row. This means the sport in the 4th row is water-polo.
