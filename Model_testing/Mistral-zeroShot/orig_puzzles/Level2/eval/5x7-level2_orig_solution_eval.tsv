Lv2-5x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the first row:

1. The Russian is on the left of the Chinese, so the Russian must be in the first position (1st row, 1st column). The only nationality left for the second position is Australian, so the Australian is in the second position (1st row, 2nd column).

2. The Dutch is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, so the Dutch cannot be in the first or second position. The only nationality left for the third position is Italian, so the Italian is in the third position (1st row, 3rd column).

3. The Thai is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing, so the Thai cannot be in the last position. The only nationality left for the fourth position is Indonesian, so the Indonesian is in the fourth position (1st row, 4th column).

4. The Chinese is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the Chinese cannot be in the first, second, third, or fourth position. The only nationality left for the fifth position is Australian, so the Australian is in the fifth position (1st row, 5th column).

5. The only nationality left for the sixth position is Chinese, so the Chinese is in the sixth position (1st row, 6th column).

6. The only nationality left for the seventh position is Thai, so the Thai is in the seventh position (1st row, 7th column).

Now let's assign the pets to the second row:

1. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so the hedgehog must be in the first position (2nd row, 1st column). The only pet left for the second position is goat, so the goat is in the second position (2nd row, 2nd column).

2. The owner of the chinchilla is not in the first position, so the chinchilla must be in the third position (2nd row, 3rd column).

3. The only pet left for the fourth position is horse, so the horse is in the fourth position (2nd row, 4th column).

4. The owner of the rabbit cannot be in the first, second, third, or fourth position. The only pet left for the fifth position is mouse, so the mouse is in the fifth position (2nd row, 5th column).

5. The owner of the snake is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's sport is handball, but we haven't assigned these hobbies and sports yet. We'll come back to this later. The only pet left for the sixth position is rabbit, so the rabbit is in the sixth position (2nd row, 6th column).

6. The only pet left for the seventh position is snake, so the snake is in the seventh position (2nd row, 7th column).

Now let's assign the hobbies to the third row:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking is between the person who's hobby is reading and the Indonesian. The only hobby left for the first position is board-games, so the person who's hobby is board-games is in the first position (3rd row, 1st column).

Lv2-5x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the people and their jobs. Since the project-manager is on the far right, we can place them in position 7. The engineer is on the right of the project-manager, so the engineer goes in position 6. The freelancer is the person drinking almond-milk, which is between the person drinking 7up and the engineer. So, the freelancer goes in position 5. The accountant is not yet placed, but we know the person watching disaster movies is between the accountant and the person eating mango. Since the engineer is in position 6, the accountant must be in position 4.

2. The person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since the project-manager is watching family movies (position 7), the person eating garlic is in position 1, 2, 3, or 6. However, since the person eating peas is the person drinking lemonade (position 6), the person eating garlic cannot be in position 6. So, the person eating garlic is in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. The person watching disaster movies is between the accountant (position 4) and the person eating mango. Since the person eating garlic cannot be in position 6, the person eating mango must be in position 5. So, the person watching disaster movies is in position 3.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the project-manager (position 7). Since the person eating mango (sport is -polo) is in position 5, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 2.

5. The person who's sport is climbing is the person eating orange. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 3, the person eating orange must be in position 1.

6. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the police-officer. Since the person eating mango (sport is -polo) is in position 5, the police-officer must be in position 4. So, the person who's sport is rowing is in position 6.

7. The person drinking milk is the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating peas is the person drinking lemonade (position 6), the person eating lettuce must be in position 5.

8. The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking milk (and eating lettuce) is in position 5, the person drinking 7up must be in position 3.

9. The chef is on the right of the person eating lettuce (position 5). Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the chef must be in position 2.

10. The person drinking water is on the far left.

11. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person eating watermelon. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the person eating watermelon must be in position 2. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3.

12. The person eating orange is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 3, the person watching drama movies is in position 4.

13. The person eating orange is on the left of the person drinking 7up (position 3).

14. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking milk (and eating lettuce) is in position 5, the person drinking cola must be in position 6. So, the person who's sport is tennis is in position 4.

15. The person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking 7up (position 3).

16. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person watching drama movies (position 4).

22. The person eating lettuce is in position 5.

23. The person drinking lemonade is in position 6.

24. The person eating peas is in position 3.

25. The person eating watermelon is in position 2.

26. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3.

27. The person drinking 7up is in position 3.

28. The person drinking cola is in position 6.

29. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking 7up (position 3) and the freelancer (position 5). So, the person drinking almond-milk is in position 4.

30. The person drinking milk is in position 5.

31. The person drinking water is in position 1.

Now, let's place the food:

|               |     1      |      2       |       3       |     4      |      5      |       6        |        7        |

| Sport         |           |               |               |      -polo  |             |               |                 |

We still need to place the job, movie-genre, and sport for all positions. This part is more challenging and might require a different approach, such as guessing and checking or using a computer program to solve it.

However, I'll provide a possible solution for the remaining positions:

Lv2-5x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign a number to each person (1-7) and each item (A-G for beverages, 1-7 for food, and so on). We'll use the given information to fill in the table row by row.

2. From the given information, we know that the thai is on the far left (24), so Thai = 1. Since the Brazilian is on the far left (12), Brazilian = 7.

3. The person driving the bus is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the car (20), so let's assume the bus driver is 3. This means Taxi = 5 and Car = 6.
