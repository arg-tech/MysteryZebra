Now let's start solving the constraints:

1. The Dutch is not drinking tea, so tea cannot be in the second column.
2. Fanta is not in the first column, so it must be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth column. Since fanta is to the left of soy-milk, soy-milk cannot be in the first column. So, soy-milk must be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth column.
3. The librarian is gardening, so gardening must be in the third row. Since the librarian is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess, chess cannot be in the first or third column. So, chess must be in the second, fourth, or sixth column.
4. The accountant is eating lettuce, so lettuce must be in the sixth row. Since the accountant is to the right of the person drinking coffee, coffee cannot be in the sixth column. So, coffee must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth column.
5. The nigerian is eating strawberry, so strawberry must be in the sixth row.
6. The security-guard is drinking fanta, so fanta must be in the sixth row.
7. The person drinking coffee is to the right of the accountant, so coffee cannot be in the sixth column. So, coffee must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth column.
8. The italian is eating plum, so plum must be in the fifth row.
9. The person eating lettuce is doing sudoku, so sudoku must be in the sixth row.
10. The american is to the left of the photographer, so the photographer cannot be in the first column. So, the photographer must be in the second, fourth, or sixth column.
11. The security-guard is to the right of the nigerian, so the nigerian cannot be in the sixth column. So, the nigerian must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth column.
12. The person drinking coffee is between the person drinking tea and the person eating grapes. Since coffee cannot be in the sixth column, it must be in the first, second, or fifth column. If coffee is in the first column, it would violate the condition that the accountant is to the right of the person drinking coffee. If coffee is in the fifth column, it would violate the condition that the security-guard is drinking fanta. So, coffee must be in the second column.
13. The entrepreneur is to the right of the person eating cranberry, so the entrepreneur cannot be in the first column. So, the entrepreneur must be in the second, fourth, or sixth column. If the entrepreneur is in the sixth column, it would violate the condition that the security-guard is to the right of the nigerian. So, the entrepreneur must be in the fourth column.
14. The person eating lettuce is on the far left, so lettuce must be in the first column.
15. The security-guard is the person drinking fanta, so fanta must be in the sixth row.
16. The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person eating plum and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the security-guard is drinking fanta and the entrepreneur is in the fourth column, the person who's hobby is traveling cannot be in the fourth column. So, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in the second or sixth column. If the person who's hobby is traveling is in the second column, it would violate the condition that the entrepreneur is in the fourth column. So, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in the sixth column.
17. The person who's hobby is hiking is to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, so hiking cannot be in the first, second, or sixth column. So, hiking must be in the third or fifth column.
18. The person eating cranberry is the egyptian, so cranberry must be in the first row.

Lv2-5x6-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the columns:

1. The Mexican is on the left of the person watching action movies (10), so Mexican must be in column 1.
2. The French is on the right of the Japanese (19), so French must be in column 6.
3. The Japanese is on the left of the French (19), so Japanese must be in column 5.
4. The Thai is on the right of the Mexican (18), so Thai must be in column 2.
5. The Spanish is the person watching action movies (20), so Spanish must be in column 4.
6. The Javanese is left of the person watching action movies (9), so Javanese must be in column 3.

Now let's assign the sports to the rows:

1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left (3), so snowboarding must be in row 1.
2. The person who's sport is sailing is the owner of the chinchilla (4), so sailing must be in row 2.
3. The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the owner of the dog (5), so golf must be in row 3.
4. The person who's sport is tennis is the fan of jazz (7) and the watcher of epic movies (12), so tennis must be in row 4.
5. The person who's sport is rugby is the owner of the turtle (14), so rugby must be in row 5.
6. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the owner of the turtle (17), so handball must be in row 6.

Now let's assign the pets to the columns:

1. The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis (6), so fish must be in column 1.
2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the turtle (17), so chinchilla must be in column 2.
3. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (5), so dog must be in column 3.
4. The owner of the turtle is the person who's sport is rugby (14), so turtle must be in column 4.
5. The owner of the pony is not specified, so we'll leave this for now.
6. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the turtle (17), so the pony must be in column 6.

Now let's assign the music genres to the rows:

1. The fan of reggae is on the far left (13), so reggae must be in row 1.
2. The fan of salsa is on the left of the owner of the horse (2), so salsa must be in row 2.
3. The fan of jazz is between the fan of disco and the person who's sport is golf (22), so jazz must be in row 3.
4. The fan of disco is on the far right (15), so disco must be in row 4.
5. The fan of punk is the person who's sport is golf (22), so punk must be in row 3.
6. The fan of blues is not specified, so we'll leave this for now.

Now let's assign the movie genres to the columns:

1. The person watching satire movies is the fan of jazz (7), so satire must be in column 3.
2. The person watching scientific movies is the Malaysian (8), so scientific must be in column 5.
3. The person watching epic movies is the French (16), so epic must be in column 6.
4. The person watching action movies is the Spanish (20), so action must be in column 4.
5. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby (1), so time-travel must be in column 2.
6. The person watching crime movies is not specified, so we'll leave this for now.

Now let's assign the remaining movie genre:

* The person watching crime movies must be in column 1, as there are only 6 movie genres and all other genres have been assigned.

Finally, let's assign the remaining pet:

* The owner of the pony is on the far right (6), so the pony must be in column 6.

Lv2-5x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so we can fill in the number from 1 to 6 in the empty cells.

2. The Australian eats eggplant, so we can place the Australian in the cell with eggplant under Nationality. Since the lawyer is on the left of the Australian (4), the lawyer must be in the first position. So, we can place the lawyer in the first row under Job. Since the Australian is on the right of the lawyer (4), the Australian must be in the second position. So, we can place the Australian in the second row under Nationality.

3. The person eating pear is on the right of the designer (2), and the person eating mango is on the left of the person eating pear (3). Since the mango eater is the Australian (1), the pear eater must be in the third position. So, we can place the pear eater in the third row under Food. Since the mango eater is the Australian (1), we can place the mango in the second row under Food. Since the person eating mango is driving the trike (6), we can place the trike in the second row under Transport.

4. The person eating mango is between the person drinking mirinda and the analyst (9). Since the mirinda drinker is between the Colombian and the French (20), the mirinda drinker must be in the fourth position. So, we can place the mirinda drinker in the fourth row under Beverage. Since the analyst is the Dutch (15), we can place the analyst in the fifth row under Job. Since the analyst is between the mirinda drinker and the person eating mango (9), the analyst must be in the third position. So, we can place the analyst in the third row under Job.

5. The person drinking sprite is the writer (12), so we can place the sprite in the sixth row under Beverage and the writer in the sixth row under Job.

6. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the Turkish (16), so we can place the coffee in the first row under Beverage. Since the coffee drinker is not the Australian (1), the coffee drinker must be in the fifth position. So, we can place the coffee in the fifth row under Beverage.

7. The person drinking cola is on the far right (19), so we can place the cola in the sixth row under Beverage.

8. The person eating lettuce is the person driving the bus (18), so we can place the lettuce in the first row under Food and the bus in the first row under Transport.

9. The person driving the helicopter is the social-worker (7), so we can place the helicopter in the fifth row under Transport.

10. The person driving the van is the person eating eggplant (8), so we can place the van in the first row under Transport.

11. The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the subway (11), so we can place the iced-tea in the fourth row under Beverage and the subway in the sixth row under Transport.

12. The person eating plum is on the right of the person drinking sprite (10), so we can place the plum in the sixth row under Food.

13. The person driving the trike is on the right of the Australian (13), so we can place the trike in the third row under Transport.

14. The person driving the subway is on the far left (14), so we can place the subway in the first row under Transport.

15. The Colombian is on the right of the Australian (5), so we can place the Colombian in the third position under Nationality.

16. The French is not next to the Colombian (20), so the French must be in the second position under Nationality.

17. The Dutch is the analyst (15), so we have already placed the Dutch.

18. The British is not the Australian (1), the Colombian (3), the French (2), or the Dutch (5), so the British must be in the sixth position under Nationality.

19. The Turkish is not the Australian (1), the Colombian (3), the French (2), the Dutch (5), the British (6), or the person drinking coffee (5), so the Turkish must be in the fourth position under Nationality.

Lv2-5x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the American is on the left of the Spanish and the Egyptian, and the Egyptian is on the left of the rat owner, we can place the American in the first position. The Spanish and the Egyptian can't be in the first two positions because the American is on their left, so they must be in positions 3 and 4. The Colombian is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess, so the Colombian must be in position 5. The Malay and Turkish can't be in the first five positions because the Malay is on the far right, so they must be in positions 6 and 1.

2. Now let's place the pets. Since the American is on the left of the person drinking fanta, and the person drinking fanta is eating artichoke, the American can't be in the first position. The Malay is on the far right, so the pet of the Malay (turtle) must be in position 6. The Egyptian can't have a pet in the first two positions because the rat owner is on their left, so the pet of the Egyptian (lizard) must be in position 5. The rat owner can't have a pet in the first four positions because the Egyptian is on their right, so the rat owner's pet (rat) must be in position 1. The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, so the pony must be in position 6. The owner of the bird is between the person drinking tea and the rat owner, so the bird must be in position 2. The owner of the fish is between the person eating cauliflower and the person eating watermelon, so the fish must be in position 4. The lizard is between the bird and the person drinking tea, so the person drinking tea must be in position 3.

3. Now let's place the beverages. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking fanta, and the person drinking fanta is eating artichoke, so the coffee must be in position 1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea, so hot-chocolate must be in position 6 and iced-tea must be in position 5. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking, so tea must be in position 3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking cola, so cola must be in position 2. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the American, who is drinking coffee, so fanta must be in position 4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking tea, so hot-chocolate must be in position 5.

4. Now let's place the food. The person eating watermelon is the person drinking coffee, so watermelon must be in position 1. The person eating eggplant is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping, so eggplant must be in position 2. The person eating mango is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person eating peach, so mango must be in position 3 and peach must be in position 4. The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person eating watermelon, so cauliflower must be in position 5. The person eating artichoke is the person drinking fanta, so artichoke must be in position 6.

5. Finally, let's place the hobbies. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far right, so baking must be in position 6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking, so rock-climbing must be in position 5. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the Colombian, so chess must be in position 6. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person eating eggplant, so camping must be in position 4. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so filmmaking must be in position 5.

Lv2-5x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Let's place the water-polo player (WP) and the trike driver (T) in the last two positions. So, WP is in position 6 and T is in position 5.

2. The person eating tomato is the fisherman (F). Since F can't be in position 6 (as it's the sport of WP), F must be in position 1. So, F is in position 1, eating tomato.

3. The bartender (B) is the owner of the cat (C). Since C can't be in position 6 (as it's owned by T), C can't be in position 5 (as it's owned by B and B is on the right of C). So, C must be in position 2. Therefore, B is in position 3, owning the cat.

4. The person who's sport is water-polo is the person driving the scooter (S). Since S can't be in position 1 (as it's the position of F), S can't be in position 2 (as C is in position 2 and C is the pet of B, who is on the right of S). So, S must be in position 4. Therefore, WP is in position 4, driving the scooter.

5. The owner of the goldfish (G) is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since G can't be in position 6 (as it's owned by T), G can't be in position 5 (as it's on the right of WP). So, G must be in position 3. Therefore, G is in position 3, owning the goldfish.

6. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating pomegranate (P). Since P can't be in position 6 (as it's the sport of WP), P can't be in position 5 (as G is in position 5 and G is on the right of P). So, P must be in position 2. Therefore, P is in position 2, eating pomegranate. The person eating papaya (A) must be in position 3.

7. The person eating papaya is the person driving the bus (Bs). Since Bs can't be in position 1 (as it's the position of F), Bs can't be in position 2 (as P is in position 2). So, Bs must be in position 4. Therefore, A is in position 3, eating papaya and driving the bus.

8. The owner of the snake (Sn) is between the musician (M) and the fisherman (F). Since Sn can't be in position 6 (as it's the position of T), Sn can't be in position 5 (as G is in position 5). So, Sn must be in position 2. Therefore, M is in position 1 and F is in position 3.

9. The person eating cucumber is the accountant (Ac). Since Ac can't be in position 6 (as it's the sport of WP), Ac can't be in position 5 (as T is in position 5). So, Ac must be in position 4. Therefore, Ac is in position 4, eating cucumber.

10. The person eating tomato is the owner of the hedgehog (H). Since H can't be in position 6 (as it's the sport of WP), H can't be in position 5 (as T is in position 5 and T is on the right of H). So, H must be in position 2. Therefore, H is in position 2, owning the hedgehog.

11. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the owner of the snake. Since WP is in position 4, Sn is in position 2, and the right order is Sn-WP, the person driving the scooter (WP) is on the right of the owner of the snake (Sn). So, the person driving the trike (T) is on the left of the owner of the pony (P).

12. The person who's sport is rowing (R) is on the left of the owner of the pony (P). Since P can't be in position 1 (as it's the position of M), P must be in position 2. Therefore, R is in position 1, doing rowing.

13. The person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since T is in position 5 and P is in position 2, R must be in position 3.

14. The person eating apricot is the person who's sport is rugby (Rg). Since Rg can't be in position 6 (as it's the sport of WP), Rg can't be in position 5 (as T is in position 5). So, Rg must be in position 4. Therefore, Rg is in position 4, eating apricot and doing rugby.

15. The person who's sport is surfing (Sf) is on the right of the person eating tomato (F). Since F is in position 1, Sf must be in position 6.

16. The person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the cat (C). Since C is in position 2, the person driving the jet-ski (Js) must be in position 1.

17. The owner of the cat is on the far right. Since C is in position 1, the positions from 2 to 6 are empty.

18. The owner of the cat is on the right of the social-worker (Sw). Since C is in position 1, Sw must be in position 2.

Lv2-5x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Pet, Transport). We'll assign a number from 1 to 6 to each variable in each row, and we'll use the given clues to fill in the numbers.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. We know that the person drinking cola is between the person driving the jet-ski and the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the pony is on the far right (clue 12), the person driving the jet-ski must be 6, and the person drinking cola is 2 or 4 (since the pony is 6). Let's assume the person drinking cola is 2 for now. This means the person driving the jet-ski is 6. Now, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching spy movies (clue 11), so the spy movies person is 1 or 3. Let's assume the spy movies person is 1 for now. This means the person watching mystery movies is 5.

3. The person drinking coffee is between the person driving the bike and the person eating eggplant (clue 6). Since the person driving the bike is 1 (from the previous step), the person drinking coffee is 3 or 5. Let's assume the person drinking coffee is 3 for now. This means the person eating eggplant is 6. The person eating eggplant is on the right of the person watching animation movies (clue 19), so the animation movies person is 2 or 4. Let's assume the animation movies person is 2 for now. This means the person watching martial-arts movies is 5 (from clue 7).

4. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person driving the helicopter (clue 5). Since the person driving the helicopter is 1 (from the previous step), the person eating broccoli is 6. The person eating broccoli is the person watching martial-arts movies (clue 7), so the martial-arts movies person is 6. This means the person watching mystery movies is 1, the person watching spy movies is 3, and the person watching animation movies is 2.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person eating cherry (clue 3). Since the person eating cherry is 6 (from the previous step), the owner of the chinchilla is 5. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 1), so the sports movies person is 4.

6. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog (clue 4). Since the owner of the chinchilla is 5, the owner of the hedgehog is 3. This means the owner of the hamster is 6. The owner of the hamster is the person eating cherry (clue 15), so the person eating cherry is 6. This means the owner of the frog is 1 (clue 14).

7. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (clue 8). Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is 4 (from the previous step), the person driving the trike is 5. The person eating cherry is on the right of the person driving the trike (clue 10), so the person driving the trike is 3. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is 6.

8. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking tea (clue 16), so the person drinking tea is 1 or 2. Since the person drinking tea can't be 1 (because the person driving the trike is 1), the person drinking tea is 2. This means the person drinking lemonade is 3.

9. The person eating pear is on the left of the person drinking tea (clue 13), so the person drinking tea is 6, and the person eating pear is 5.

10. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating eggplant (clue 18), so the person eating nectarine is 4.

11. The person eating papaya is the person watching spy movies (clue 9), so the person watching spy movies is 3, and the person eating papaya is 3.

12. The owner of the pony is 6 (from the beginning), and the owner of the frog is 1 (from the previous step). The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog (clue 14), so the owner of the mouse is 5.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv2-5x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is photography is the person doing skateboarding. Let's place skateboarding in position 6 and photography in position 3 (since it's on the right of iced-tea and on the left of hot-chocolate).

2. Place iced-tea in position 2 (since it's drinking iced-tea and driving the jet-ski).

3. Place photography's pet, which is a chinchilla, in position 1 (since the person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the chinchilla owner).

4. From rule 16, the person drinking mirinda is the owner of the chinchilla. So, mirinda goes in position 1.

5. From rule 15, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is in position 1, the rabbit owner should be in position 2. So, the hobby of writing goes in position 2.

6. From rule 14, the person drinking fanta is the person driving the quad-bike. Since fanta is not placed yet, let's place it in position 5 (since it's on the far right).

7. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is woodworking is the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is not placed yet, let's place it in position 4 (since the hobby of woodworking is on the left of the turtle owner, and the turtle is not placed yet).

8. From rule 19, the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the bus. Since lemonade is not placed yet, let's place it in position 6 (since it's not adjacent to any other beverage).

9. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far right. Since fanta is on the far right already, puzzles should be in position 1.

10. From rule 11, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since skateboard is in position 6, mirinda should be in position 5.

11. From rule 17, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person driving the tram. Since the tram is not placed yet, let's place it in position 3 (since hot-chocolate is on its right and photography is on its left).

12. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is writing is the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit is in position 2, the sport of the person in position 2 should be cricket (since it's between skateboarding and the owner of the guinea-pig).

13. From rule 8, the person drinking soy-milk is between the person who's sport is rugby and the owner of the goldfish. Since rugby is not placed yet, let's place it in position 4 (since soy-milk is between rugby and the goldfish owner).

14. From rule 1, the person who's sport is cricket is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the guinea-pig. Since skateboarding is in position 6 and the guinea-pig owner is not placed yet, the sport of the person in position 5 should be cricket.

15. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is photography is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since iced-tea is in position 2 and hot-chocolate is in position 3, photography should be in position 1.

16. From rule 9, the person drinking fanta is on the far right. Since fanta is already in position 5, it's in the correct position.

17. From rule 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person driving the tram. Since hot-chocolate is in position 3, the tram should be in position 2.

18. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since woodworking is in position 4, the turtle should be in position 5.

19. From rule 20, the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the bus. Since lemonade is in position 6, the bus should be in position 1.
