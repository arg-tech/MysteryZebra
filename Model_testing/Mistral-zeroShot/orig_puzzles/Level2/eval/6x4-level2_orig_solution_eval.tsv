Lv2-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill the numbers from 1 to 4 in the first column.

2. Let's start with the jobs. The teacher is on the far right, so we can place 'teacher' in the 4th row, 1st column. Since the manager is between the person who plays baseball and the fan of R&B, and the teacher is on the right of the manager, the manager must be in the 3rd row, 1st column. The entrepreneur is on the right of the fan of classical, so the fan of classical must be in the 2nd row, 1st column. The journalist is left of the fan of R&B, so the fan of R&B must be in the 4th row, 1st column.

3. Now let's fill the jobs in the remaining columns. Since the manager is between baseball and the fan of R&B, the person playing baseball must be in the 3rd row, 2nd column. The person who eats radish drinks tea, so they must be in the 4th row, 3rd column. This leaves the 3rd row, 2nd column for the person who eats broccoli.

4. The person drinking lemonade is a fan of classical, so they must be in the 2nd row, 2nd column. This leaves the 2nd row, 3rd column for the person eating plum. The person eating peach is on the left of the person eating plum, so they must be in the 2nd row, 4th column.

5. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, so the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in the 1st row, 4th column. The person drinking tea is the person eating radish, so we already know their position. This leaves the 1st row, 2nd column for the person drinking coffee.

6. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing, so the person who's sport is skiing must be in the 4th row, 4th column. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who eats broccoli, so the person who eats broccoli must be in the 3rd row, 3rd column. This leaves the 4th row, 3rd column for the person who's sport is climbing.

7. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the fan of funk, and the fan of funk is between the fan of dubstep and the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the fan of dubstep must be in the 1st row, 2nd column, the fan of funk in the 2nd row, 3rd column, and the person who's hobby is puzzles in the 2nd row, 4th column.

8. The person who's music genre is classical is on the right of the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur must be in the 1st row, 3rd column. The person who's music genre is dubstep is in the 1st row, 2nd column, and the person who's music genre is funk is in the 2nd row, 3rd column. This leaves the 1st row, 4th column for the person who's music genre is r&b.

9. The person who's hobby is gardening is not specified to be in a specific position, so we can place it anywhere. Let's place it in the 3rd row, 2nd column for now.

10. The person who's hobby is writing is the teacher, so we already know their position. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing, so the person who's sport is skiing must be in the 4th row, 4th column. This leaves the 4th row, 3rd column for the person who's hobby is fishing.

11. The person who's sport is baseball is between the manager and the person who eats radish, so the person who eats radish must be in the 3rd row, 3rd column. This leaves the 3rd row, 2nd column for the person who plays baseball.

12. The person who eats plum is on the left of the person who eats peach, so the person who eats peach must be in the 2nd row, 4th column. This leaves the 2nd row, 3rd column for the person who eats plum.

13. The person who's hobby is puzzles is between the fan of dubstep and the fan of funk, so we already know their position. The person who's hobby is gardening is not specified to be in a specific position, so we can place it anywhere. Let's place it in the 1st row, 1st column for now.

14. The person who drinks almond milk is not specified to be in a specific position, so we can place it anywhere. Let's place it in the 3rd row, 1st column for now.

15. The person who drinks coffee is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, so the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in the 2nd row, 4th column. This leaves the 2nd row, 3rd column for the person who drinks coffee.

16. The person who drinks lemonade is a fan of classical, so they must be in the 2nd row, 2nd column. This leaves the 2nd row, 1st column for the person who drinks almond milk.

17. The person who drinks tea is the person who eats radish, so we already know their position.

18. The person who eats broccoli is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing, so the person who's sport is climbing must be in the 3rd row, 2nd column. This leaves the 3rd row, 3rd column for the person who eats broccoli.

19. The person who eats peach is on the right of the person who eats plum, so we already know their position.

20. The person who eats radish drinks tea, so we already know their position.

Now, let's check the hobbies:
- The person in the 1st row, 1st column has gardening, which is not puzzles, dubstep, or funk, so it's possible.
- The person in the 2nd row, 1st column has writing, which is not puzzles, dubstep, or funk, so it's possible.
- The person in the 2nd row, 4th column has puzzles, which is not gardening, dubstep, or funk, so it's possible.
- The person in the 3rd row, 1st column has a hobby that's not specified, so it's possible.
- The person in the 3rd row, 3rd column has a hobby that's not specified, so it's possible.
- The person in the 4th row, 3rd column has a hobby that's not specified, so it's possible.
- The person in the 4th row, 4th column has fishing, which is not gardening, dubstep, or funk, so it's possible.

All hobbies are possible, so the current arrangement is a valid solution.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-6x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the german is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person driving the bike. Let's place them in the second, third, and fourth positions. Since the hobbies are unique, the first person must be doing chess (far left). So, the hobbies are [chess, skydiving, german, writing].

3. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the canadian. So, the hobbies are [chess, skydiving, german, writing, canadian].

4. The german is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the ship. Since the german is in the third position, the beverages are [almond-milk, fanta, german, soy-milk, sprite].

| Transport     | subway        |            |               |          |

32. From point 1, we know there are 4 different nationalities: brazilian, egyptian, mexican, russian. We've filled in 3 of them, so the remaining nationality must be brazilian.

|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |

| Transport     | subway        |            |               |          |

33. From point 5, we know the person doing weightlifting is the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is in the 2nd row, the sport of the person in the 3rd row must be soccer (since handball is already filled). So, we can fill in the Sport column for the 3rd row with 'soccer'.

|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |

| Transport     | subway        |            |               |          |

35. From point 4, we know the person eating corn is on the left of the russian. Since the russian is in the 4th position, the person eating corn must be in the 3rd position. But we already filled the 3rd position with soccer. So, the person eating corn must be in the 2nd position.

|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |

40. From point 1, we know there are 4 different pets: guinea-pig, hamster, lizard, rat. We've filled in 3 of them, so the remaining pet must be the guinea-pig.

|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |

Lv2-6x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent them as P1, P2, P3, and P4.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. Since we know that there are 4 different beverages, we can assign each person a unique beverage. Let's say P1 drinks 7up, P2 drinks fanta, P3 drinks water, and P4 drinks soy-milk.

3. Now let's fill the Hobby column. Since there are 4 different hobbies, we can assign each person a unique hobby. Let's say P1 has a hobby of card-games, P2 collects, P3 gardens, and P4 reads.

4. Next, let's fill the Job column. Since there are 4 different jobs, we can assign each person a unique job. Let's say P1 is a dancer, P2 is a designer, P3 is a scientist, and P4 is a software-developer.

5. Now let's fill the Movie-Genre column. Since there are 4 different movie genres, we can assign each person a unique genre. Let's say P1 watches crime movies, P2 watches disaster movies, P3 watches scientific movies, and P4 watches family movies.

6. Next, let's fill the Nationality column. Since there are 4 different nationalities, we can assign each person a unique nationality. Let's say P1 is American, P2 is French, P3 is Malaysian, and P4 is Russian.

7. Now let's fill the Transport column. Since there are 4 different means of transport, we can assign each person a unique transport. Let's say P1 drives a car, P2 rides a jet-ski, P3 drives the subway, and P4 takes a taxi.

8. Now we can use the given clues to arrange the people in the correct order:

   - P2 (fanta) is between P3 (Malaysian) and P4 (Russian) (1)
   - P3 (Malaysian) is on the left of P4 (Russian) (10)
   - So, P2 is to the left of P3, and P4 is to the right of P3.

   - P3 (Malaysian) is on the left of P1 (car) (9)
   - P1 (American) is on the left of P2 (jet-ski) (11)
   - So, P3 is to the left of P1, and P2 is to the right of P1.

   - P1 (American) is on the left of P4 (taxi) (5)
   - P4 (Russian) is on the left of P2 (jet-ski) (10)
   - So, P1 is to the left of P4, and P4 is to the left of P2.

   - P3 (Malaysian) is on the left of P2 (fanta) (1)
   - P2 (fanta) is on the right of P1 (7up) (4)
   - So, P3 is to the left of P1, P1 is to the right of P2, and P2 is to the right of P3.

   - P3 (gardening) is on the left of P1 (dancer) (14)
   - P1 (American) is on the left of P2 (designer) (11)
   - So, P3 is to the left of P1, P1 is to the left of P2, and P2 is to the right of P3.

   - P4 (Russian) is on the left of P1 (dancer) (5)
   - P1 (dancer) is on the left of P2 (designer) (11)
   - So, P4 is to the left of P1, P1 is to the left of P2, and P2 is to the right of P4.

   - P2 (disaster) is on the left of P3 (soy-milk) (6)
   - P3 (soy-milk) is on the right of P4 (family) (12)
   - So, P2 is to the left of P3, P3 is to the right of P4, and P4 is to the right of P2.

   - P1 (car) is between P3 (scientist) and P2 (card-games) (9, 11)
   - P3 (scientist) is on the left of P4 (American) (7)
   - So, P1 is to the left of P3, P3 is to the left of P4, and P4 is to the right of P1.

   - P4 (software-developer) is on the right of P1 (7up) (12)

9. Now we have the final solution:

Lv2-6x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the number of options for each category, so we can fill in the number of categories in each row and column.

|               |      1      |       2       |      3       |      4      |

| Transport     | helicopter | quad-bike    | subway       | train       |

2. From point 12, we know the colombian is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. So, colombian must be in column 2 and the quad-bike driver must be in column 4.

|               |      1      |       2       |      3       |      4      |

| Transport     | helicopter | quad-bike    | subway       | train       |

11. From rule 6, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person playing baseball is in the 2nd row, the person playing basketball must be in the 1st row. Since we have already placed the fan of metal in the 1st row, the person playing basketball must be playing juices.

14. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right. Since we have already placed hot-chocolate in the 1st row, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the 4th column. Since the person drinking juice is in the 1st column, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the 3rd column.

15. From rule 5, we know that the person playing lacrosse is the fan of folk. Since we have already placed the person playing basketball in the 1st row, the person playing lacrosse must be in the 2nd row. Since we have already placed the fan of metal in the 1st row, the person playing lacrosse must be playing mirinda.

16. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different pets. Since we have already placed the lizard in the 3rd row, the remaining 3 pets can be placed in the remaining 3 rows. Let's place them in the order they were given: bird, guinea-pig, mouse.

| Sport         |         | Lacrosse | Guinea-Pig|               |

17. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different sports. Since we have already placed basketball and lacrosse in the 1st and 2nd rows, the remaining 2 sports can be placed in the remaining 2 rows. Let's place them in the order they were given: baseball, rowing.

Lv2-6x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the people are arranged in a line, so we can use numbers 1 to 4 to represent the positions.

2. From point 12, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left, so Chinchilla is in position 1.

3. From point 5, the fisherman is on the far left, but we also know from point 6 that the fisherman is Pakistani and the Pakistani is the fisherman, so Pakistani (Fisherman) is in position 1.

4. From point 2, the Argentine is to the left of the British. Since the Pakistani is in position 1, the Argentine must be in position 2 and the British in position 3.

5. From point 11, the person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we know the positions of the Argentine and British, we can place Skydiving (Juice) in position 4.

6. From point 13, the engineer is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we know the positions of the Argentine, British, and Pakistani, the only possible position for the Engineer is position 2.

7. From point 10, the bartender plays basketball. Since we know the positions of the Argentine, British, Pakistani, and Engineer, the only possible position for the Bartender (Basketball) is position 3.

8. From point 4, we know the writer is to the left of the bartender, so the Writer is in position 2.

9. From point 9, the fisherman is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since we know the positions of the Argentine, British, Pakistani, Engineer, and Writer, the only possible position for Hot-Chocolate is position 1.

10. From point 3, the owner of the goldfish is between the Canadian and the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we know the positions of the Argentine, British, Pakistani, Engineer, Writer, and Fisherman, the only possible positions for Goldfish and Cooking are positions 2 and 3, respectively.

11. From point 7, we know the person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is skydiving, so Skydiving (Juice) is in position 4.

12. From point 8, the Writer is in position 2, so Cooking must be in position 3.

13. From point 14, the person drinking milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking, so Milk is in position 4.

Lv2-6x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Italian watches fantasy movies, so let's place them in the first row under the ""Movie-Genre"" column. Since the person driving the tram is between the person driving the trike and the Italian, the Italian can't be driving the tram or the trike. So, let's place the person driving the trike in the third row and the person driving the tram in the fourth row.

2. The Thai owns a frog, so let's place them in the second row under the ""Nationality"" column. Since the frog owner is not the person driving the trike or the tram (as they are already placed), the Thai can't be driving the trike or the tram. So, let's place the Thai in the fourth row under the ""Nationality"" column, and the person driving the helicopter in the third row (since the Japanese is the one driving the helicopter).

3. The Italian watches fantasy movies, so the person watching horror movies must be in the first row (as they are to the left of the person watching zombie movies). Let's place the horror movie viewer in the first row under the ""Movie-Genre"" column. The person watching zombie movies is to the right of the goat owner, so the goat owner must be in the second row. Let's place the zombie movie viewer in the fourth row under the ""Movie-Genre"" column.

4. The person driving the bike is not the Italian, Thai, or the person driving the trike or the tram (as they are already placed). The person driving the bike can't be the person watching horror or zombie movies (as they are already placed). The person driving the bike can't be the designer (as the designer is the skydiving hobbyist), the journalist (as the journalist is to the left of the Thai), or the musician (as the musician is to the right of the Thai). So, let's place the person driving the bike in the first row under the ""Transport"" column.

5. The designer is the skydiving hobbyist, so let's place the designer in the third row under the ""Job"" column. The designer can't be the person driving the bike, the Italian, the Thai, or the person driving the trike (as they are already placed). The designer can't be the person watching horror or zombie movies (as they are already placed). So, let's place the designer in the second row under the ""Job"" column.

6. The journalist is to the left of the Thai, so let's place the journalist in the first row under the ""Job"" column. The journalist can't be the person driving the bike, the Italian, or the person driving the trike (as they are already placed). The journalist can't be the person watching horror or zombie movies (as they are already placed).

7. The musician is to the right of the Thai, so let's place the musician in the fourth row under the ""Job"" column. The musician can't be the person driving the bike, the Italian, the Thai, or the person driving the trike (as they are already placed). The musician can't be the person watching horror or zombie movies (as they are already placed).

8. The person who's hobby is hiking is between the Italian and the person driving the trike. Since the Italian and the person driving the trike are already placed, the hiker must be in the second row. The hiker can't be the person driving the bike, the designer, the journalist, the Thai, or the person watching horror or zombie movies (as they are already placed). So, let's place the hiker in the second row under the ""Hobby"" column.

9. The person who's hobby is woodworking is to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake owner is not yet placed, let's place the woodworker in the fourth row under the ""Hobby"" column. The woodworker can't be the person driving the bike, the designer, the journalist, the Thai, the Italian, the person driving the trike, the person watching horror or zombie movies, or the hiker (as they are already placed).

10. The owner of the snake is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, so let's place the snake owner in the fifth column under the ""Hobby"" column. The snake owner can't be the person driving the bike, the designer, the journalist, the Thai, the Italian, the person driving the trike, the person watching horror or zombie movies, or the hiker (as they are already placed).

11. The nigerian is to the right of the writer, so let's place the nigerian in the fifth column under the ""Nationality"" column. The nigerian can't be the person driving the bike, the designer, the journalist, the Thai, the Italian, the person driving the trike, the person watching horror or zombie movies, the hiker, the woodworker, or the snake owner (as they are already placed).

12. The writer can't be the person driving the bike, the designer, the journalist, the Thai, the Italian, the person driving the trike, the person watching horror or zombie movies, the hiker, the woodworker, the snake owner, the nigerian, or the goat owner (as they are already placed). So, let's place the writer in the first column under the ""Job"" column.

13. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the Thai. Since the Thai is already placed, the skydiver must be in the first row. The skydiver can't be the person driving the bike, the writer, the journalist, the nigerian, the Italian, the person driving the trike, the person watching horror or zombie movies, the hiker, the woodworker, or the snake owner (as they are already placed). So, let's place the skydiver in the first row under the ""Hobby"" column.

Lv2-6x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the favorite beverages, food, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and sports. Let's fill in these categories with the given options.

3. From point 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the freelancer. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling (point 3), and the freelancer is not specified yet, we can place the comedy watcher between cycling and skateboarding. Let's place the freelancer in the remaining spot.

4. The person watching romance movies is on the far right (point 2), so we can place the accountant (who is watching romance, point 5) in the rightmost spot.

5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling (point 3), so we can place skateboarding in the third spot from the right. Since the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (point 8), we can place sprite in the rightmost spot, and the person drinking sprite is the skateboarder.

6. The person drinking coffee is between the mexican and the person drinking 7up (point 10), so we can place coffee in the second spot from the right. Since the person eating peach is on the right of the person drinking coffee (point 7), we can place peach in the rightmost spot, and the person eating peach is the scientist (point 6).

7. The person eating watermelon is the person who's sport is cycling (point 13), so we can place watermelon in the first spot.

8. The british is the person eating avocado (point 12), so we can place avocado in the second spot.

9. The person watching animation movies is the person eating peach (point 9), so we have already placed animation in the rightmost spot.

10. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left (point 11), so we can place volleyball in the first spot.

Now, let's fill in the jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and sports:

|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |

| Nationality   | mexican    | spanish   |      malaysian |  british   |
| Sport         | cycling    | manager   |      skateboarding|  water-polo|

However, we still don't know the job, movie-genre, nationality, and sport for the third person. Let's try to solve this by process of elimination:

1. The person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the manager (since the manager is watching comedy, and we placed the manager in the third spot), so the manager must be watching comedy.

2. The person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the british (since the british is watching romance, and we placed the british in the second spot), so the british must be watching animation.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the mexican (since the mexican is drinking coffee, and we placed the mexican in the second spot), so the mexican must be drinking 7up.

4. The person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the person drinking sprite (since the person drinking sprite is the skateboarder, and we placed the skateboarder in the rightmost spot), so the person drinking sprite must be the malaysian.

5. The person watching martial-arts movies cannot be the person eating watermelon (since the person eating watermelon is the cyclist, and we placed the cyclist in the first spot), so the person eating watermelon must be the freelancer.

Now, let's fill in the missing information:
