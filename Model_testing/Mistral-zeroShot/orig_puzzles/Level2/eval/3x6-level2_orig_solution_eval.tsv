Lv2-3x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, pets, and transport, but we don't have any initial positions yet. Let's assign them arbitrarily for now.

| Nationality   | Pet           | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| A (Australian) | P1 (chinchilla) | T1 (airplane) |
| C (Chinese)   | P2 (goldfish) | T2 (boat)     |
| E (Egyptian)  | P3 (horse)    | T3 (car)      |
| I (Italian)   | P4 (lizard)   | T4 (taxi)     |
| G (German)    | P5 (rat)      | T5 (tram)     |
| T (Thai)      | P6 (snake)    | T6 (van)      |

Now let's apply the given conditions:

2. The person driving the airplane (T1) is on the far right, so A (Australian) is in the 6th column.
3. The person driving the airplane (T1) is on the right of the person driving the tram (T5), so E (Egyptian) is in the 5th column.
4. The owner of the horse (P3) is the person driving the airplane (T1), so E (Egyptian) is also P3.
5. The owner of the goldfish (P2) is on the right of the person driving the car (T3), so I (Italian) is in the 4th column and P2 is next to I.
6. The owner of the lizard (P4) is on the left of the Italian (I), so I (Italian) is in the 5th row and P4 is in the 6th row.
7. The owner of the snake (P6) is on the right of the person driving the taxi (T4), so T (Thai) is in the 6th column and P6 is next to T.
8. The chinese (C) is on the left of the person driving the boat (T2), so C is in the 1st column.
9. The thai (T) is on the left of the Australian (A), so T is in the 2nd column.
10. The italian (I) is the owner of the goldfish (P2), which we already placed next to I.
11. The thai (T) is on the right of the owner of the goldfish (I), so T is in the 3rd column.
12. The thai (T) is between the person driving the tram (E) and the owner of the goldfish (I). Since T is in the 3rd column, E must be in the 2nd column and I in the 4th column.
13. The person driving the airplane (E) is between the Egyptian (E) and the owner of the rat (G). Since E is in the 5th column, G must be in the 4th column.

Now we have the final positions:

| Nationality   | Pet           | Transport     |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| A (Australian) | P1 (chinchilla) | T1 (airplane) |
| C (Chinese)   | P2 (goldfish) | T2 (boat)     |
| E (Egyptian)  | P3 (horse)    | T3 (car)      |
| I (Italian)   | P4 (lizard)   | T4 (taxi)     |
| G (German)    | P5 (rat)      | T5 (tram)     |
| T (Thai)      | P6 (snake)    | T6 (van)      |

So the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person watching animation movies is the person drinking juice (J). So, we can place Juice in the first column and Animation in the first row.

2. The person drinking sprite is the person watching superhero movies (S). Since we know that Juice is on the far left, Sprite cannot be in the first column. So, Sprite must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

3. The person drinking milk is the owner of the turtle (T). Since Juice is on the far left, Milk cannot be in the first column. So, Milk must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

5. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee (C). Since Juice is on the far left, Coffee cannot be in the first column. So, Coffee must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Documentary (Doc) must be on the left of Coffee, so it can be in the first, second, or third column.

6. The person drinking juice is the owner of the ferret (F). So, Ferret must be in the first column.

7. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person watching animation movies and the owner of the lizard (L). Since we know that Juice is on the far left, Almond-milk (A) must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. It cannot be in the first column because it should be between Animation and Lizard. Since we know that Ferret is on the far left, Lizard cannot be in the first column. So, Lizard must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

8. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know that Lizard is not in the first column, Scientific (Sci) cannot be in the first row. So, Sci must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth row.

11. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person drinking sprite (S). Since we know that Documentary is in the first column, Fantasy (Fan) cannot be in the first column. So, Fan must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

12. The person drinking juice is the owner of the ferret (F). We already placed Ferret in the first column.

13. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person watching animation movies and the owner of the lizard (L). We already placed Juice and Ferret in the first column. So, Almond-milk (A) must be in the second column.

14. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (A). Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Scientific (Sci) must be in the fourth row.

15. The person watching western movies is on the left of the owner of the horse (H). Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Western (West) must be in the third row.

16. The owner of the chinchilla (Ch) is on the far right. Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Chinchilla (Ch) must be in the sixth row.

17. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person drinking sprite (S). Since we know that Documentary is in the first column, Fantasy (Fan) must be in the third column.

18. The person drinking coffee (C) is on the right of the person watching documentary movies (Doc). Since we know that Documentary is in the first column, Coffee (C) must be in the second row.

19. The person drinking milk (M) is the owner of the turtle (T). Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Milk (M) must be in the fifth row.

20. The person drinking sprite (S) is the person watching superhero movies (S). Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Sprite (S) must be in the sixth column.

21. The person drinking juice (J) is the owner of the ferret (F). We already placed Ferret in the first column.

22. The person watching animation movies is on the far left. Since we know that Juice is in the first column, Animation (Anim) must be in the first row.

23. The owner of the lizard (L) is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (A). Since we know that Almond-milk is in the second column, Lizard (L) must be in the third row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the paramedic is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column and the first row. Let's put them in position (1,1).

2. Since the paramedic is on the left of the fan of soul, the fan of soul must be in the second column. Let's put them in position (1,2).

3. The person driving the train is the fan of soul, so we can place them in position (2,2).

4. The fan of reggae is on the left of the bartender, so the bartender must be in the third column. Let's put them in position (1,3).

5. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the bartender, so the jet-ski driver must be in the fourth column. Let's put them in position (1,4).

6. The fan of blues is on the far right, so they must be in the sixth column. Let's put them in position (1,6).

7. The person driving the bus is on the right of the fan of classical, so the fan of classical must be in the fifth column. Let's put them in position (1,5).

8. The person driving the bus is on the left of the fan of country, so the fan of country must be in the second column. This means the person driving the bus must be in the first column, which contradicts our initial placement of the paramedic. We need to swap the paramedic and the bus driver. So, the paramedic goes to position (1,2) and the bus driver goes to position (1,1).

9. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the bus driver is now in the first column, the subway driver must be in the second column. Let's put them in position (1,2). This means the trike driver must be in the third column. Let's put them in position (1,3).

10. The nurse is between the fan of house and the person driving the train. Since the fan of soul and the train driver are already placed, the nurse must be in the fourth column. Let's put them in position (1,4). This means the fan of house must be in the fifth column. Let's put them in position (1,5).

11. The firefighter is on the right of the fan of house and on the right of the entrepreneur. Since the fan of house and the entrepreneur's positions are already determined, the firefighter must be in the sixth column. Let's put them in position (1,6). The entrepreneur must be in the fifth column. Let's put them in position (1,5).

12. The entrepreneur is on the left of the firefighter, so the entrepreneur is in position (1,5) and the firefighter is in position (1,6).

13. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the fan of soul, so they must be in the first column. This means the helicopter driver must be in the same row as the fan of blues, which is the sixth row. Let's put them in position (6,1).

14. The only remaining position is (6,6) for the job. Since all jobs have been assigned to other positions, this position must be empty.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv2-3x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 7, the hamster is on the far left, and the owner of the hamster is the Thai (rule 8). So, the Thai is in the first column.

2. From rule 11, the Australian is between the Chinese and the Dutch. Since the Thai is on the far left, the Chinese must be in the second column, and the Dutch in the third column. So, we have:

   |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
   |----|----|----|----|----|----|
   | Thai |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   | Chinese | Dutch |   |   |   |

3. From rule 10, the Dutch is doing parkour. Since we know the nationalities of the first three columns, the only sport left for the fourth column is volleyball (as all other sports are taken). So, the fourth column is:

   |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |
   |----|----|----|----|----|----|
   | Thai | Chinese | Dutch | Volleyball |   |   |

4. From rule 12, the owner of the dog is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we know the sport of the fourth column, the dog must be in the sixth column. The only nationality left for the sixth column is Australian (as all other nationalities are taken). So, the sixth column is:

   |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 | Australian |
   |----|----|----|----|----|------------|
   | Thai | Chinese | Dutch | Volleyball |   | Dog |

5. From rule 2, the owner of the dog is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since we know the position of the dog, the person doing golf must be in the fifth column. The only sport left for the fifth column is climbing (as all other sports are taken). So, the fifth column is:

   |  1 |  2 |  3 |  4 | Climbing | Australian |
   |----|----|----|----|---------|------------|
   | Thai | Chinese | Dutch | Volleyball |   | Dog |

6. From rule 9, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we know the position of the person doing golf, the rabbit must be in the sixth column. The only nationality left for the second column is German (as all other nationalities are taken). So, the second column is:

   |  1 | German |  3 |  4 | Climbing | Australian |
   |----|-------|----|----|---------|------------|
   | Thai | Chinese | Dutch | Volleyball |   | Dog |
   |     |       |     |         |       |       |
   |     |       |     |         |       |       |

   |     |       |     |         |       |       |

7. From rule 1, the owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we know the position of the person doing volleyball, the horse must be in the third column. The only nationality left for the third column is Japanese (as all other nationalities are taken). So, the third column is:

   |  1 | German | Japanese |  4 | Climbing | Australian |
   |----|-------|---------|----|---------|------------|
   | Thai | Chinese |   | Volleyball |   | Dog |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |

   |     |       |       |         |       |       |

8. From rule 3, the person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since we know the position of the guinea-pig owner (the Japanese), the biathlon must be in the fifth column. The only nationality left for the fourth column is Chinese (as all other nationalities are taken). So, the fourth column is:

   |  1 | German | Japanese | Chinese | Biathlon | Australian |
   |----|-------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
   | Thai | Chinese |   | Volleyball |   | Dog |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |
   |     |       |       |         |       |       |

9. From rule 5, the Japanese is the owner of the guinea-pig. This matches our current arrangement.

10. From rule 6, the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's sport is baseball. Since we know the position of the guinea-pig owner, the baseball must be in the first column. The only nationality left for the first column is Australian (as all other nationalities are taken). So, the first column is:

    | Australian | German | Japanese | Chinese | Biathlon | Volleyball |
    |-----------|-------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
    | Baseball  |   |   |   |   |   |
    |   | Chinese |   | Volleyball |   | Dog |
    |   |       |       |         |       |       |
    |   |       |       |         |       |       |
    |   |       |       |         |       |       |
    |   |       |       |         |       |       |

11. From rule 4, the owner of the horse is on the left of the Japanese. Since we know the position of the Japanese, the horse must be in the second column. The only pet left for the second column is the rabbit (as all other pets are taken). So, the second column is:

    | Australian | Rabbit | Japanese | Chinese | Biathlon | Volleyball |
    |-----------|-------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
    | Baseball  |   |   |   |   |   |
    |   |   |   | Volleyball |   | Dog |
    |   |   | Japanese |   |   |   |
    |   |   |       |       |       |   |
    |   |   |       |       |       |   |
    |   |   |       |       |       |   |

12. From rule 1, the owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we know the position of the person doing volleyball, this rule is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

   | Australian | Rabbit | Japanese | Chinese | Biathlon | Volleyball |
   |-----------|-------|---------|--------|---------|------------|
   | Baseball  |   |   |   |   |   |
   |   |   |   | Volleyball |   | Dog |

Lv2-3x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating cherry is the person who's hobby is baking (row 1, column 2), so we can place baking in the hobby column of row 2. Since baking is on the far right, we can place cherry in column 6 of the food column.

2. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (row 6, column 1). Since we don't know the position of mirinda yet, we can't place skydiving yet.

3. The person eating eggplant is the person drinking sprite (row 3, column 1). So, we can place sprite in the beverage column of row 3 and eggplant in the food column of row 3.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far right (column 6), so it can't be in any other column.

5. The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (row 6, column 3). Since we don't know the position of hot-chocolate yet, we can't place singing yet. However, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is the person drinking hot-chocolate (row 6, column 3), so we can place reading in the hobby column of row 6.

6. The person who's hobby is singing is the person eating pomegranate (row 5, column 6). So, we can place pomegranate in the food column of row 5.

7. The person drinking tea is between the person eating papaya and the person who's hobby is hiking (row 4, column 2). Since we don't know the position of hiking yet, we can't place tea yet. However, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person eating papaya (row 2, column 1), so we can place skydiving in the hobby column of row 2.

8. The person eating cherry is on the right of the person eating papaya (column 6 is right of column 2), so we can place papaya in column 5.

9. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking fanta (column 3 is right of column 1), so we can place fanta in column 1.

10. The person eating blueberry is on the far left (column 1), so we can place blueberry in the food column of row 1.

11. Now we have the following table:

| Beverage   | fanta | sprite | tea  |   | pomegranate |
| Food       | blueberry | eggplant | papaya | cherry | pomegranate |
| Hobby      | singing | reading | skydiving | baking | hiking |

We still need to place hiking and tea.

12. Since the person drinking tea is between the person eating papaya and the person who's hobby is hiking (column 2), we can place tea in column 2.

Now we have the final solution:

#############

Lv2-3x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is drawing (8), so we can place the bird owner in the ""Drawing"" row and the ""Bird"" column.

2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (1), so the person watching disaster movies must be in the row above and to the left of the bird owner. Let's place Disaster Movies in the ""Disaster"" row and the column to the left of the ""Bird"" column.

3. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (2), so we can place Zombie Movies in the row above and to the right of the Disaster Movies.

4. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (3), so we can place Singing in the row above the Guinea-Pig row and to the left of the column with the Guinea-Pig. Since the owner of the chinchilla is also the person who's hobby is singing (10), we can place the Chinchilla in the same column as the Guinea-Pig.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching crime movies (5), so we can place Crime Movies in the row above the Chinchilla row and to the left of the Chinchilla column.

8. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (6), so we can place Traveling in the row below the Collecting row and to the right of the Collecting column.

9. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla (9), so we can place Fishing in the row above the Chinchilla row and to the left of the Chinchilla column. This placement conflicts with our previous placement (7), so we need to adjust the placement of Fishing. Let's place Fishing in the row below the Turtle row and to the right of the Turtle column.

10. The person watching romance movies is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person watching scientific movies (11), so we can place Romance Movies in the row below the Traveling row and to the right of the Traveling column, and Scientific Movies in the row below the Traveling row and to the right of the Romance Movies column.

11. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching disaster movies (12), so we can place Traveling in the row below the Disaster Movies row and to the left of the Disaster Movies column.

12. The person watching scientific movies is between the person who's hobby is collecting and the person who's hobby is fishing (13), so we can place Scientific Movies in the row below the Collecting row and to the right of the Collecting column, and Fishing in the row below the Turtle row and to the right of the Turtle column.

Lv2-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The bus driver is on the left of the person eating tomato. Let's place the bus driver in the first position and the tomato eater in position 6. So, we have `[Bus]` and `[Tomato]`.

2. The van driver is on the left of the turtle owner. Since the turtle owner is on the far right, the van driver cannot be in the first position. So, the van driver must be in position 2, and the turtle owner in position 6. So, we have `[Bus, Van]` and `[Tomato, Turtle]`.

3. The roller driver is the person eating tomato. So, the roller driver is in position 6. So, we have `[Bus, Van, Roller]` and `[Tomato, Turtle]`.

4. The owner of the pony is between the person eating blueberry and the owner of the rabbit. Since the turtle owner is on the far right, the pony owner cannot be in the last position. Also, the pony owner cannot be in the first position because the roller driver is the tomato eater. So, the pony owner can only be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the pony owner in position 4 for now. So, we have `[Bus, Van, Roller, Pony]` and `[Tomato, Turtle, Blueberry, Rabbit]`.

5. The owner of the turtle is on the far right. This is already satisfied.

6. The jet-ski driver is on the right of the van driver. Since the van driver is in position 2, the jet-ski driver must be in position 3. So, we have `[Bus, Van, Roller, Pony, Jet-ski]` and `[Tomato, Turtle, Blueberry, Rabbit]`.

8. The owner of the pony is between the owner of the horse and the person driving the roller.

So, we have `[Bus, Horse, Van, Pony, Jet-ski, Apple, Roller]` and `[Tomato, Turtle, Blueberry, Rabbit]`.

9. The owner of the pony is between the person eating blueberry and the owner of the rabbit. Since the pony owner is in position 4 and the rabbit owner is the last, the blueberry eater must be in position 5. So, we have `[Bus, Horse, Van, Pony, Jet-ski, Blueberry, Rabbit, Apple, Roller]` and `[Tomato, Turtle]`.

10. The person eating plum is on the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the blueberry eater is in position 5, the plum eater must be in position 6. So, we have `[Bus, Horse, Van, Pony, Jet-ski, Blueberry, Rabbit, Plum, Apple, Roller]` and `[Tomato, Turtle]`.

11. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left. So, the motorbike driver must be in position 1. So, we have `[Motorbike, Bus, Horse, Van, Pony, Jet-ski, Blueberry, Rabbit, Plum, Apple, Roller]` and `[Tomato, Turtle]`.

12. The person eating peach is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is not determined yet, let's place the peach eater in position 7 for now. So, we have `[Motorbike, Bus, Horse, Van, Pony, Jet-ski, Blueberry, Rabbit, Plum, Apple, Roller, Peach]` and `[Tomato, Turtle, Goat]`.

13. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left. This is already satisfied.

Lv2-3x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label the people A to F from left to right.

2. We know the beverages, movie-genres, and sports, so we can start filling in the table with these. Let's start with the beverages:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Sport |
   |----------|------------|-------|
   | 7up      |            |       |

   | water     |            |       |

4. From rule 9, we know that the person drinking mirinda is the person who's sport is golf. So, golf must be in the same row as mirinda. Since golf can't be A, B, or C (because those are already taken), it must be D or E. Let's try golf in position D for now.

12. The person who's hobby is board-games is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking almond-milk (rule 12). Since the tea and almond-milk persons are already placed, the board-games person must be in the 3rd column.

|            | almond-milk| analyst  | board-games| hiking     | woodworking| coach      | tea         |

13. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (rule 4). Since the board-games person is already placed, the reading person must be in the 2nd column.

|            | almond-milk| analyst  | reading    | board-games| hiking     | woodworking| coach      | tea         |

14. The only remaining job is the dressmaker. Since it can't be in the 1st column (because it's already occupied), it must be in the 1st column. But that would mean the almond-milk person is not between the analyst and the hiking person (rule 11), which is a contradiction.

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, and it's not possible to solve it with the given information."	{'beverage': ['', '', '', '', '', 'mirinda', '', ''], 'hobby': ['', '', '', '', 'camping', '', '', ''], 'job': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	1	False
