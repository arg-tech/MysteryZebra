Lv2-7x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on the given conditions.

   - The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left (position 1).
   - The fan of punk is the person drinking iced-tea (rule 14).
   - The mechanic is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing (rule 2). The mechanic can't be in position 1, so they must be in position 2. The person who's sport is surfing must be in position 3 or 6. If they were in position 3, the mechanic would be in position 2, but the fan of electronic is on the left of the mechanic (rule 2), so the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 6. So, the mechanic is in position 2, and the person who's sport is surfing is in position 6.
   - The person who's hobby is cooking is the person watching crime movies (rule 3). Since the mechanic is in position 2, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in an even position (4, 6, or 7). Let's place them in position 4 for now.
   - The fan of indie is in the middle (rule 18). Since the mechanic is in position 2 and the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 4, the fan of indie must be in position 5.
   - The fan of electronic is on the left of the mechanic (rule 2). Since the mechanic is in position 2, the fan of electronic must be in position 1.
   - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the fan of jazz (rule 21). The fan of jazz can't be in position 1 (since the fan of electronic is there), so the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 1.
   - The owner of the mouse is on the right of the fan of ambient (rule 25). The fan of ambient can't be in position 1 (since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is there), so the owner of the mouse must be in position 2.
   - The owner of the mouse is between the person drinking sprite and the teacher (rule 13). Since the owner of the mouse is in position 2, the person drinking sprite must be in position 3, and the teacher must be in position 4.
   - The person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the hamster (rule 27). The owner of the hamster can't be in position 1 (since the fan of electronic is there), so the person drinking fanta must be in position 1.
   - The person watching horror movies is between the person watching action movies and the person who's sport is tennis (rule 20). Since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 4, the person watching horror movies must be in position 5 or 7. Let's place them in position 5 for now.
   - The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (rule 23). The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the fan of house (rule 19), so they must be in position 6 or 7. If they were in position 7, the person watching satire movies would be in position 5, but the person watching horror movies is already there, so the person watching satire movies must be in position 6. So, the person watching satire movies is in position 6, and the person who's sport is water-polo is in position 7.
   - The person who's hobby is photography is the person drinking fanta (rule 33).
   - The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is handball and the person who's hobby is photography (rule 22). Since the person who's hobby is photography is in position 1, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 2.
   - The person watching family movies is on the left of the person drinking fanta (rule 32). Since the person drinking fanta is in position 1, the person watching family movies must be in position 0 (the far left, outside the table).
   - The owner of the ferret is on the left of the fan of punk (rule 4). Since the fan of punk is in position 1, the owner of the ferret must be in position 0.
   - The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies (not explicitly stated but implied by rule 20). Since the person watching horror movies is in position 5, the person watching action movies must be in position 4.
   - The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person watching horror movies (rule 20). Since the person watching horror movies is in position 5, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 6.
   - The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving (rule 16). Since the person who's hobby is skydiving can't be in position 7 (since the person who's sport is water-polo is there), the person who's hobby is hiking must be in position 7. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 6.
   - The coach is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (rule 17). Since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 6 (since the owner of the turtle is the person who's hobby is chess, and the owner of the turtle is in position 6), the coach must be in position 5.
   - The person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the fan of indie (rule 30). Since the fan of indie is in position 5, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 4.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |       4       |     5      |      6      |    7     |

| Food          |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Nationality   |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Pet           |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Sport         |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Transport     |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |

From the information we have, we know that:
- Beverage 1 cannot be 7Up, Lemonade, Sprite, or Soy-milk (already assigned)
- Beverage 1 cannot be Milk (implies that Milk is not in position 1 or 7, and Quad-bike is between Indonesian and Milk)
- Beverage 1 cannot be Almond-milk (implies that Almond-milk is on the left of Handball, and Handball is Dubstep)

The only remaining beverage is Tea. So, Beverage 1 is Tea.

Now we can fill in the table:

|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |       4       |     5      |      6      |    7     |
| Beverage      | Tea          | soy-    |            |               |            |             |          |
| Food          |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Nationality   |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Pet           |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Sport         |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |
| Transport     |              |          |            |               |            |             |          |

We can continue this process to fill in the rest of the table. However, the puzzle is too complex to solve completely in this format. I recommend using a spreadsheet or a similar tool to keep track of the information and solve the puzzle step by step.

The final solution table will be:
