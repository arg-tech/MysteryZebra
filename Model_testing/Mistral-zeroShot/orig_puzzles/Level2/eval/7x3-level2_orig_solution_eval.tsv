Lv2-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the nationalities to the three rows:
   - Row 1: Colombian (C)
   - Row 2: German (G)
   - Row 3: Italian (I)

2. Since the Colombian (C) is a skydiving enthusiast and is on the left of the person eating lemon, we can place the lemon eater in row 1 and the skydiving hobby in column 3. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |            |            |               |
   | Food          | Lemon      |            |               |
   | Hobby         | Skydiving  |            |               |
   | Job           |            |            |               |
   | Music-Genre   |            |            |               |
   | Nationality   | C          |            |               |
   | Sport         |            |            | Tennis        |

3. The German (G) plays tennis, so we can place tennis in row 2's sport column. Since the tennis player is on the left of the designer, the designer must be in row 1. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |            |            |               |
   | Food          | Lemon      |            |               |
   | Hobby         | Skydiving  |            |               |
   | Job           | Designer   | Accountant | Mechanic      |
   | Music-Genre   |            |            |               |
   | Nationality   | C          |            |               |
   | Sport         |            | Tennis     | Water-polo     |

4. The person drinking soy-milk is between the Italian (I) and the person drinking mirinda. Since the Italian (I) is in row 3, the soy-milk drinker must be in row 2, and the mirinda drinker must be in row 1. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Soy-milk   |            |
   | Food          | Lemon      |            | Spinach     |
   | Hobby         | Skydiving  |            |             |
   | Job           | Designer   | Accountant | Mechanic    |
   | Music-Genre   |            | Country    | Dubstep     |
   | Nationality   | C          |            | I           |
   | Sport         |            | Tennis     | Water-polo   |

5. The fan of d&b is on the left of the Colombian (C), so d&b must be in row 1. Since the designer is in row 1, the d&b fan must be in column 4. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Soy-milk   | D&B          |
   | Food          | Lemon      |            | Spinach     |
   | Hobby         | Skydiving  |            |             |
   | Job           | Designer   | Accountant | Mechanic    |
   | Music-Genre   | Country    |            | Dubstep     |
   | Nationality   | C          |            | I           |
   | Sport         | Tennis     |            | Water-polo   |

6. The person who's hobby is reading is on the far left, so reading must be in row 1. Since d&b is already in row 1, reading must be in column 1. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Soy-milk   | D&B          |
   | Food          | Reading    | Lemon      | Spinach     |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Skydiving  |             |
   | Job           | Designer   | Accountant | Mechanic    |
   | Music-Genre   | Country    |            | Dubstep     |
   | Nationality   | C          |            | I           |
   | Sport         | Tennis     |            | Water-polo   |

7. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the fan of country. Since the fan of country is in row 2, the water-polo player must be in row 1. But we already have tennis in row 1, so this condition cannot be satisfied. There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

However, with the information given, we can fill in the table up to this point:

   |               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Mirinda    | Soy-milk   | D&B          |
   | Food          | Reading    | Lemon      | Spinach     |
   | Hobby         | Reading    | Skydiving  |             |
   | Job           | Designer   | Accountant | Mechanic    |

   | Sport         | Tennis     | Water-polo  |             |

The rest of the table cannot be filled in due to the contradiction in the puzzle."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport) and 3 values for each variable.

2. Let's assign the values for each variable:
   - Beverage: iced-tea, juice, sprite
   - Food: apricot, nectarine, pear
   - Movie-Genre: adventure, animation, disaster
   - Music-Genre: metal, punk, rock
   - Nationality: australian, british, dutch
   - Pet: dog, horse, pony
   - Sport: baseball, water-polo, weightlifting

3. From point 1, we know that the pony owner is British, so we can place the British in the Pet column and the Pony in the corresponding row. Let's place them in the 3rd row.

4. The pony owner watches disaster movies, so we can place disaster in the Movie-Genre column in the 3rd row.

5. The owner of the pony is on the right of the owner of the dog. Since the pony is in the 3rd row, the dog owner must be in the 1st or 2nd row. Let's place the dog in the 1st row for now.

6. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the fan of rock. Since disaster is in the 3rd row, the fan of rock must be in the 1st or 2nd row as well. Let's place rock in the 2nd row for now.

7. The person watching disaster movies is to the right of the fan of rock, so the fan of rock must be in the 1st row.

8. The person who's sport is baseball is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking iced-tea. Since baseball is in the 3rd row, the juice and iced-tea must be in the 1st and 2nd rows, respectively.

9. The fan of punk is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since weightlifting is in the 3rd row, punk must be in the 1st or 2nd row. Let's place punk in the 1st row for now.

10. The person eating apricot is the person watching adventure movies. Since apricot is the only food left, it must be in the 1st row.

11. The dutch is on the far left, so they must be in the 1st row. Since the dutch is already placed as the fan of punk, we don't need to change anything.

12. The person eating pear is on the left of the pony owner. Since the pony owner is in the 3rd row, the person eating pear must be in the 2nd row.

13. The person drinking juice is the fan of metal. Since juice is already placed in the 1st row, we don't need to change anything.

Lv2-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating kale owns a hedgehog, so let's place the hedgehog owner in the 3rd column and the kale eater in the row corresponding to the 3rd column (since there are only 3 types of food, we can cycle through them). Let's place the kale eater in the 3rd row for now.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

2. The Russian is the person who does magic-tricks, so let's place the Russian in the 2nd column and the magic-trick hobby in the row corresponding to the 2nd column. Since there are only 3 nationalities, we can cycle through them. Let's place the Russian in the 2nd row for now.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

3. The person watching adventure movies is the person eating peas, so let's place the peas eater in the 3rd row and the adventure movie watcher in the 1st column.

4. The person watching satire movies is the owner of the hedgehog, but we already know that the hedgehog owner is in the 3rd row. So, the satire movie watcher must be in the 1st column.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

   | Sport         |         |         | swimming     |

5. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the satire movie watcher is in the 1st column, the swimmer must be in the 2nd column.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

6. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the swimmer is in the 2nd column, the sailor must be in the 1st column.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

   | Sport         | swimming|         |             |

7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is between the indian and the fan of r&b. Since the indian is in the 2nd column and the r&b fan is yet to be placed, the skydiver must be in the 3rd column.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

8. The indian is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the indian is in the 2nd column, the fan of folk must be in the 1st column.

   |               |     1     |     2     |      3       |

9. The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the hedgehog owner is in the 3rd column and we haven't placed the climber yet, the climber must be in the 1st or 2nd column. However, since the indian is on the left of the climber, the climber cannot be in the 1st column. So, the climber must be in the 2nd column.

   | Sport         | swimming|         | climbing     |

10. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the kale eater is in the 3rd row and the mouse owner is yet to be placed, the mouse owner must be in the 2nd or 3rd column. However, since the hedgehog owner is on the right of the mouse owner, the mouse owner cannot be in the 3rd column. So, the mouse owner must be in the 2nd column.

   | Sport         | swimming|         | climbing     |

11. The indian is the person eating peas. Since the indian is in the 2nd column, the peas eater must be in the 3rd row. However, we already have the peas eater in the 3rd row. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the peas eater is in the 3rd row was incorrect. Let's try placing the peas eater in the 1st row instead.

1. We know the nationalities, pets, beverages, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, and music-genres. We also have some clues about their positions and relationships. Let's start by placing the nationalities and pets:

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      |             |                | soy-          |

   | Job           |             |                |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Music-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |

2. Now let's place the beverages based on the nationalities:

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| milk          | soy-          |
   | Hobby         |             |                |               |
   | Job           |             |                |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Music-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |

3. The lizard owner is on the right of the person drinking milk. So, the lizard owner is in position 3, and the person drinking milk is in position 2:

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| milk          | soy-          |

   | Music-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |
   | Hobby         |             |                |               |
   | Job           |             |                |               |

4. The person drinking almond-milk is the malaysian. We already placed the malaysian, so the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1:

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| milk          | soy-          |

   | Music-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |
   | Hobby         |             |                |               |
   | Job           |             |                |               |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |

5. The fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of country. Since we know the nationalities, we can deduce the music-genres:

   - The malaysian drinks almond-milk, so the fan of country (which is the malaysian) cannot be a fan of jazz.
   - The only remaining option for the fan of jazz is position 3.

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| milk          | soy-          |

   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |

   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |

6. The fan of country is between the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know the movie-genres, we can deduce the movie-genres:

   - The person drinking almond-milk (the malaysian) watches country movies.
   - The only remaining option for the person watching disaster movies is position 2 (since position 3 is occupied by the fan of jazz).

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| disaster      | soy-          |

   | Music-Genre   | country     | pop           | jazz          |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |

   | Job           |             |                |               |

7. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we know the hobbies, we can deduce the hobbies:

   - The person drinking milk (the egyptian) has a hobby other than chess, fishing, or sudoku (since the malaysian watches country movies and the lizard owner is the fan of jazz). The only remaining hobby is sudoku.

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| disaster      | soy-          |
   | Hobby         |             |                |               |

   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Music-Genre   | country     | pop           | jazz          |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |
   | Hobby         |             | sudoku         |               |
   | Job           |             |                |               |

8. The malaysian is on the left of the egyptian. Since we know the nationalities, this is already satisfied.

9. The fan of country is the person who's hobby is sudoku. This is already satisfied.

10. The musician is the owner of the mouse. Since we know the jobs, we can deduce the jobs:

    - The person drinking milk (the egyptian) cannot be the musician, since the musician is on the left of the person drinking milk (according to clue 9).
    - The only remaining option for the musician is position 3.

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| disaster      | soy-          |
   | Hobby         |             | sudoku         |               |
   | Job           |             |                | musician      |
   | Movie-Genre   |             |                |               |
   | Music-Genre   | country     | pop           | jazz          |
   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |

11. The person drinking milk is between the musician and the social-worker. Since we know the jobs, we can deduce the jobs:

    - The person drinking milk (the egyptian) is between the musician (position 3) and the social-worker (since the only remaining job is security-guard, and the security-guard cannot be on the left of the musician according to clue 8).

   |               |      1      |       2        |       3       |
   | Beverage      | almond-milk| disaster      | soy-          |
   | Hobby         |             | sudoku         |               |
   | Job           |             |                | musician      |

   | Nationality   | malaysian   | egyptian       | dutch          |
   | Pet           | ferret      | lizard         | mouse          |
   | Hobby         |             | sudoku         |               |
   | Job           | social-worker|                | musician      |

12. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since we know the pets and jobs, we can deduce the jobs:

    - The owner of the mouse (the musician) is on the left of the person watching sports movies. However, the only remaining position for the person watching sports movies is position 1, which is occupied by the person drinking almond-milk (the malaysian). This contradicts the fact that the musician is on the left of the person watching sports movies.

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, as the current solution cannot satisfy all the given clues. The puzzle might have an error."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Job, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport) and 3 variables for Transport. Since we have 3 people, each variable should appear exactly 3 times.

2. Let's start with the people and their positions. We know that the onion eater is on the left of the taxi driver. Let's place them in the first two spots:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      |              |               |            |
   | Food          | Onion        |               |            |
   | Job           |              |               |            |

   | Pet           |              |               |            |
   | Sport         |              |               |            |
   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

3. The person driving the bike is on the left of the horse owner. Since the horse owner can't be in the first two spots (because the onion eater is there), the horse owner must be in the third spot. The bike driver must be between the first two spots, so let's place the bike driver in the second spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      |              | Bike         | Horse      |

   | Sport         |              |               |            |
   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

4. The person drinking water is the weightlifter. Since the weightlifter can't be in the first two spots, let's place the weightlifter in the third spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |

   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

5. The person drinking juice is on the far right. Let's place the juice drinker in the third spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |

   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

6. The person drinking 7up can't be in the first two spots, so let's place the 7up drinker in the first spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      | 7up         | Bike         | Juice      |

   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

7. The person eating strawberry is the engineer. Since the engineer is already placed, let's leave it as is:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      | 7up         | Bike         | Juice      |

   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

8. The fan of punk is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie is the photographer (placed in the third spot), let's place the fan of punk in the second spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      | 7up         | Punk         | Juice      |
   | Food          | Onion        | Strawberry   |            |
   | Job           | Engineer     | Photographer  | Journalist  |
   | Music-Genre   |              | Indie        |            |
   | Pet           |              |               |            |
   | Sport         |              |               | Weightlifting|
   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

9. The journalist is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the fan of indie is already placed, let's place the journalist in the third spot:

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      | 7up         | Punk         | Juice      |
   | Food          | Onion        | Strawberry   | Journalist |
   | Job           | Engineer     | Photographer  | Journalist  |
   | Music-Genre   |              | Indie        |            |
   | Pet           |              |               |            |
   | Sport         |              |               | Weightlifting|
   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

10. The weightlifter is between the swimmer and the pop fan. Since the pop fan is the photographer (placed in the second spot), the swimmer must be in the first spot and the weightlifter in the third spot. However, the weightlifter is already in the third spot, so it's impossible to place the swimmer in the first spot. There seems to be a contradiction in this puzzle.

Final solution table (with the contradiction):

   |               |      1       |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage      | 7up         | Punk         | Juice      |
   | Food          | Onion        | Strawberry   | Journalist |
   | Job           | Engineer     | Photographer  | Journalist  |
   | Music-Genre   |              | Indie        |            |
   | Pet           |              |               |            |
   | Sport         | Swimmer      |               | Weightlifting|
   | Transport     | quad-        | Taxi          |            |

The contradiction is that the weightlifter should be between the swimmer and the pop fan, but the weightlifter is already in the third spot, and there's no way to place the swimmer in the first spot."	{}	False	0	False
Lv2-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill the first row with the 3 beverages, the second row with the 3 foods, the third row with the 3 hobbies, the fourth row with the 3 movie genres, the fifth row with the 3 music genres, the sixth row with the 3 pets, and the seventh row with the 3 means of transport.

2. From point 6, we know that the person drinking 7up is the owner of the turtle. So, let's place 7up in the first column of the beverage row, and turtle in the first column of the pet row.

3. From point 8, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the fan of hip-hop. Since the hobby is in the third row, and the music genre is in the sixth row, we can place filmmaking in the third column of the hobby row and hip-hop in the third column of the music genre row.

4. From point 9, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is between the person drinking water and the owner of the turtle. Since the hobby is in the third row, the person drinking water is in the first column, and the owner of the turtle is in the sixth column, the person dancing must be in the second column. So, let's place dancing in the second column of the hobby row.

5. From point 1, we know that there are 3 different beverages, so the person drinking water must be in the second column. Let's place water in the second column of the beverage row.

6. From point 2, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the far right. Since there are 3 foods, the person eating melon must be in the first column, and the person eating watermelon must be in the third column. Let's place melon in the first column of the food row and watermelon in the third column of the food row.

7. From point 3, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the fan of metal. Since the person drinking water is in the second column, and the fan of hip-hop (which is related to the fan of metal) is in the third column, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the first column. Let's place hot-chocolate in the first column of the beverage row.

8. From point 4, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in the middle (point 7), the person watching action movies must be on the left. Since the person driving the taxi is on the right of the owner of the pony (point 1), the person driving the taxi must be in the third column. Let's place taxi in the third column of the transport row.

9. From point 5, we know that the person eating papaya is between the person watching action movies and the owner of the ferret. Since the person watching action movies is in the first column, the person eating papaya must be in the second column, and the owner of the ferret must be in the third column. Let's place papaya in the second column of the food row and ferret in the third column of the pet row.

10. From point 7, we know that the person watching sports movies is in the middle. Since there are 3 movie genres, the person watching horror must be in the first column, and the person watching action movies must be in the second column. Let's place sports in the middle of the movie-genre row.

11. From point 4, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is in the second column, and the person driving the taxi is in the third column, the person driving the motorbike must be in the first column. Let's place motorbike in the first column of the transport row.

12. From point 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the person driving the motorbike is in the first column, and the owner of the pony must be on the right of the person driving the motorbike (point 11), the owner of the pony must be in the second column. Let's place pony in the second column of the pet row.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```

| Beverage   | 7up   |  water |  hot-chocolate |
| Food       |  melon |  pomegranate |  watermelon   |

Lv2-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating onion is on the far left, we can place the onion eater in the first column.

2. The analyst is on the left of the fan of indie, so the analyst must be in the first row. Let's place the analyst in the first row, first column (since the onion eater is already there).

3. Now, the thai is between the woodworker and the pop fan. Since the onion eater is on the left of the rock fan, the rock fan must be in the third column. So, the woodworker and the thai must be in the first and second columns respectively, in the second and third rows.

4. The software-developer eats pepper, so he must be in the third column. Since the analyst is in the first column, the software-developer must be in the third row.

5. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the dog owner. Since the analyst, the onion eater, the rock fan, the woodworker, the thai, and the software-developer are all placed, the only available spot for the fantasy fan is in the first column, second row.

6. The italian is on the left of the sports movie fan. Since the fantasy fan is in the first column, second row, the sports movie fan must be in the second column, second row. This means the italian must be in the first column, third row.

7. The owner of the goat is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the goat owner must be in the second column (because the skydiving hobby is in the second row), the only available spot for the pop fan is in the second column, third row.

8. The only remaining spot is the first column, first row for the hobby of hiking.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv2-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each person has one unique item in each category.

2. Let's assign the beverages: Cola, Fanta, Soy-Milk to the people from left to right (1, 2, 3).

3. Now let's assign the hobbies: Cooking, Dancing, Skydiving to the people from left to right (1, 2, 3).

4. Assign the jobs: Accountant, Doctor, Manager from the given conditions (1st condition not yet applicable, will be used later). Let's place the Doctor on position 2 for now.

5. Assign the movie-genres: Crime, Epic, Thriller from the given conditions (2nd condition: Thriller for the Egyptian, so the Egyptian is on position 3).

6. Now we can place the Nationalities: Colombian, Egyptian, French from the given conditions (5th condition: Dancing for the French, so the French is on position 1).

7. Assign the pets: Cat, Frog, Lizard from the given conditions (4th condition: Manager is between the owner of the Frog and the person watching Thriller movies, so the Manager is on position 2. The Frog owner is on position 3, and the Lizard owner is on position 1 or 2. Since the Lizard owner is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, the Lizard owner cannot be on position 1, so it's on position 2).

8. Now we can place the Transport: Airplane, Quad-bike, Ship from the given conditions (6th condition: Quad-bike on the far right, so it's on position 3. The French is driving the ship, so the French is on position 1, and the Transport for position 2 is either Airplane or Ship. Since the Lizard owner is on position 2, the Transport for position 2 cannot be Ship, so it's Airplane).

9. Now we can place the Manager: Since the Manager is between the owner of the Frog and the person watching Thriller movies, and the Frog owner is on position 3, the Manager is on position 2.

10. Now we can place the Accountant: Since the person drinking Cola is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, and the Skydiving hobby is on position 2 (the Doctor), the Cola drinker is on position 3. The Accountant is the only one left, so it's on position 1.

11. Now we can place the remaining items: Movie-Genre for position 1 (Epic), Hobby for position 3 (Cooking), and Transport for position 1 (Airplane).

Lv2-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nigerian is between the argentine and the malaysian, we can place the argentine and the malaysian in the first two spots, and the nigerian in the middle. Let's assume the order is Argentine, Malaysian, Nigerian.

2. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the argentine is drinking juice, the tennis player must be to the left of the argentine. Let's place the tennis player in the first spot, so the order becomes Tennis (1), Argentine (2), Malaysian (3), Nigerian (4).

3. The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the tennis player is watching satire movies, the climber must be to the right of the tennis player. Let's place the climber in the third spot, so the order becomes Tennis (1), Satire (2), Climbing (3), Argentine (4), Malaysian (5), Nigerian (6).

4. The paramedic is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we don't know who is drinking soy-milk yet, we can't place the paramedic yet.

5. The person drinking coffee is between the owner of the ferret and the person watching drama movies. Let's assume the owner of the ferret and the drama watcher are in spots 5 and 6. Since the argentine is drinking juice, the coffee drinker can't be the argentine. The only remaining person is the malaysian, so the malaysian must be drinking coffee. So the order becomes Tennis (1), Satire (2), Climbing (3), Argentine (4), Coffee (5), Drama (6), Malaysian (7), Nigerian (8).

6. The argentine is the person drinking juice, so the order is correct.

7. The owner of the bird is on the far right. Since the order is correct, the bird owner is the nigerian.

8. The person who's hobby is writing is on the far right. Since the order is correct, the writer is the nigerian.

9. The firefighter is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the argentine is the firefighter and the malaysian is camping, the firefighter must be in the first spot. So the order becomes Firefighter (1), Tennis (2), Satire (3), Climbing (4), Argentine (5), Coffee (6), Drama (7), Writing (8), Malaysian (9), Bird (10), Paramedic (11), Horse (12), Soy-milk (13), Ferret (14), Camping (15), Skateboarding (16), Thriller (17), Magic-tricks (18), Drama (19), Argentine (20), Juice (21), Malaysian (22), Nigerian (23), Bird (24), Writing (25), Paramedic (26), Horse (27), Soy-milk (28), Ferret (29), Camping (30), Skateboarding (31), Thriller (32), Magic-tricks (33).

However, this is too long and doesn't fit the given table format. We can rearrange the table to fit the given format by swapping the positions of the firefighter and the tennis player, and then swapping the positions of the malaysian and the nigerian. The final solution table is:

Lv2-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and each has 6 different characteristics. Let's label them from A to F for easier reference.

2. We know that each person has a unique hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, and pet. Also, each person uses a unique means of transport.

3. From the clues, we can start by placing the nationalities:
   - The Egyptian is between the person driving the bus and the Italian (E is not the driver of the bus, so E cannot be in the first or last position. Italian is the photographer (3), so the Italian cannot be in the first position. Therefore, E must be in the third position.)

4. The Italian is the photographer (3), so the photographer must be in the second position.

5. The person driving the bike is the Italian and the fan of rock (5, 4). Since the Italian is in the second position, the person driving the bike must be in the first position (A). So, A is a photographer and a fan of rock.

6. The person driving the bike is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since A is driving the bike, the person driving the bus must be in the fourth position (D). So, D is driving the bus.

7. The person driving the bike is the Italian, so A is Italian. Since the Egyptian is between the person driving the bus and the Italian, the person driving the bus must be of a different nationality, which means C is Egyptian.

8. The fan of classical is the owner of the ferret (2). Since we know the nationalities, we can deduce that A (Italian) cannot be the fan of classical, so B is the fan of classical. So, B owns the ferret.

9. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since B owns the ferret, the owner of the pony must be on the right of B. Since the Egyptian is between the person driving the bus and the Italian, the Egyptian cannot be the owner of the pony, so F is the owner of the pony. So, F watches romance movies.

10. The person who's hobby is board-games is the person watching romance movies (6). Since F watches romance movies, A cannot have board-games as a hobby, so B must have board-games as a hobby.

11. The fan of blues is on the right of the fan of classical (8). Since B is the fan of classical, the fan of blues must be on the right of B, which means C is the fan of blues.

12. The person driving the bike is the Italian and the fan of rock (5, 4). Since A is Italian, A cannot be the fan of blues, so D must be the fan of blues.

13. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the fan of rock (9). Since A is the fan of rock, D cannot watch satire movies, so E must watch satire movies.

14. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left (10). Since A and B have hobbies (board-games and classical music), C cannot have gardening as a hobby, so E must have gardening as a hobby.

15. Now we know the nationalities, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and means of transport for all six people.
