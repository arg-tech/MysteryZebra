Lv2-2x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the French is in the middle, they must be in the 4th position. Let's assign the sports to the first three and the last three positions:
   - First row: Badminton, Cycling, Biathlon
   - Fourth row: Volleyball, Parkour, Skiing
   - Seventh row: Baseball, Unknown, Thai

2. The Australian is between the Italian and the Turkish, so the Australian must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. Since the French is in the 4th position, the Australian cannot be in the 3rd position. So, the Australian is in the 2nd position, and the Italian is in the 1st position. The Turkish is in the 5th position.

3. The Japanese is between Biathlon and Parkour, so the Japanese must be in the 3rd position. This means Cycling is in the 1st position and Badminton is in the 2nd position.

4. The person who's sport is Parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is Volleyball, so Parkour is in the 5th position and Volleyball is in the 4th position.

5. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is Skiing, so Baseball is in the 6th position and Skiing is in the 5th position.

6. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the right of the Italian, so the Italian cannot be in the 6th position. The Italian is in the 1st position, so Baseball must be in the 7th position.

7. The person who's sport is Baseball is on the left of the Turkish, so the Turkish must be in the 6th position.

8. The Japanese is on the left of the Thai, so the Thai must be in the 7th position.

9. The Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is Biathlon, so Biathlon must be in the 3rd position.

10. The Thai is on the far right, so we already know their position.

11. The person who's sport is Badminton is between the person who's sport is Cycling and the person who's sport is Biathlon. We already know Cycling and Biathlon's positions, so Badminton must be in the 2nd position.

Lv2-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the mexican is on the left of the canadian, so we can place them in the first two spots. Let's put the Mexican in position 1 and the Canadian in position 2.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Mexican | Canadian | | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |   |   |   |   |   |

2. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the pony, so the hamster owner must be to the left of the pony owner. Since the Canadian owns the pony (from point 6), the hamster owner must be in position 1 (already occupied by the Mexican). So, the pony owner must be in position 2 (already occupied by the Canadian). Let's place the Indian in position 2 as the owner of the pony.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Mexican | Indian (pony) | | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |   |   |   |   |   |

3. The owner of the rabbit is the Polish, so we can place the Polish in an empty spot. Since the Dutch is in the middle (from point 10), the Polish cannot be in position 4. So, the Polish must be in position 3 (the only remaining spot on the left).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Mexican | Indian (pony) | Polish (rabbit) | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |        |   |   |   |   |

4. The german is on the left of the pakistani (from point 4), so the German must be in position 1 or 2. Since the Mexican is already in position 1, the German must be in position 2. But the Indian (pony owner) is already in position 2. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

However, if we assume that the German and the Indian swap places (Indian moves to position 2 and German moves to position 1), the puzzle can be solved:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | German (pony) | Indian | Polish (rabbit) | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |        |   |   |   |   |

5. The owner of the fish is on the left of the owner of the turtle (from point 5), so the fish owner must be in position 1 or 2. Since the German (pony owner) is in position 1, the fish owner must be in position 2.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | German (pony) | Indian (fish) | Polish (rabbit) | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |        |   |   |   |   |

6. The canadian is on the left of the owner of the hamster (from point 7), so the Canadian must be in position 1. But the German (pony owner) is already in position 1. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

However, if we assume that the Canadian and the German swap places (German moves to position 2 and Canadian moves to position 1), the puzzle can be solved:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Polish (rabbit) | | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |        |   |   |   |   |

7. The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the fish and the Indian (from point 8). The only possible spot for the turtle owner is position 3, as positions 1 and 2 are occupied by the Canadian (hamster owner) and the German (pony owner), and position 4 is the Dutch (from point 10).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Dutch (turtle) | Polish (rabbit) | | | |
   | Pet        |      |        |        |        |   |   |   |

8. The dutch is in the middle (from point 10), so the Dutch must be in position 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Dutch (turtle) | Polish (rabbit) | | | |

9. The canadian is on the right of the owner of the rat (from point 9), so the owner of the rat must be in position 5 or 6. Since the Dutch (turtle owner) is in position 4, the rat owner must be in position 5.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Dutch (turtle) | Polish (rabbit) | Mexican (rat) | | |

10. The only remaining nationality is the pakistani. The only remaining spot is position 6. So, the pakistani is the owner of the goat.

   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Dutch (turtle) | Polish (rabbit) | Mexican (rat) | Pakistani (goat) | |

11. The only remaining pet is the fish. Since the Canadian (hamster owner) is in position 1, the fish must be in position 7.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

   | Nationality | Canadian (hamster) | German (pony) | Dutch (turtle) | Polish (rabbit) | Mexican (rat) | Pakistani (goat) | Fish |

Lv2-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the Australian is drinking water, so we can place 'Australian' and 'Water' in the first position (1,1).

2. Since the Australian is on the right of the person drinking fanta, we know that fanta cannot be in the first position. So, let's place 'Fanta' in the second position (1,2).

3. The person drinking fanta is in the middle, so we know that there must be 3 positions before and 3 positions after it. This means that the nationalities to the left of fanta must be Mexican, Juice, and someone else, and the nationalities to the right of fanta must be Nigerian, Sprite, and someone else.

4. The Mexican is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, so the Mexican must be in the third position (1,3). This means that the lemonade must be in the fifth position (1,5).

5. The person drinking juice is before the Mexican, so the juice must be in the second position (1,2).

6. The pakistani is on the right of the mexican, so the pakistani must be in the fourth position (1,4).

7. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the nigerian, so the nigerian must be in the sixth position (1,6). This means that the sprite must be in the seventh position (1,7).

8. The iced-tea is the chinese, so we can place 'Chinese' and 'Iced-tea' in the third position (1,3).

9. The mexican is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, so the lemonade must be in the fifth position (1,5).

10. The mexican is between the person drinking juice and the pakistani, so the person drinking juice must be in the second position (1,2) and the pakistani in the fourth position (1,4).

11. The last nationality, polish, does not have a corresponding beverage assigned, but since there are only 7 beverages and 7 nationalities, it must be the person drinking tea. So, we can place 'Polish' and 'Tea' in the last position (1,7).

Lv2-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, each with a unique music genre preference and a unique mode of transport. Let's assign each person a number from 1 to 7.

2. From point 1, we know that the person driving the ship (#7) is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (#6). So, #7 > #6.

3. The person driving the skateboard (#6) is a fan of disco.

4. The person driving the bike (#3) is between the fan of rock (#5) and the fan of classical (#1). So, #3 is to the right of #1 and to the left of #5. Since #7 > #6, #3 cannot be #7. Also, since #6 is the skateboarder, #3 cannot be #6. So, #3 must be #5 (rock fan) and the bike driver is between rock and classical.

5. The bike driver (#5) is in the middle, so #1 (classical fan) is either #1 or #2, and #7 (ship driver) is either #6 or #7.

6. The fan of punk (#4) is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (#6), so #4 cannot be #3 (bike driver) or #1 (classical fan). So, #4 is either #2, #5, #6, or #7. Since #7 is the ship driver and is to the right of #6, #4 cannot be #7. Also, since #3 is the bike driver and is to the left of #6, #4 cannot be #3. So, #4 must be #2 (punk fan).

7. The person driving the motorbike (#2) is on the left of the person driving the skateboard (#6), so #2 < #6.

8. The person driving the helicopter (#8) is the fan of house. Since #8 is not used yet, it must be #1 (classical fan) or #2 (punk fan). Since #2 is the punk fan, #8 must be #1 (classical fan). So, the helicopter driver is the classical fan.

9. The fan of metal (#9) is the person driving the train. Since #9 is not used yet, it must be #3 (bike driver), #4 (punk fan), #5 (rock fan), #6 (skateboarder), or #7 (ship driver). Since #7 is the ship driver and is to the right of #6, #9 cannot be #7. Also, since #3 is the bike driver and is in the middle, #9 cannot be #3. So, #9 must be #5 (rock fan). So, the train driver is the rock fan.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Music-Genre   | Classical | Disco  | Folk   | House  | Metal  | Punk   | Rock  |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Skateboard| Bike  | Motorbike| Train  |       |       |

Since the bike driver is in the middle, the skateboarder is to the left and the train driver is to the right. So, the arrangement is:

| Music-Genre   | Classical | Disco  | Folk   | House  | Metal  | Punk   | Rock  |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Skateboard| Bike  | Motorbike| Train  | Van   |       |

But we still don't know the positions of folk, van, and the remaining transport. Since the skateboarder is to the left of the bike driver, the skateboarder cannot be the van driver. Also, since the train driver is to the right of the bike driver, the train driver cannot be the van driver. So, the van driver must be either the folk fan or one of the remaining transport drivers.

Lv2-2x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the pilot is on the left of the writer, so we can place the pilot in the first or second column and the writer in the third or fourth column. Let's place the pilot in the first column and the writer in the third column for now.

2. The person who's sport is cycling is the scientist. Since the scientist must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the scientist in the fifth column.

3. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the rower must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the rower in the sixth column. The badminton player must then be in the fourth column, to the left of the rower.

4. The paramedic is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the paramedic must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the paramedic in the second column.

5. The videographer is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarder must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the snowboarder in the seventh column. The videographer must then be in the third column.

6. The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's sport is parkour and the firefighter. Since the firefighter must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the firefighter in the first row. The parkour player must then be in the sixth column, and the snowboarder in the seventh column.

7. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the climber must be in one of the remaining jobs, let's place the climber in the second row.

8. The videographer is in the middle. Since the videographer is already in the third column, this condition is satisfied.

Now, let's arrange the jobs according to the sports:

|         |     1     |      2      |        3        |      4       |     5     |     6     |   7    |

We still need to fill in the sports.

9. The person who's sport is cycling is the scientist. Since the scientist is in the fifth column, the sport for the scientist must be cycling.

10. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the badminton player is in the fourth column, the sport for the badminton player must be a sport that is on the left of rowing. The only sport that fits this condition is climbing, so the sport for the badminton player is climbing.

11. The person who's sport is rowing is in the sixth column. The only sport that fits this condition is rowing.

12. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in the seventh column. The only sport that fits this condition is snowboarding.

13. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the parkour player is in the sixth column, the sport for the parkour player must be a sport that is on the left of climbing. The only sport that fits this condition is badminton, but we already assigned badminton to the fourth column. However, since badminton is on the left of climbing, we can swap the positions of the badminton player and the parkour player. So, the sport for the parkour player is climbing, and the sport for the badminton player is parkour.

14. The only sport left is lacrosse. Since the firefighter is in the first row, the sport for the firefighter must be lacrosse.

Now, let's arrange the jobs according to the sports:

|         |     1     |      2      |        3        |      4       |     5     |     6     |   7    |

Lv2-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that surfing is associated with iced-tea. Let's place them at the end (7th row and column). So, iced-tea goes in the 7th column and surfing goes in the 7th row.

   |            |   1    |    2    |       3       |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |         | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|
   | Sport      |        |         |               |         |          |         | surfing  |

2. Cola is on the left of volleyball. Since we know surfing is at the end, volleyball must be in the 6th column. Let's place volleyball in the 6th column and cola in the 2nd column.

   |            | cola   |    2    |       3       |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |         | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|
   | Sport      |       v|         |               |         |          |         | surfing  |

3. Cycling is in the middle. Since we know volleyball is in the 6th column, cycling must be in the 4th column.

   |            | cola   |    2    | cycling     |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |         | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|

4. Fanta is between rugby and volleyball. Since we know volleyball is in the 6th column, and surfing is at the end, rugby must be in the 5th column. Fanta will be between them, so it goes in the 4th column.

   |            | cola   |    2    | fanta      | rugby    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |         | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|

5. Cricket is on the left of hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is in the 4th column, cricket must be in the 3rd column.

   |            | cola   |    2    | fanta      | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |         | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|
   | Sport      |       v|         | c          | r        | c        |          |         | surfing  |

6. Coffee is on the left of cricket. So, coffee goes in the 2nd column.

   |            | coffee  | cola   | fanta      | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |        | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|

7. Rowing is the person drinking coffee. So, rowing goes in the 1st row.

   |            | rowing  | coffee  | cola   | fanta      | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |        |        | hot-cho    te |         |          |         |  iced-tea|

8. Lemonade is the person who's sport is rugby. So, lemonade goes in the 1st column.

   |            | lemonade| rowing  | coffee  | cola   | fanta      | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |

9. Parkour is between rugby and iced-tea. Since we know iced-tea is at the end, parkour must be in the 5th column.

   |            | lemonade| rowing  | coffee  | cola   | fanta      | parkour  | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |

10. Fanta is on the left of lemonade. So, fanta goes in the 1st column.

   |            | fanta   | lemonade| rowing  | coffee  | cola   | fanta      | parkour  | rugby    | cricket  |    5     |    6    |    7     |
   | Beverage   |        |        |        |        |        | hot-cho    te |         |         |          | p       |  iced-tea|

Lv2-2x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police-officer is on the far left, we can place them in position 1.
2. The accountant is on the left of the fisherman, so the accountant must be in position 2 and the fisherman in position 3.
3. The photographer is on the left of the librarian, so the librarian cannot be in position 1 (since the police-officer is there). The librarian must be in position 4, 5, or 6. If the librarian were in position 4, the photographer would have to be in position 3, but that would place the photographer to the left of the police-officer, which contradicts the given information. So, the librarian cannot be in position 4. If the librarian were in position 5, the photographer would have to be in position 6, but that would place the photographer to the right of the person drinking lemonade, which contradicts the given information. So, the librarian cannot be in position 5 either. Therefore, the librarian must be in position 6. This means the photographer is in position 5.
4. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking water. Since the librarian is in position 6, the person drinking water must be in position 7. The person drinking fanta must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the person drinking fanta were in position 2, the person drinking water would have to be in position 3, but that would place the person drinking fanta to the left of the photographer, which contradicts the given information. If the person drinking fanta were in position 3, the person drinking water would have to be in position 4, but that would place the person drinking fanta to the left of the librarian, which contradicts the given information. Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4.
5. The person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 7 and the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the person drinking mirinda must be in position 5.
6. The person drinking cola is to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the person drinking cola must be in position 6.
7. The dressmaker is on the right of the police-officer. Since the police-officer is in position 1, the dressmaker must be in position 2.
8. The accountant is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 7, the accountant must be in position 6.
9. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is in position 6, the person drinking fanta must be in position 7.
10. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking water and the person drinking cola. This condition is already satisfied since the person drinking fanta is in positions 4, 5, and 7.
11. The photographer is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 7, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5.

Lv2-2x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching action movies is the person driving the tram. Let's place them in the table:

   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |
   | Transport     |           |            |        |         |          |           |        |

2. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person watching action movies. Let's place them:

   |--------------|-----------|------------|--------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|

3. The person watching romance movies is between the person driving the trike and the person driving the taxi. Since we already have the tram and the motorbike, let's place the trike and taxi first:

   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

   |--------------|-----------|------------|--------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|

   Now, we can place the romance movies:

4. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since we have the tram, motorbike, trike, taxi, and romance, let's place adventure and horror:

   |--------------|-----------|------------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|

   The only remaining genres are disaster, satire, and disaster must be on the right of romance, so:

   | Movie-Genre   |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

Lv2-2x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is photography is drinking cola. Let's place cola in the first row and photography in the second row.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   | Cola   |           |             |              |         |             |         |
   | Hobby      |       | Photography|             |              |         |             |         |

2. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since we have already placed cola (photography), let's place coffee in the second row, one place to the left of cola.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   | Cola   | Coffee    |             |              |         |             |         |
   | Hobby      |       | Photography|             |              |         |             |         |

3. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person drinking coffee. So, let's place gardening in the fourth row, one place to the right of coffee.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |

   | Hobby      |       | Photography|             |              |         |             |         |

4. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Let's place singing in the third row, one place to the left of gardening.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   | Cola   | Coffee    | Singing     | Gardening    |         |             |         |
   | Hobby      |       | Photography|             |              |         |             |         |

5. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since we have already placed coffee, cola, and tea, let's place 7up in the sixth row, one place to the right of tea.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   | Cola   | Coffee    | Singing     | Gardening    | Tea     | 7up        |         |

6. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right. Since we have already placed 7up, let's place hiking in the seventh row.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |

7. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking milk and the person who's hobby is photography. Since we have already placed cola (photography), let's place milk in the fifth row, one place to the left of cola.

   |            |    1    |     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   | Cola   | Coffee    | Singing     | Milk         | Tea     | 7up        | Hiking  |
   | Hobby      |       | Photography|             |              |        |             |        |

8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since we have already placed singing, let's place board-games in the first row, and magic-tricks in the second row, one place to the right of board-games.

   |            | Board-Games|     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |
   | Beverage   |          | Coffee    | Singing     | Milk         | Tea     | 7up        | Hiking  |
   | Hobby      | Magic-Tricks| Photography|             |              |        |             |        |

9. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since we have already placed 7up and tea, the table is complete.

   |            | Board-Games|     2     |      3      |      4       |    5    |      6      |    7    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Board-Games| Coffee | Singing  | Gardening | Milk         | Tea     | 7up        | Hiking  |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|--------------|--------|-------------|--------|
