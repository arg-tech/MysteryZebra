Lv2-6x6-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people based on their nationalities. Since the Chinese is on the far left, we can place them in position 1. The Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the subway driver must be someone other than Indonesian. Let's place the Indonesian in position 6. The nigerian is on the right of the person driving the trike, so the trike driver must be someone other than Nigerian. Let's place the Nigerian in position 5. The Italian is on the left of the person driving the bike, so the bike driver must be someone other than Italian. Let's place the Italian in position 2. The Spanish is not specified to be on the left or right of anyone yet, so we can place the Spanish in position 3. The Mexican is not specified yet, so we'll place them in position 4.

2. The fan of blues is on the right of the Italian, so the fan of blues must be in position 4 or 6. Since the fan of blues cannot be in position 6 (because the Indonesian is there), the fan of blues must be in position 4.

3. The fan of metal is on the left of the fan of country. Since the fan of blues is in position 4, the fan of metal must be in position 2.

4. The fan of pop is the person who's hobby is gardening, and the owner of the snake is the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the fan of pop is on the far right, the gardener must be in position 6. This means the snake owner is also in position 6.

5. The owner of the goat is between the Indonesian and the owner of the goldfish. Since the Indonesian is in position 6, the goat owner must be in position 5, and the goldfish owner must be in position 7.

6. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the Indonesian is in position 6, the rower must be in position 5. The skydiving hobby is not assigned yet, so let's place it in position 1.

7. The person who's sport is parkour is the person driving the boat. Since the Indonesian is in position 6, the parkour person cannot be in position 6 (because the boat driver must be in position 6). The parkour person must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the rower is in position 5, the parkour person cannot be in position 5. The parkour person cannot be in position 1 (because the fan of country is on the left of the parkour person, and the fan of country is in position 4). The parkour person cannot be in position 2 (because the fan of metal is in position 2). The parkour person cannot be in position 3 (because the Spanish is in position 3). So, the parkour person must be in position 4. This means the boat driver is in position 6.

8. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in position 3, the fan of dubstep must be in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the gardener is in position 6, the reader must be in position 5.

Lv2-6x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign the beverages to the columns. Since the person drinking 7up is on the far right, we can place 7up in column 6. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the electrician, so we can place the mouse owner in column 5 (since the electrician can't be in column 6). The remaining beverages can be filled in the remaining columns from left to right. So, the Beverage column looks like this:

   | Beverage      | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
   |--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | 7up          |     |     |     |     |     | #####|
   | Almond-milk  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Cola         |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Hot-chocolate|     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Tea          |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Water        |     |     |     |     |     |     |

2. Next, let's assign the jobs to the rows. The police-officer is on the left of the owner of the dog, so we can place the police-officer in row 1 and the dog owner in row 2. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the scooter, so we can place the car driver in row 5 and the scooter driver in row 4. The remaining jobs can be filled in the remaining rows from top to bottom. So, the Job column looks like this:

   |               | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
   |--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Police-officer| #####|     |     |     |     |     |
   | Dancer       |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Electrician  |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Journalist   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Librarian    |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Musician     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

3. We can now start filling in the other categories based on the given clues. For example, the owner of the rat is the person who's sport is badminton, so we can place badminton in the row 2 (since the rat owner is in column 5). The person driving the ship is the person drinking tea, so we can place tea in the row 20 (since the ship driver is in column 6). We can continue filling in the other categories in a similar manner.

After a lot of deduction and reasoning, the final solution table looks like this:

   |               | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
   |--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Beverage      |     |     |     |     |     | #####|
   | Job           | #####|     |     |     |     |     |
   | Music-Genre   |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Sport         |     |     |     |     |     |     |
   | Transport     |     |     |     |     |     |     |

The filled table is as follows:

   |               | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   | 6   |
   |--------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
   | Beverage      |     |     |     |     |     | Cola|
   | Job           | Police-officer| Dancer| Electrician| Journalist| Librarian| Musician|
   | Music-Genre   |     |     |     |     |     | Rock  |
   | Pet           |     |     |     |     | Rat   | Cat   |
   | Sport         |     | Badminton|     |     |     | Surfing|
   | Transport     |     |     |     | Car  | Scooter| Ship  |

I'm unable to fill in the remaining columns (Beverage, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport) as there are not enough unique clues to determine the exact positions for all of them. However, I've filled in the Job column based on the given clues."	{}	False	0	False
