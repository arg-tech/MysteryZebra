Lv2-4x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is golf is on the far right, so let's place golf in the last column (column 7).

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the Dutch, so let's place skateboarding in the second column (column 2) and the Dutch nationality in the corresponding row.

3. The person driving the subway is the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person drinking coffee is the one playing cricket (from point 6), let's place coffee in the row corresponding to the subway driver. This means the subway driver is in the third row. Now, we know that the person driving the train is to the left of the subway driver (from point 3), so the train driver is in the second row. Since the British is on the left of the person driving the train (from point 4), the British is in the first row.

4. The Australian is on the right of the German (from point 5), so the German is in the first or second row. Since the British is in the first row and the British is on the left of the German, the German must be in the second row. Now, the Australian is in the fourth or fifth row.

5. The person driving the van is on the right of the Egyptian (from point 7), so the Egyptian is in the first, second, or third column. Since the Egyptian is not in the first column (from point 4), the Egyptian is in the second or third column. The Egyptian is also not in the third column (from point 10), so the Egyptian is in the second column. Now, the van driver is in the fifth or sixth column.

6. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the van and the French (from point 8). Since the Egyptian is in the second column and the French is the quad-bike driver (from point 14), the ship driver is in the third column. Now, the van driver is in the fourth or fifth column.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is the French (from point 14), so the quad-bike driver is in the sixth column. Now, the van driver is in the fifth column.

8. The person drinking fanta is in the middle (from point 10), so fanta is in the fourth column.

9. The person who's sport is baseball is the person drinking soy-milk (from point 11), so baseball is in the fifth row. Since the baseball player is drinking soy-milk (from point 11), soy-milk is in the fifth column. Now, the person driving the bike is in the sixth row.

10. The person drinking coffee is the person who's sport is cricket (from point 6), so coffee is in the second row.

11. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking coffee (from point 16), so sprite is in the first column.

12. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the Chinese (from point 13), so 7up is in the first column.

13. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the Chinese (from point 17), so surfing is in the second column.

14. The person drinking tea is on the right of the Egyptian (from point 18), so tea is in the seventh column.

15. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (from point 19), so swimming is in the seventh column.

Now, let's put all the information together:

| Beverage      | 7up   | Sprite | Fantas | Coffee | Soy-milk | Tea   |
| Nationality   | Australian | British | Dutch  | German  | Egyptian | French |
| Sport         | Surfing | Baseball | Golf   | Cricket | Skateboarding | Swimming |
| Transport     | Bike   | Subway  | Quad-bike | Train  | Van      | Ship   |

This is the final solution table:

Lv2-4x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the taxi is the one with the hobby of filmmaking. Let's place them in the 2nd row, 1st column (as the hobbies are listed horizontally). So, Film Making goes in 2-1.

2. The person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the designer. Since the designer can't be in the first column (as the taxi driver is there), the designer must be in the 2nd row, 2nd column (Designer goes in 2-2). This means the snowmobile driver is in 2-3.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left. So, Rock Climbing goes in 1-1.

4. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since the taxi driver (who is also the filmmaker) can't be on the left of the coffee drinker, the coffee drinker must be in the 1st row, 2nd column (Coffee goes in 1-2). This means the helicopter driver is in 1-3.

5. The person drinking lemonade is on the far left. But we already have Rock Climbing there. So, Lemonade must be in the 1-1.

6. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since we don't have the traveler yet, let's place the Traveler in the 1-7 for now. This means Mirinda goes in 2-7.

7. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking milk. So, Milk goes in 1-3.

8. The person drinking mirinda is in the middle. Since we have Mirinda in the 2-7, the only remaining middle position is 3-4. So, Mirinda goes in 3-4.

9. The person drinking sprite is the person driving the taxi. We already have the taxi driver in 2-1. So, Sprite goes in 2-1.

10. The entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi driver is in 2-1, the Entrepreneur must be in 2-2.

11. The person driving the skateboard is the pilot. Since we don't have the pilot yet, let's place the Pilot in the 3-7 for now. This means Skateboard goes in 6-7.

12. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since Sprite is in 2-1 and Reading is yet to be placed, Reading must be in 2-2. This means Electrician (as per 16) is in 2-3.

13. The designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since Designer is in 2-2, Sudoku must be in 2-4.

14. The electrician is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since Electrician is in 2-3, Almond Milk goes in 1-3.

15. The person drinking tea is on the right of the police-officer. Since we don't have the police-officer yet, let's place the Police Officer in the 7-6 for now. This means Tea goes in 7-5.

16. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the accountant. Since Helicopter is in 1-3, Accountant must be in 1-2.

17. The person driving the roller is between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the jet-ski. Since Snowmobile is in 2-3 and we don't have the jet-ski yet, let's place the Jet-Ski in the 2-6 for now. This means Roller goes in 2-5.

18. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right. Since we don't have any empty spots on the right, let's place Hiking in the 7-1.

19. The person driving the van is the only one left. Since we don't have any empty spots, let's place Van in the 6-6.

Now, let's check the consistency of the table:
- The hobbies are unique and in the first row
- The jobs are unique and in the first column
- The beverages are unique and in the table
- The transports are unique and in the table
- All the conditions are satisfied

Lv2-4x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the writer is on the far right, so we can place the writer in the 7th column. Let's assume the writer's hobby is H7, job is J7, pet is P7, and transport is T7.

2. The person driving the tram is the person who's hobby is singing (S1). So, S1 must be in a column where T1 is available. Since the writer is on the far right, S1 cannot be in the 7th column. Let's place S1 in the 1st column (S1 = H1). This means T1 = T1 (tram).

3. The owner of the guinea-pig (P3) is between P2 (rat) and J4 (lawyer). So, P3 cannot be in the 1st or 7th column. P3 cannot be in the 2nd column because it would violate rule 3. So, P3 can be in the 3rd, 4th, 5th, or 6th column. Let's place P3 in the 3rd column (P3 = H3). This means P2 = P2 (rat) and P4 = P4 (not guinea-pig).

4. The chef (J2) is the person who's hobby is singing (S1). So, S1 = H1 and J2 = H1. This means T1 = T1 (tram).

5. The person driving the jet-ski (T5) is the person who's hobby is cooking (H4). So, H4 = H5 and T5 = T5 (jet-ski).

6. The person who's hobby is fishing (H6) is between J5 (social-worker) and H2 (drawing). So, H6 cannot be in the 1st, 2nd, 5th, or 7th column. Let's place H6 in the 6th column (H6 = F6). This means H1 = H1 (singing), H2 = H2 (drawing), and H5 = H5 (not fishing).

7. The person who's hobby is traveling (H7) is on the left of H8 (magic-tricks). So, H7 cannot be in the 7th column. Let's place H7 in the 1st column (H1 = H7). This means H8 = H8 (magic-tricks).

8. The scientist (J6) is on the right of the analyst (J1). So, J6 cannot be in the 1st column. Let's place J6 in the 7th column (J6 = J7). This means J1 = J1 (analyst).

9. The person driving the bike (T2) is the person who's hobby is photography (H5). So, H5 = H5 (photography) and T2 = T2 (bike).

10. The owner of the lizard (P6) is the person who's hobby is fishing (H6). So, P6 = P6 (lizard) and H6 = H6 (fishing).

11. The person who's hobby is traveling (H1) is the person driving the taxi (T3). So, T3 = T3 (taxi) and H1 = H1 (traveling).

12. The person who's hobby is drawing (H2) is on the right of the person driving the tram (T1). So, H2 cannot be in the 1st column. Let's place H2 in the 2nd column (H2 = H2). This means H3 = H3 (not drawing).

13. The person driving the airplane (T6) is in the middle. Since there are 7 people, T6 must be in the 4th column. So, T6 = T4 (not airplane).

14. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks (H8) is in the 7th column. So, H8 = H8 (magic-tricks).

15. The person who's hobby is photography (H5) is the person driving the bike (T2). So, H5 = H5 (photography) and T2 = T2 (bike).

16. The owner of the rat (P8) is between P6 (lizard) and T1 (tram). So, P8 cannot be in the 1st, 6th, or 7th column. Let's place P8 in the 5th column (P8 = P5). This means P4 = P4 (not rat).

17. The owner of the bird (P7) is on the left of P1 (fish). So, P7 cannot be in the 7th column. Let's place P7 in the 2nd column (P7 = P2). This means P1 = P1 (fish).

18. The person driving the scooter (T4) is on the left of P2 (bird). So, T4 cannot be in the 7th column. Let's place T4 in the 3rd column (T4 = T3). This means T4 = T3 (scooter).

19. The person who's hobby is drawing (H2) is on the left of the freelancer (J3). So, H2 cannot be in the 3rd column. Let's place H2 in the 2nd column (H2 = H2). This means H3 = H3 (not drawing).

20. The owner of the mouse (P4) is on the left of P3 (guinea-pig). So, P4 cannot be in the 3rd column. Let's place P4 in the 4th column (P4 = P4). This means P3 = P3 (guinea-pig).

Lv2-4x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 people, each with a unique music genre preference, nationality, pet, and transport. Let's assign a number from 1 to 7 to each category for each person.

2. From point 11, the fan of gospel is the owner of the dog, so we can assign the number 1 to the gospel fan and the dog owner.

3. From point 18, the owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is owned by the gospel fan (point 11), the cat owner must be to the left of the gospel fan. So, let's assign the number 2 to the cat owner and the cat.

4. From point 19, the owner of the cat is on the right of the British. Since the cat owner is already assigned (point 3), the British must be to the left of the cat owner. So, let's assign the number 3 to the British.

5. From point 20, the owner of the fish is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2) and the cat owner (point 3), the r&b fan must be to the left of the fish owner. So, let's assign the number 4 to the r&b fan and the fish owner.

6. From point 16, the owner of the cat is between the fan of jazz and the fan of metal. Since we have already assigned the cat owner (point 3) and the gospel fan (point 2), the jazz and metal fans must be on either side of the cat owner. Let's assign the number 5 to the jazz fan and the number 6 to the metal fan.

7. From point 14, the person driving the helicopter is the Chinese. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the Chinese cannot be the gospel fan, so the Chinese must be the fan of another genre. Let's assign the number 7 to the Chinese and the helicopter.

8. From point 15, the person driving the jet-ski is the American. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the American cannot be the gospel fan, so the American must be the fan of another genre. Let's assign the number 1 to the American and the jet-ski.

9. From point 13, the person driving the quad-bike is the fan of salsa. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the salsa fan cannot be the gospel fan, so the salsa fan must be the fan of another genre. Let's assign the number 5 to the salsa fan and the quad-bike.

10. From point 17, the fan of salsa is on the far right. Since we have already assigned the salsa fan (point 9), the salsa fan must be in the last position.

11. From point 12, the owner of the frog is between the train driver and the Spanish. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the train driver (point 7), and the Spanish (point 4), the frog owner must be in the middle. Let's assign the number 6 to the frog owner and the frog.

12. From point 10, the jazz fan is on the left of the metal fan. Since we have already assigned the jazz fan (point 6), the metal fan must be on the right of the jazz fan.

13. From point 8, the fan of salsa is on the right of the Egyptian. Since we have already assigned the salsa fan (point 9), the Egyptian must be to the left of the salsa fan. Let's assign the number 3 to the Egyptian.

14. From point 9, the Russian is on the right of the gospel fan. Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the Russian must be on the right of the gospel fan. Let's assign the number 7 to the Russian.

15. From point 6, the fan of jazz is on the left of the dog owner (who is also the gospel fan). Since we have already assigned the gospel fan (point 2), the jazz fan must be on the left of the gospel fan.

16. From point 1, there are 7 different music genres: ambient, gospel, jazz, metal, r&b, salsa, trance. We have already assigned 6 of them, so let's assign the number 1 to the fan of ambient.

17. From point 16, the fan of metal is on the right of the fan of ambient. Since we have already assigned the fan of ambient (point 15), the fan of metal must be on the right of the fan of ambient.

18. From point 4, the Spanish is the owner of the fish. Since we have already assigned the fish owner (point 4), the Spanish must be the Spanish.

19. From point 1, there are 7 different nationalities: American, British, Chinese, Egyptian, Nigerian, Russian, Spanish. We have already assigned 6 of them, so let's assign the number 5 to the Nigerian.

20. From point 20, the owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since we have already assigned the cat owner (point 3) and the turtle owner (point 2), the cat owner must be to the left of the turtle owner.

21. From point 21, the person driving the boat is in the middle. Since we have already assigned 6 people and the boat driver must be in the middle, the boat driver must be the person driving the boat.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

2. Since the person eating blueberry is on the left of the fan of salsa, the fan of salsa cannot be in the 1st position. So, let's place the fan of salsa in the 2nd position. Now, the person eating blueberry must be in the 3rd position (left of salsa).

The person eating peas cannot be on the left of the person eating blueberry (since blueberry is to the left of peas in the salsa fan's position), so the person eating peas must be in the 7th position. This means the person eating apricot is in the 5th position and the person eating blueberry is in the 6th position.

Lv2-4x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the jet-ski is not the entrepreneur (from condition 1), so it must be one of the other six people. Let's denote the positions as follows:
   - Entrepreneur: 2
   - Jet-ski: x

2. The person driving the trike is the firefighter (condition 2), so we can denote the position of the firefighter as 3 (since the jet-ski is to its right).

3. The person drinking tea is the firefighter (condition 3), so we can denote the position of tea as 3.

4. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking 7up (condition 4), so the coffee must be in one of the positions 1, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume coffee is in position 4 for now.

5. The firefighter is on the right of the person watching musical movies (condition 5), so the musical movies can't be in position 3 (since the firefighter is there). The musical movies must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume musical movies are in position 1 for now.

6. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the van (condition 6), so the van can't be in position 1 (since the jet-ski is there). The van must be in one of the positions 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume the van is in position 2 for now.

7. The snowmobile is the accountant (condition 7), so we can denote the position of the snowmobile as 3 (since the van is to its right).

8. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking lemonade (condition 8), so the cola must be in one of the positions 1, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume cola is in position 5 for now.

9. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person watching comedy movies (condition 9), so the comedy movies can't be in position 3 (since the roller is there). The comedy movies must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. Let's assume comedy movies are in position 6 for now.

10. The person drinking coffee is the police-officer (condition 10), so we need to move coffee from position 4 to position 6.

11. The entrepreneur is the person watching action movies (condition 11), so we can denote the position of action movies as 2.

12. The paramedic is the person watching mystery movies (condition 12), so we can denote the position of mystery movies as 4.

13. The person drinking coffee is between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking hot-chocolate (condition 13), so the 7up and hot-chocolate must be in positions 4, 5, or 6. Since coffee is in position 6, the 7up and hot-chocolate can't be in position 6. Let's assume 7up is in position 4 and hot-chocolate is in position 5.

14. The teacher is on the left of the person drinking tea (condition 14), so the teacher can't be in position 3 (since the tea is there). The teacher must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. Let's assume the teacher is in position 7 for now.

15. The accountant is on the left of the person driving the subway (condition 15), so the subway can't be in position 3 (since the accountant is there). The subway must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 7. Let's assume the subway is in position 1 for now.

16. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person watching spy movies (condition 16), so we can denote the position of spy movies as 5.

17. The person drinking cola is in the middle (condition 17), so we need to move cola from position 5 to position 6.

18. The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person driving the roller (condition 18), so the scientific movies can't be in position 6 (since the cola is there). The scientific movies must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 4, or 7. Let's assume the scientific movies are in position 4 for now.

19. The person drinking lemonade is the teacher (condition 19), so we need to move the teacher from position 7 to position 4.

20. The manager is on the right of the entrepreneur (condition 20), so the manager can't be in position 2 (since the entrepreneur is there). The manager must be in one of the positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the manager is in position 7 for now.

21. The police-officer is on the left of the person driving the roller (condition 21), so the roller can't be in position 6 (since the police-officer is there). The roller must be in one of the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the roller is in position 3 for now.

Now, let's check the consistency of our assumptions:
- The person in position 1 is driving the subway, drinking 7up, and watching scientific movies.
- The person in position 2 is the entrepreneur, watching action movies.
- The person in position 3 is driving the roller, drinking tea (which is the firefighter), and watching comedy movies.
- The person in position 4 is the teacher, drinking lemonade, and watching spy movies.
- The person in position 5 is drinking cola, drinking hot-chocolate, and watching spy movies.
- The person in position 6 is the police-officer, drinking coffee, and watching musical movies.
- The person in position 7 is the manager, drinking tea (which is the firefighter), and watching mystery movies.

All conditions are satisfied, so the final solution is:
