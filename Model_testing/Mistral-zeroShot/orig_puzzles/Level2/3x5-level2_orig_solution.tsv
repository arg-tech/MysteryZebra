Lv2-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is singing is on the far left, so we can place singing in the first column. Let's assume singing is in position 1.

2. The person driving the roller is on the far left, so roller must be in the first row.

3. Now, let's place the transport options in the first row based on the given conditions:
   - The person driving the roller is on the far left, so roller is in position 1.
   - The person driving the boat is between the person driving the train and the person driving the taxi. Since roller is in position 1, boat must be in position 3 or 5. However, the person eating carrot is the person driving the boat (point 9), so boat must be in position 3. This means train is in position 2 and taxi is in position 4 or 5. Since the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the boat (point 8), taxi must be in position 5. This leaves subway for position 4.

4. Now, let's place the hobbies in the first row based on the given conditions:
   - The person driving the roller has the hobby of singing (point 4), so we already have singing in position 1.
   - The person driving the boat has the hobby of board-games (point 9), so board-games must be in position 3.
   - The person driving the train has the hobby of puzzles (point 2, since zucchini is between garlic and train, and we don't know the order of garlic and train yet).
   - The person driving the subway has the hobby of woodworking (point 6).
   - This leaves singing, video-games, and puzzles for the second row. Since the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (point 5), singing must be in position 2 and video-games in position 3. This leaves puzzles for position 4.

5. Now, let's place the food in the second row based on the given conditions:
   - The person eating zucchini is between the person eating garlic and the person driving the train (point 2). Since we don't know the order of garlic and train yet, let's assume garlic is in position 2 and zucchini is in position 3. This leaves spinach, carrot, and papaya for the second row.
   - The person eating papaya is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (point 10), so papaya must be in position 4.
   - This leaves carrot for position 1. However, the person driving the boat is the person eating carrot (point 9), which contradicts our assumption that garlic is in position 2. So, we need to swap garlic and carrot. This means garlic is in position 1 and carrot is in position 2.

6. Now, we have the final solution:

|             |    1    |      2      |      3      |      4      |    5    |
| Food        | Carrot  |   Garlic   |   Zucchini  |   Papaya   |  Spinach |
| Hobby       | Board-games | Singing | Puzzles | Video-games | Woodworking |
| Transport   | Boat     |   Roller   |   Train    |   Taxi     |  Subway   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking tea is on the far left, Tea goes in the first column.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is the person watching family movies, so Family goes in the third column, and Soy-milk goes in the third row.
3. The person eating apricot is the person watching drama movies, so Drama goes in the second row, and Apricot goes in the second column.
4. The person watching spy movies is in the middle, which means it should be in the third row. However, we already know that the third row is Soy-milk. Since the person watching spy movies is also eating raspberry (from rule 9), Raspberry must be in the third row as well. This means Spy and Raspberry must swap places, so Spy goes in the third row and Raspberry goes in the fourth row.
5. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since Tea is in the first column, Animation must be in the fifth column.
6. The person eating mango is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since Milk is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of Mango yet.
7. The person drinking 7up is the person eating cherry. Since Cherry is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of 7up yet.
8. The person eating raspberry is between the person drinking coffee and the person watching family movies. Since Coffee is not yet placed and Family is in the third column, this rule doesn't provide any new information.

At this point, we have placed Tea, Family, Drama, Spy, and Animation. We know that Mango and Cherry are not placed yet, and we don't have enough information to place them. However, we can place Coffee and 7up based on rules 7 and 6. Let's place Coffee in the second row (since it can't be in the first row because of rule 1) and 7up in the fourth row (since it can't be in the fifth row because of rule 5).

Now, the person eating raspberry is between Coffee and Family. Since Family is in the third column, Raspberry must be in the second column. This means Cherry must be in the fifth column (since it is paired with 7up).

Finally, the only remaining food, Mango, can be placed in the first column, as it can't be in the second or fifth column (because of rules 3 and 5).

The final solution table is:

```

Lv2-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies are different, so we can write them down in any order. Let's start with singing (S), dancing (D), magic-tricks (M), baking (B), and writing (W).

2. The fan of metal (M) is the person who's hobby is singing (S). So, we can replace M in the music-genre column with pop (P) since pop can't be the genre of S (from condition 3). Now our music-genre column is: P, T, I, H, T.

3. The fan of trance (T) is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing (D). Since T is already in the first position, D must be in the second position. So, our hobby column is: S, D, M, B, W.

4. The fan of pop (P) is between the person who's hobby is baking (B) and the person who's hobby is singing (S). Since D is already in the second position, P must be in the third position. So, our hobby column is: S, D, P, B, W.

5. The fan of trance (T) is on the left of the fan of hip-hop (H). Since T is already in the first position, H must be in the third position. So, our hobby column is: S, D, H, P, W.

6. The owner of the rabbit (R) is on the left of the fan of pop (P). Since P is already in the third position, R must be in the second position. So, our hobby column is: S, R, H, D, W.

7. The person who's hobby is baking (B) is on the left of the owner of the dog (D). Since R is already in the second position, B must be in the first position. So, our hobby column is: B, R, H, D, S.

8. The fan of indie (I) is in the middle. Since our hobby column is now B, R, H, D, S, I must be in the fourth position. So, our hobby column is: B, R, H, I, D, S.

9. The owner of the guinea-pig (G) is on the left of the fan of trance (T). Since T is already in the first position, G must be in the second position. So, our hobby column is: G, R, H, I, D, S.

10. The person who's hobby is writing (W) is on the left of the owner of the hamster (H). Since H is already in the fourth position, W must be in the third position. So, our hobby column is: G, R, W, H, I, D.

Now we have the final solution:

|               |    1    |      2       |     3      |    4    |    5    |

| Pet           | rabbit  | guinea-pig  | hamster    | dog     |         |

Lv2-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 jobs, 5 nationalities, and 5 means of transport. Let's assign each person a unique identifier (1-5) for each category.

2. From point 10, the American is on the left of the Argentine. So, American = 1, Argentine = 2.

3. From point 9, the person driving the airplane is on the left of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is 3 (from point 2, the Egyptian is the third nationality), the person driving the airplane is 4.

4. From point 10 and 9, the Egyptian is 3. From point 5, the librarian is on the right of the Egyptian, so the librarian is 5.

5. From point 8, the Indonesian is on the left of the chef. Since the Indonesian is not yet assigned, let's assign Indonesian = 4. Now, the chef is 5.

6. From point 6, the software-developer is the person driving the ship. Since the software-developer is not yet assigned, let's assign software-developer = 2. Now, the person driving the ship is 2.

7. From point 7, the person driving the taxi is on the left of the French. Since the French is 1 (from point 2, the French is the second nationality), the person driving the taxi is 3.

8. From point 4, the librarian is between the person driving the trike and the chef. Since the librarian is 5 and the chef is 5, the person driving the trike is 3.

9. From point 3, the architect is on the left of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is 2, the architect is 1.

10. From point 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is 3, the person driving the motorbike is 4 or 5. However, from point 5, the librarian is 5 and the librarian is on the right of the Egyptian, so the person driving the motorbike must be 4.

Lv2-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nurse is on the left of the owner of the pony, and the owner of the dog is on the far left, the nurse cannot be the owner of the dog. Also, the nurse cannot be the owner of the pony because the pony's owner does sport Parkour, and the nurse's job is not compatible with Parkour. So, the nurse must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the videographer and the person who's sport is surfing. Since the videographer is on the far left, the weightlifter cannot be in position 1. Also, the surfing person cannot be in position 5 because the owner of the goldfish is between the analyst and the owner of the lizard, and there's no room for the surfing person between the analyst and the lizard's owner. So, the weightlifter must be in position 3, and the surfing person must be in position 4.

3. The owner of the pony is the person who's sport is parkour. Since the nurse cannot be the owner of the pony, the parkour person must be in positions 2, 3, or 4. However, we already placed the weightlifter and the surfing person in positions 3 and 4, so the parkour person must be in position 2.

4. The videographer is on the left of the police-officer. Since the videographer is already in position 1, the police-officer must be in position 2.

5. The owner of the dog is on the far left (position 1).

6. The owner of the goldfish is between the analyst and the owner of the lizard. Since the analyst cannot be in position 1 (the dog owner is there), the goldfish owner must be in position 2, and the lizard owner must be in position 3.

7. The dressmaker is in the middle (position 4).

8. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left (position 1). However, we already placed the dog owner in position 1. So, the snowboarding person cannot be in position 1. The only remaining position for the snowboarding person is position 5.

Now, let's arrange the jobs, pets, and sports:

|         |      1       |       2        |     3      |     4      |    5    |
| Job     | Dog owner   | Goldfish owner | Pony owner | Dressmaker | Snowboarder |
| Pet     | Dog         | Goldfish      | Pony      | -         | -        |
| Sport   | Snowboarding| -             | Parkour    | -         | -        |

We still need to fill in the pets and sports for positions 2, 3, and 4. Since the goldfish owner is in position 2, the pet for position 2 is the goldfish. The pony owner does Parkour, so the sport for position 2 is Parkour. The only remaining sport is weightlifting, so it must be for position 3. The only remaining pet is the lizard, so it must be for position 3.

Finally, we have the following solution:

|         |      1       |       2        |     3      |     4      |    5    |
| Job     | Dog owner   | Goldfish owner | Pony owner | Dressmaker | Snowboarder |
| Pet     | Dog         | Goldfish      | Pony      | -         | -        |
| Sport   | Snowboarding| Parkour       | Weightlifting | -         | -        |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact order of the pets. So, the final solution table is:

|         |      1       |       2        |     3      |     4      |    5    |
| Job     | Dog owner   | Goldfish owner | Pony owner | Dressmaker | Snowboarder |
| Pet     | Dog         | Goldfish      | Pony      | -         | -        |

2. We know that the sport of snowboarding is on the far left, so it must be person A. Let's assign it to the Sport column: A - Snowboarding.

3. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left, the person to the right of A must be the person who's sport is baseball. Let's assign it to the Sport column: B - Baseball.

4. The japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball, so person C must be Japanese. Let's assign it to the Nationality column: C - Japanese.

5. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the fan of gospel, so person D must be the fan of gospel. Let's assign it to the Music-Genre column: D - Gospel.

6. The fan of gospel is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so person E must be the fan of ice-hockey. Let's assign it to the Music-Genre column: E - Ice-Hockey.

7. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the french and the fan of d&b, so person B must be French and person D (the fan of gospel) must be the fan of d&b. Let's assign them to the Nationality and Music-Genre columns respectively: B - French, D - d&b.

8. The dutch is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour, so person A (snowboarder) must be Dutch. Let's assign it to the Nationality column: A - Dutch.

9. The fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of house, so person E (ice-hockey) must be the fan of house. Let's assign it to the Music-Genre column: E - House.

10. The fan of punk is on the right of the fan of gospel, so person C (Japanese) must be the fan of punk. Let's assign it to the Music-Genre column: C - Punk.

11. We have filled all the columns, so the final solution table is:

Now, let's fill the missing Music-Genre columns:

- The person who's sport is parkour is to the right of the Dutch (snowboarder), so person B must be the fan of salsa. Let's assign it to the Music-Genre column: B - Salsa.

Lv2-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the owner of the dog. Let's place the soy-milk drinker and the dog owner in the first two spots, and we'll assume the soy-milk drinker has the dog. So, the first row and column would be:

   | Beverage | Soy-milk | Cola | ... |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | Country | ... |
   | Pet | Dog | ... | ... |

   Now we know that the soy-milk drinker is the owner of the pony (from point 8), so we can place the pony in the second row.

2. The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since we've placed the soy-milk drinker and the pony owner in the first two spots, the cola drinker must be in the third spot. So, the second row and column would be:

   | Beverage | Soy-milk | Cola | ... |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | R&B | ... |
   | Pet | Dog | Pony | ... |

   Now we know that the owner of the pony is the fan of r&b (from point 6), so we can place R&B in the third column.

3. The fan of country is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since we've placed the soy-milk drinker, cola drinker, and the pony owner in the first three spots, the tea drinker must be in the fourth spot. So, the third row and column would be:

   | Beverage | Soy-milk | Cola | Tea | ... |
   | Music-Genre | Classical | R&B | Country | ... |
   | Pet | Dog | Pony | ... | ... |

   Now we know that the owner of the snake is the fan of country (from point 7), so we can place snake in the third column.

4. The person drinking 7up is the fan of classical (from point 4), so we can place 7up in the first row and Classical in the first column.

5. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person drinking 7up (from point 9). Since we've placed 7up in the first row, the sprite drinker must be in the second row. So, the fourth row and column would be:

   | Beverage | Sprite | ... | ... | ... |
   | Music-Genre | ... | ... | ... | ... |
   | Pet | ... | ... | ... | Turtle |

   Now we know that the fan of ambient is on the left of the person drinking sprite (from point 10), so we can place Ambient in the first column.

6. The only remaining spot is for the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is between the fan of country and the fan of r&b (from point 2), the tea drinker must be in the fifth spot. So, the fifth row and column would be:

   | Beverage | Tea | ... | ... | ... |
   | Music-Genre | ... | Country | R&B | ... |
   | Pet | ... | ... | Pony | Turtle |

   Now we have the final solution:

5. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we have five people now, let's place the turtle owner in the first column and the snowmobile driver in the sixth column.

   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   |         |      |          |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   | Lemon   |       | Snowmobile|

6. The person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since we have six people now, let's place the lizard owner in the fifth column and the van driver in the sixth column.

   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   |         |      |          |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   | Lemon   | Lizard | Snowmobile|
   |         | Guinea-pig| Van      |

7. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we have seven people now, there's no more room to the right of the hedgehog. This condition cannot be satisfied with the current arrangement. Let's rearrange the table so that the guinea-pig owner is on the right of the hedgehog owner.

   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   |         |      |          |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   | Lemon   | Lizard | Snowmobile|
   | Guinea-pig|       | Van      |

8. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since we have seven people now, let's place the helicopter driver in the sixth column.

   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   |         |      |          |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   | Lemon   | Lizard | Helicopter|
   | Guinea-pig|       | Van      |

9. The owner of the lizard is between the person driving the ship and the person driving the van. Since we have six people now, let's move the lizard to the third column.

   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   | Lemon   | Lizard| Van      |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   |         |        | Helicopter|
   | Guinea-pig|       |          |

10. The person driving the skateboard is not mentioned, so we can't place any of the remaining people on a skateboard. Since all the conditions are satisfied, the final solution table is:

   #############
   | Beverage | Pet  | Transport |
   |---------|------|----------|
   | Turtle  | Fish | Ship     |
   | Almond  |      | Water    |
   | Lemon   | Lizard| Van      |
   | Soy     | Hedgehog |          |
   |         | Lizard | Helicopter|
   | Guinea-pig|       |          |
   ############

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv2-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the car is in the middle, so we can fill the third row with 'car'.

2. The software-developer is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter. Since the car is in the middle, the software-developer cannot be in the first, third, or fifth positions. So, the software-developer can be in the second position. Let's fill the second row with 'software-developer' and the fifth row with 'scooter'.

3. The person driving the van is the person who's sport is sailing. Since the car is in the middle, the van cannot be in the first, third, or fifth positions. So, the van can be in the second, fourth, or fifth positions. However, since the software-developer is in the second position, the van cannot be in the second position. So, the van can be either in the fourth or fifth position. Let's assume it's in the fourth position for now. Let's fill the fourth row with 'van' and the first row with 'sailing' (since the person who's sport is sailing is the chef according to rule 4).

4. Now, the person who's sport is sailing is the chef. So, the chef must be in the first position.

5. The person who's sport is rugby is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter. Since the chef is in the first position and the software-developer is in the second position, the person who's sport is rugby must be in the third position.

6. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the chef. Since the chef is in the first position, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in the fifth position.

7. The entrepreneur is on the left of the engineer. Since the chef is in the first position and the person who's sport is water-polo is in the fifth position, the entrepreneur must be in the second position and the engineer in the fourth position.

8. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the software-developer is driving the scooter and is in the second position, the person driving the bike must be in the fifth position.

9. The chef is on the far right. Since the chef is already in the first position, this condition is satisfied.

10. The person who's sport is rugby is the software-developer. But we have already placed the software-developer in the second position. This condition contradicts our previous placement of the software-developer. However, if we assume that the van is in the fifth position instead of the fourth (as assumed earlier), then the software-developer can be in the fourth position, and the person who's sport is rugby can be in the third position, which satisfies this condition.

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |     1      |         2          |      3       |     4      |    5    |
| Job         | chef      | software-developer | entrepreneur  | engineer   | bike    |
| Sport       | sailing   | basketball        | rugby         | soccer     | water-polo|
| Transport   | car       | scooter           | van           | roller     | bike    |

However, this solution assumes that the van is in the fifth position, which was not our initial assumption. So, there might be another solution where the van is in the fourth position, but I couldn't find it. The given conditions seem to allow for multiple solutions due to the ambiguity in the placement of the van."
Lv2-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Let's assume the hobby of the first person is magic-tricks (column 1). Then, the hobby of the second person must be reading (column 2).

2. The Italian is on the right of the German. Since the second person is reading, the third person must be the German (column 3).

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the Egyptian. If the third person is German, then the fourth person must be skydiving (column 4). The fifth person must be the Egyptian, as the Italian is on the right of the German (column 5).

4. The person who's hobby is cooking is between the Colombian and the Italian. The first person is doing magic-tricks, the second is reading, the third is German, and the fourth is skydiving. So, the first available spot for cooking is the first position, and the Colombian must be in the second position.

5. The owner of the horse is on the far right. Since the fifth person is the Egyptian, the horse must be owned by the Egyptian (column 5).

6. The person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the German. The third person is German, so the sixth person must be photography (column 6).

7. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since the second person is reading, the fourth person is skydiving, the fifth person is the Egyptian with the horse, and the sixth person is photography, the seventh person must be the owner of the guinea-pig and the eighth person must be the owner of the dog.

8. The owner of the fish is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the horse. Since the fifth person is the Egyptian with the horse, the sixth person is photography, the seventh person is the owner of the guinea-pig, and the eighth person is the owner of the dog, the ninth person must be the owner of the fish, and the tenth person must be the owner of the goldfish.

Here is the final solution table:
