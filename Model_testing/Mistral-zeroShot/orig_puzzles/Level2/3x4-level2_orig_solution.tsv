Lv2-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Let's denote the positions as follows: T (Trike), F (Ferret), C (Cat), L (Lizard), A (Artichoke), S (Snowmobile), B (Blueberry), V (Van), G (Garlic), and Asp (Asparagus).

   So, T < F

2. The person driving the van is the owner of the cat. This means V > C

3. The person eating blueberry is on the far left. This means B = 1

4. The person eating artichoke is on the far right. This means A = 4

5. The owner of the ferret is between the person driving the trike and the person eating asparagus. Since F < A and T < F, we can deduce that A > F > T

6. The owner of the lizard is the person driving the snowmobile. This means L = S

7. The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since V > F and F > T, we can deduce that V > F > T

Now we have the following information:

   T < F < V
   L = S
   B = 1
   A = 4
   A > F > T

8. Since there are only 4 positions, and we know that B = 1 and A = 4, we can deduce that the positions for the remaining foods are:
   - Garlic (G) is in position 3 (since A = 4 and A > F > T, G must be between F and T)
   - Asparagus (Asp) is in position 2 (since A > F and A = 4, Asp must be to the right of F and to the left of T)

9. Now we know the positions for all the foods. Since the owner of the ferret is between the person driving the trike and the person eating asparagus, we can deduce that the position for the ferret (F) is 2.

10. Since the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the ferret, the position for the cat (C) is 3.

11. Since the owner of the lizard is the person driving the snowmobile, the position for the lizard (L) is 5.

12. Since the person driving the van is the owner of the cat, the position for the van (V) is 3.

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column. Let's assume it's hobby is H1.

2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the far left and also watches zombie movies (from point 5), so we can place it in the top left corner, making it S1 and M4.

3. Since the person who's sport is climbing is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (from point 2), and the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left, the person who's hobby is chess must be in the second column. Let's assume it's hobby is H2.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is between the person watching zombie movies (S1) and the person who's hobby is reading (from point 4). Since S1 is in the top left corner, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the second row and third column, making it S3.

5. From point 6, the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since H2 is the person who's hobby is chess and it's in the second column, the person watching fantasy movies must be in the first column, making it M1.

6. The person watching sports movies must be the person who's sport is surfing, as stated in point 7. Since S3 is the person who's sport is swimming and it's in the second row, the person watching sports movies must be in the third column, making it M3.

7. The only hobby left is reading. Since it can't be in the first column (as it's not drawing or watching fantasy movies), it must be in the fourth column.

8. The only sport left is climbing. Since it's to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (H2), it must be in the third row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking sprite is on the far right (4), so we can place it in the last column and the last row. Let's put Sprite in the 4th row, 3rd column.

2. The fan of house is on the far left, so it should be in the first column. Since the person drinking sprite is on the far right, the fan of house cannot be in the same row. So, it can only be in the first row, and we can put House in the 1st column, 1st row.

3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left, so it should be in the first column as well. Since the fan of house is already in the first column, the person who cooks must be in the second row. So, we can put Cooking in the 1st column, 2nd row.

4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, it should be in the first or second column. Since the person who cooks is in the first column, the person who does photography must be in the second column. So, we can put Photography in the 2nd column, 2nd row.

5. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the fan of country. Since the person who does photography is in the second column, the person who collects must be in the first column. Since the person who cooks is in the second row, the person who collects must be in the first row. So, we can put Collecting in the 1st column, 1st row.

6. The fan of country is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person who collects is in the first row, the fan of country cannot be in the first row. So, it can only be in the second or third row. Since the person who does photography is in the second row, the fan of country must be in the third row. Since the person drinking sprite is in the fourth row, the fan of country cannot be in the fourth row. So, the fan of country must be in the third row. So, we can put Country in the 2nd column, 3rd row.

7. The fan of folk is between the fan of indie and the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking sprite is in the fourth row, the person drinking mirinda must be in the third row. Since the fan of country is in the third row, the fan of folk cannot be in the third row. So, the fan of folk must be in the second row. Since the fan of house is in the first row, the fan of folk cannot be in the first row. So, the fan of folk must be in the second row. Since the fan of country is in the third column, the fan of folk cannot be in the third column. So, the fan of folk must be in the first or fourth column. Since the person who does photography is in the second column, the fan of folk must be in the fourth column. Since the person drinking sprite is in the fourth row, the fan of folk cannot be in the fourth row. So, the fan of folk must be in the second row. But we already placed the fan of folk in the second row. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption about the fan of folk being in the second row was incorrect. Let's try placing the fan of folk in the first row instead. This satisfies all the conditions, so the final solution is:

Lv2-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the scooter is on the far left, so let's place the scooter driver in the first row, first column. Let's assume the scooter driver is Australian and their sport is skateboarding (A1).

2. The person driving the bus is between the person driving the ship and the Polish. Since the scooter driver is on the far left, the bus driver cannot be in the first row, so let's place the bus driver in the second row. The ship driver must be above the bus driver, so let's place the ship driver in the first row, second column (S2). Now, the Polish person cannot be in the first row, so let's place the Polish person in the second row, third column (P3). This means the bus driver is between the ship driver and the Polish person, and the bus driver's nationality is not Australian (B2).

3. The German is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since we have already placed the scooter driver, ship driver, bus driver, and Polish person, the only remaining person is the cyclist. Let's place the cyclist in the third row, first column (C3). Now, the German must be in the fourth row, which means the cyclist's sport is not tennis (C3). The remaining sports are cricket, skateboarding, and tennis. Since the scooter driver is doing skateboarding (A1), the cyclist cannot be doing skateboarding. So, the cyclist is playing cricket (C3). Now, the German can be either Dutch or Polish, but since the Polish person is already in the third column (P3), the German must be Dutch (G4).

4. The German is on the right of the Australian. Since the German is in the fourth row (G4), the Australian must be in the third row, second column (A3).

5. The person driving the car is not the Polish (P3) or the German (G4). The remaining nationalities are Australian (A3) and Dutch (C3). Since the bus driver is not Australian (B2), the car driver must be Dutch (D2).

6. The person driving the ship is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the car##2. Since the ship driver is in the first row (S2) and the cricket player is in the third row (C3), the car driver must be between the ship driver and the cricket player. But we have already placed the car driver (D2), so this condition is not possible. However, if we interpret the ""##2"" as ""is not the second person"", then the condition is satisfied. So, the car driver is not the second person, which means the Dutch person (D2) is not the second person. The remaining nationalities for the second person are Australian (A1) and Polish (P3). Since the scooter driver is Australian (A1), the second person must be Polish (P2).

Final solution table:

```

|   A1      | S2 | P3 |
|  Skateboarding |     |    |

In this table, the nationalities are listed in the rows, sports are listed in the columns, and the symbols represent the means of transport. The symbols for the means of transport are not explicitly given in the table, but we can infer them based on the given information. For example, since the scooter driver is Australian and their sport is skateboarding (A1), we can infer that the symbol for the scooter is in the A1 cell. Similarly, we can infer the symbols for the other means of transport."
Lv2-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is handball is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking fanta. Let's place handball in the second position (2). Since the person who's sport is handball is also the person drinking tea, we can place tea in the third position (3). This means almond-milk must be in the first position (1).

2. Now, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. So, lemonade must be in the fourth position (4).

3. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far right. Since we have already placed all the other hobbies, sudoku must be in the second position (2). But we already placed handball there. This means sudoku cannot be the hobby of the person playing handball. So, sudoku must be in the third position (3).

4. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since we have already placed golf in the fourth position (4), basketball must be in the third position (3).

5. The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we have already placed golf in the fourth position (4), the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in the second position (2).

6. Now, we are left with the hobby of gardening. Since sudoku is in the third position (3), gardening must be in the first position (1).

7. The person who's sport is handball is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's hobby is gardening. But we have already placed handball in the second position (2) and golf in the fourth position (4). So, the person who's hobby is gardening must be in the third position (3).

8. Finally, we have placed all the beverages. So, almond-milk is in the first position (1), fanta is in the second position (2), lemonade is in the third position (3), and tea is in the fourth position (4).

Here is the final solution table:

6. The person eating cranberry is between the person eating cherry and the person eating cucumber. Since we already have cherry in the first food column and we don't have any food in the third food column, we can place cucumber in the third food column.

7. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we already have ice-hockey in the fourth sport column, we can place fishing in the fifth hobby column.

3. From point 4, the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. So, let's place Spy in the last column and Food4 (let's say it's Pomegranate) in the last row.

4. From point 6, the person eating papaya is between the person watching epic movies and the person watching mystery movies. Since we already placed Mystery in the first column, the only possible position for Papaya is the second column and the second row (since it can't be in the first row because of point 5). So, let's place Epic in the second row and Food2 (let's say it's Papaya).

5. From point 7, the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since we already placed Pomegranate in the last column, the only possible position for Drama is the third column and the first row. So, let's place Drama in the third row and Food3 (let's say it's Pepper) in the third column.

6. From point 5, the person eating pepper is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since we already placed Pepper in the third column, the only possible position for Badminton is the second column and the third row.

   |               |    1    |    2    |    3    |      4      |
   | Hobby         | Sudoku | Rabbit | Crime   | Cooking    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Western|        |        |            |
   | Pet           | Hamster |       |        |            |

6. The cooking hobby person is on the left of the spy movie watcher. Since the cooking hobby person is in the fourth column, the spy movie watcher must be in the third column.

   |               |    1    |    2    |    3    |      4      |
   | Hobby         | Sudoku | Rabbit | Spy    | Cooking    |
   | Movie-Genre   | Western|        |        |            |
   | Pet           | Hamster |       |        |            |

Now, we have the movie genres, but we don't know the exact hobbies yet. Let's assign the hobbies based on the information we have:

- Sudoku hobby person is in the first column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as board-games for now.
- The western movie watcher is in the last column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as camping for now.
- The rabbit owner is in the second column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as cooking for now.
- The crime movie watcher is in the third column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as sudoku for now.
- The lizard owner is in the first column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as board-games for now.
- The cooking hobby person is in the fourth column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as camping for now.
- The spy movie watcher is in the third column, so this person could be doing any hobby. Let's assign this as board-games for now.

Now, let's check the consistency of our assignments:

- The person watching western movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster, which is true.
- The person watching crime movies is between the owner of the rabbit and the person's hobby is camping, which is true.
- The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the owner of the lizard, which is true.
- The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the hamster, which is true.
- The person watching western movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, which is true.
- The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person watching spy movies, which is true.

Since all conditions are satisfied, our assignments are correct.

Final solution table:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Board-games| Cooking | Sudoku  | Camping    |
| Movie-Genre   | Western |        |        |            |
| Pet           | Hamster  | Rabbit |        |            |

However, we don't have enough information to determine the movie genres for the first three people. The table below shows the possible movie genres for the first three people:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |      4      |
| Hobby         | Board-games| Cooking | Sudoku  | Camping    |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy  |        |        |            |
|              | Crime   |        |        |            |
|              | Spy    |        |        |            |
|              | Western |        |        |            |
| Pet           | Hamster  | Rabbit |        |            |

The exact movie genres for the first three people cannot be determined with the given information."
Lv2-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of techno. Let's place them in the first two spots, with salsa on the left (1) and techno on the right (2).

   |   | 1 | 2 |  |  |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food |   |   |   |   |
   | Hobby |   |   |   |   |
   | Music-Genre |   |   |   |   |

2. The person who's hobby is photography is eating eggplant. Since the photography hobby is between the fan of salsa and the person who's hobby is chess, we can place photography in the middle (3).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |  |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food | eggplant |   |   |   |
   | Hobby | salsa | photography | chess |  |
   | Music-Genre |   |   |   |   |

3. The fan of house is on the left of the person eating mango. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is eating mango, and woodworking is on the far right, the fan of house must be in the last spot (4).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food | eggplant |   | mango |   |
   | Hobby | salsa | photography | woodworking | chess |
   | Music-Genre | house |   |   | techno |

4. The person eating tomato is on the right of the person eating eggplant. So, tomato goes in the second to last spot (3).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food | eggplant | tomato | mango |   |
   | Hobby | salsa | photography | woodworking | chess |
   | Music-Genre | house |   |   | techno |

5. Now we know that the person who's hobby is chess is in the first spot. Since the hobby of the person in the first spot is not mentioned, we can't determine the music-genre for the first person.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food | eggplant | tomato | mango |   |
   | Hobby | chess | photography | woodworking | salsa |
   | Music-Genre | house |   |   | techno |

6. We can't determine the music-genre for the first person, so we'll leave it blank.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|--|--|
   | Food | eggplant | tomato | mango |   |
   | Hobby | chess | photography | woodworking | salsa |
   | Music-Genre |   | house |   | techno |

Final solution:

```

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle. The music-genre for the first person is not determined."
Lv2-3x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person eating pepper and the person with the hobby of gardening are on the far left. Since there are 4 people and only one can be on the far left, let's place the gardener and pepper eater in the first two columns. Let's assume the gardener is eating pepper (P) and the hobby of gardening is in column 1.

   |               |       P      |       ?      |    ?    |     ?    |

2. The person eating lettuce is not the gardener, so they must be in the third column. Let's assume the person eating lettuce (L) is in the third column.

   |               |       P      |       L      |    ?    |     ?    |

3. The person eating orange is between the person eating lettuce and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the gardener and the person eating lettuce are already placed, the person eating orange (O) must be in the second column.

   |               |       P      |       O      |    L    |     ?    |

4. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since we haven't placed the person eating pomegranate yet, let's place the comedy watcher (C) in the fourth column for now.

5. The person watching comedy movies is also on the far right. Since we already placed the comedy watcher in the fourth column, this condition is satisfied.

6. The person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already know the gardener is the person eating pepper, the gardener must be watching time-travel movies (TT).

   |               |       P      |       O      |    L    |    C    |

8. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right. Since we already placed the comedy watcher in the fourth column, the dancer must be in the fifth column. Let's assume the hobby of dancing is Dancing.

   |               |       P      |       O      |    L    |    C    |    D    |
