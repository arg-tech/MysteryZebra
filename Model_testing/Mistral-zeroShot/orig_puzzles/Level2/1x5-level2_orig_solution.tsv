Lv2-1x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is soccer is in the middle, so we can mark that position (3rd column) with 'soccer'.

   |         |       1       |    2    |   3    |   4    |     5     |
   | Sport   |               |         | soccer |        |           |

2. The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since soccer is in the 3rd column, cricket must be in the 2nd column.

   |         |       1       | cricket | soccer |        |           |
   | Sport   |               |         |        |        |           |

3. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we don't know the position of weightlifting yet, let's assume it's in the 1st column for now.

   |         | weightlifting| cricket | soccer |        |           |
   | Sport   |               |         |        |        |           |

   But this violates rule 4, as cricket is not between soccer and badminton. So, weightlifting cannot be in the 1st column.

4. Let's try placing weightlifting in the 5th column instead.

   |         |       1       |    2    |   3    | weightlifting|
   | Sport   |               |         | soccer |            |

   Now, cricket is on the left of soccer, and we can place badminton in the 4th column, as it should be between skiing and soccer.

   |         |       1       |    2    |   3    | weightlifting|
   | Sport   |               | cricket | soccer |   badminton |

5. The person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's sport is badminton. So, skiing goes in the 4th column.

   |         |       1       |    2    |   3    | skiing     | weightlifting|
   | Sport   |               | cricket | soccer |   badminton|            |

6. Finally, we have one remaining sport, which is skiing. Since it should be between soccer and badminton, it can only go in the 2nd column.

   |         |       1       | skiing  | cricket | soccer    | weightlifting|
   | Sport   |               |         |         |           |             |

7. Now, we can fill in the sports in the first column. Since cricket is on the right of weightlifting, weightlifting must be in the 1st column.

   | weightlifting|         | skiing  | cricket | soccer    |
   | Sport       | weightlifting|         |         |           |

8. The last sport is cricket, which is on the right of soccer. So, cricket goes in the 5th column.

   | weightlifting|         | skiing  |        | cricket   | soccer    |
   | Sport       | weightlifting|         | skiing  |          |           |

9. Finally, we can fill in the sports in the first column. Since soccer is in the middle, it must be in the 3rd column.

   | weightlifting| badminton | skiing  | cricket | soccer    |
   | Sport       | weightlifting|         |         |          |           |

10. Now, we can fill in the sports in the first column. Since cricket is on the right of soccer, it must be in the 5th column.

   | weightlifting| badminton | skiing  |        | cricket   | soccer    |
   | Sport       | weightlifting|         | skiing  |          |           |

11. We have filled all the sports, so we can now mark the final solution table:

   | weightlifting| badminton | skiing  |        | cricket   | soccer    |
   | Sport       | weightlifting|         | skiing  |          |           |

   The final solution is: Weightlifting, Badminton, Skiing, Cricket, Soccer."
Lv2-1x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The skateboard is on the far left (position 1). So, the table now looks like this:

|             |     1     |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Skateboard|          |           |       |     |

2. The airplane is between the skateboard and the quad-bike. So, the quad-bike must be on the right of the airplane, which means it can only be in position 5. The table now looks like this:

|             |     1     |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Skateboard|          |           | Airplane| Quad-bike|

3. The trike is on the left of the van. Since the skateboard is on the far left, the van must be in position 2. The table now looks like this:

|             |     1     |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Skateboard| Van     |           | Airplane| Quad-bike|

4. Now we have only one position left for the trike, which is position 3. The table now looks like this:

|             |     1     |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | Skateboard| Van     | Trike    | Airplane| Quad-bike|

5. We still have one more transport left, the car. Since all other positions are filled, the car must be in position 4. The final table is:

Lv2-1x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From points 2 and 3, we know that Sprite is between Fanta and Mirinda, and Mirinda is to the left of Sprite. So, the arrangement for Fanta, Mirinda, and Sprite is fixed: Fanta-Mirinda-Sprite.

2. Now, from point 1, we know that the person drinking Fanta is between the person drinking Iced-Tea and the person drinking Sprite. Since the arrangement of Fanta, Mirinda, and Sprite is fixed, the only possible position for Iced-Tea is to the left of Fanta.

3. From point 4, we know that the person drinking Iced-Tea is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since Iced-Tea is already placed to the left of Fanta, the only possible position for 7up is to the right of Sprite.

4. Now, we have placed all the beverages except for 7up. Since there are only two empty spots left (one to the left of Fanta and one to the right of Sprite), the only possible position for 7up is to the left of Fanta.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4     |  5  |

Lv2-1x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the British is on the right of the Nigerian. So, the possible positions for the British are 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. The Australian is on the right of the Indian, so the Indian cannot be in position 1. This means the Australian can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. The Australian is between the Indian and the American. If the Australian is in position 2, then the Indian must be in position 1 and the American in position 3. But this contradicts the fact that the Australian is on the right of the Indian. So, the Australian cannot be in position 2.

   If the Australian is in position 3, then the Indian must be in position 1 and the American in position 4. But this contradicts the fact that the British is on the right of the Nigerian, as the Nigerian would have to be in position 5. So, the Australian cannot be in position 3 either.

   Therefore, the only remaining position for the Australian is position 4. This means the Indian is in position 1, the American in position 2, and the British in position 5.

4. The Nigerian is on the right of the American. But the American is already in position 2, so the Nigerian must be in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-1x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the frog is to the right of the owner of the cat, and to the left of the owner of the ferret. This means that the order cannot be Cat-Frog-Ferret, as that would violate both conditions. So, the possible orders are: Ferret-Frog-Cat or Cat-Ferret-Frog.

2. Now, let's consider the owner of the turtle. It must be between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the chinchilla. If the order was Cat-Ferret-Frog, then the turtle could not be placed between the ferret and the chinchilla (as there is no chinchilla yet). So, the order must be Ferret-Frog-Cat.

3. The owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the ferret. So, the final order is: Ferret-Frog-Turtle-Cat.

4. The owner of the chinchilla must be to the left of the owner of the turtle. So, the final order is: Ferret-Frog-Turtle-Chinchilla-Cat.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the musician is on the far left, we can place him in the first column. Let's put him in position 1.

   |       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
   |-------|---------|-------|------|----------|---------|
   | Job   | Musician|       |     |          |         |

2. Now, since the lawyer is between the musician and the chef, the lawyer cannot be in position 1 (as the musician is already there) and cannot be in position 5 (as the lawyer cannot be the last one). So, the lawyer can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

   |       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
   |-------|---------|-------|------|----------|---------|
   | Job   | Musician| Lawyer|     |          |         |

3. The teacher is on the right of the designer. Since the designer cannot be in position 1 (as the musician is already there) and cannot be in position 5 (as the teacher is on the right), the designer can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. If the designer is in position 2, then the teacher must be in position 3. If the designer is in position 3, then the teacher must be in position 4. If the designer is in position 4, then the teacher can be in position 2 or 3, but since the lawyer cannot be in position 5, the teacher must be in position 2.

   So, if the designer is in position 4, the arrangement is:

   |       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
   |-------|---------|-------|------|----------|---------|
   | Job   | Musician| Lawyer| Teacher| Designer| Chef    |

   However, if the designer is in position 2, the arrangement would be:

   |       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
   |-------|---------|-------|------|----------|---------|
   | Job   | Musician| Designer| Teacher| Lawyer| Chef    |

   But this arrangement violates the condition that the lawyer is between the musician and the chef. So, the designer must be in position 4.

   Therefore, the final solution is:

   |       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |

Lv2-1x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the firefighter is in the middle, we know that the jobs to the left and right of the firefighter are two different jobs. So, the firefighter cannot be in position 1 or 5.

2. Now, let's place the firefighter in position 2. This means the jobs in positions 1 and 3 are different from the firefighter, and the job in position 4 is also different because the firefighter is between the coach and the police-officer. So, the jobs in positions 1, 3, and 4 are all different.

3. The teacher is on the right of the police-officer. Since the firefighter is in position 2, the police-officer can only be in position 1 or 3. If the police-officer were in position 1, the teacher would have to be in position 5, but we know the firefighter cannot be in position 5. So, the police-officer must be in position 3.

4. Now, we know the jobs in positions 1, 3, and 4 are different, and the police-officer is in position 3. The only remaining job for position 1 is the coach, and the only remaining job for position 4 is the social-worker.

5. With the coach in position 1, the firefighter in position 2, and the police-officer in position 3, the teacher must be in position 5.

Lv2-1x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 5).

2. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, so it must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Since the adventure movie is in column 5, horror movies can't be in column 5. So, it can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's place it in column 1 for now (we'll check later if this is possible).

3. The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since the adventure movie is in column 5 and the horror movie is in column 1, the action movie must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the action movie is in column 2, then the western movie must be in column 1, which contradicts the position of the horror movie. If the action movie is in column 3, then the western movie can be in column 2. If the action movie is in column 4 or 5, then the western movie can be in column 3. Let's place the western movie in column 3 for now (we'll check later if this is possible).

4. Now we have the horror movie in column 1, the adventure movie in column 5, and the western movie in column 3. The mystery movie is between the horror movie and the action movie. Since the horror movie is in column 1, the mystery movie can't be in column 1 or 5. So, it can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. If the mystery movie is in column 2, then the action movie must be in column 3 or 4, but this contradicts the position of the western movie. If the mystery movie is in column 3, then the action movie must be in column 4 or 5, but this contradicts the position of the adventure movie. If the mystery movie is in column 4, then the action movie must be in column 5, which is correct because the adventure movie is in column 5. So, let's place the mystery movie in column 4.

Now let's check if our placements are correct:

- The person watching adventure movies is on the far right (column 5), correct.
- The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (column 1), correct.
- The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching action movies (column 3), correct.
- The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching action movies (column 4), correct.

1. Since the bus is on the far left, we know that it's in the first column (Column 1).

2. The person driving the snowmobile is between the person driving the bus and the person driving the boat. This means the snowmobile cannot be in Column 1 (where the bus is) or Column 5 (since the boat is not on the far right). So, the snowmobile is either in Column 2, 3, or 4.

3. If the snowmobile were in Column 2, it would be to the left of the bus, which contradicts the given information. So, the snowmobile is not in Column 2.

4. If the snowmobile were in Column 4, it would be to the right of the boat, which also contradicts the given information. So, the snowmobile is not in Column 4.

5. Therefore, the snowmobile must be in Column 3.

6. Now, the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the bus is on the far left, the roller cannot be on the far left either (as it would be to the left of the bus). So, the roller is not in Column 1.

7. If the roller were in Column 5, it would be to the right of the boat, which contradicts the given information (since the bike is to the right of the roller and the boat is on the far right). So, the roller is not in Column 5.

8. If the roller were in Column 2, it would be to the left of the snowmobile, which also contradicts the given information. So, the roller is not in Column 2.

9. Therefore, the roller must be in Column 4.
