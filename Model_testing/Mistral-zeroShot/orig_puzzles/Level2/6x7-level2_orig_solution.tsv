This is the final solution table. The table is incomplete because the remaining positions for beverages, jobs, nationalities, pets, sports, and transports are not specified in the given clues."
Lv2-6x7-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by filling in the information we know:

1. The nationalities:
   - The British is on the right of the person drinking milk, so the milk must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. The Italian is in the middle, so the Italian cannot be the British. The Italian is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, so the tennis must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 7th position. Since the British is in the middle, the British cannot be the person drinking milk or the person playing tennis. Therefore, the British must be in the 1st position, and the milk must be in the 6th position. The Italian is in the 3rd position, and the tennis is in the 5th position. The remaining nationalities can be placed in the remaining positions.

2. The pets:
   - The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour, so the parkour must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. The person who's sport is soccer is in the middle, so the parkour cannot be in the 3rd position. The person drinking water is between the person who's sport is parkour and the bartender, so the bartender must be in the 1st position. The person who's sport is parkour must be in the 2nd position, and the bartender is in the 1st position. The remaining pets can be placed in the remaining positions.

3. The jobs:
   - The mechanic is between the owner of the lizard and the person who's sport is parkour, so the parkour must be in the 2nd position, and the mechanic must be in the 3rd position. The mechanic is the person drinking water, so the water is in the 3rd position. The remaining jobs can be placed in the remaining positions.

4. The music-genres:
   - The fan of indie is on the left of the Egyptian, so the Egyptian must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position. The fan of indie is also the person playing weightlifting, so the weightlifting must be in the 6th position. The fan of indie is on the far left, so the indie is in the 1st position. The fan of d&b is on the left of the Egyptian, so the Egyptian cannot be in the 1st position. Therefore, the Egyptian must be in the 2nd position, and the fan of d&b is in the 4th position. The remaining music-genres can be placed in the remaining positions.

5. The sports:
   - The person playing soccer is in the middle, so the soccer is in the 3rd position. The person playing soccer is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so the chinchilla must be in the 4th or 5th position. The person playing biathlon is on the right of the fan of indie, so the biathlon must be in the 7th position. The person playing tennis is on the left of the person drinking mirinda, so the mirinda must be in the 6th position. The person playing sailing is on the left of the person drinking mirinda, so the sailing must be in the 5th position. The remaining sports can be placed in the remaining positions.

6. The beverages:

Lv2-6x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 7 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport). Let's assign each variable a unique value from 1 to 7.

2. From the given clues, we can start by placing some elements in their correct positions. For example, we know that the Australian is eating papaya (clue 7), so we can place 'papaya' under 'Australian' in the Food column.

3. We can also place the pet 'ferret' under 'motorbike' since the owner of the ferret is driving the motorbike (clue 1).

4. Let's assign the music genres to the Nationality column based on the clues. For example, the Dutch is a fan of metal (clue 19), so we can place 'metal' under 'Dutch' in the Music-Genre column.

5. We can also place the pets under their owners based on the clues. For example, the owner of the mouse is on the right of the person eating artichoke (clue 21), so we can place 'mouse' under 'artichoke' and 'rabbit' under 'carrot' since the owner of the rabbit is eating carrot (clue 30).

6. We can place the Transport under the correct Nationality based on the clues. For example, the person driving the taxi is the British (clue 8), so we can place 'taxi' under 'British'.

7. We can now start filling in the Beverage and Food columns based on the clues. For example, the person drinking fanta is between the person eating peas and the Australian (clue 4), so we can place 'fanta' between 'peas' and 'Australian' in the Beverage column.

8. We can also place the Food under the correct Beverage based on the clues. For example, the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person eating papaya (clue 9), so we can place 'almond-milk' under 'papaya' and 'papaya' under 'almond-milk'.

9. We can continue filling in the table based on the remaining clues. For example, the person driving the trike is the British (clue 8), so we can place 'trike' under 'British'.

10. After filling in as many elements as possible, we may encounter conflicts or ambiguities. In such cases, we can use other clues to resolve these conflicts. For example, the fan of trance is in the middle (clue 27), so we can place 'trance' under the 4th Nationality since there are 7 Nationalities.

11. Continue filling in the table until all elements are placed.

The final solution table is:

```
                 |     1      |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |      6      |     7     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee    | cola     | fanta   | iced-tea   | sprite     | water     |
| Food          | artichoke  | cabbage   | carrot   | cucumber| nectarine  | papaya     | peas      |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        | folk      | hip-hop   | house   | metal       | salsa      | trance    |
| Nationality   | argentine  | australian| brazilian| british | dutch       | indonesian  | thai      |
| Pet           | bird       | ferret    | fish     | goldfish | mouse      | rabbit     | turtle    |
| Transport     | car        | motorbike | roller   | scooter  | taxi       | trike      | van       |
```

This table is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv2-6x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the first row (Food) and the first column (Person 1) and work our way through the puzzle.

1. We know that Person 1 watches horror movies, so let's assign horror movies to the first row (Food).
2. Since Person 1 is on the left of the person driving the airplane, the airplane driver cannot be Person 1. So, let's assign the airplane to the second row (Transport).
3. Now, we know that the fan of d&b is the person driving the ship, so let's assign the ship to the sixth row (Transport).
4. Person 3 is the one playing baseball, so let's assign baseball to the fourth row (Sport).
5. Person 4 plays lacrosse and is between Person 1 (horror) and Person 2 (unknown). Since Person 1 can't be Person 4 (lacrosse), Person 4 must be in the third row (Food). Let's assign lacrosse to the fifth row (Sport).
6. Person 5 watches time-travel movies and is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since Person 1 (horror) can't be Person 5, Person 5 must be in the second column (Person 2). So, let's assign time-travel movies to the second row (Movie-Genre).
7. Now, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of Person 3 (baseball). Since Person 3 is in the fourth row, let's assign the guinea-pig to the seventh column (Pet).
8. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of Person 6 (nectarine). Since Person 6 is in the fifth column, let's assign the motorbike to the third row (Transport).
9. The fan of gospel is on the right of Person 7 (soccer). Since Person 7 is in the sixth column, let's assign gospel to the sixth row (Music-Genre).
10. The fan of pop is the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster is not assigned yet, let's assign pop to the fifth row (Music-Genre) and the hamster to the sixth column (Pet).
11. Person 6 watches time-travel movies, which we know is Person 5. So, Person 5 is the fan of pop.
12. The owner of the guinea-pig is between the owner of the mouse and the person watching zombie movies. Since the guinea-pig is in the seventh column, the mouse must be in the sixth column. Let's assign the mouse to the fifth column (Pet) and zombie movies to the third row (Movie-Genre).
13. The person driving the train is on the left of Person 7 (zucchini). Since Person 7 is in the sixth column, let's assign the train to the fifth row (Transport).
14. Person 8 eats cucumber and is on the right of Person 3 (baseball). Since Person 3 is in the fourth row, let's assign cucumber to the first column (Person 1) and Person 8 to the second column (Person 2).
15. Person 9 watches drama movies and is on the far left. Since Person 1 (horror) is not on the far left, Person 9 must be in the first row (Food). Let's assign drama movies to the first row (Movie-Genre).
16. Person 10 eats artichoke and watches horror movies, which we know is Person 1. So, Person 1 is the person eating artichoke.
17. The owner of the bird is the person eating spinach. Since spinach is not assigned yet, let's assign the bird to the second column (Person 2) and spinach to the second row (Food).
18. The person driving the bus is on the left of the person eating spinach. Since the person eating spinach is in the second row, let's assign the bus to the first row (Transport).
