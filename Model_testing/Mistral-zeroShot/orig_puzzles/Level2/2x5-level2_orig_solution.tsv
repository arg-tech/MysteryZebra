Lv2-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The architect is on the far left, so let's place the architect in the first column.

| Job   | 1  |  |  |  |  |
|-------|----|--|--|--|--|
| Sport |   |  |  |  |  |

2. The architect is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the architect is already in the first column, the person who's sport is swimming must be in the second column.

| Job   | 1  | 2  |  |  |  |
|-------|----|----|--|--|--|
| Sport | A  | S  |  |  |  |

3. The lawyer is on the left of the electrician. Since the architect and the person who's sport is swimming are already placed, the electrician must be in the third column. The lawyer must be in the fourth column to the left of the electrician.

| Job   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  |  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|--|
| Sport | A  | S  | E  | L  |  |

4. The person who's sport is handball is between the electrician and the person who's sport is basketball. Since the electrician is in the third column and we don't know the position of the person who's sport is basketball yet, we can't place the person who's sport is handball yet.

5. The lawyer is on the right of the software-developer. Since the lawyer is in the fourth column, the software-developer must be in the fifth column.

| Job   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Sport | A  | S  | E  | L  | SD |

6. The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the firefighter. Since we don't know the position of the firefighter yet, we can't place the person who's sport is cricket yet.

Now let's place the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person who's sport is handball is between the electrician and the person who's sport is basketball, and the electrician is in the third column, the person who's sport is basketball must be in the fourth column.

| Job   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Sport | A  | S  | E  | B  | SD |

Finally, the person who's sport is cricket must be in the second column, since it's on the left of the firefighter and the person who's sport is basketball is in the fourth column.

| Job   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|-------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Sport | A  | C  | E  | B  | SD |

The person who's sport is handball is the only one left, so it must be in the third column.

| Sport | A  | C  | H  | B  | SD |

The final solution table is:

Lv2-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of salsa is eating lemon. Let's place them in the first row, first column (1,1).

   |   | 1 |  |  |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Lemon |  |  |  |
   | Music-Genre | Salsa |  |  |  |

2. The person eating grapefruit is on the left of the fan of techno. Since the fan of salsa is already in the first column, the fan of techno must be in the second column (2,2). So, the person eating grapefruit is in the first column, second row (1,2).

   |   | 1 | 2 |  |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Lemon | Grapefruit |  |  |
   | Music-Genre | Salsa | Techno |  |  |

3. The fan of electronic is in the middle. Since we have filled the first two columns, the fan of electronic must be in the third column (3,3).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Lemon | Grapefruit | Electronic |  |
   | Music-Genre | Salsa | Techno | Electronic |  |

4. The fan of jazz is the person eating plum. Since we know the fan of electronic is in the third column, the fan of jazz must be in the fourth column (4,4).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Lemon | Grapefruit | Electronic | Plum |
   | Music-Genre | Salsa | Techno | Electronic | Jazz |

5. The person eating apricot is on the right of the fan of house. Since we have filled all the columns except the last one, the fan of house must be in the fifth column (5,5).

   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Food | Lemon | Grapefruit | Electronic | Plum | Apricot |
   | Music-Genre | Salsa | Techno | Electronic | Jazz | House |

6. The person eating plum is between the person eating lemon and the person eating radish. Since we have already placed the person eating plum and lemon, the person eating radish must be in the fourth column (4,4). However, we already placed the fan of jazz there. This is a contradiction, as the fan of jazz is supposed to be eating plum.

There seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Lv2-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating onion and the person eating banana. Let's place them in positions where this condition is satisfied. Since the person eating onion is on the far right, the possible positions for the onion, nectarine, and banana are:

   |        |   1    |      2       |     3     |     4     |         5          |
   | Food   | onion | nectarine | banana   |   ______ |          ______     |

2. The fisherman is on the left of the engineer. Since the engineer can't be in position 1 (because the onion is there), the possible positions for the fisherman and engineer are:

   |        |   1    |      2       |     3     |     4     |         5          |

Lv2-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Chinese is on the left of the Argentine, so let's place them in the first two spots. Let's assume the Chinese is in the first spot (1) and the Argentine is in the second spot (2).

   | Food   | Nationality |
   |--------|------------|
   | Chinese| Argentine  |

2. The person eating spinach is the person eating spinach, so the spinach must be in one of the remaining spots. Since we already have the Chinese and Argentine, let's place spinach in the third spot (3).

   | Food   | Nationality |
   |--------|------------|
   | Chinese| Argentine  |
   |       | Spinach   |

3. The Chinese is the Chinese, so our assumption in the first row is correct.

4. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating radish. Since we have the spinach in the third spot, the radish must be in the fourth spot (4).

   | Food   | Nationality |
   |--------|------------|
   | Chinese| Argentine  |
   | Spinach|           |
   |       | Radish    |

5. The argentine is between the person eating artichoke and the australian. Since the Argentine is in the second spot, the artichoke must be in the first spot (swapping with the Chinese), and the Australian must be in the fourth spot (swapping with the radish).

   | Food   | Nationality |
   |--------|------------|
   | Artichoke| Argentine  |
   | Spinach |           |
   |       | Radish    |
   | Australian|          |

6. The Italian is on the left of the Malaysian. Since there is only one spot left, the Italian must be in the fifth spot (5), and the Malaysian must be in the last spot (2).

   | Food   | Nationality |

   | Artichoke| Argentine  |
   | Spinach |           |

Lv2-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person driving the bus is on the far left (row 4). So, the first row is Bus.

2. Since the person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (row 5), row 5 cannot be the first row. So, the hobby of row 5 is not rock-climbing.

3. Now, let's place the hobbies that are not rock-climbing in the remaining rows. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography (rows 1 and 3), gardening cannot be in the first row. So, gardening can be in the second, fourth, or fifth row. Let's try gardening in the second row for now.

4. If gardening is in the second row, photography must be in the third row because of the left-right relationship between gardening and photography (rows 1 and 3).

5. Now, the person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (row 2). So, the hobby of row 2 cannot be puzzles. Since we already placed gardening in row 2, the hobby of row 2 must be something other than puzzles, photography, or rock-climbing. Let's try singing for now.

6. With singing in the second row, the hobby of row 1 cannot be photography because of the left-right relationship between gardening and photography (rows 1 and 3). So, the hobby of row 1 must be something other than photography, singing, or rock-climbing. Let's try puzzles for now.

7. Now, the hobby of row 3 is photography, and the hobby of row 2 is singing. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (row 2). So, the person driving the roller cannot be in row 2. The only remaining option for the roller is row 4.

8. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (row 2), the hobby of row 4 must be something other than puzzles. Since we already placed singing in row 2, the hobby of row 4 cannot be singing. So, the hobby of row 4 must be something other than puzzles, singing, photography, or rock-climbing. Let's try gardening for now.

9. With gardening in row 4, the hobby of row 5 must be rock-climbing because the person driving the van is between the person driving the bus (row 1) and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (row 5).

10. Now, let's check the consistency of our placement. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography (rows 1 and 3), and this condition is satisfied. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (row 2), and this condition is also satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-2x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 6, we know that the videographer (orange eater) is between the musician and the person eating potato. Since there are only 5 positions, the musician must be in position 1, the videographer in position 2, and the potato eater in position 3.

2. Now, we know the positions of the musician, videographer, and potato eater. From rule 1, the photographer is to the right of the videographer, so the photographer must be in position 4.

3. From rule 2, the person eating onion is to the left of the entrepreneur. Since the musician, videographer, and potato eater are already placed, the only available positions for the onion eater are 1, 2, and 5. However, since the onion eater is to the left of the entrepreneur, the onion eater cannot be in position 2 (because the entrepreneur is in position 3). So, the onion eater must be in position 1 or 5.

   If the onion eater is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2, and the only remaining food for the entrepreneur to eat is avocado. But this contradicts rule 3, as the entrepreneur is to the left of the person eating avocado, and the avocado eater is already in position 3.

   Therefore, the onion eater must be in position 5. This means the entrepreneur must be in position 4.

4. Now, we know the positions of the musician, videographer, potato eater, onion eater, and entrepreneur. The only remaining food for the photographer to eat is cucumber, as avocado, onion, orange, and potato are already assigned. So, the photographer eats cucumber and is in position 3.

5. Finally, the only remaining food for the security-guard to eat is the avocado, as all other foods are already assigned. So, the security-guard eats avocado and is in position 1.

The final solution table is:

|        |       1        |      2       |    3     |      4       |      5       |

Lv2-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching epic movies is on the far right, so we can place it in the last column (column 5).

2. The person watching zombie movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the paramedic. Since the paramedic is watching animation movies (from point 4), and the paramedic must be on the far left (as the first column), the only possible position for the zombie movies is in column 2. This means that the person watching comedy movies must be in column 3.

3. The engineer is on the left of the person watching comedy movies, so the engineer must be in column 1.

4. The chef is in the middle, so it must be in column 3.

5. The paramedic is the person watching animation movies, which we already know is in column 1.

6. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the paramedic, so it must be in column 5.

7. The architect is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since we don't know yet who is watching documentary movies, we can't place the architect yet. Let's assume for now that the scientist is watching documentary movies (column 4), and the architect is in column 5.

8. The scientist is on the right of the person watching animation movies (the paramedic), but we already placed the scientist in column 4. This contradicts the given information, so our assumption about the scientist watching documentary movies is incorrect. Let's try another assumption: the scientist is watching zombie movies (column 2). Now, the architect can be on the right of the person watching documentary movies (column 4).

With these assumptions, the table looks like this:

|               |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |     5     |
| Job           | paramedic  | scientist | chef   | architect | epic     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  | zombie    | comedy  | documentary| epic     |

Now, let's check the remaining conditions:

- The person watching comedy movies (column 3) is not an engineer (as the engineer is in column 1), so it can be either a chef, architect, or scientist. However, since the chef is already in column 3, the person in this column must be the architect.

- The person watching documentary movies (column 4) cannot be the scientist (as the scientist is in column 2), so it must be the paramedic.

- The table is now complete and satisfies all the given conditions.

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   |   |   |   |   |

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since sprite is in the first column, hot-chocolate must be in the second column, and milk in the third column.

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | hot-chocolate | milk |   |   |

3. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since salsa's fan is in the last row, rock's fan must be in the last column.

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | hot-chocolate | milk | rock | salsa |

4. The person drinking mirinda is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of funk. Since hip-hop is on the far right, mirinda must be in the fourth column, and funk in the fifth column.

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | hot-chocolate | milk | mirinda | funk |

5. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since sprite is in the first column and hot-chocolate is in the second column, this condition is already satisfied.

Now, let's fill in the beverages:

   | Beverage | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---------|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Music-Genre |   | hot-chocolate | milk | mirinda | funk |

   | Beverage | sprite | hot-chocolate | milk | mirinda | soy-milk |
   |---------|--------|--------------|------|---------|----------|
   | Music-Genre |   | disco | rock | hip-hop | salsa |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Beverage | sprite | hot-chocolate | milk | mirinda | soy-milk |
|---------|--------|--------------|------|---------|----------|
| Music-Genre |   | disco | rock | hip-hop | salsa |

Lv2-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who prefers ice-hockey is in the middle, so we can mark that position with 'I'.

|     |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4     |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Job |         |                |           |         |        |
| Sport|         |                |           |         |        |

2. The person who prefers cricket is to the right of the person who prefers ice-hockey, so it must be in position 3 or 5. Since the engineer prefers cricket (from rule 3), let's place the engineer in position 3 and mark it with 'E'.

|     |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4     |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Job |         |                |   E (Engineer) |         |        |
| Sport|         |                |   C (Cricket) |         |        |

3. The nurse is to the left of the engineer (from rule 6), so the nurse must be in position 2. Let's mark it with 'N'.

|     |    1     |         N       |     3      |    4     |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------|--------|
| Job |         |   N (Nurse)    |   E (Engineer) |         |        |
| Sport|         |                |   C (Cricket) |         |        |

4. The person who prefers swimming is to the left of the project-manager (from rule 4), so the project-manager must be in position 4 or 5. Since the project-manager can't be in position 5 (because of rule 5), it must be in position 4. Let's mark it with 'P'.

|     |    1     |         N       |     3      |   P (Project-Manager) |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Job |         |   N (Nurse)    |   E (Engineer) |   P (Project-Manager) |        |
| Sport|         |                |   C (Cricket) |                |        |

5. The person who prefers rowing is between the nurse and the coach (from rule 5). Since the nurse is in position 2 and the project-manager is in position 4, the only possible position for rowing is position 3. Let's mark it with 'R'.

|     |    1     |         N       |      R      |   P (Project-Manager) |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Job |         |   N (Nurse)    |   R (Rowing) |   P (Project-Manager) |        |
| Sport|         |                |            |                |        |

6. Now we have all the jobs and sports filled, but we still have an empty position for the sport. Since we know the sports are different, the only possible sport for position 1 is swimming. Let's mark it with 'S'.

|     |     S     |         N       |      R      |   P (Project-Manager) |   5    |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|--------|
| Job | Coach    |   N (Nurse)    |   R (Rowing) |   P (Project-Manager) | Writer  |
| Sport| Swimming |                |            |                |         |

7. Finally, the only job left is writer, which fits perfectly in position 5.

|     |     S     |         N       |      R      |   P (Project-Manager) | Writer  |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Job | Coach    |   N (Nurse)    |   R (Rowing) |   P (Project-Manager) | Writer   |
| Sport| Swimming |                |            |                |         |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|     |     S     |         N       |      R      |   P (Project-Manager) | Writer   |
|-----|----------|----------------|-----------|---------------------|---------|
| Job | Coach    |   N (Nurse)    |   R (Rowing) |   P (Project-Manager) | Writer   |
| Sport| Swimming |                |            |                |         |
