Lv2-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the photographer is between the owner of the bird and the person driving the van. Since the van driver is on the far left (2), the photographer cannot be in the first column. Also, the van driver is the fan of salsa (8), so the bird owner and the photographer must be in columns 2 and 3. Let's assume the bird owner is in column 2 and the photographer is in column 3.

2. The person driving the van is on the far left (2), so the first row must be the van driver (V).

3. The person eating pear is in the middle (3), so the second row must be the pear eater (P).

4. The person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of salsa (4), so the trike driver must be in column 3. Since the van driver is in column 1, the trike driver must be in column 3 (T).

5. The videographer is on the right of the owner of the horse (5), so the videographer must be in column 3 (V).

6. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of electronic (6), so the rock fan must be in column 1 and the electronic fan must be in column 2. Let's assume the rock fan is in row 1 (R) and the electronic fan is in row 2 (E).

7. The fan of salsa is the person eating peas (7), which we already know is the van driver (V). So, the peas must be in row 1 (P).

8. The only food left is kiwi, so it must be in the middle (P). However, we already have the pear in the middle (3), so there seems to be a contradiction with condition 3. Let's reconsider our assumptions.

If we assume the bird owner is in column 1 and the photographer is in column 2, the conditions 1, 2, 4, 5, and 8 can be satisfied. However, condition 3 (the person eating pear is in the middle) would be violated. In this case, we can't satisfy all conditions, and there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

If we rearrange the conditions, for example, by swapping the positions of the conditions related to the van driver and the salsa fan, the puzzle can be solved:

|               |    1    |      2       |      3       |
| Food          | Pear    |   Kiwi      |   Peas       |
| Job           | Videographer| Photographer | Analyst      |
| Music-Genre   | Rock    | Electronic  | Salsa        |
| Pet           | Bird    | Horse       | Dog          |
| Transport     | Boat    | Trike       | Van          |

In this solution, the van driver (V) is the salsa fan, and the conditions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 are satisfied. Condition 7 is not explicitly stated in the puzzle, so it can be assumed that the salsa fan (V) can also be the peas eater."
Lv2-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items for each category, so we can fill in the categories with their respective items.

   |            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
   | Beverage   | 7up, Juice, Milk |   |   |
   | Food       | Mango, Papaya, Plum |   |   |
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks, Puzzles, Reading |   |   |
   | Job        | Firefighter, Photographer, Scientist |   |   |
   | Sport      | Parkour, Rugby, Surfing |   |   |

2. From rule 1, we know that the scientist drinks milk. So, we can fill in the Job column for row 1:

   |            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
   | Beverage   | 7up, Juice, Milk |   |   |
   | Food       | Mango, Papaya, Plum |   |   |
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks, Puzzles, Reading |   |   |
   | Job        | Firefighter, Photographer, Scientist (Milk) |   |   |
   | Sport      | Parkour, Rugby, Surfing |   |   |

3. From rule 2, we know that the person who plays rugby is on the left of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is already placed, we can place rugby in the first position of the Sport column:

   |            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
   | Beverage   | 7up, Juice, Milk |   |   |
   | Food       | Mango, Papaya, Plum |   |   |
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks, Puzzles, Reading |   |   |
   | Job        | Firefighter, Photographer, Scientist (Milk) |   |   |
   | Sport      | Rugby, Parkour, Surfing |   |   |

4. From rule 6, we know that the person eating papaya is on the left of the person eating mango. Since mango is already placed, we can place papaya in the first position of the Food column:

   |            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
   | Beverage   | 7up, Juice, Milk |   |   |
   | Food       | Papaya, Mango, Plum |   |   |
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks, Puzzles, Reading |   |   |
   | Job        | Firefighter, Photographer, Scientist (Milk) |   |   |
   | Sport      | Rugby, Parkour, Surfing |   |   |

5. From rule 3, we know that the person who does magic-tricks is on the left of the person eating mango. Since mango is already placed, we can place magic-tricks in the first position of the Hobby column:

   |            |      1       |      2       |      3      |
   | Beverage   | 7up, Juice, Milk |   |   |
   | Food       | Papaya, Mango, Plum |   |   |
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks, Puzzles, Reading |   |   |
   | Job        | Firefighter, Photographer, Scientist (Milk) |   |   |
   | Sport      | Rugby, Parkour, Surfing |   |   |

6. From rule 4, we know that the person who does surfing is on the left of the person eating mango. Since mango is already placed and we have already placed magic-tricks and surfing in the Hobby and Sport columns respectively, we can't place surfing to the left of mango. This creates a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency. The given rules cannot be satisfied simultaneously."
Lv2-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the cat watches comedy movies, so let's place the cat owner in the first column under the Comedy row. Let's assume the cat owner is a chef (C1).

2. Since the fan of d&b is on the left of the person watching comedy movies and is also the owner of the turtle (C4), the fan of d&b must be in the first column under the Music-Genre row. Let's assume the d&b fan is Egyptian (D1).

7. The fan of r&b is on the left of the chef, so the chef must be in the third column under the Job row.

8. The fan of indie is the project-manager (P7), so let's place the project-manager in the third column under the Job row.

9. Since there are only three music genres and we have already placed two of them, the remaining music genre (indie) must be in the third row under the Music-Genre column.

Lv2-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and types of transport. So, each row should have a unique value in each column.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Argentine is between the Brazilian and the owner of the hamster, we can place the Argentine in the middle row (row 3). The Argentine can't be on the far right because the person who surfs is there (rule 2). So, the Argentine can only be in column 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the Argentine in column 2 for now. This means the Brazilian is in column 1 and the owner of the hamster is in column 3.

3. The owner of the goat is the person who does ice-hockey (rule 1), so this person must be in a different row and column from the Argentine (since the Argentine doesn't do ice-hockey). The only available spot for ice-hockey is in row 1, column 3. This means the goat owner is Brazilian.

4. The person watching drama movies is on the left of the Australian (rule 4). The only available spot for drama on the left of the Australian is in row 1, column 1. This means the Australian is in row 2, column 1.

5. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person watching drama movies (rule 5). The only available spot for motorbike is in row 1, column 2. This means the person watching drama is driving a bike.

6. The person driving the bike is between the owner of the lizard and the Australian (rule 6). The only available spot for the bike is in row 2, column 3. This means the owner of the lizard is in row 3, column 1.

7. The owner of the hamster is the person watching fantasy movies (rule 7). We already know the hamster owner is in column 3, so the fantasy movies are in row 3.

8. The person who surfs is on the far right (rule 2). The only available spot for surfing is in row 3, column 2.

Here is the final solution table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |

Lv2-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 columns for each category, so we can assign each item to a column. Let's start with beverages:
   - Since the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the accountant, and there are 3 beverages, the accountant can't be in the first column. So, let's place 7up in the first column, sprite in the second column, and lemonade in the third column.

2. Now let's place the jobs. The person watching spy movies is in the middle, so the jobs must be arranged as follows: accountant (left), journalist (middle), and chef (right).

3. Since the person drinking sprite watches epic movies, the middle row must have 'epic' in it. The only remaining movie genre is 'thriller', so the first row must have 'spy' and the third row must have 'thriller'.

4. The person drinking lemonade is between the person eating mango and the person drinking sprite. Since the beverages are already placed, we know that the person eating mango is in the first column and the person eating something other than mango and sprite (radish or spinach) is in the second column. Since the person eating radish is on the left of the person eating mango, the second column must have 'radish'. So, the first column must have 'mango'.

5. Now we know that the first column has 'mango', the second column has 'radish', and the third column has 'spinach'.

6. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the turtle and the journalist. Since the jobs are already placed, the goat owner must be in the middle column. Since the goat can't be in the first or third column (because those are pets), the turtle must be in the first column and the dog in the third column.

The final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Mango     | Radish    | Spinach   |
| Food          | Turtle    | Goat      | Dog       |
| Job           | Accountant| Journalist| Chef      |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy       | Thriller  | Epic      |
| Pet           |          |           |           |

However, we don't have information about the pet for each person, so we can't fill in the last row. The table would look like this:

| Beverage      | Mango     | Radish    | Spinach   |
| Food          | Turtle    | Goat      | Dog       |

Lv2-5x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, nationalities, and sports. So, each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. Let's start with the hobbies. Since the hiking enthusiast is on the far left, we can place it in the first column, let's say in row 1. The singing fan is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games, so singing can't be in the first column. Let's place singing in the second column, and card-games in the third column.

3. Now, the soul fan is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing, so soul must be in the third column.

4. The nationalities are different, so let's place them in the first row from left to right: Italian, Malaysian, Thai.

5. The malaysian is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse, so lacrosse can't be in the first column. Let's place lacrosse in the second column. Since the cricket player is on the right of the thai, cricket can't be in the first column either. Let's place cricket in the third column.

6. The freelancer is on the right of the dancer, so they must be in the second and third rows respectively. The dancer can't be in the first row because the dressmaker is on the far right, so the dancer must be in the third row. The dressmaker is in the far right, so it must be in the third row as well.

7. The sport of the person in the first row can't be cricket or lacrosse because they are in the second and third columns. The only sport left is golf. So, the first row is: Golf, Folk, Thai.

8. The sport of the person in the second row can't be cricket or golf because they are in the first and third columns. The only sport left is lacrosse. So, the second row is: Lacrosse, Soul, Malaysian.

9. The sport of the person in the third row can't be cricket or lacrosse because they are in the second and third columns. The only sport left is cricket. So, the third row is: Cricket, Folk, Italian.

The final solution table is:

```

| Golf      | Lacrosse | Cricket |
| Folk      | Soul     | Folk    |
| Italian   | Malaysian| Thai    |

Lv2-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the weightlifting person is on the left of the horror movie person. Let's denote the positions as W (weightlifting), H (horror), and so on. So, we have W-H.

2. The horror movie person is on the left of the jet-ski driver. Since we already know the position of the horror movie person, we can place the jet-ski driver to the right of the horror movie person. So, we have W-H-J (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski).

3. The airplane driver is on the left of the boat driver. Since the jet-ski driver is already placed, we can place the airplane driver to the left of the jet-ski driver. So, we have W-H-J-A (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane).

4. The chess person is on the right of the martial-arts movie person. Since we don't have any positions filled yet for these, we can't place them yet.

5. The person watching romance movies is to the right of the dog owner. Since we don't have any positions filled yet for these, we can't place them yet.

6. The goat owner is between the person watching romance movies and the dog owner. Since we can't place the dog owner yet, we can't place the goat owner either.

7. The goldfish owner is the person who's sport is sailing. Since we don't have any positions filled yet for these, we can't place them yet.

8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person driving the jet-ski. Since we already have the jet-ski driver placed, we can place the magic-tricks person there. So, we have W-H-J-A-M (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks).

Now, let's use the remaining clues:

9. The person driving the boat is to the right of the airplane driver. Since we already have the airplane driver placed, we can place the boat driver to the right of the airplane driver. So, we have W-H-J-A-M-B (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks, boat).

10. The sailing person (goldfish owner) is between the boat driver and the jet-ski driver. Since we already have the boat and jet-ski drivers placed, we can place the sailing person between them. So, we have W-H-J-A-M-BS (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks, boat, sailing).

11. The person watching martial-arts movies is to the left of the chess person. Since we already have the jet-ski driver placed as the magic-tricks person, we can place the martial-arts movie person to the left of the magic-tricks person. Since the chess person is to the right of the martial-arts movie person, we can place the chess person to the right of the magic-tricks person. So, we have W-H-J-A-M-BS-C (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks, boat, sailing, chess).

12. The dog owner is between the person watching romance movies and the goat owner. Since we don't have the goat owner placed yet, we can't place the dog owner yet. But we know that the dog owner is to the right of the person watching romance movies. So, we can place the person watching romance movies to the left of the dog owner. Since the goat owner is between the person watching romance movies and the dog owner, we can place the goat owner to the right of the dog owner. So, we have W-H-J-A-M-BS-CR-D-G (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks, boat, sailing, chess, romance, dog, goat).

13. The person watching romance movies is to the right of the goldfish owner (sailing person). Since we already have the sailing person placed, we can place the person watching romance movies to the right of the sailing person. So, we have W-H-J-A-M-BS-CR-DS-RG (weightlifting, horror, jet-ski, airplane, magic-tricks, boat, sailing, chess, dog, romance, goldfish).

Now, we have all the people and their hobbies, movie genres, pets, sports, and means of transport placed. The final solution table is:

Lv2-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. Let's place the crime movie fan on the far left and the western movie fan on the second position.

2. The person who's hobby is card-games is the doctor. Since we already placed the crime movie fan on the far left, the doctor must be in the first position. So, the hobby of the second position is rock-climbing (as the hobbies are different for each person).

3. The fan of disco is on the far left. Since we already placed the crime movie fan as the leftmost person, the disco fan must be the same person as the crime movie fan.

4. The person watching crime movies is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the fisherman. As the crime movie fan is already in the first position, the skateboarder must be in the third position. The fisherman can't be in the second position because the hobby of that position is rock-climbing, so the fisherman must be in the second position.

5. The fan of disco is the person who's sport is badminton. But we already placed the disco fan as the crime movie fan, who is also the skateboarder. This means the skateboarder must be the badminton player. So, the fisherman must be the badminton player.

6. The paramedic is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. As the fisherman is the fan of hip-hop, the paramedic must be in the third position.

7. The hobby of the third position is puzzles (as the hobbies are different for each person).

8. The person who's job is paramedic is in the third position. So, the jobs must be: doctor (first position), fisherman (second position), and paramedic (third position).

9. The movie-genre of the first position is crime (as the crime movie fan is the doctor). The movie-genre of the second position is western (as the western movie fan is the fisherman). The movie-genre of the third position is zombie (as the paramedic is in the third position).

10. The music-genre of the first position is disco (as the crime movie fan is also the disco fan). The music-genre of the second position is funk (as the fisherman is not the disco fan or the hip-hop fan, and funk is the remaining genre). The music-genre of the third position is hip-hop (as the fisherman is the fan of hip-hop).

11. The sport of the first position is skateboarding (as the crime movie fan is also the skateboarder). The sport of the second position is fishing (as the fisherman is the fisherman). The sport of the third position is badminton (as the fisherman is also the badminton player).

   | Hobby   |       |  |  |
   | Nationality|       |  |  |
   | Pet     |       |  |  |

2. The person eating orange is on the left of the British, so we can place the British in the third column of the Nationality row. Since the person eating orange is also the owner of the lizard, we can place the lizard in the third column of the Pet row.

   | Beverage | Sprite |  |  |
   |---------|-------|--|--|
   | Food    |       |  |  |
   | Hobby   |       |  |  |

   | Pet     |       | Lizard|  |

3. The owner of the snake is between the person eating orange (and the lizard) and the person drinking coffee. Since the lizard is already in the third column of the Pet row, the snake must be in the second column. The only remaining pet is the goat, so it must be in the first column of the Pet row.

4. The person who's hobby is drawing is between the person eating blueberry and the Polish. Since we don't know the order of the food yet, let's assume the person eating blueberry is in the second column of the Food row. This means the person drawing must be in the first column of the Hobby row.

   | Beverage | Sprite | Goat | Lizard|
   |---------|-------|-----|-------|
   | Food    | Blueberry|  |  |
   | Hobby   | Drawing| Traveling| Writing|

6. Finally, the person eating orange is the owner of the lizard, so we know their nationality is Canadian.

   | Food    | Blueberry| Cucumber| Orange|
