Lv2-6x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities since we have some direct relationships. Let's place the Egyptian (E) next to the Soul fan (S) because of condition 3. Let's place the Russian (R) next to the Egyptian since the Russian is a fan of Electronic (E) and the Egyptian is a fan of Soul, so they can't be next to each other. Now, we have:

   |               |     1      |       2       |    3    |     4      |   5    |
   | Food          |            |               |         |            |        |
   | Hobby         |            |               |         |            |        |
   | Music-Genre   |            |               |         |            |        |
   | Nationality   | E          |               |         |            |        |
   | Pet           |            |               |         |            |        |
   | Transport     |            |               |         |            |        |

2. Now, we know the Egyptian is a fan of Soul, so the Hip-Hop fan (H) can't be next to the Egyptian. Let's place the Hip-Hop fan next to the Russian since the Russian is on the right of the Egyptian. Now, we have:

   |               |     1      |       2       |    3    |     4      |   5    |

   | Pet           |            |               |         |            |        |

    | Transport     | Js         | G            | T       | Rc         | Hm     |

Now, we have a complete table:
