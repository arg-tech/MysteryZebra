Lv2-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching spy movies (Spy) is also a fan of trance (Tr).
2. Since the fan of blues (B) is on the left of the person driving the motorbike (Mot), and the person driving the bus (Bus) is on the right of the fan of trance (Spy), we can place them as follows:
   - Bus - Right of Spy
   - Mot - Left of Blues

3. The person who's hobby is baking (Bak) is between the person watching spy movies (Spy) and the person watching superhero movies (Sh). So, Bak cannot be on the left of Spy (since it would mean Bak is Bus or Mot, but we've placed them already), and Bak cannot be on the right of Sh (since it would mean Bak is Bus or Mot, but we've placed them already). Therefore, Bak must be in the middle.

4. The person who's hobby is dancing (Danc) is on the right of the person driving the bus (Bus). Since we've placed Bus already, we can place Danc to its right.

5. Now, we have only one spot left for the person watching superhero movies (Sh). Since it cannot be on the left of Danc (since it would mean Sh is Bus or Mot, but we've placed them already), it must be on the left of Bak.

6. Finally, we have only one spot left for the person watching disaster movies (Dis). It cannot be on the left of Danc (since it would mean Dis is Bus or Mot, but we've placed them already), and it cannot be on the right of Sh (since it would mean Dis is Bus or Mot, but we've placed them already). Therefore, Dis must be in the middle.

Lv2-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the Nationality column with the given nationalities (Australian, Japanese, Pakistani). Let's assume the order is Australian, Japanese, Pakistani from left to right.

   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Food          |            |          |            |
   | Music-Genre   |            |          |            |
   | Nationality   | Australian | Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |            |          |            |

2. From rule 3, we know the Pakistani eats raspberry, so we can fill in the Food column for the third person (Pakistani).

   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Food          |            |          | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   |            |          |            |
   | Nationality   | Australian | Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |            |          |            |

3. From rule 4, we know the Japanese eats kale, so we can fill in the Food column for the second person (Japanese).

   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Food          |            | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   |            |         |           |
   | Nationality   | Australian | Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |            |         |           |

4. From rule 6, we know the person eating tomato is the owner of the goat. Since we already know the Food for the third person (Pakistani), the only option left for the first person is tomato. So, we can fill in the Food column for the first person (Australian).

   |               | Tomato    |    2     |     3      |
   | Food          |           | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         |           |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |           |         |           |

5. From rule 1, we know the fan of soul is on the left of the owner of the goat (first person), so the second person must be a fan of a different genre. Since there are only two genres left (blues and gospel), the second person must be a fan of blues.

   |               | Tomato    | Blues    |     3      |
   | Food          |           | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   |           |         | Soul      |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |           |         |           |

6. From rule 2, we know the pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the Pakistani is the third person, the fan of soul must be the first person (Australian). So, the second person (Japanese) must be a fan of gospel.

   |               | Tomato    | Blues    | Gospel    |
   | Food          |           | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul      |         |           |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |           |         |           |

7. From rule 5, we know the owner of the frog is between the fan of gospel and the person eating tomato. Since the person eating tomato is the first person (Australian), the owner of the frog must be the second person (Japanese).

   |               | Tomato    | Blues    | Gospel    |
   | Food          |           | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul      | Frogs   |           |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           |           |         |           |

8. Now we have filled all the columns except the Pet column. Since there are 3 pets and we have 3 empty spaces, each pet must be owned by a different person. So, the Pet column can be filled as follows:

   |               | Tomato    | Blues    | Gospel    |
   | Food          |           | Kale    | Raspberry |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul      | Frogs   |           |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Japanese | Pakistani  |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Goat    | Guinea-pig|

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies, we can place the bartender in the first column and the person watching thriller movies in the second column. Let's assume the bartender is in the first row and the person watching thriller movies is in the second row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Kale | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Doctor | Paramedic |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Pet | Chinchilla | Goldfish | Snake |

2. The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies. Since the paramedic is in the third row, the chinchilla owner must be in the second row. So, the person watching mystery movies is in the first row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Chinchilla | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Paramedic | Doctor |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Pet | Goldfish | Snake |  |

3. The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale. So, the goldfish owner must be in the second column. Since the paramedic is already in the second row and owns the chinchilla, the doctor must be in the second row and the goldfish owner in the first row.

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Kale | Chinchilla | Orange |
   | Job | Doctor | Paramedic | Bartender |
   | Movie-Genre | Mystery | Thriller | Disaster |
   | Pet | Goldfish | Snake |  |

4. The person eating eggplant is on the far left. Since the doctor is already eating kale, the eggplant must be in the first row. But we already placed the doctor in the first row. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

However, if we assume that the bartender is not on the far left, we can solve the puzzle as follows:

   |   | 1 | 2 |
   |--|--|--|
   | Food | Eggplant | Kale | Orange |
   | Job | Bartender | Doctor | Paramedic |
   | Movie-Genre | Disaster | Mystery | Thriller |
   | Pet | Chinchilla | Goldfish | Snake |

This solution assumes that the bartender is not on the far left, which is not stated in the puzzle. If the bartender must be on the far left, then there is a contradiction in the puzzle as it is currently stated."
Lv2-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 4, the person eating cucumber does rowing, which means rowing cannot be in the first column because the chinchilla owner must be on the right of the rower (point 1). So, rowing must be in the second or third column.

2. From point 1, the chinchilla owner cannot be in the first column because the rower must be on the right of the chinchilla owner. So, the chinchilla owner must be in the third column.

3. From point 2, the person eating cucumber is on the right of the scientist. Since the chinchilla owner is in the third column and cannot be the scientist (because the chinchilla owner is the rower and rowing is in the second or third column), the scientist must be in the first column.

4. Now we know the scientist is in the first column, and the chinchilla owner is in the third column. Since the rower is on the right of the chinchilla owner, the rower must be in the second column. So, cucumber is in the second column, and rowing is in the second row.

5. From point 1, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the rower is in the second row, the chinchilla owner must be in the fourth cell (the rightmost cell of the third row).

Lv2-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the gospel fan on the left of the funk fan. Let's place gospel in the first column and funk in the second column.

2. Since the bird owner is between the gospel fan and the photographer, the bird owner must be in the second column. Let's place the bird in the second column.

5. The person eating carrot is on the right of the person eating plum. Since the cherry is in the first column and the dog is in the third column, the plum must be in the second column.

   |               |    1    |     2      |      3      |
   | Food          | cherry  | plum      | dog        |

Lv2-4x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Let's assume that the hobby of the person on the far right is sudoku (since it's the only hobby left). So, the owner of the horse must be in the second position.

2. The person eating pumpkin is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we know the hobby of the person on the far right, the person eating pumpkin must be in the first position. So, the food in the first position is pumpkin, and the hobby in the far right is sudoku.

3. The fan of country is between the person eating pineapple and the owner of the horse. Since we know the position of the owner of the horse and the person eating pumpkin, the person eating pineapple must be in the second position. So, the food in the second position is pineapple, and the music-genre in the second position is country.

4. Now, we know the positions of the horse and the person eating pumpkin. The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the fish. So, the person eating cauliflower must be in the third position. So, the food in the third position is cauliflower, and the owner of the fish must be in the first position.

5. The last music-genre, d&b, is on the far right. Since we already know that the hobby in the far right is sudoku, the music-genre in the far right must be d&b.

6. Now, we have all the information filled except for the hobby of the first and third positions. Since the person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the fish, the hobby of the first position must be something other than filmmaking (since the person eating pumpkin, who has the hobby of filmmaking, is on the second position). Similarly, the hobby of the third position must be something other than sudoku (since the hobby of the far right is sudoku). So, let's assume the hobby of the first position is skydiving and the hobby of the third position is filmmaking.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |
| Food          | cauliflower | pumpkin | pineapple |
| Hobby         | skydiving | filmmaking | sudoku |
| Music-Genre   | ambient | country | d&b |
| Pet           | fish | horse | mouse |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."

   |---|---|---|---|
   | Beverage | | | |
   | Hobby   | | | |
   | Job     | A | | |
   | Music-Genre | | | |

2. The person drinking soy-milk (S) is on the right of the fan of gospel (G). Since the journalist is an architect (A), the only possible position for Gospel is in the third column under the Music-Genre row. So, Gospel is in the third column.

   |---|---|---|---|
   | Beverage | | | S |
   | Hobby   | | | G |
   | Job     | A | | |

3. The person drinking soy-milk (S) is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (C). Since we already placed Gospel in the third column, the only possible position for Chess is in the second column under the Hobby row. So, Chess is in the second column.

Lv2-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking 7up is on the far left, we can place 7up in the first column of the Beverage row. As 7up is one of the three beverages, the other two beverages (almond-milk and cola) must go in the second and third columns respectively.

2. The person eating papaya is on the far left, so we place papaya in the first column of the Food row. As there are three foods, the other two (carrot and peas) must go in the second and third columns respectively.

3. The indian is on the left of the person driving the bike, and the person driving the bike is the nigerian (from point 6). So, the nationalities must be arranged as follows: Indian, Nigerian, Russian.

4. From point 2, the person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know the nationalities and the beverages, we can deduce the positions of almond-milk and peas in the Food row. The person drinking almond-milk must be to the left of the person eating peas, so the Food row should be: Papaya, Carrot, Peas.

5. From point 1, the person driving the taxi is between the nigerian and the russian. As we know the nationalities, the Transport row should be: Airplane, Taxi, Bike.

6. Now we know the positions of the nationalities and the transport, we can deduce the positions of the beverages in the Transport row. The person driving the taxi is drinking cola (since it's not 7up or almond-milk), so the Transport row should be: Airplane, Taxi (cola), Bike (almond-milk).

Here is the final solution table:

  |               |    1     |      2      |    3     |

Lv2-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of chess is on the right of the person with the hobby of traveling, we can place them in the last two columns of the first row. Let's place chess in column 3 and traveling in column 1.

2. The project-manager is between the engineer and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the hobby of chess is already placed, the only possible position for the engineer is in column 2 of the first row. This means the project-manager must be in column 3 of the second row, and the person with the hobby of drawing must be in column 1 of the second row.

3. The person who's sport is sailing is the person who's hobby is traveling. Since traveling is in column 1 of the first row, sailing must be in column 1 of the third row.

4. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the social-worker. This means the social-worker must be in the second column of the third row.

5. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the engineer. Since the engineer is in column 2 of the first row, the taxi driver must be in column 1 of the second row.

6. The person driving the roller is the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since lacrosse is in column 2 of the third row, the roller must be in column 2 of the fourth row.

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

- The only sport left is handball. Since there are only 3 sports and 3 people, it must be in column 3 of the third row.

- The only job left is social-worker. Since it's the person who plays lacrosse, it must be in column 2 of the third row.

- The only means of transport left is scooter. Since it's not the taxi or roller, it must be in column 3 of the fourth row.
