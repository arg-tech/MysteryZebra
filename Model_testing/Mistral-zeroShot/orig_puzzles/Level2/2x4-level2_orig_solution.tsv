Lv2-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking water is on the far left, so we can place water in the first column.

| Beverage   | Water   |     |     |      |
|-----------|--------|-----|-----|------|
| Sport      |        |     |     |      |

2. Since the person drinking water is on the far left, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in the second column because of rule 2. So, weightlifting goes in the second row.

| Beverage   | Water   | Weightlifting |     |      |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-----|------|
| Sport      |        |              |     |      |

3. The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking juice. Since weightlifting is already in the second row, the only possible position for soccer is the third row. Also, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer, so cola must be in the fourth column.

| Beverage   | Water   | Weightlifting | Soccer | Cola  |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|-------|
| Sport      |        |              |        |       |

4. Now, the person drinking juice must be in the second column, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in the first row because soccer is in the third row.

| Beverage   | Water   | Juice        | Soccer  | Cola  |
|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|-------|
| Sport      | Ice-hockey|             |        |       |

5. Finally, the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola. So, lemonade goes in the third column.

Lv2-2x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Turkish is between the person who's hobby is reading and the Colombian. So, the Turkish cannot be in the first column (as it would have no one on its left) or the last column (as it would have no one on its right). Therefore, the Turkish must be in the second or third column.

2. The Dutch is on the right of the British. Since the Turkish cannot be in the last column, the Dutch must be in the fourth column. This means the British must be in the third column.

3. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the British. So, the gardening hobby must be in the first column.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the far right. Since the Dutch is already in the fourth column, the video-games hobby must be in the second column.

Now, let's put the information together:

| Nationality   |              |           | British | Dutch       |

5. We still need to place the Colombian and determine their hobby. Since the Turkish is between the Colombian and the person who's hobby is reading, the Colombian must be in the third column. The only remaining hobby for the Colombian is magic-tricks.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the British is on the far left, they must be in the first column (Column 1).
2. The Colombian is to the right of the person eating kale, so the person eating kale cannot be in Column 1 (since the British is there). Therefore, the person eating kale must be in Column 2, 3, or 4.
3. The Colombian is between the British and the person eating corn. Since the British is in Column 1, the Colombian cannot be in Column 1 either. So, the Colombian must be in Column 2, 3, or 4. The person eating corn must be to the right of the Colombian, so the person eating corn cannot be in Column 1 or Column 2. Therefore, the person eating corn must be in Column 3 or Column 4.
4. The french is on the left of the person eating cranberry. Since the British is in Column 1 and the person eating corn cannot be in Column 1 or Column 2, the only option for the French is Column 2. This means the person eating cranberry must be in Column 3 or Column 4.
5. The person eating corn is the French. Since the French is in Column 2, the person eating corn must be in Column 3.
6. Now we know the French is in Column 2, the person eating corn is in Column 3, and the Colombian is to the right of the person eating kale. The only option left for the Colombian is Column 4.
7. The only food left for Column 1 is cauliflower, and the only nationality left for Column 4 is Australian.

1. We know that the person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the lizard. Let's place the biathlon owner and the lizard in the last column and the last row, respectively, as per condition 3. So, the table looks like this:

   |         |   1   |   2    |     3      |    4     |

   | Sport   |       |        |            | Biathlon |

2. Now, the owner of the cat is between the person who's sport is basketball and the owner of the rat. Since the biathlon owner is on the far right, the cat owner must be on the left of the biathlon owner. Also, the cat owner cannot be in the first column because the biathlon owner is in the last column. So, the only possible position for the cat owner is the second column, and the person who's sport is basketball must be in the first column.

   |         | Basketball |   2    |     3      | Biathlon |

3. The owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the cat owner is in the second column, the rugby owner must be in the first column.

Lv2-2x4-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is on the far left, so we can place that in the first column. Let's say Magic-tricks is in the Hobby column of the first row.

2. Since the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, and the person with magic-tricks is on the far left, fanta must be in the first row as well. So, let's say Fanta is in the Beverage column of the first row.

3. Now, we know that soy-milk is between the person who's hobby is card-games (on the far right) and the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we've placed fanta and magic-tricks already, the only available spots for soy-milk are the second and third rows. However, since soy-milk can't be in the first row (because it's not on the left of card-games), it must be in the third row. So, let's say Soy-milk is in the Beverage column of the third row.

4. Now, we have two remaining beverages (iced-tea and hot-chocolate) and one remaining spot (the second row). Since the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking fanta, it can't be in the first row. Therefore, it must be in the second row. So, let's say Iced-tea is in the Beverage column of the second row.

5. Lastly, hot-chocolate is the only remaining beverage, so it must be in the fourth row. So, let's say Hot-chocolate is in the Beverage column of the fourth row.

6. For the hobbies, since card-games is on the far right, it must be in the fourth column. Since soy-milk is between card-games and dancing, dancing must be in the third column. Since we've placed all the beverages, we know that the person with the hobby of card-games must be drinking soy-milk. So, let's say Card-games is in the Hobby column of the fourth row and Dancing is in the Hobby column of the third row.

7. The only hobby left is skydiving. Since it can't be on the far left (because magic-tricks is there), it can only be in the second column. So, let's say Skydiving is in the Hobby column of the second row.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv2-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 4 different music-genres and 4 different sports. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From point 3, we know that the fan of salsa is on the far right. Since there are 5 empty spaces, the fan of salsa must be in the rightmost column (column 5).

3. From point 2, we know that the fan of salsa is the person who's sport is rowing. So, rowing must be in the 4th row (since there are 5 rows and the other sports are already placed).

4. Now, we know that the fan of salsa is in the rightmost column and row 4. So, we can fill row 4 with 'Salsa' in column 5 and 'Rowing' in row 4.

5. From point 1, the fan of classical must be in a different row and column than the fans of salsa, d&b, pop, and rowing. Since we already have salsa and rowing, the fan of classical can't be in the 4th row. Also, since the fan of salsa is on the far right, the fan of classical can't be in the 5th column. So, the fan of classical must be in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd row and column.

6. From point 4, we know that the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is cycling. So, cycling must be in a different row than row 4 (since row 4 is rowing). Also, since the fan of salsa is on the far right, the fan of d&b can't be in the 5th column. So, the fan of d&b must be in either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd row and column.

7. From point 5, we know that the fan of classical can't be in the same row as the fan of d&b. So, the fan of classical must be in a different row than the fan of d&b.

8. From point 4, we know that the fan of pop is between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b. Since the fan of classical and the fan of d&b can't be in the same row, the fan of pop must be in a different row than both.

9. Now, let's place the fans of classical, pop, and d&b. Since the fan of salsa is in the 5th column and row 4, the fan of classical can't be in the 5th column. Also, the fan of classical can't be in the same row as the fan of d&b. So, the fan of classical must be in the 1st column of either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd row. The fan of pop must be in the 2nd or 3rd column of a row different from the row of the fan of classical and the fan of d&b. The fan of d&b must be in the 1st or 3rd column of a row different from the row of the fan of classical and the fan of pop.

10. Let's place the fans of classical, pop, and d&b one by one. Since the fan of salsa is in the 5th column and row 4, the fan of classical can't be in the 5th column. Also, the fan of classical can't be in the same row as the fan of d&b. So, let's place the fan of classical in the 1st column of the 1st row (since the fan of salsa is in the 5th column and row 4, and the fan of d&b can't be in the 1st row due to point 8). Now, the fan of pop can't be in the 1st column (since the fan of classical is already there), so let's place the fan of pop in the 2nd column of the 2nd row (since the fan of classical is in the 1st row and the fan of d&b can't be in the 2nd row due to point 8). Now, the fan of d&b can't be in the 2nd row (since the fan of pop is already there), so let's place the fan of d&b in the 1st column of the 3rd row.

11. Now, let's place the sports. Since the fan of salsa is rowing, the sport of rowing must be in the 4th row. Since the fan of classical is in the 1st row, the sport of the person in the 1st row must be different from rowing. Let's place the sport of the 1st row as cycling (since the fan of d&b is in the 1st column of the 3rd row, and we know that the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is cycling). Now, the sport of the person in the 2nd row must be different from cycling and rowing. Let's place the sport of the 2nd row as parkour (since the fan of pop is in the 2nd column of the 2nd row, and the person who's sport is parkour must be to the left of the person who's sport is rowing). Now, the sport of the person in the 3rd row must be different from cycling, rowing, and parkour. Let's place the sport of the 3rd row as skateboarding.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Classical|   Pop    |   D&B     |   Salsa  |
#############
|  Cycling   |  Parkour |  Cycling  |  Rowing  |
#############
|  Skateboard|         |          |         |

Now, let's fill the missing sports in the 3rd row:

```
#############
|   Classical|   Pop    |   D&B     |   Salsa  |
#############
|  Cycling   |  Parkour |  Cycling  |  Rowing  |

4. From the third rule, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the fan of electronic. Since we don't know who the fan of electronic is yet, we can't place the snowmobile yet.

6. Now, let's use the fifth rule. The fan of electronic is between the person driving the bus and the fan of house. Since we know the fan of gospel is the bus driver, and we don't know who the fan of house is yet, we can't place the fan of electronic yet.

2. Since the person driving the helicopter is on the far right and the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the helicopter, lacrosse goes in the last column (4).

3. Now we know that the person driving the motorbike is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person driving the roller. Since biathlon and lacrosse are already placed, soccer and roller are left for columns 2 and 3. If soccer were in column 2, the motorbike would have to be in column 3, but that would leave no place for roller. So, soccer must be in column 3 and roller in column 2.

Lv2-2x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the librarian is between the person driving the boat and the dressmaker, and the dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the ship, we can place the librarian, boat, dressmaker, and ship from left to right in that order. Let's represent them as L, B, D, S.

2. The person driving the van is on the left of the dressmaker, so it should be placed to the left of D. However, since the boat is already on the left of D, the van must be before the boat. So, the order should be L, V, B, D, S.

3. The videographer is on the right of the dressmaker, so it should be placed to the right of D. But since the ship is already on the right of D, the videographer must be after the ship. So, the order should be L, V, B, D, S, V.

4. Now, we have the librarian, two dressmakers (one is the actual dressmaker and the other is the videographer pretending to be a dressmaker), the boat driver, the van driver, the ship driver, and the actual videographer. Since the librarian is between the boat driver and the dressmaker, the only possible position for the librarian is before the boat driver. So, the order should be L, V (as the dressmaker), B (as the boat driver), V (as the videographer), V (again as the videographer), D, S.

5. Finally, we have the librarian, the actual dressmaker, the boat driver, the videographer (twice), the van driver, and the ship driver. Since the van driver is on the left of the dressmaker, the van driver should be before the dressmaker. So, the order should be L, B, V (as the boat driver), V (as the dressmaker), V (as the videographer), V (again as the videographer), D, S.

The final solution table is:

|             |      1       |     2     |     3      |      4       |
| Job         | Librarian   | Boat Driver| Dressmaker | Videographer |
| Transport   | Scooter     | Boat      | Van       | Ship         |"
Lv2-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating plum. Let's place them in the last two positions (4, 3) since the table is read from left to right. So, Ice-hockey is in position 4 and Plum is in position 3.

2. Now, the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person eating peach. Since we already placed the person who's sport is ice-hockey on the right of the person eating plum, the only remaining position for swimming is 2. So, Peach is in position 1.

3. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating garlic. Since we already placed the person who's sport is ice-hockey on the right of the person eating plum, and the person who's sport is swimming on the right of the person eating peach, the only remaining position for avocado is 1, which means Garlic is in position 4.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. But we already placed them in positions 2 and 4. This condition cannot be satisfied, so there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the puzzle is a mistake or incomplete, we can fill the table as follows:

  |         |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4     |
  | Food    | Garlic | Peach     | Plum     | Avocado  |
  | Sport   | Tennis | Swimming  | Ice-hockey| Baseball |

This is the best solution we can find given the conditions provided. But remember, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, so the solution might not be completely accurate."
