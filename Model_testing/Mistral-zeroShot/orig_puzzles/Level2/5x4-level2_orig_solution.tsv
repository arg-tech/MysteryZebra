Lv2-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 jobs, 4 movie genres, 4 music genres, 4 pets, and 4 means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the person driving the car is not the software-developer (since there are only 3 people left for the other jobs). So, the software-developer is either driving the helicopter, taxi, or tram. Let's assume the software-developer is driving the helicopter (H).

3. From rule 7, the software-developer is driving the helicopter (H). Now, the car (C) is driven by one of the remaining three jobs (dancer, fisherman, freelancer).

4. From rule 5, the person driving the car (C) is between the dancer and the fan of reggae (R). Since the software-developer is not a dancer or a reggae fan, the car driver must be a freelancer (F) or a fisherman (M). Let's assume the car driver is a fisherman (M).

5. Now, the dancer (D) is not driving the car (C) or the helicopter (H), so the dancer must be driving the tram (T) or the taxi (X). Let's assume the dancer is driving the tram (T).

6. From rule 3, the owner of the cat (Ct) is the person driving the tram (T). So, the cat owner cannot be the dancer (D), fisherman (M), software-developer (S), or the fan of rock (R). The only remaining option is the freelancer (F). So, the freelancer owns a cat (Ct).

7. From rule 4, the owner of the dog (Dg) is on the left of the owner of the goat (Gt). Since the cat owner (F) is already placed, the dog owner cannot be the cat owner (F). The only remaining option for the dog owner is the software-developer (S). So, the software-developer owns a dog (Dg).

8. From rule 10, the fan of folk (Fk) is on the left of the dancer (T). Since the cat owner (F) and the dog owner (S) are already placed, the only remaining option for the dancer's left is the fan of folk (Fk).

9. From rule 9, the person watching drama (Dm) is on the left of the person driving the tram (T). Since the fan of folk (Fk) and the dancer (T) are already placed, the only remaining option for the drama watcher is the fisherman (M).

10. From rule 6, the owner of the goldfish (Gf) is on the right of the person driving the taxi (X). Since the software-developer (S) and the cat owner (F) are already placed, the only remaining options for the taxi driver are the dancer (T) and the freelancer (F). Since the dancer (T) is already driving the tram, the taxi driver must be the freelancer (F). So, the freelancer owns a goldfish (Gf).

11. From rule 2, the fan of rock (R) is between the dancer (T) and the person driving the tram (T). Since the dancer (T) and the cat owner (F) are already placed, the only remaining options for the person on the left of the rock fan (R) are the fisherman (M) and the software-developer (S). Since the software-developer (S) owns a dog (Dg) and the dog owner (S) is already placed, the person on the left of the rock fan (R) must be the fisherman (M).

12. From rule 8, the software-developer (S) is on the left of the person watching superhero movies (Sh). Since the cat owner (F), dog owner (S), and the drama watcher (M) are already placed, the only remaining option for the superhero watcher is the freelancer (F).

13. From rule 1, the person watching disaster movies (Ds) is on the right of the person driving the car (M). Since the cat owner (F), dog owner (S), drama watcher (M), and the superhero watcher (F) are already placed, the only remaining option for the disaster watcher is the dancer (T).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv2-5x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The police-officer (PO) is eating blueberry (B) and is on the right of the person eating lemon (L). So, L cannot be in the first column.

2. The fan of gospel (G) is on the right of the person eating blueberry (B), so B cannot be in the last column.

3. The freelancer (F) is between the person eating pineapple (P) and the owner of the goat (Gt). Since F cannot be in the first or last row (as per points 1 and 2), F must be in the second or third row. If F is in the second row, then P must be in the first row, but that would mean P is on the right of L, which is not possible (as per point 1). So, F must be in the third row. This means P is in the second row. Also, Gt must be in the fourth row.

4. The fan of techno (T) is the person who's sport is handball (H). As per point 11, H is in the second row, so T is also in the second row.

5. The owner of the hamster (Hm) is the freelancer (F). As F is in the third row, Hm is also in the third row.

6. The project-manager (PM) is on the left of the fan of punk (Pu). Since Pu cannot be in the first column (as per point 2), PM must be in the first column.

7. The person who's sport is sailing (S) is on the left of the police-officer (PO). Since PO is in the first column, S must be in the second column.

8. The person who's sport is tennis (Tn) is on the left of the electrician (E). Since E cannot be in the first row (as per point 6), Tn must be in the first row.

9. The police-officer (PO) is on the left of the owner of the snake (Sn). Since PO is in the first column, Sn must be in the third column.

Lv2-5x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the British is not on the far left (10), so they must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10), the British cannot be in the first column. So, the British must be in the third or fourth column.

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the fan of r&b (2), so the chinchilla cannot be in the first or second column. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10), the chinchilla cannot be in the fourth column. So, the chinchilla must be in the third column.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Japanese (3), so the Japanese cannot be in the third column. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10), the Japanese cannot be in the first column. So, the Japanese must be in the second or fourth column.

4. The owner of the chinchilla is the person who's sport is rugby (4), so rugby cannot be in the first or second row. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10) and the sport of golf is in the first row (11), rugby cannot be in the fourth row. So, rugby must be in the third row.

5. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating strawberry (5), so the dog cannot be in the first column. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10) and the British is on the left of the person eating strawberry (7), the dog cannot be in the second or fourth column. So, the dog must be in the third column.

6. The person eating asparagus is between the fan of electronic and the person who's sport is golf (6), so asparagus cannot be in the first or fourth row. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10) and the British is on the left of the person eating strawberry (7), asparagus cannot be in the second column. So, asparagus must be in the third row.

7. The person eating grapefruit is the person who's sport is skiing (8), so grapefruit cannot be in the first or fourth row. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10) and the British is on the left of the person eating strawberry (7), grapefruit cannot be in the second column. So, grapefruit must be in the third column.

8. The British is the owner of the mouse (9), so the mouse cannot be in the third column (since the chinchilla is there). So, the mouse must be in the first or fourth column. Since the Colombian is on the far left (10), the mouse cannot be in the fourth column. So, the mouse must be in the first column.

9. The only remaining spot for the Colombian is the far left (10), and the only remaining spot for the Japanese is the second column. The only remaining spot for the dog is the third column, and the only remaining spot for the asparagus is the third row. The only remaining spot for the grapefruit is the third column. The only remaining spot for the strawberry is the second row. The only remaining spot for the sport of golf is the first row.

Final solution:

Lv2-5x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill the first row with the 4 different beverages, the second row with the 4 different foods, the third row with the 4 music genres, and the fourth row with the 4 sports.

2. From point 10, we know that the person eating spinach is on the far left, so we can place spinach in the first column of the food row.

3. From point 11, we know that the person eating corn is on the far right, so we can place corn in the fourth column of the food row.

4. From point 6, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left, so we can place soccer in the first column of the sport row.

5. From point 7, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the fan of jazz, so parkour cannot be in the first column of the sport row. Since soccer is in the first column, we can place parkour in the second column of the sport row.

6. From point 4, we know that the person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is cricket. Since soccer is in the first column and parkour in the second, cricket must be in the third column of the sport row.

7. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different beverages, so we can place the remaining beverages (7up, almond-milk, and tea) in the remaining columns of the beverage row.

8. From point 8, we know that the person drinking 7up is the person driving the van, so we can place 7up in the fourth column of the beverage row and van in the fourth column of the transport row.

9. From point 9, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is between the person driving the quad-bike and the fan of jazz. Since we know the positions of van, quad-bike, and jazz, we can place almond-milk in the second column of the beverage row.

10. From point 5, we know that the fan of house is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the bus. Since we know the positions of cricket, almond-milk, and van, we can place house in the third column of the music-genre row and bus in the third column of the transport row.

11. From point 2, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is between the fan of disco and the fan of house. Since we know the positions of house and van, we can place disco in the first column of the music-genre row and quad-bike in the second column of the transport row.

12. From point 3, we know that the fan of disco is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since we know the positions of cricket and disco, we can place the person who's sport is cricket to the left of disco in the music-genre row.

13. From point 4, we know that the person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is cricket. Since we know the position of cricket in the music-genre row, we can place the person who's sport is cricket (and who drinks lemonade) in the third column of the food row.

14. From point 1, we know that there are 4 different beverages, so the remaining beverage (tea) must be in the first column of the beverage row.

2. The Canadian is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, so the person doing magic-tricks must be in row 1. Let's place it there.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

3. The person watching thriller movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking, so the person doing woodworking must be in a position where the movie genre is thriller. Since the Canadian is in the rightmost position, the thriller-watcher must be in one of the left three positions. Let's try placing the woodworker in row 2.

4. The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the German. Since the Canadian is in the rightmost position, the German must be in one of the first three positions. Let's try placing the German in row 1.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

6. The person eating cranberry is on the right of the person eating corn. So the person eating cranberry is in row 3.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

7. The person who's hobby is reading is on the far right. Since the person eating cranberry is in row 3, the person who's hobby is reading must be in row 4.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

8. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in the rightmost position, the person watching crime movies must be in one of the first three positions. Let's try placing the person watching crime movies in row 1.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

9. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the pilot. Since the person watching crime movies is in the first position, the pilot must be in the second position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

   | Nationality   | canadian    |             |             |              |

10. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the pilot is in the second position, the entrepreneur must be in the third position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

   | Nationality   | canadian    |             |             |              |

11. The person eating corn is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since the entrepreneur is in the third position, the person watching action movies must be in the first position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

   | Nationality   | canadian    |             |             |              |

12. The person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the doctor. Since the entrepreneur is in the third position and the doctor must be in the fourth position (as the Spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks), the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in the second position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

13. The Spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in the first position, the Spanish must be in the fourth position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

   | Nationality   | canadian    |             |             | spanish     |

14. The person eating watermelon is not specified in the puzzle, so we can place it in any position. Let's place it in the second position.

   |               |      1       |      2      |      3       |      4       |

4. We know the musician is on the right of the dancer, so we can swap their positions:

   |               |       1       |      2      |      3      |     4     |

5. We know the musician is between the dressmaker and the person eating avocado. Since the musician is now in the 2nd position, the person eating avocado must be in the 3rd position. Let's fill in the Food column with avocado in the 3rd position:

   |               |       1       |      2      |      3      |     4     |

8. We know the person who's hobby is woodworking is between the person eating avocado and the person who's hobby is video-games.

9. We know the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, so we can fill in the Hobby column with video-games in the 4th position:

Lv2-5x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows in the table.

2. We know the favorite beverages, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and means of transport. Let's list them out:
   - Beverages: 7up, almond-milk, soy-milk, water
   - Hobbies: baking, hiking, photography, writing
   - Movie-Genres: crime, drama, sports, thriller
   - Music-Genres: country, hip-hop, indie, r&b
   - Transport: motorbike, roller, ship, taxi

3. Let's start with the transport. From points 2 and 10, we know that the person driving the motorbike is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the ship. Since there are only 4 people, the person driving the motorbike must be in the middle (position 3). So, we can fill in the transport for the first row:
   | Transport     | motorbike |   |   |

4. From points 9 and 10, we know that the person driving the motorbike is the fan of country. So, we can fill in the first row:
   | Transport     | motorbike | country |   |

5. From points 5 and 6, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk and the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person driving the motorbike (country) is in the middle, the person drinking 7up must be in the first position and the person drinking almond-milk in the second position. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing, so the person who's hobby is writing must be in the fourth position. So, we can fill in the second row:
   |               | 7up      | almond-milk | writing |

6. From point 1, we know that the people have 4 different hobbies. Since we have filled in 3 hobbies (baking, hiking, writing), the person with the hobby of baking must be in the third position. So, we can fill in the second row:
   |               | 7up      | almond-milk | baking  |

7. From point 11, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is on the far right. Since we have filled in 3 hobbies, the person with the hobby of photography must be in the fourth position. So, we can fill in the second row:
   |               | 7up      | almond-milk | baking  | photography

8. From point 1, we know that the people have 4 different movie-genres. Since we have filled in 3 movie-genres (crime, drama, sports), the person watching thriller movies must be in the third position. From point 4, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the person watching thriller movies. So, we can fill in the third row:
   |               |   | soy-milk | thriller |

9. From point 3, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person drinking soy-milk (thriller) is in the third position, the person drinking water must be in the first position. So, we can fill in the first row:
   | Transport     | motorbike | country  | water   |

10. From point 8, we know that the person with the hobby of hiking is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the person with the hobby of photography is on the far right, the person with the hobby of hiking must be in the second position. From point 1, we know that the people have 4 different hobbies, so the person with the hobby of baking must be in the third position. So, we can fill in the second row:
   |               | 7up      | almond-milk | hiking  |

11. From point 7, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is between the person watching sports movies and the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in the first position, the person watching sports movies must be in the second position. Since the person with the hobby of hiking is in the second position, the person who's hobby is writing must be in the third position. So, we can fill in the second row:
   |               | 7up      | almond-milk | writing |

12. From point 12, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching sports movies is in the second position, the person watching drama movies must be in the fourth position. So, we can fill in the fourth row:
   |               |   |   | drama  |

Now, we have the final solution table:

#############
| Transport     | motorbike | country  | water   |
| Beverage      | 7up       | almond-milk | writing |
| Hobby         | baking    | hiking    | photography |
| Movie-Genre   | crime     | sports    | thriller |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop   | indie     | r&b      |
|               |   | soy-milk | drama    |
#############

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv2-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 4 columns and 5 given conditions that involve 3 or more columns. Let's start by placing the people based on the conditions that involve only 2 columns.

   - From condition 1, the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of country. So, we can place the fan of gospel in the first column (Column 1) and the fan of country in the second column (Column 2).
   - From condition 11, the owner of the dog is on the far right. Since we know the fan of gospel is in Column 1 and the fan of country is in Column 2, the owner of the dog must be in Column 4.
   - From condition 6, the person eating banana is on the far right. Since the owner of the dog is in Column 4, the person eating banana must be in Column 3.
   - From condition 7, the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating banana. So, the person drinking water is in Column 1.

   Now we have:

   | Beverage      | soy-milk | milk     | water   |
   | Food          |          |         | banana  |
   | Music-Genre   | gospel   | country  |         |
   | Pet           |          |         | dog     |
   | Transport     |          |         |         |

   - From condition 8, the fan of gospel is the person eating carrot. So, the person eating carrot is in Column 3.
   - From condition 10, the person eating potato is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since we know the person eating banana is in Column 3, the person eating potato must be in Column 2.
   - From condition 5, the owner of the dog is the person driving the bus. Since we know the owner of the dog is in Column 4, the person driving the bus must be in Column 4.
   - From condition 9, the fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking water is in Column 1, the fan of d&b must be in Column 2.
   - From condition 3, the owner of the goat is between the person driving the roller and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person eating potato is in Column 2 and the person drinking soy-milk is yet to be determined, let's place the owner of the goat in Column 3 for now.
   - From condition 4, the person driving the train is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is in Column 2, the person driving the train must be in Column 4.
   - Now we know the person driving the roller is between the owner of the goat (Column 3) and the person drinking soy-milk (yet to be determined). Since the person eating potato is in Column 2, the person driving the roller must be in Column 1.

   Finally, the person drinking milk is the only one left. Since the fan of d&b is in Column 2 and the person driving the roller is in Column 1, the person drinking milk must be in Column 3.

   The final solution table is:

   | Beverage      | soy-milk | milk     | water   |
   | Food          | peas     | carrot  | banana  |
   | Music-Genre   | gospel   | d&b     | electronic|
   | Pet           | goat     | dog     | horse   |
   | Transport     | roller   | bus     | train   |

   This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv2-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 beverages, 4 foods, 4 nationalities, 4 pets, and 4 transports. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From the clues, we can deduce the following:

   - The Thai is on the right of the French, so Nationality[2] > Nationality[1].
   - The owner of the goldfish is the person eating peach, so Food[3] = Peach.
   - The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the goat, so Pet[3] < Pet[4].
   - The person driving the boat is between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the van, so Beverage[1] < Transport[3] < Beverage[4].
   - The person driving the scooter is between the French and the person drinking milk, so Nationality[1] < Transport[2] < Beverage[3].
   - The person drinking 7up is the owner of the goldfish, so Beverage[1] = Goldfish.
   - The Egyptian is on the right of the person eating lemon, so Nationality[3] > Food[2].
   - The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person drinking milk, so Food[1] < Beverage[3].
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk, so Beverage[3] > Beverage[2].
   - The owner of the rabbit is on the far right, so Pet[4] = Rabbit.

3. Now we have some more relationships between the numbers:

   - From Nationality[2] > Nationality[1], we know Nationality[2] cannot be 1 or 2. So Nationality[2] = 3 or 4. If Nationality[2] = 3, then Nationality[1] = 1 or 2. But Nationality[1] cannot be 1 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Nationality[1] = 2. In this case, Nationality[2] = 4 and Nationality[3] = 3. If Nationality[2] = 4, then Nationality[1] = 3 or 4. But Nationality[1] cannot be 4 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Nationality[1] = 3. In this case, Nationality[2] = 1 and Nationality[3] = 4.
   - From Beverage[1] < Transport[3] < Beverage[4], we know Beverage[4] cannot be 1 or 2. So Beverage[4] = 3 or 4. If Beverage[4] = 3, then Beverage[3] = 1 or 2. But Beverage[3] cannot be 1 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[3] = 2. In this case, Beverage[4] = 3 and Beverage[1] = 4. If Beverage[4] = 4, then Beverage[3] = 1 or 2. But Beverage[3] cannot be 1 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[3] = 2. In this case, Beverage[4] = 1 and Beverage[1] = 3.
   - From Nationality[3] > Food[2], we know Food[2] cannot be 1 or 3. So Food[2] = 2 or 4. If Food[2] = 2, then Food[1] = 1 or 3. But Food[1] cannot be 1 because of Beverage[1] < Beverage[3], so Food[1] = 3. In this case, Food[2] = 4 and Food[3] = 2. If Food[2] = 4, then Food[1] = 2 or 3. But Food[1] cannot be 2 because of Beverage[1] < Beverage[3], so Food[1] = 3. In this case, Food[2] = 1 and Food[3] = 4.
   - From Beverage[3] > Beverage[2], we know Beverage[2] cannot be 4. So Beverage[2] = 1 or 3. If Beverage[2] = 1, then Beverage[1] = 2 or 3. But Beverage[1] cannot be 2 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[1] = 3. In this case, Beverage[2] = 2 and Beverage[3] = 1. If Beverage[2] = 3, then Beverage[1] = 1 or 2. But Beverage[1] cannot be 1 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[1] = 2. In this case, Beverage[2] = 1 and Beverage[3] = 4.
   - From Pet[3] < Pet[4], we know Pet[4] cannot be 1 or 2. So Pet[4] = 3 or 4. If Pet[4] = 3, then Pet[3] = 1 or 2. But Pet[3] cannot be 1 because of Transport[2] < Beverage[3], so Pet[3] = 2. In this case, Pet[4] = 4 and Pet[3] = 1. If Pet[4] = 4, then Pet[3] = 1 or 2. But Pet[3] cannot be 1 because of Transport[2] < Beverage[3], so Pet[3] = 3. In this case, Pet[4] = 1 and Pet[3] = 2.
   - From Transport[2] < Beverage[3], we know Beverage[3] cannot be 1. So Beverage[3] = 2 or 4. If Beverage[3] = 2, then Beverage[1] = 3 or 4. But Beverage[1] cannot be 3 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[1] = 4. In this case, Beverage[3] = 2 and Beverage[1] = 3. If Beverage[3] = 4, then Beverage[1] = 1 or 2. But Beverage[1] cannot be 1 because of Food[1] < Beverage[3], so Beverage[1] = 2. In this case, Beverage[3] = 1 and Beverage[1] = 3.
   - From the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person drinking milk, we know Food[1] < Beverage[3].
   - From the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk, we know Beverage[3] > Beverage[2].

   Solution 13:
   Beverage: 3, 1, 2, 4
   Food: 3, 4, 1, 2
   Nationality: 2, 3, 1, 4
   Pet: 1, 2, 3, 4
   Transport: Boat, Taxi, 3, Taxi

5. Now we can use the remaining clues to solve for the missing Transport values:

   - From the person driving the scooter is between the French and the person drinking milk, we know Nationality[1] < Transport[2] < Beverage[3]. So Transport[2] cannot be Boat or Van. Transport[2] = Scooter.
   - From the person driving the boat is between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the van, we know Beverage[1] < Transport[3] < Beverage[4]. So Transport[3] cannot be Scooter or Taxi. Transport[3] = Boat.
   - From the owner of the rabbit is on the far right, we know Pet[4] = Rabbit. So Transport[4] cannot be Boat, Scooter, or Taxi. Transport[4] = Van.

6. The final solution is:

   ```
   Beverage: 3, 1, 2, 4
   Food: 3, 4, 1, 2
   Nationality: 2, 3, 1, 4
   Pet: 1, 2, 3, 4
   Transport: Boat, Scooter, 3, Van
   ```

   Or, in a more readable format:

Lv2-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the person eating corn is between the owner of the dog and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Let's place the sudoku person on the far right (column 4) and the dog owner in column 1. Since corn can't be in column 4 (as it's already occupied by the sudoku person), corn must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place corn in column 3 for now.

2. The person watching epic movies is on the far left. Since the sudoku person is on the far right, the epic movie person must be in column 1.

3. The fan of salsa is the person watching epic movies. So, salsa is in column 1.

4. The fan of classical is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the epic movie person (salsa) is in column 1, the classical fan must be in column 2.

5. The owner of the frog is between the owner of the horse and the person watching superhero movies. Since the dog owner is in column 1 and the epic movie person (salsa) is in column 1, the frog owner can't be in column 1 or 4. So, the frog owner must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place the frog owner in column 2 for now. This means the superhero movie person is in column 3.

6. The person eating grapes is the person who's hobby is singing. Since the gardening person (cauliflower) is already placed, the singing person must be in column 2 or 4. Let's place the singing person in column 4 for now. This means the grapes person is in column 2.

7. The owner of the pony is the person eating grapes. So, the pony owner is in column 2.

8. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the blues fan. Since the superhero movie person (column 3) and the pony owner (column 2) are already placed, the time-travel movie person must be in column 1 or 4. Let's place the time-travel movie person in column 4 for now. This means the blues fan is in column 3.

9. The person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating cauliflower. So, the gardening person is in column 1.

Now, let's check the consistency of the table:
- All food, hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and pets are unique.
- The conditions 1-11 are satisfied.

Here is the final solution table:

  |               |    1    |      2      |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | cauliflower | grapes | corn | strawberry |
| Hobby         | gardening | singing | sudoku | filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | epic | time-travel | superhero | scientific |
| Music-Genre   | blues | salsa | classical | punk |
| Pet           | dog | pony | frog | horse |"
