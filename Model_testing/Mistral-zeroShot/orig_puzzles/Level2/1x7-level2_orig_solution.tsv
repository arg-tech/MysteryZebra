Lv2-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the genres are arranged in a row, and there are 7 different genres. So, we can write the genres in a row as follows:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Genres |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

2. From rule 1, we know that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of blues. So, let's place blues in the first position (position 1) and house in the second position (position 2).

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Genres | Blues | House |   |   |   |   |   |

3. From rule 2, we know that the fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since we already placed blues and house, the only available positions for ambient and d&b are positions 3 and 4. Let's place ambient in position 3 and d&b in position 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Genres | Blues | House | Ambient | d&b |   |   |   |

4. From rule 3, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of classical. Since we already placed ambient, d&b, blues, and house, the only available positions for techno and classical are positions 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. Let's place techno in position 5 and classical in position 6.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Genres | Blues | House | Ambient | d&b | Techno | Classical |   |

5. From rule 4, we know that the fan of disco is between the fan of ambient and the fan of classical. Since we already placed ambient, d&b, blues, house, techno, and classical, the only available positions for disco are positions 3, 4, and 5. However, position 3 is already occupied by ambient, and position 5 is occupied by techno. So, the only available position for disco is position 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Genres | Blues | House | Ambient | Disco | Techno | Classical |   |

Now, we have placed all the genres according to the given rules. So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
|----|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Genres | Blues | House | Ambient | Disco | Techno | Classical |   |

Lv2-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fishing hobby is on the left of skydiving. Let's place them in the first two spots: Fishing (1) and Skydiving (2).

2. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the hobby of baking should be in the third position, which is Chess (3) because we already placed Skydiving (2) and Fishing (1).

3. The hobby of chess is between collecting and baking. Since we already placed Chess (3) and Baking (2), the hobby of collecting should be in the fourth position, which is Collecting (4).

4. The hobby of camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. So, the hobby of camping should be in the fifth position, which is Camping (5).

5. Now, we know that the hobby of chess is in the middle, so it should be in the sixth position, which is Chess (6).

6. Finally, we have one hobby left, filmmaking. Since all other hobbies are placed, filmmaking should be in the seventh position, which is Filmmaking (7).

The final solution table is:

  |         |    1    |     2     |   3    |   4   |     5      |    6    |     7      |

Lv2-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that hiking is to the right of fishing. Let's place fishing in the first position (1) and hiking in the second position (2).

   | Hobby   | fishing     | hiking   |   ?    |            |        |         |        |

2. Now, we know that traveling is to the right of woodworking. Since fishing is already in position 1, and we can't have traveling in position 1 (because it's to the right of woodworking), let's place woodworking in position 3.

   |         |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4      |   5    |    6    |   7    |
   | Hobby   | fishing     | hiking   | woodworking|   ?    |        |         |        |

3. Since traveling is to the right of woodworking and sudoku is between traveling and card-games, let's place traveling in position 4 and sudoku in position 5.

   |         |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |   5    |    6    |   7    |
   | Hobby   | fishing     | hiking   | woodworking| traveling| sudoku  |   ?    |        |

4. Now, we know that card-games is to the left of baking, and baking is to the right of fishing. Since card-games is already in position 5, let's place baking in position 6.

   |         |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |   5    |    6    |   7    |
   | Hobby   | fishing     | hiking   | woodworking| traveling| sudoku  | baking  |   ?    |

5. Finally, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since we've already placed card-games in position 5 and baking in position 6, there's no more room to the left of baking. So, card-games must be in position 6, and baking in position 7.

   |         |      1      |     2     |   3    |     4     |   5    |    6    |   7    |

Lv2-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobby of woodworking is in the middle, so we can place it in the 4th position (3rd from the left and 3rd from the right).

2. Since woodworking is in the middle, we know that fishing and reading are on either side of it. So, fishing is in position 3 and reading is in position 5.

3. The hobby of sudoku is on the left of chess. Since we know the positions of woodworking, fishing, and reading, the only possible position for sudoku is position 1, and chess must be in position 6.

4. The hobby of camping is on the right of reading, so it must be in position 6. This means that the hobby of dancing must be in position 2.

5. The hobby of camping is also on the left of dancing, so it cannot be in position 6. This means that our initial assumption about camping and dancing positions was incorrect. Let's rearrange the positions we have determined so far:

   - Woodworking: 4
   - Fishing: 3
   - Reading: 5
   - Sudoku: 1
   - Chess: 6

6. Now, we know that camping is on the right of reading, so it must be in position 7. This means that dancing must be in position 2.

7. The hobby of dancing is the person who's hobby is dancing, so our solution is correct.

Final solution table:

1. We know that the person watching musical movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. Let's place them in order: Family, Musical, Martial-arts.

2. The person watching action movies is on the far right, so it should be placed at the end: Action.

3. The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching action movies, so it should be placed before action: Animation, Action.

4. The person watching drama movies is between the person watching martial-arts movies and the person watching animation movies. Since we already know the order of martial-arts, animation, and action, we can place drama between them: Family, Musical, Martial-arts, Drama, Animation, Action.

5. The person watching zombie movies is on the far left, so it should be the first one: Zombie, Family, Musical, Martial-arts, Drama, Animation, Action.

So, the final solution table is:

2. The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. So, we place singing to the right of chess:

   |         |   1    |   2   |    3    |    4    |       5       |      6       |    7    |
   | Hobby   | Baking| Chess |   ?    |   ?    |   Singing |   ?          | Dancing  |

3. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right. Since we already have singing on the rightmost position, dancing cannot be placed:

   This is a contradiction, so let's rearrange the hobbies for chess and singing:

   |         |   1    |   2   |    3    |    4    |       5       |      6       |    7    |

4. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is fishing. Let's place rock-climbing between magic-tricks and singing:

   | Hobby   | Baking| Magic | Rock   |   Fishing|   Singing |   ?          | Dancing  |

5. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we already have magic-tricks in position 3, dancing cannot be on the right of it. So, let's swap the positions of magic-tricks and rock-climbing:

   |         |   1    |   2   |    3    |    4    |       5       |      6       |    7    |
   | Hobby   | Baking|   ?   | Rock   | Magic  |   Singing |   ?          | Dancing  |

3. The person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we know the positions of sailing (4), cycling (3), and golf (5), basketball must be either in position 1 or 2. If it were in position 1, baseball would have to be in position 6, but then there would be no room for biathlon. So, basketball must be in position 2. Baseball must be in position 1, and biathlon must be in position 6.

4. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. This condition is already satisfied since we placed baseball in position 1 and sailing in position 4.

5. The person who's sport is cycling is between the person who's sport is skiing and the person who's sport is golf. We already placed cycling in position 3 and golf in position 5. So, skiing must be in position 2.
