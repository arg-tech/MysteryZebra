1. Since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person watching animation movies, we can place the mouse owner in the first column and the animation movie-watcher in the second column. Let's assign the hobby of animation to the second row and the pet of mouse to the first row.

2. The pilot is the person driving the bus, so we can place the pilot in the row with the bus and assign the job of pilot to that row. Since the pilot is on the far right, the bus driver must be in the last column.

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Australian, so the card-games hobby must be in a column to the right of the Australian. Let's assign the hobby of card-games to the third column.

4. The person driving the motorbike is the fan of d&b, so we can place the d&b fan in the row with the motorbike and assign the music-genre of d&b to that row. Since the motorbike driver must be in a column to the right of the card-games hobby, the motorbike driver must be in the fourth column.

5. The person who's hobby is hiking is between the security-guard and the bartender. Since the hiking hobby must be in a column to the left of the card-games hobby, the hiking hobby must be in the second column.

28. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person driving the car.
   - Mirinda: firefighter, right of car

Now let's use the information from steps 4, 6, 24, and 28 to determine the positions of snowboarding, disaster movies, nigerian, and car:
- Since the nigerian is between basketball and rowing, and the rowing is in position 1, the nigerian must be in position 2 or 3.
- Since the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person driving the car, and the firefighter drinks mirinda, the car cannot be in position 1. So, the car must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- If the nigerian is in position 2, then snowboarding must be in position 3, and disaster movies must be in position 4. However, this would place the french (between disaster movies and thai) in position 5 or 6, which is not possible because the french is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton, and badminton is in position 1. So, the nigerian must be in position 3.
- With the nigerian in position 3, the car must be in position 2, and snowboarding is in position 4. This places disaster movies in position 5, and the french in position 6.

Now let's use the information from steps 1, 5, 19, and 25 to determine the positions of soy-milk, magic-tricks, board-games, and social-worker:
- Since the nigerian is in position 3, soy-milk must be in position 1, 2, or 6. However, if soy-milk is in position 1, then the person driving the boat (mystery movies) must be in position 2, which would place the social-worker (left of boat) in position 3, but the social-worker is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, and magic-tricks is in position 5. So, soy-milk cannot be in position 1.
- If soy-milk is in position 6, then the person driving the boat (mystery movies) must be in position 5, which would place the social-worker (left of boat) in position 6, but the social-worker is on the right of the person drinking tea, and tea is in position 1. So, soy-milk cannot be in position 6.
- Therefore, soy-milk must be in position 2.
- Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left, it must be in position 1.
- Since the social-worker is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (boat), and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the firefighter (mirinda), the social-worker must be in position 5, and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 4.

Now let's use the information from steps 11, 13, and 21 to determine the positions of sudoku, skydiving, and collecting:
- Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person who's hobby is sudoku, and snowboarding is in position 4, sudoku must be in position 4.
- Since the person driving the boat (mystery movies) is the person who's hobby is collecting, and the boat is in position 5, collecting must be in position 5.
- Since the person who's sport is rowing is on the far left, it must be in position 1.

Now let's use the information from steps 12, 16, 17, and 26 to determine the positions of cola, disaster movies, fantasy movies, and tea:
- Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's hobby is skydiving is not yet determined, cola must be in position 6.
- Since the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person drinking mirinda (firefighter), and the person watching disaster movies is not yet determined, disaster movies must be in position 5.
- Since the software-developer is the person watching fantasy movies, and the software-developer is not yet determined, fantasy movies must be in position 7.
- Since the social-worker is on the right of the person drinking tea, and the social-worker is in position 5, tea must be in position 6.

Now let's use the information from steps 3, 7, 14, 15, 23, and 27 to determine the positions of basketball, skateboard, airplane, soccer, and tennis:
- Since the person who's sport is basketball is the person watching fantasy movies, and fantasy movies is in position 7, basketball must be in position 7.
- Since the person driving the skateboard is the italian, and the italian is not yet determined, skateboard must be in position 6.
- Since the person driving the airplane is on the far left, it must be in position 1.
- Since the italian is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer, and soccer is not yet determined, soccer must be in position 5.
- Since the person who's sport is tennis is the bartender, and the bartender is not yet determined, tennis must be in position 4.

Now let's use the information from steps 8, 9, 20, and 22 to determine the positions of rower, french, boat, and brazilian:
- Since the person driving the roller is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's sport is rowing, and skydiving and roller are not yet determined, rowing must be in position 3.
- Since the french is between the person watching disaster movies and the thai, and disaster movies is in position 5 and thai is in position 6, the french must be in position 4.
- Since the person driving the boat is the person watching mystery movies, and mystery movies is in position 5, boat must be in position 4.

- Since the person drinking mirinda is the firefighter, and mirinda is in position 5, firefighter must be in position 5.
- Since the person watching comedy movies is between the person watching mystery movies (boat) and the person drinking lemonade, and mystery movies is in position 5 and lemonade is not yet determined, comedy movies must be in position 6.
- Since the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person driving the car, and mirinda is in position 5, car must be in position 3.

Now let's use the information from steps 10 and 24 to determine the position of lemonade:
- Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left, and board-games is in position 1, lemonade must be in position 2.

|               |      1      |    2     |       3       |     4     |     5      |     6      |
| Beverage      | 7up        | cola    | hot-chocolate| juice    | milk      | water     |

Now let's assign the variables to the second row (Hobby):

|               |      1      |    2     |       3       |     4     |     5      |     6      |
| Beverage      | 7up        | cola    | hot-chocolate| juice    | milk      | water     |
| Hobby         | drawing    | board-games|               |           |            |            |

Since the person driving the tram is the person drinking 7up and the person driving the tram is on the far right, we can deduce that the 7up drinker is in the last column:

|               |      1      |    2     |       3       |     4     |     5      |     6      |
| Beverage      | 7up        | cola    | hot-chocolate| juice    | milk      | water     |
| Hobby         | drawing    | board-games|               |           |            |            |
| Job           |           |          |               |           |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |               |           |            |            |
| Nationality   |           |          |               |           |            |            |
| Pet           |           |          |               |           |            |            |
| Transport     | tram      |           |               |           |            |            |

Now let's use the clues to fill in the remaining columns:
