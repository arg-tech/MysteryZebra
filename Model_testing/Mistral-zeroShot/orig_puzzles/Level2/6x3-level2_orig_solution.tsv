Lv2-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport) with 3 options each. So, there are 720 possible combinations (3^6). However, we have 8 constraints, which will help us reduce the number of possibilities.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Mexican is on the far right, it can't be in the first or second column. So, it must be in the third column.

3. The Indian can't be in the third column because the person drinking tea is on the left of the Indian, and the Indian is not on the far left (from constraint 2). So, the Indian must be in the first or second column.

4. The Polish can't be in the third column either, because the Polish can't be on the far left (from constraint 2). So, the Polish must be in the first or second column as well.

5. The remaining nationality, which is the Indian or the Polish, can't be in the first column because the person drinking tea is on the left of the Indian or the Polish, and the Indian or the Polish can't be in the third column. So, the Indian or the Polish must be in the second column.

6. Since the Indian or the Polish can't be in the first column and the Mexican is in the third column, the person in the first column must be the person from the remaining nationality, which is the Indian or the Polish. Let's assume it's the Indian (for now).

7. The person drinking tea is on the left of the Indian. Since the Indian is in the second column, the person drinking tea must be in the first column. So, the beverage in the first column is tea.

8. The person eating cabbage is between the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating mango. Since the Mexican is on the far right, the person eating mango must be in the second column. So, the person eating cabbage must be in the third column.

9. The person eating mango is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the person eating mango is in the second column, the person driving the train must be in the third column. So, the transport in the third column is train.

10. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking tea is in the first column and the person drinking fanta can't be in the third column (because the person driving the train is in the third column), the person drinking fanta must be in the second column. So, the beverage in the second column is fanta.

11. The person drinking milk can't be in the third column because the person driving the train is in the third column. So, the person drinking milk must be in the first column. So, the beverage in the first column is milk.

12. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching western movies is on the far left, the person watching adventure movies must be in the second column. So, the movie-genre in the second column is adventure.

13. The person watching musical movies is in the third column. So, the movie-genre in the third column is musical.

14. The person watching western movies is on the far left. So, the movie-genre in the first column is western.

15. The person eating peas can't be in the third column because the person eating mango is in the second column and the person eating mango is on the left of the person eating peas. So, the person eating peas must be in the first or second column. Since the person eating cabbage is in the third column, the person eating peas must be in the first column. So, the food in the first column is peas.

16. The person driving the bus is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the person driving the train is in the third column, the person driving the bus must be in the second column. So, the transport in the second column is bus.

17. The person owning the chinchilla can't be in the third column because the person driving the train is in the third column. So, the person owning the chinchilla must be in the first or second column. Since the person eating peas is in the first column, the person owning the chinchilla must be in the second column. So, the pet in the second column is chinchilla.

18. The person owning the fish can't be in the first column because the person eating peas is in the first column. So, the person owning the fish must be in the second or third column. Since the person owning the chinchilla is in the second column, the person owning the fish must be in the third column. So, the pet in the third column is fish.

19. The person owning the lizard can't be in the third column because the person driving the bus is in the second column. So, the person owning the lizard must be in the first column. So, the pet in the first column is lizard.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 beverages and the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking cola, we can place them as follows:
   | Beverage      | 1   | 2   | 3   |

   |             |     |     |     |

   We can fill the first row with the beverages: Cola in position 1, Fanta in position 2, and Tea in position 3.

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we already placed the beverages, we can place the chinchilla owner and Biathlon in the second row. Let's place Biathlon on the left and the chinchilla owner to its right.

Lv2-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the writing person is between the Mexican and the cat owner. Let's place the Egyptian, French, and Mexican in the Nationality column, and the cat, ferret, and snake in the Pet column. We can't place the writing person yet because we don't know who the traveler is. So, let's fill the other columns with random values for now:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | Egyptian  | French   | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | snowmobile| van      |

2. The French is on the left of the Egyptian, so we swap their positions in the Nationality column:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | snowmobile| van      |

3. The Egyptian is the Egyptian, so no change is needed.

4. The fan of folk is the owner of the snake. We already know the snake owner is Mexican, so we can place folk under Mexico in the Music-Genre column:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | snowmobile| van      |

5. The fan of classical is on the left of the fan of folk. Since we already placed the fan of folk, the fan of classical must be French:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | snowmobile| van      |

6. The writing person is between the traveler and the nectarine eater. Since we know the traveler is on the right of the writing person, the nectarine eater must be the Egyptian:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | snowmobile| van      |

7. The car driver is on the left of the van driver. Since we already placed the car, the van driver must be Mexican:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | van      | snowmobile|

8. The fan of folk is on the left of the pumpkin eater. Since we already placed the fan of folk, the pumpkin eater must be the French:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | van      | snowmobile|

9. The snowmobile driver is on the left of the fan of folk. Since we already placed the snowmobile, the fan of folk must be the Egyptian:

   |               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
   | Food          | nectarine | plum    | pumpkin  |
   | Hobby         | filmmaking| traveling| writing   |
   | Music-Genre   | classical | folk     | punk      |
   | Nationality   | French    | Egyptian | Mexican   |
   | Pet           | cat       | ferret   | snake     |
   | Transport     | car       | van      | snowmobile|

Now we have a contradiction, as the Egyptian is both the fan of folk and the pumpkin eater. Let's reconsider the puzzle or find an error in the given information.

If there's no error, the puzzle seems to have an inconsistency."
Lv2-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Nationality, Sport, Transport) and 3 instances for each. Let's denote them as follows:

   - Beverage: A, B, C (where A = fanta, B = mirinda, C = water)
   - Food: X, Y, Z (where X = apple, Y = cucumber, Z = radish)
   - Hobby: a, b, c (where a = chess, b = gardening, c = skydiving)
   - Nationality: i, j, k (where i = argentine, j = colombian, k = nigerian)
   - Sport: p, q, r (where p = baseball, q = golf, r = snowboarding)
   - Transport: u, v, w (where u = bike, v = car, w = helicopter)

2. From the clues, we can start to place some variables in their respective positions:

   - The person who's hobby is chess is on the far left. So, hobby 'a' goes in the first column.
   - The person driving the helicopter is the argentine. So, transport 'w' goes in the third row and nationality 'i' goes in the third column.
   - The person driving the bike is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. So, transport 'u' goes in the first row, and since the snowboarder is on the far right, sport 'r' goes in the third column.
   - The person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is snowboarding. So, food 'Y' goes in the third column and we know it's the same as the sport 'r'.
   - The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person drinking fanta. So, sport 'q' goes in the second column, and since fanta is denoted as 'B', it goes in the second row.
   - The nigerian is on the right of the colombian. So, nationality 'k' goes in the second column, and since colombian is denoted as 'j', it goes in the first column.
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person eating radish and the person driving the car. So, hobby 'c' goes in the second row, and since radish is denoted as 'Z' and car is denoted as 'v', we can't place them yet as we don't know their positions.
   - The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far right. Since we already placed the snowboarder in the third column, no further action is needed for this clue.

3. Now we have some empty cells where we can't place the variables based on the given clues. However, we can use the remaining variables to fill these cells. Since there are only 2 variables left (food 'Z' and transport 'v'), they must be placed in the remaining cells.

   - The only remaining cell for food is the second row, first column. So, food 'Z' goes there.
   - The only remaining cell for transport is the second row, third column. Since the person driving the bike is on the left of the snowboarder, and the snowboarder is on the far right, the person driving the car must be in the second row, second column. So, transport 'v' goes there.

4. Now we have a complete table:

   |               |     1      |     2     |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta (B)  | mirinda (A) | water (C)    |
   | Food          | apple (X)  | cucumber (Y) | radish (Z)   |
   | Hobby         | chess (a)  | skydiving (c) | gardening (b) |
   | Nationality   | colombian (j) | argentine (i) | nigerian (k) |
   | Sport         | baseball (p) | golf (q) | snowboarding (r) |
   | Transport     | bike (u)  | car (v) | helicopter (w) |

5. To make the table more readable, we can add the names of the items:

   |               |     1      |     2     |      3       |
   | Beverage      | fanta      | mirinda   | water        |
   | Food          | apple      | cucumber  | radish       |
   | Hobby         | chess      | skydiving | gardening    |
   | Nationality   | colombian  | argentine | nigerian     |
   | Sport         | baseball   | golf      | snowboarding  |
   | Transport     | bike       | car       | helicopter   |

6. To make the final solution table, we can add the separators:

   ```

Lv2-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the indie fan is on the left of the country fan, and there are only three options, the indie fan must be in the first column, and the country fan must be in the second column.

2. The owner of the guinea-pig eats banana, so the banana eater must be in the third row.

3. The person watching animation movies is on the far left, so they must be in the first row.

4. The japanese is on the far right, so they must be in the third column.

5. The fan of country is the owner of the dog, so the dog owner must be in the second row.

6. The bartender is between the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the goat. Since the bartender can't be in the first row (because the bartender is not the fan of animation), the bartender must be in the second column. This means the person eating pumpkin must be in the first row, and the owner of the goat must be in the third row.

7. The egyptian is on the right of the person eating kiwi. Since the person eating kiwi can't be in the first column (because the animation fan is there), the person eating kiwi must be in the second column. This means the egyptian must be in the third column.

8. The social-worker is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the animation fan is on the far left, the martial-arts fan must be in the second column. This means the social-worker must be in the third column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

3. The fan of metal is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. So, handball must be in the second or third row, and metal can be in the second or third column, but not in the same column as handball (because metal is to the right of handball).

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person watching superhero movies and the fan of metal. Since we don't know the position of the fan of metal yet, we can't place skydiving yet.

5. The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person driving the tram. So, tram must be in the third row.

6. The person watching martial-arts movies is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person eating apple. So, badminton must be in the first row, and martial-arts can be in the second or third row, but not in the same row as badminton or apple.

7. The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person driving the trike. So, trike must be in the first row.

Now, let's place the remaining items:

8. Since we know the position of badminton, we can place apple in the second row.

9. Since we know the position of handball and the position of the person who's hobby is skydiving, we can place superhero movies in the second row.

10. Since we know the position of the fan of metal, we can place skydiving in the second row.

11. Since we know the position of the person who's hobby is reading, we can place reading in the third row.

Lv2-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items (beverages, food, hobbies, pets, sports, transport). Each person has one of each.

2. Let's start with the pets. From condition 4, the goldfish is on the far right, so it must be in the third column. Since there are only three pets, the fish and rabbit must be in the first and second columns respectively. So, the table looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    |           |            |             |
   | Food        |           |            | pomegranate  |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish      | rabbit     | goldfish    |
   | Sport       |           |            |             |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

3. From condition 3, the owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. So, handball must be in the first row. Let's say handball is in the first row and first column, so the sport column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    |           |            |             |
   | Food        |           |            | pomegranate  |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish      | rabbit     | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  |           |             |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

4. From condition 1, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since handball is in the first row and first column, badminton cannot be in the first row. So, badminton must be in the second row. Let's say badminton is in the second row and second column, so the sport column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    |           |            |             |
   | Food        |           |            | pomegranate  |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish      | rabbit     | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  |             |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

5. From condition 2, the person driving the bike is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since badminton is in the second row and second column, volleyball cannot be in the second row. So, volleyball must be in the third row. Let's say volleyball is in the third row and third column, so the sport column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    |           |            |             |
   | Food        |           |            | pomegranate  |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish      | rabbit     | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

6. From condition 8, the person eating asparagus is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. So, asparagus must be in the first column. Let's say asparagus is in the first column and first row, so the food column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    | coffee   | milk      | water       |
   | Food        | asparagus|           | pomegranate |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

7. From condition 7, the person drinking water is on the right of the person eating cranberry. Since pomegranate is in the second column, cranberry must be in the first column. But we already placed asparagus there. So, cranberry must be in the third column. Let's say cranberry is in the third column and second row, so the food column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    | coffee   | milk      | water       |
   | Food        | asparagus| cranberry | pomegranate |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
   | Transport   |           |            |             |

8. From condition 6, the person driving the taxi is between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since pomegranate is in the third column, the taxi cannot be in the third row. So, the taxi must be in the second row. But the second row is already filled with badminton and milk. So, let's swap milk and taxi. The transport column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    | coffee   | taxi      | water       |
   | Food        | asparagus| cranberry | pomegranate |
   | Hobby       |           |            |             |
   | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
   | Transport   | bike     |           |             |

9. From condition 5, the person who's hobby is baking is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's hobby is writing. Since drawing is in the second column and writing is in the third column, baking must be in the first column. But the first column is already filled with asparagus, coffee, and fish. So, let's swap asparagus and baking. The hobby column looks like this:

   |             |     1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Beverage    | coffee   | taxi      | water       |
   | Food        | baking   | cranberry | pomegranate |
   | Hobby       | drawing  |           | writing     |
   | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
   | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
   | Transport   | bike     |           |             |

10. Now, the table is filled, and we have a solution:

    | Beverage    | coffee   | taxi      | water       |
    | Food        | baking   | cranberry | pomegranate |
    | Hobby       | drawing  |           | writing     |
    | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
    | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
    | Transport   | bike     |           |             |

So, the final solution table is:

    | Beverage    | coffee   | taxi      | water       |
    | Food        | baking   | cranberry | pomegranate |
    | Hobby       | drawing  |           | writing     |
    | Pet         | fish     | rabbit    | goldfish    |
    | Sport       | handball  | badminton  | volleyball   |
    | Transport   | bike     |           |             |

Lv2-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Sport) and each has 3 different options. Let's assign a number to each option for each variable:

   Beverage: 1 - hot-chocolate, 2 - iced-tea, 3 - lemonade
   Food: 1 - apricot, 2 - corn, 3 - spinach
   Hobby: 1 - camping, 2 - skydiving, 3 - video-games
   Job: 1 - journalist, 2 - pilot, 3 - writer
   Movie-Genre: 1 - epic, 2 - mystery, 3 - spy
   Sport: 1 - basketball, 2 - skiing, 3 - tennis

2. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the journalist. So, we can place video-games in the third column and journalist in the second column. Let's assign them the numbers 3 and 2 respectively.

3. The writer is the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, hot-chocolate must be in the second row. Since the journalist is already in the second row, hot-chocolate must be in the first column. Let's assign it the number 1.

4. The person watching epic movies is on the far right. Since we already placed the journalist and the person with video-games in the second and third columns, epic movies must be in the first row. Let's assign it the number 1.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right. Since we already placed the person watching epic movies in the first column of the first row, iced-tea must be in the third column of the first row. Let's assign it the number 3.

6. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we already placed the person with video-games (hobby: 3) in the third column, the person watching mystery movies must be in the second column. Let's assign it the number 2.

7. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating corn. So, spinach must be in the first column and corn must be in the second column. Let's assign them the numbers 1 and 2 respectively.

8. The person who's sport is basketball is between the person drinking hot-chocolate (row 1, column 1) and the person eating apricot (column 2). Since there's only one option left for the second column of the first row (iced-tea), basketball must be in the third column of the second row. Let's assign it the number 3.

9. The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the journalist (column 2). Since we already placed basketball in the third column of the second row, skiing must be in the third column of the first row. Let's assign it the number 3.

10. The only remaining option for the first column of the second row is tennis. So, the person watching spy movies must be in the second column of the second row. Let's assign it the number 2.

The final solution table is:

Lv2-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Music-Genre, Pet) and 6 people (1, 2, 3). Let's assign each variable to a person.

2. Let's start with the pets. From point 1, the chinchilla owner is on the right of the carrot eater. So, let's place the chinchilla owner as person 3 and the carrot eater as person 1. Now, the chinchilla is between the person eating potato and the person eating radish.

3. From point 2, the radish eater is between the lemonade drinker and the firefighter. So, let's place the lemonade drinker as person 2 and the firefighter as person 5. Now, the radish eater is person 4.

4. From point 3, the country music fan is on the right of the house music fan. Since the house music fan is on the right of the singing hobby person (from point 6), the singing hobby person must be person 2 (leaving the other two hobbies for persons 1 and 3). So, let's place the singing hobby person as person 2 and the house music fan as person 3. Now, the country music fan is person 1.

5. From point 4, the fanta drinker is between the software-developer and the skydiving hobby person. Since the skydiving hobby person is between the dog owner and the potato eater (from point 5), the dog owner must be person 5 and the potato eater is person 4. So, let's place the software-developer as person 1 and the skydiving hobby person as person 4. Now, the fanta drinker is person 2.

6. From point 5, the drawing hobby person is between the dog owner and the potato eater. Since we already placed the dog owner and the potato eater, the drawing hobby person is person 5.

7. Now, we have placed all the people and their hobbies, jobs, music genres, and pets. The final solution table is:
