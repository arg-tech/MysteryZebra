Lv2-1x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three nationalities: Indian, Japanese, and Thai. Let's denote them as I, J, and T respectively.

2. The Thai is on the left of the Japanese, so T cannot be in the rightmost position. This means the possible positions for the nationalities are:

   |               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
   | Nationality   | I     | T   |     J     |
   | Nationality   | I     | J   |     T     |
   | Nationality   | T     | I   |     J     |

3. The Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese. This means the Thai cannot be in the first position (since there is no nationality to its left) and cannot be in the last position (since the Japanese is to its right). So, the possible positions for the nationalities are:

   |               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
   | Nationality   | I     | T   |     J     |
   | Nationality   | I     | J   |     T     |
   | Nationality   | T     | I   |     J     |

   We can eliminate the first row because the Thai cannot be in the first position.

   |               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
   | Nationality   | I     | J   |     T     |
   | Nationality   | T     | I   |     J     |

4. Now, let's check the second row. If the Thai is in the second position, then the Indian must be in the first position and the Japanese in the third position. This satisfies all the conditions.

   |               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
   | Nationality   | I     | T   |     J     |

5. The third row is not possible because the Thai is already placed in the second position.

So, the final solution is:

#############
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
| Nationality   | I     | T   |     J     |

Lv2-1x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching disaster movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching sports movies, we can write this as: Disaster -> Horror -> Sports

2. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies, so we can rearrange the sequence as: Disaster -> Sports -> Horror

Now, let's fill in the table with the genres:

|               |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster | Sports | Horror |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster | Sports | Horror |
#############"
Lv2-1x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fans of the three genres are different and in a row, we can write down the genres in one possible order: Ambient, Folk, Metal.

2. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient, so the order should be: Folk, Ambient, Metal.

3. The fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal, so the positions should be: Folk, Ambient, Metal (in that order).

The final solution table is:

  |               |   1   |  2   |    3    |
| Music-Genre   | Folk  | Ambient | Metal  |

#############
|               | Folk  | Ambient | Metal  |

Lv2-1x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three pets: ferret, guinea-pig, and snake.

2. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. This means that the snake cannot be in the rightmost position (position 3) because if it were, the guinea-pig would have to be in the leftmost position (position 1), and the ferret would be in the middle (position 2), which contradicts the fact that the snake is between the guinea-pig and the ferret. So, the snake must be in either position 1 or 2.

3. If the snake were in position 1, the guinea-pig would have to be in position 2, and the ferret in position 3. But this arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition that the snake is between the guinea-pig and the ferret.

4. Therefore, the snake must be in position 2. This means the guinea-pig must be in position 1, and the ferret in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Guinea-pig   |   Snake    |   Ferret   |

Lv2-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking milk is on the far right, so we can place it in the third column. Let's put M for milk in the third column.

   |            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage   |       |      | M    |

2. Now, the person drinking cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice. Since we know the position of milk, cola can only be in the second column. Let's put C for cola in the second column.

   |            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage   |   C   |      | M    |

3. The only beverage left is juice. Since it's not on the far right (because milk is there), it must be in the first column. Let's put J for juice in the first column.

   |            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
   | Beverage   |   J   |   C  |   M  |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   |   J   |   C  |   M  |

Lv2-1x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking almond-milk, we can rule out the possibility that mirinda is in the first column (column 1). This is because if it were, there would be no one to its left (the person drinking juice).

2. Now, let's place the person drinking juice in the first column (column 1).

3. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, the only remaining position for almond-milk is the third column (column 3).

4. This leaves the second column (column 2) for the person drinking mirinda, as it must be between the person drinking juice and the person drinking almond-milk.

So, the final solution table is:

  |            |   1   |    2    |      3      |
  | Beverage   | juice | mirinda | almond-milk |

Lv2-1x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the pet owners are arranged in a row, and there are 3 different pets: cat, frog, and hedgehog.

2. From the second clue, we know that the owner of the cat is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This means that the order of the pets cannot be H-C-F (Hedgehog, Cat, Frog) because the cat would be on the left of the hedgehog. So, the possible orders are F-C-H or C-F-H.

3. From the first clue, we know that the owner of the cat is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog. This means that the owner of the cat cannot be the first or the last.

4. If the order was F-C-H, the owner of the cat would be the second, which is consistent with the first clue. However, the first pet (frog) would be the owner of the first position, which contradicts the second clue that the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.

5. Therefore, the only possible order is C-F-H. This means the owner of the cat is in the second position, the owner of the frog is in the first position, and the owner of the hedgehog is in the third position.

The final solution table is:

  |       |    1     |  2  |  3   |
| Pet   | Froggie  | Cat  | Hedgehog |
#############

So, the final arrangement is Froggie (Frog), Cat, Hedgehog."
Lv2-1x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. This means that Drawing cannot be in column 3, so it must be either in column 1 or 2.

2. Now, let's consider the second condition: the person who's hobby is gardening is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is drawing. This means that Gardening cannot be in column 1, as there is no hobby to its left. So, Gardening must be in column 2.

3. Since Gardening is in column 2, Drawing must be in column 1, as per the first condition.

4. Now, we know that Drawing is in column 1 and Gardening is in column 2. The only hobby left is Reading. Reading must be in column 3, as it is the only option left.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| Drawing   | Gardening | Reading |

Lv2-1x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different music genres: country, rock, and techno. Let's label them as A, B, and C respectively.

2. From the first rule, we know that the fan of techno (C) is between the fan of country (A) and the fan of rock (B). This means that the arrangement can only be ABC, ACB, or CAB.

3. From the second rule, we know that the fan of techno (C) is on the left of the fan of rock (B). This means that the arrangement cannot be ACB or CAB. So, the only possible arrangement is ABC.

The final solution table is:

  |               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | Country | Rock   | Techno|
#############

So, the final solution is Country, Rock, and Techno in that order."
Lv2-1x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the ferret. This means that the order of the pets cannot be: Rabbit, Bird, Ferret or Ferret, Bird, Rabbit. So, the possible orders are: Bird, Rabbit, Ferret or Ferret, Rabbit, Bird.

2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. This means that the order cannot be: Bird, Rabbit, Ferret. So, the possible order is: Ferret, Rabbit, Bird or Rabbit, Ferret, Bird.

3. Since there are only 3 pets and we have 3 places in the table, each pet must occupy a different place. So, the order cannot be: Ferret, Rabbit, Bird (because the ferret and rabbit are already in the first two places). Therefore, the final order is: Rabbit, Ferret, Bird.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|   1    |   2    |  3   |
| Pet    |       |      |
#############
| Rabbit | Ferret| Bird |"
