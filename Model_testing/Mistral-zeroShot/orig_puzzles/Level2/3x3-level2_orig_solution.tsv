Lv2-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating raspberry is driving the train. Let's place the raspberry eater in the 'Train' row and '3' column.

   |             |     1     |    2    |   3   |
   | Food        |           |         |       |
   | Pet         |           |         |       |
   | Transport   |           |         | Raspberry (Train) |

2. The owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry (Train) and the person eating apple. Since the raspberry eater is in the '3' column, the cat owner must be in either the '1' or '2' column. If the cat owner were in the '1' column, the apple eater would have to be in the '3' column, but that would mean the cat owner is not between the raspberry eater and the apple eater. So, the cat owner must be in the '2' column. Let's place the cat owner in the '2' row and 'Pet' column.

   |             |     1     |    2    |   3   |
   | Food        |           | Cat     | Raspberry (Train) |
   | Pet         |           |         |         |
   | Transport   |           |         |         |

3. The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard owner is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the car driver yet. Let's continue with the next clue.

4. The owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating apple. Since the cat owner is in the '2' row, the apple eater must be in the '1' row. Let's place the apple eater in the '1' row and 'Food' column.

   |             | Apple    |    2    |   3   |
   | Food        |         | Cat     | Raspberry (Train) |
   | Pet         |         |         |         |
   | Transport   |         |         |         |

5. Now we can place the lizard owner. Since the lizard owner must be on the left of the car driver (according to the third clue), the lizard owner can only be in the '1' or '2' column. If the lizard owner were in the '1' column, the car driver would have to be in the '3' column, but that would mean the lizard owner is not on the left of the car driver. So, the lizard owner must be in the '2' column. Let's place the lizard owner in the '2' row and 'Pet' column.

   |             | Apple    | Cat     | Lizard |
   | Food        |         |         |        |
   | Pet         |         |         |        |
   | Transport   |         |         | Raspberry (Train) |

6. Now we can place the car driver. Since the car driver is on the right of the lizard owner, the car driver must be in the '3' column. Let's place the car driver in the '3' row and 'Transport' column.

   |             | Apple    | Cat     | Lizard |
   | Food        |         |         |        |
   | Pet         |         |         |        |
   | Transport   | Car     |         | Raspberry (Train) |

7. Finally, we can place the remaining food. Since the apple eater is in the '1' row, the remaining food options (cabbage and apple) can only be in the '2' and '3' columns. Since the raspberry eater is in the '3' column, the remaining food must be in the '2' column. Let's place the remaining food (cabbage) in the '2' row and 'Food' column.

   |             | Apple    | Cabbage | Lizard |
   | Food        |         |         |        |
   | Pet         |         | Cat     |        |
   | Transport   | Car     |         | Raspberry (Train) |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             | Apple    | Cabbage | Lizard |
| Food        |         |         |        |
| Pet         |         | Cat     |        |
| Transport   | Car     |         | Raspberry (Train) |

Lv2-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of chess is the lawyer, we can place the lawyer in the first row, third column (1,3) because there are only three options for each category.

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   |        |             |                 |
   | Hobby      |        |             |                 |
   | Job        |        |             |                 |
   |            | Lawyer |             |                 |

2. Now, the person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the lawyer is already in the third column, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in the second column (1,2). The only beverage left for this person is 7up, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   | 7up   |             |                 |
   | Hobby      |        | Woodworking |                 |
   | Job        |        |             |                 |
   |            | Lawyer |             |                 |

3. The person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up. Since the lawyer is the person drinking 7up, the project-manager must be in the first column (1,1). The only beverage left for the project-manager is tea, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   |  Tea  |  Fanta    | 7up            |
   | Hobby      | Project-Manager | Woodworking |                |
   | Job        |        |             |                 |
   |            | Lawyer  |             |                 |

4. The only job left is musician, so it must be in the third column (1,3). However, we already have the lawyer there. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that the project-manager drinks tea was incorrect. Let's try another beverage for the project-manager:

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   |  Tea  |  Fanta    | 7up            |
   | Hobby      | Project-Manager | Woodworking |                |
   | Job        |        |             | Musician       |
   |            | Lawyer  |             |                |

5. Now, the person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up. This is correct because the project-manager is in the first column (1,1) and the person drinking 7up is in the third column (1,3).

6. The only beverage left for the person with the hobby of woodworking is fanta, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   |  Tea  |  Fanta    | 7up            |
   | Hobby      | Project-Manager | Woodworking |                |
   | Job        |        |             | Musician       |
   |            | Lawyer  | Fanta      |                |

7. The only beverage left for the person in the first column is 7up, so we can fill in the table as follows:

   |            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
   | Beverage   |  Tea  |  Fanta    | 7up            |
   | Hobby      | Project-Manager | Woodworking | Card-games     |
   | Job        | 7up    |             | Musician       |
   |            | Lawyer  | Fanta      |                |

Lv2-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter and the left of the person watching spy movies. So, the person watching disaster movies must be in the first or second column. Since the jobs are different, the firefighter can't be in the first column, so the person watching disaster movies is in the first column, and the firefighter is in the second column.

2. The person watching disaster movies is also the person who's sport is ice-hockey. So, ice-hockey must be in the first row.

3. Now we know that the firefighter is in the second column and the sport of the firefighter can't be ice-hockey (since it's already taken), so the firefighter must be playing parkour.

4. The person watching spy movies is to the right of the firefighter, so they must be in the third column. Since the jobs are different, the mechanic can't be in the third row (since the firefighter is already there), so the mechanic must be in the second row.

5. The person watching spy movies can't be playing ice-hockey (since it's already taken), parkour (since the firefighter is playing that), or sailing (since the mechanic is playing that). So, the person watching spy movies must be playing a new sport, let's call it 'swimming'.

6. Now we know that the mechanic is in the second row and playing a sport other than ice-hockey, parkour, or sailing, so the mechanic must be sailing.

7. The only sport left for the person in the third row is 'sailing'. Since the jobs are different, the designer can't be in the third row (since the mechanic is already there), so the designer must be in the first row.

8. The only movie-genre left for the person in the first row is 'documentary', and the only job left for the person in the first row is 'designer'.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three different movie-genres, music-genres, and means of transport. Let's label them as follows:
   - Movie-Genres: A (Drama), B (Epic), C (Romance)
   - Music-Genres: D (Funk), E (Pop), F (R&B)
   - Transport: G (Helicopter), H (Motorbike), I (Train)

2. From point 1, we know that the person driving the motorbike (H) is on the far right. So, H must be in the rightmost column.

3. The fan of funk (D) is on the left of the person driving the train (I). Since H is on the far right, I must be in the middle column.

4. The person driving the train (I) is between the fan of funk (D) and the person watching drama movies (A). So, D and I are in the middle row, and A is in the leftmost column.

5. The fan of pop (E) is on the right of the person watching epic movies (B). Since A is in the leftmost column and H is in the rightmost column, B must be in the middle column. So, E is in the rightmost row.

6. Now, we know the positions of D, I, A, B, E, and H. The only genre left for the leftmost row is C (Romance). So, the final solution table is:

   |               |      A      |    B   |      C     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Drama      | Epic   | Romance    |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk       |       | R&B        |
   | Transport     | Helicopter | Motorbike| Train   |

   But we still don't know the order of music-genres and transport. Since we don't have any more clues about them, we can't determine the exact order. However, we know that R&B is in the middle column, so it's not Funk or Pop. So, the final solution table with the known information is:

   |               |      A      |    B   |      C     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Drama      | Epic   | Romance    |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk       | R&B    | Pop        |

Lv2-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three people, and they prefer three different music genres (salsa, soul, trance). Let's assign the music genres to the people horizontally, starting from left to right. We'll use S for salsa, T for trance, and O for soul.

   | Music-Genre   | S | T | O |
   |--------------|--|--|--|

2. Next, we know that the owner of the ferret is a fan of soul (O). So, we can place O in the first row, and since there are only three people, we know that the owner of the ferret is the first person.

   | Music-Genre   | O | T | S |
   |--------------|--|--|--|

3. The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since the owner of the ferret is the first person, the person driving the bike must be the second person. Let's assign B for bike.

   | Music-Genre   | O | B | S |
   |--------------|--|--|--|

4. The owner of the ferret is between the owner of the frog and the fan of salsa. Since the owner of the ferret is the first person, the owner of the frog must be the third person. Let's assign F for frog.

   | Music-Genre   | O | B | F |
   |--------------|--|--|--|

5. The fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski. Since the owner of the ferret is the first person and the owner of the frog is the third person, the fan of salsa must be the second person. Let's assign J for jet-ski.

   | Music-Genre   | O | J | F |
   |--------------|--|--|--|

6. The last person is left for the trance fan and the pet. Since the owner of the frog is the third person, the trance fan must be the second pet, which we'll assign as R for rat.

   | Music-Genre   | O | J | F |
   |--------------|--|--|--|
   | Pet           | F | R | ? |

7. The last pet is the ferret. So, the pet table is complete.

   | Pet           | F | R | F |

8. The last means of transport is left. Since the owner of the ferret is on the bike, the person driving the van must be the trance fan, and the person on the jet-ski must be on the jet-ski. So, let's assign V for van.

   | Music-Genre   | O | J | F |
   |--------------|--|--|--|
   | Transport     | B | J | V |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who enjoys reading is not on the leftmost position (since the person watching sports movies is on the left of the reader). So, the hobbies in the first and second columns must be photography and puzzles, respectively.

2. The fan of rock is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. So, the music-genre in the first row must be rock, and the hobby in the third column must be photography.

3. The fan of classical is between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock. Since we already know the positions of rock and photography, the person watching horror movies must be in the second row. So, the movie-genre in the second row is horror.

4. Now, we know that the person watching horror movies is in the second row and the second column must be puzzles (since the reader is not on the leftmost position). So, the movie-genre in the first row must be animation.

5. The remaining music-genre, ambient, must be in the third row since we have already placed rock and classical in the first and second rows, respectively.

6. The person who enjoys reading must be in the third column since the reader is not on the leftmost position and the hobby in the first column is photography.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv2-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres, sports, and means of transport. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. Let's start with the Movie-Genre column. Since we have 3 genres (documentary, fantasy, western), we can fill the first column as follows:
   - First row: Documentary (since it's the first genre, it goes in the first column)
   - Second row: Fantasy (since it's the second genre, it goes in the second column)
   - Third row: Western (since it's the third genre, it goes in the third column)

3. Now let's fill the Sport column. Since we have 3 sports (baseball, sailing, tennis), we can fill the second row as follows:
   - Second row: Tennis (since it's the third sport, it goes in the second row and second column, as it's between Documentary and Fantasy according to rule 1)

4. Now we have two sports left (baseball and sailing). Since the person watching Documentary is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, the person watching baseball must be in the third row and second column. So,
   - Third row: Baseball (since it's the first sport left, it goes in the third row and second column)

5. Now we have one sport left (sailing). Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, the person driving sailing must be in the first row and third column. So,
   - First row: Sailing (since it's the second sport left, it goes in the first row and third column)

6. Now we have one sport left (baseball). Since the person watching western movies is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person who's sport is baseball, the person driving the jet-ski must be in the second row and third column. So,
   - Second row: Jet-ski (since it's the third means of transport left, it goes in the second row and third column)

7. Now we have two means of transport left (skateboard and snowmobile). Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, the person driving the skateboard must be in the first row and second column. So,
   - First row: Skateboard (since it's the first means of transport left, it goes in the first row and second column)

8. Now we have one means of transport left (snowmobile). So,
   - Third row: Snowmobile (since it's the second means of transport left, it goes in the third row and first column)

   | Music-Genre | Indie | | |
   | Sport | | | |

2. From point 1, we know that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the fan of r&b. So, the fan of r&b must be in the second column:

   | Hobby | Magic-Tricks | Card-Games | Gardening |

   | Music-Genre | Indie | | R&B |
   | Sport | | | |

3. From point 2, we know that the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since we already placed the fan of r&b in the second column, the person who's sport is golf must be in the first row:

   | Hobby | Magic-Tricks | Card-Games | Gardening |
   |-------|-------------|------------|-----------|
   | Music-Genre | Indie | Golf | R&B |
   | Sport | Climbing | | Surfing |

4. From point 3, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is between the fan of indie and the person who's sport is climbing.

2. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst. Since the analyst is in the first position, the person driving the ship must be in the third position. So, the second row should be: [bike, scooter, ship].

3. The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle. Since the bartender is in the second position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the third position. So, the third row should be: [chinchilla, hedgehog, pony].

4. The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in the third position, the owner of the pony must be in the second position. So, the third row should be revised to: [pony, chinchilla, hedgehog].

The final solution table is:

  |             |    1    |     2      |    3     |
| Job         | analyst | bartender | manager  |
| Pet         |         |           | chinchilla|
| Transport   |         | bike      | ship     |

And the revised final solution table is:

  |             |    1    |     2      |    3     |
| Job         | analyst | bartender | manager  |
| Pet         |         |           | pony     |
| Transport   |         | bike      | ship     |

So, the final solution is:

  |             |    1    |     2      |    3     |
| Job         | analyst | bartender | manager  |
| Pet         |         |           | pony     |
| Transport   |         | bike      | ship     |

Lv2-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are three people, each with a different nationality, music genre preference, and sport. Let's assign them numbers 1, 2, and 3 for now.

2. From point 1, the Egyptian is the person who plays handball. So, we can assign the Egyptian to the first row (row 1) and handball to the sport column (column 3). Since the Egyptian is the first person, we can assign him number 1. So, the first row and first column will be filled as follows:

   | Nationality   |     1      |       2       |    3     |
   | Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
   | Sport         | Handball    |               |          |

3. The fan of indie is between the Indonesian and the fan of r&b. Since there are only three people, this means that the indie fan must be either person 2 or person 3. If the indie fan were person 2, then the Indonesian would be person 1 and the r&b fan would be person 3. However, this would violate point 4 (the Mexican is on the left of the fan of r&b), as the Mexican is person 1 and the r&b fan would be person 3. Therefore, the indie fan must be person 3. So, the second row and first column will be filled as follows:

   | Nationality   |     1      |       2       |    3     |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      |               | R&B     |
   | Sport         | Handball    |               |          |

4. Now we know that the Indonesian is person 2. So, the third row and first column will be filled as follows:

   | Nationality   |     1      |       2       |    3     |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      | Indonesian   | R&B     |
   | Sport         | Handball    |               |          |

5. The person who plays handball is on the right of the person who plays skateboarding. Since we already know that the Egyptian (person 1) plays handball, the person who plays skateboarding must be person 2 (Indonesian). So, the sport column will be filled as follows:

   | Nationality   |     1      |       2       |    3     |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      | Indonesian   | R&B     |
   | Sport         | Handball    | Skateboarding | Soccer  |

6. The Mexican is on the left of the fan of r&b. Since we already know that the Mexican is person 1 and the r&b fan is person 3, the nationality column will be filled as follows:

   | Nationality   | Egyptian   | Indonesian   | Mexican  |
   | Music-Genre   | Indie      |               | R&B     |
   | Sport         | Handball    | Skateboarding | Soccer  |

7. Finally, we need to fill the music-genre column. Since we know that the indie fan is person 3, the jazz fan must be person 2 (Indonesian) and the r&b fan must be person 1 (Egyptian). So, the final solution table is:

  #############
   | Nationality   | Egyptian   | Indonesian   | Mexican  |
   | Music-Genre   | R&B        | Indie        | Jazz    |
   | Sport         | Handball    | Skateboarding | Soccer  |
