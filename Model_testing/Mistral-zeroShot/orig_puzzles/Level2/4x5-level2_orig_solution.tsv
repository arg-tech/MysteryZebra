Lv2-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 5 people and 5 items for each category, we can assign each item to a person in a row. Let's start with beverages.

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |
   | tea      |            |            |     |

2. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking coffee is the same person, so we can fill that in:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |
   | tea      |            |            |     |

3. From rule 6, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking coffee. So, we can swap their positions:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | tea      |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | 7up     |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

4. From rule 10, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the lizard. So, we can place 7up on the first position:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     |            |            | lizard |
   | tea      |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

5. From rule 11, the person drinking tea is between the chinese and the person watching zombie movies. Since there are only 4 people left, the person watching zombie movies must be on the far left, so we can place them there:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     |            | lizard |
   | tea      |            | chinese    |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

6. From rule 3, the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the owner of the bird. So, the owner of the bird must be on the second position:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | bird    |            |            |     |
   | tea      |            |            | lizard |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

7. From rule 5, the owner of the bird is the person watching crime movies. So, we can place crime movies in the second position:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |
   | tea      |            |            | lizard |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

8. From rule 1, there are 5 different movie-genres, so we can fill in the remaining genres:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |
   | family  |            |            |     |
   | satire  |            |            |     |
   | western  |            |            | lizard |
   | tea      |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | almond-milk |            |            |     |
   | lemonade |            |            |     |

9. From rule 8, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since there are only 2 people left, the owner of the rabbit must be on the second to last position:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |
   | family  |            |            |     |
   | satire  |            |            |     |
   | western  |            |            | lizard |
   | tea      |            |            |     |
   | coffee   |            |            |     |
   | rabbit   |            |            | lemonade |

10. From rule 9, the person drinking lemonade is on the far right. So, we have the correct order of pets: bird, lizard, rabbit.

11. From rule 7, the british is on the left of the egyptian. Since there are only 2 nationalities left, the egyptian must be on the last position:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |

   | rabbit   |            | british    | lemonade |
   |          | egyptian   |            |       |

12. From rule 12, the malaysian is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since there is only 1 person left, the person watching family movies must be malaysian:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |
   | family  | malaysian  |            |     |

   | egyptian |            |            |       |

13. From rule 13, the turkish is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since there is only 1 person left, the person drinking coffee must be turkish:

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet |
   |---------|------------|------------|-----|
   | 7up     | zombie     | chinese    |     |
   | crime   |            |            | bird |

Lv2-4x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the skateboard driver is in the middle, we know that positions 2, 3, and 4 are occupied by others.

2. Let's assign hobbies to the first two positions (1 and 2). Since the techno fan is on the left of the gardener, we can't place the techno fan in position 1 because the gardener must be in position 3 or 5. So, let's place the techno fan in position 2. The gardener can't be in position 1, so it must be one of the remaining hobbies (gardening, hiking, reading, skydiving, writing). Let's place gardening in position 1 for now.

3. Now, we know that the hiking person is on the right of the skateboard driver, so the hiking person must be in position 4.

4. The hobby of the person in position 1 (gardening) is on the right of the Dutch, so the Dutch can't be in position 1. Let's place the Dutch in position 5.

5. The quad-bike driver is between the Chinese and the techno fan. Since the techno fan is in position 2, the quad-bike driver can't be in position 1 or 3. The Chinese can't be in position 5 because the Dutch is there. So, the Chinese must be in position 3, and the quad-bike driver can be in position 4.

6. The scooter driver is the person who's hobby is hiking (position 4), so the scooter driver can't be in any other position.

7. The fan of country is on the left of the helicopter driver. Since the Dutch is in position 5, the helicopter driver can't be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the helicopter driver must be in position 3. The fan of country can be in any of the remaining positions (1, 2, 4, 5). Let's place the fan of country in position 1 for now.

8. The indian is the fan of r&b and is on the right of the hiking person (position 4). The indian is also the person who's hobby is reading, so the indian can't be in position 1, 2, or 5. The indian can't be in position 3 because the helicopter driver is there. So, the indian must be in position 4.

9. Since the indian is the fan of r&b and is in position 4, the fan of d&b must be in position 1 (since the fan of country is there).

10. The fan of disco is on the right of the fan of d&b (position 1), so the fan of disco can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the fan of disco in position 5 for now.

11. The Spanish can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4 because they are all occupied. So, the Spanish must be in position 5.

12. The quad-bike driver is on the right of the Spanish (position 5), so the quad-bike driver can't be in position 4. The quad-bike driver is also on the right of the indian (position 4), so the quad-bike driver must be in position 3.

13. The fan of disco is in position 5, and the Spanish is on the left of the fan of disco. So, the Spanish must be in position 2.

14. The fan of d&b is in position 1, and the fan of disco is on the right of the fan of d&b. So, the fan of disco must be in position 3.

15. The helicopter driver is in position 3, and the fan of country is on the left of the helicopter driver. So, the fan of country must be in position 2.

16. The skateboard driver is in the middle (position 4), and the hiking person is on the right of the skateboard driver. So, the hiking person must be in position 5.

17. The Dutch is in position 5, and the indian is on the right of the hiking person. So, the indian must be in position 3.

18. The quad-bike driver is in position 3, and the Chinese is on the left of the quad-bike driver. So, the Chinese must be in position 2.

19. The gardener is in position 1, and the techno fan is on the left of the gardener. So, the techno fan must be in position 2.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv2-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and sports are in different columns and there are 5 unique items in each column.

2. From rule 9, the fan of metal is on the far left. So, let's place Metal in the first position of the Music-Genre column.

3. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we don't know the position of volleyball yet, let's place Puzzles in the last position of the Hobby column for now.

4. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since we don't know the position of Reggae yet, let's place Rock-climbing in the second last position of the Hobby column for now.

5. From rule 13, the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person watching superhero movies and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we know the position of Puzzles (last position), let's place Volleyball in the position before Puzzles in the Sport column.

6. From rule 10, the person who's sport is badminton is the person watching martial-arts movies. Since we don't know the position of Martial-arts yet, let's place Badminton in the first position of the Sport column for now.

7. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since we don't know the position of Basketball yet, let's place Singing in the last position of the Hobby column for now.

8. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since we know that Metal is on the far left, let's place Filmmaking in the second position of the Hobby column and Ambient in the third position of the Music-Genre column.

9. From rule 3, the fan of pop is in the middle. Since we know that Metal is on the far left and Filmmaking is second, let's place Pop in the third position of the Hobby column.

10. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is singing is the fan of gospel. Since we know that Singing is in the last position of the Hobby column, let's place Gospel in the last position of the Music-Genre column.

11. From rule 7, the fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since we know that Metal is on the far left and Filmmaking is second, let's place Reggae in the second position of the Music-Genre column and Rowing in the fourth position of the Sport column.

12. From rule 8, the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since we don't know the position of Documentary yet, let's place Adventure in the fifth position of the Movie-Genre column for now.

13. Now, we have placed 9 items (5 hobbies, 3 music-genres, and 1 sport). We have 2 rules left to apply:
   - the person who's sport is tennis is in the middle
   - the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies

14. Since Tennis is in the middle of the Sport column and we have already placed 4 items, let's place Tennis in the third position of the Sport column.

15. Now, the only remaining item is Documentary. Since Adventure is on the right and we have already placed 4 items, let's place Documentary in the fourth position of the Movie-Genre column.

16. Finally, let's check the consistency of the table with the given rules:
    - The person who's hobby is singing is the fan of gospel (correct)
    - The person who's sport is tennis is in the middle (correct)
    - The fan of pop is in the middle (correct)

    - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the fan of reggae (correct)
    - The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person watching superhero movies and the person who's hobby is puzzles (correct)

However, this table does not satisfy all the given rules."
Lv2-4x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the Egyptian is on the far left, so let's place the Egyptian in the first column under Nationality.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

2. The fan of funk is on the far left, so it must be in the first row under Music-Genre. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is the fan of funk (from point 8), we can place Woodworking in the first row under Hobby.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

3. The person eating onion is on the left of the person eating artichoke (from point 3), so let's place Onion in the second column under Food and Artichoke in the third column.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

4. The fan of rock is in the middle (from point 9), so it must be in the third row under Music-Genre. Since the fan of rock is on the right of the Indonesian (from point 6), let's place Indonesian in the fourth column under Nationality and Rock in the third row under Music-Genre.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

5. The fan of reggae is the British (from point 10), so let's place British in the fifth column under Nationality and Reggae in the fourth row under Music-Genre.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

6. The person eating onion is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing (from point 5), so let's place Singing in the second row under Hobby. Since the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person eating papaya (from point 7), let's place Papaya in the second column under Food.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

7. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing (from point 11), so let's place Skydiving in the third row under Hobby.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

8. The person eating tomato is between the fan of reggae and the person eating tomato (from point 4), so let's place Tomato in the fourth column under Food.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

9. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the fan of funk (from point 8), so we already have the correct arrangement for Hobby and Music-Genre.

10. The only remaining food is watermelon, so let's place it in the fifth column under Food.

   |               |      1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |

Lv2-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the names of the beverages, food, jobs, and sports, so we can fill in the column names.

3. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the dancer. Let's place the dancer in the first position and parkour in the second position.

4. From rule 2, the person eating orange is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since we've placed parkour and dancer, let's place climbing in the third position. This means orange should be in the second-to-last position (position 4).

5. From rule 3, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we've placed parkour and climbing, let's place volleyball in the fifth position. This means mirinda should be in the last position (position 5).

6. From rule 6, the person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating orange. Since we've placed orange in position 4, let's place milk in position 3.

7. From rule 7, the person drinking milk is on the left of the lawyer. Since we've placed milk in position 3, the lawyer must be in position 2.

8. From rule 8, the writer is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since we've placed volleyball in position 5, skateboarding must be in position 1. This means the writer is in position 6.

9. From rule 9, the person drinking juice is on the far right. Since we've placed mirinda in position 5, juice must be in position 4.

10. From rule 10, the person drinking juice is on the right of the dancer. Since we've placed the dancer in position 1 and juice in position 4, this rule is satisfied.

11. From rule 11, the person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating lettuce. Since we haven't placed apricot yet, let's place it in the first position. This means lettuce should be in the second position.

12. From rule 12, the social-worker is on the left of the dancer. Since we've placed the dancer in position 1 and apricot in position 1, the social-worker must be in position 0 (before position 1).

13. From rule 13, the person eating lettuce is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we've placed lettuce in position 2 and haven't placed almond-milk yet, let's place almond-milk in position 0 (before position 1).

Now, let's arrange the food, beverages, jobs, and sports according to the positions we've determined:

|            | 0       |     1      |       2       |       3       |    4     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk |            |               |               |     juice     |
| Food       | apricot | lettuce   |               |               | watermelon |
| Job        | social-worker | dancer   | lawyer       | manager     | writer     |
| Sport      |            | parkour  | climbing     | volleyball  | skateboarding |

However, we still need to determine the positions for broccoli and orange. Since we know their positions are to the left of climbing and to the right of apricot, we can place broccot in position 0 (before apricot) and orange in position 2 (before climbing).

|            | 0       |     1      |       2       |       3       |    4     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk |            |               |               |     juice     |
| Food       | apricot | broccoli  | lettuce   | orange     | watermelon |
| Job        | social-worker | dancer   | lawyer       | manager     | writer     |
| Sport      |            | parkour  | climbing     | volleyball  | skateboarding |

Now, we have a complete table that satisfies all the given rules:

#############
|            | 0       |     1      |       2       |       3       |    4     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk |            |               |               |     juice     |
| Food       | apricot | broccoli  | lettuce   | orange     | watermelon |
| Job        | social-worker | dancer   | lawyer       | manager     | writer     |
| Sport      |            | parkour  | climbing     | volleyball  | skateboarding |

Lv2-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching family movies is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Let's place the person drinking fanta (F) in the first position and the person watching family movies (FAM) in the second position.

   |         |           |           |       |

2. The person who's sport is rowing (ROW) is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since the Australian (AUS) is on the far right, and the person watching sports movies (SPORT) is on the right of the French (FRA), the rower (ROW) must be the French. Let's place FRA in the third position and ROW in the fourth position.

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Sport |
   |----------|------------|-----------|-------|
   | Fanta    |            | FRA       | ROW   |

   |         |           |           |       |

4. The person drinking sprite (SPR) is on the right of the French. Since FRA is already in the third position, SPR must be in the fourth position.

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Sport |
   |----------|------------|-----------|-------|
   | Fanta    |            | FRA       | ROW   |

   |         |           |           |       |

5. The person watching sports movies (SPORT) is on the right of the French. Since FRA is already in the third position, SPORT must be in the fourth position. But we already placed SPR there. This is a contradiction, so let's swap SPR and SPORT.

   | Beverage | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Sport |

6. The person drinking water (WAT) is between the person watching zombie movies (ZOMB) and the person who's sport is baseball (BASE). Let's place ZOMB in the second position and BASE in the fourth position.

7. The person watching zombie movies (ZOMB) is on the far left. This is already satisfied.

9. The person watching sports movies (SPORT) is on the right of the French (FRA). This is already satisfied.

10. The person who's sport is skiing (SKI) is on the far right. Since AUS is already in the fifth position, SKI must be in the sixth position. But we already placed BASE there. This is a contradiction, so let's swap SKI and AUS.

11. The person watching thriller movies (THR) is between the person watching zombie movies (ZOMB) and the person who's sport is baseball (BASE). Since ZOMB is already in the second position and BASE is already in the sixth position, THR must be in the third position.

Lv2-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the ship is on the far left (2) and the person with the hobby of photography is to the right of the person driving the ship (1), the person with the hobby of photography cannot be in the first position.

2. Let's assume the hobby of the first person is 'A'. Since the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller (5), the person driving the skateboard cannot be in the first position. So, 'A' cannot be a hobby that uses a skateboard.

3. Since the owner of the rat is the person driving the roller (3), the hobby of the first person cannot be a hobby that involves a pet other than a rat, dog, horse, pony, or none.

4. Since the owner of the horse is between the person with the hobby of magic-tricks and the Egyptian (4), the hobby of the first person cannot be magic-tricks.

5. Since the person with the hobby of skydiving is in the middle (6), the hobby of the first person cannot be skydiving.

6. Since the turkish is on the right of the colombian (7) and the mexican is on the far right (8), the nationality of the first person cannot be colombian or mexican.

7. Since the owner of the pony is the turkish (9) and the owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian (11), the nationality of the first person cannot be turkish.

8. Since the owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi (10) and the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing (12), the hobby of the first person cannot be fishing.

9. Now, the only remaining hobbies for the first person are collecting, fishing, magic-tricks, photography, and skydiving. Since we've already ruled out all of these, the first person cannot have a hobby.

10. Now let's fill in the nationality of the first person. Since the first person cannot have a hobby, the nationality of the second person must be colombian (as the mexican is on the far right and the turkish is on the right of the colombian).

11. The hobby of the second person cannot be skydiving (as the person with the hobby of skydiving is in the middle), so the hobby of the second person is either collecting, fishing, magic-tricks, photography, or none. Since the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing (12), the hobby of the second person cannot be fishing.

12. Since the owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican (13), the nationality of the third person must be mexican.

13. Since the owner of the pony is the turkish (9) and the owner of the pony is on the right of the colombian (11), the nationality of the fourth person must be turkish.

14. Since the fourth person is turkish, the hobby of the fourth person cannot be skydiving (as the person with the hobby of skydiving is in the middle). So, the hobby of the fourth person is either collecting, fishing, magic-tricks, photography, or none. Since the owner of the horse is between the person with the hobby of magic-tricks and the Egyptian (4), the hobby of the fourth person cannot be magic-tricks.

15. Since the person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography (1), the person driving the ship cannot be the fourth person (as the fourth person is turkish and the nationality of the person driving the ship is not given). So, the person driving the ship is either the second or the fifth person.

16. Since the owner of the rat is the person driving the roller (3), the person driving the roller cannot be the fourth person (as the fourth person is turkish and the nationality of the person driving the roller is not given). So, the person driving the roller is either the second or the fifth person.

17. Since the owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican (13), the person driving the taxi cannot be the third person (as the third person is mexican). So, the person driving the taxi is either the second or the fifth person.

18. Since the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the roller (5), the person driving the skateboard cannot be the fifth person (as the fifth person is driving the taxi). So, the person driving the skateboard is the second person.

19. Since the person driving the skateboard is the second person, the person driving the roller is the fifth person.

20. Since the person driving the roller is the fifth person, the person driving the taxi is the second person.

21. Since the person driving the taxi is the second person, the person driving the ship is the fifth person.

22. Since the person driving the ship is the fifth person, the person with the hobby of photography must be the fourth person.

23. Since the person with the hobby of photography is the fourth person, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be the third person.

24. Since the person with the hobby of skydiving is the third person, the person with the hobby of magic-tricks must be the second person.

25. Since the person with the hobby of magic-tricks is the second person, the person with the hobby of collecting must be the first person.

26. Since the person with the hobby of collecting is the first person, the person with the hobby of fishing must be the third person.

27. Since the person with the hobby of fishing is the third person, the person with the hobby of photography must be the fourth person.

Now, let's fill in the pets:

1. Since the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing (12), the pet of the third person is a dog.

2. Since the owner of the horse is on the left of the mexican (13), the pet of the second person is a horse.

3. Since the owner of the rat is the person driving the roller (3), the pet of the fifth person is a rat.

4. Since the owner of the pony is the turkish (9), the pet of the fourth person is a pony.

Now, let's fill in the nationalities:

1. Since the nationality of the second person is colombian (as the mexican is on the far right and the turkish is on the right of the colombian), the nationality of the first person is Egyptian.

Now, let's fill in the means of transport:

1. Since the person driving the ship is the fifth person, the means of transport of the fifth person is a ship.

2. Since the person driving the skateboard is the second person, the means of transport of the second person is a skateboard.

3. Since the person driving the roller is the fifth person, the means of transport of the fifth person is a roller.

4. Since the person driving the taxi is the second person, the means of transport of the second person is a taxi.

Lv2-4x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Polish is in the middle, we can place them in the 3rd position.

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the Indian. Since the Polish is in the 3rd position, the Indian must be in the 2nd position. So, woodworking is in the 4th position.

3. The fan of house is on the far right. Since we know the positions of Polish, Indian, and woodworking, house must be in the 5th position.

4. The Italian watches documentary movies. Since the Italian cannot be in the 1st position (because of house), the Italian must be in the 1st position, and documentary is in the 6th position.

5. The fan of r&b is on the right of the Italian. Since r&b cannot be in the 5th position (because of house), r&b must be in the 2nd position.

6. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the Polish. Since drama cannot be in the 5th position (because of house), drama must be in the 4th position.

7. The Italian is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the Italian is in the 1st position, skydiving must be in the 5th position.

8. The person watching epic movies is the fan of dubstep. Since epic cannot be in the 6th position (because of documentary), epic must be in the 3rd position. Dubstep is in the 1st position.

9. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far left. So, sudoku is in the 1st position.

10. The fan of rock is on the left of the French. Since the French cannot be in the 1st position (because of sudoku), the French must be in the 2nd position. So, rock is in the 5th position.

11. The fan of r&b is between the person watching epic movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since r&b is in the 2nd position and epic is in the 3rd position, the hobby of the person between them must be camping. So, camping is in the 4th position.

12. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Since drama is in the 4th position, romance is in the 5th position.

13. The person who's hobby is camping is on the far right. Since all other hobbies are already placed, camping must be in the 5th position.

The final table is:

French       |  Italian |  Polish     |        |         |

Now, let's fill in the missing movie-genres and nationalities:

```
############# | R&B     |  Woodworking|  Drama  |  Camping|
Documentary  |         |             | Romance |         |

French       |  Italian |  Polish     |        |         |
```

Since the fan of trance is not specified, we can't determine the music-genre for the person with hobby woodworking. However, we can fill in the missing movie-genres and nationalities:

```
############# | R&B     |  Woodworking|  Drama  |  Camping|
Documentary  |         | Trance     | Romance |         |

French       |  Italian |  Polish     |        |         |
```

Now, we know that the person watching epic movies is the fan of dubstep. Since epic is in the 3rd position, the person with hobby woodworking must have trance as their music-genre.

```
############# | R&B     |  Woodworking|  Drama  |  Camping|
Documentary  |         | Trance     | Romance |         |

French       |  Italian |  Polish     |        |         |
```

Finally, we can fill in the missing music-genre for the person with hobby woodworking:

```
############# | R&B     |  House      |  Drama  |  Camping|
Documentary  |         | Trance     | Romance |         |

The final table is:

6. The person drinking tea is between the owner of the goldfish and the person driving the car (from rule 8).

7. The owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the bird (from rule 9), so the frog owner must be in the first or second column. Since the first column is occupied by water, the frog owner must be in the second column. Let's place the frog in the second column.

| Beverage |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |

Lv2-4x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the bartender is between the lizard owner and the chef. Let's place the bartender (B) in the 3rd position. Since the lizard owner (L) is on the left of the bartender, L should be in the 2nd position. The chef (C) is on the right of the bartender, so C should be in the 4th position.

2. The person driving the trike (T) is on the right of the person driving the van (V). Since the Turkish (TU) is on the right of the van driver, the van driver should be in the 5th position. So, the trike driver is in the 3rd position.

3. The Turkish is on the right of the van driver, so TU is in the 6th position.

4. The airplane driver (A) is in the middle, so A is in the 3rd position.

5. The dancer (D) is the Dutch, and the Dutch is driving the snowmobile (SM). So, D is in the 2nd position, and SM is in the 4th position.

6. The argentine (AR) is between the hedgehog owner (H) and the manager (M). Since the bartender is on the right of the hedgehog owner, the hedgehog owner should be in the 1st position. The manager is on the left of the argentine, so M is in the 5th position. So, AR is in the 2nd and H is in the 1st position.

7. The Australian (AU) is on the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in the 2nd position, the Australian should be in the 4th position.

8. The dancer is on the left of the bartender, so D is in the 1st position, and B is in the 3rd position.

9. The owner of the cat (CAT) is on the far right, so CAT is in the 5th position.

10. The owner of the rabbit (R) is on the right of the airplane driver. Since A is in the 3rd position, R should be in the 4th position.

11. The only remaining position for the manager (M) is the 5th position.

12. The only remaining pet is the dog. Since all other positions are occupied, the dog owner should be in the 1st position.

Final solution table:

| Transport     |           | Snowmobile| Trike    | Van      | Airplane|

Now, let's fill in the missing pets and nationalities:

|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |    5    |
| Job           | Dog       | Dancer    | Bartender| Chef     | Manager |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Dutch     |          |          | Turkish |
| Pet           | Cat       |           |          | Lizard   | Rabbit  |
| Transport     |           | Snowmobile| Trike    | Van      | Airplane|

Since we don't have specific information about the pets, we can't fill in the pet column with certainty. However, we know that the dog is in the 1st position, the cat is in the 5th position, and the lizard is between the bartender and the chef. The remaining pet, the hedgehog, should be in one of the remaining positions.
