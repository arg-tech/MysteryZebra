2. Let's move on to the pets. The owner of the chinchilla drinks sprite (12), and the owner of the bird is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing (17). The owner of the pony is the person sailing (27). The owner of the horse is the Nigerian (20), so the goat owner cannot be the owner of the pony or horse. The goat owner is also not the owner of the bird (17) or chinchilla (12). So, the goat owner must be the Australian.

3. Now let's place the sports. The person watching sports movies is the person drinking lemonade (19), and the person who's sport is badminton is on the far left or far right (10). The person driving the jet-ski is the person watching western movies (6, 25), so the person watching western movies cannot be the person watching sports movies.

The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the goat owner (1, 4, and 14), and the goat owner is the Australian (2). The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk (16), and the person watching comedy movies is also on the left of the person watching fantasy movies (22). So, the person watching fantasy movies must be on the far left, and the person watching comedy movies must be on the far right. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Australian (1), so the person watching western movies must be on the far right. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies (22), so the person watching sports movies must be on the far left. The person watching comedy movies is on the far right, so the person watching fantasy movies must be in the second position. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the Australian (1), so the person watching western movies must be in the third position. The person watching sports movies is on the far left, so it must be in the first position.

4. Now let's place the music genres. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (18), and the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the Spanish (18 and 25 help us place the helicopter driver). The fan of pop is on the left or right of the fan of reggae (29), and the person watching western movies is the fan of reggae (2).

The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (18), and the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the Spanish (18 and 25 help us place the helicopter driver), so the fan of hip-hop must be in the fourth position. The fan of soul is the person drinking soy-milk (5), and the fan of soul is on the left of the person who's sport is handball (11), so the person who's sport is handball must be in the fifth position. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the owner of the horse (9), and the owner of the horse is the Nigerian (20), so the fan of salsa must be in the sixth position.

5. Finally, let's place the beverages. The person drinking milk is on the left of the Nigerian (23), and the person drinking sprite is the owner of the chinchilla (12). The person drinking lemonade is the person watching sports movies (19), and the person drinking tea is the Colombian (21). The person drinking soy-milk is the fan of soul (5), and the person drinking 7up, lemonade, milk, sprite, and tea are already placed. So, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the third position. The person drinking milk is on the left of the Nigerian (23), so the person drinking 7up must be in the first position. The person drinking lemonade is the person watching sports movies (19), so the person drinking sprite must be in the second position.

Lv3-7x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category and person:

|               | A | B | C | D | E | F |
| Beverage      |    |   |   |   |   |   |
| Food          |  1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| Hobby         |  7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12 |
| Job           | 13 | 14| 15| 16| 17| 18 |
| Movie-Genre   | 19 | 20| 21| 22| 23| 24 |
| Nationality   | 25 | 26| 27| 28| 29| 30 |
| Pet           | 31 | 32| 33| 34| 35| 36 |

Now, let's solve the puzzle using the given clues:

1. From clue 1, we know the beverages. Let's fill them in:
   | Beverage      | 7up | coffee | cola | iced-tea | lemonade | soy-milk |

2. From clue 2, we know the person with the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the Turkish (clue 19), the Turkish cannot be in position A. So, let's assume the Turkish is in position F. Now, we can place the chinchilla owner on the right of F, which means the chinchilla owner is in position E.

3. From clue 3, the person with the hobby of baking is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant (position 3). Since the Turkish is in position F and cannot be the baker (clue 14), the baker cannot be in position F. So, let's assume the baker is in position A. Now, we can place the person eating eggplant on the left or right of A, which means the eggplant eater is in position B or D.

4. From clue 4, the person drinking soy-milk is the person eating pomegranate (position 5). So, we can place soy-milk in position 5 and pomegranate eater in position A (since the baker is already there).

5. From clue 5, the owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position F, the rabbit owner can be in position E or F.

6. From clue 6, the owner of the fish is the photographer. So, we can place the photographer in position 28 and the fish owner in position 6 (since the photographer cannot be in position 28).

7. From clue 7, the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person eating nectarine (position 6). So, the crime movie watcher cannot be in position A, B, or F (since the Turkish, rabbit owner, and fish owner are already there). So, let's assume the crime movie watcher is in position C. Now, we can place the nectarine eater on the left of C, which means the nectarine eater is in position D.

8. From clue 8, the person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left. Since the baker is already in position A, the cook cannot be in position A. So, let's assume the cook is in position B.

9. From clue 9, the bartender is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the Turkish is in position F and the cook is in position B, the animation movie watcher cannot be in position F or B. So, let's assume the animation movie watcher is in position E. Now, we can place the bartender on the left of E, which means the bartender is in position D.

10. From clue 10, the person watching western movies is the person drinking iced-tea. Since the Turkish is in position F and the crime movie watcher is in position C, the iced-tea drinker cannot be in position F or C. So, let's assume the iced-tea drinker is in position A. Now, we can place the western movie watcher on the left or right of A, which means the western movie watcher is in position B or D.

11. From clue 11, the person who's hobby is dancing is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking soy-milk.

Lv3-7x6-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. Let's start by placing the nationalities. Since the Italian is the security-guard and the volleyball player, we can place them in the table as follows:

   |               |      1       |       2        |       3       |       4       |    5     |     6      |

Lv3-7x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category and person:

|               |    1     |      2       |       3       |      4       |         5          |      6      |
| Beverage      | A       |     B        |     C         |     D         |      E           |     F       |
| Food          | G       |     H        |     I         |     J         |     K           |     L       |
| Hobby         | M       |     N        |     O         |     P         |     Q           |     R       |
| Job           | S       |     T        |     U         |     V         |     W           |     X       |
| Movie-Genre   | Y       |     Z        |     a         |     b         |     c           |     d       |
| Music-Genre   | e       |     f        |     g         |     h         |     i           |     j       |
| Pet           | p       |     q        |     r         |     s         |     t           |     u       |

Now, let's solve the puzzle using the given clues:

1. From clue 17, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is the mechanic (clue 24), the fish owner must be either 3 or 6. Let's assume the fish owner is 3 (we'll check the other possibility later). This means that the fisherman (mechanic) is 6.

2. From clue 3, the person drinking water is on the left of the fisherman (mechanic). So, water is either 1 or 2. Let's assume water is 1. This means that the person drinking water is the designer (clue 10), so the designer is 1.

3. From clue 23, the person watching sports movies is on the far left. Since the mechanic (fisherman) is watching sports movies (clue 31), he must be in the first position (1). This means that the fish owner cannot be 3, as we assumed earlier, but must be 6.

4. From clue 2, the software-developer is on the left of the fan of blues. Since the designer is the fan of blues (clue 6), the software-developer must be 2.

5. From clue 1, the owner of the mouse is the fan of folk. Since the designer is the fan of folk (clue 1), the mechanic (who is also the mouse owner, as we found earlier) must be the owner of the pony (clue 13). This means that the pony owner cannot be 6, as we assumed earlier, but must be 5.

6. From clue 26, the person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the designer is drinking coffee (clue 1), the watermelon eater cannot be 1. So, the watermelon eater is 6.

7. From clue 28, the person eating pepper is on the right of the person eating strawberry. Since the mechanic (who is also the strawberry eater, as we found earlier) is 1, the pepper eater is 4.

8. From clue 8, the person eating apricot is on the left of the designer. Since the designer is 1, the apricot eater is 2.

9. From clue 9, the person eating corn is on the right of the mechanic (who is also the strawberry eater, as we found earlier). So, the corn eater is 3.

10. From clue 22, the person eating strawberry is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person drinking coffee. Since the mechanic (who is also the strawberry eater, as we found earlier) is 1, the magic-tricks person must be 4, and the coffee drinker must be 3.

11. From clue 29, the person watching epic movies is on the right of the designer. Since the designer is 1, the epic movie watcher is 6.

12. From clue 25, the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since the fish owner is 6, the skydiving person is 5.

13. From clue 18, the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the software-developer is drinking mirinda (clue 2), the bird owner cannot be 2. So, the bird owner is 1.

14. From clue 14, the electrician is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is 5, the electrician is 6.

15. From clue 15, the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the mechanic is watching martial-arts movies (clue 24), the goat owner cannot be 1 or 6. So, the goat owner is 3 or 4. Let's assume the goat owner is 3. This means that the martial-arts movie watcher is 4.

16. From clue 16, the owner of the pony is between the fan of salsa and the electrician. Since the salsa fan is 6 (clue 11) and the electrician is 6 (as we found earlier), the pony owner must be 5.

17. From clue 19, the person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since the salsa fan is 6, the time-travel movie watcher cannot be 6. So, the time-travel movie watcher is 1.

18. From clue 30, the fan of hip-hop is between the owner of the fish and the person watching drama movies. Since the fish owner is 6 and the drama movie watcher is 1 (as we found earlier), the hip-hop fan must be 5.

19. From clue 21, the person drinking 7up is the person watching romance movies. Since the designer is drinking coffee (clue 1), the romance movie watcher cannot be 1. So, the romance movie watcher is 6.

20. From clue 12, the person drinking almond-milk is the fan of indie. Since the indie fan cannot be 1 (as we found earlier), the indie fan is 2.

21. From clue 20, the owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right. Since the designer is on the far left (clue 4), the ferret owner must be 6.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

Lv3-7x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start by placing the people with unique characteristics in their respective positions.

   - The person drinking tea is the dancer (4), so we place 'dancer' in position 4 under 'Beverage'.
   - The fan of reggae is on the far left (5), so we place 'reggae' in position 1 under 'Music-Genre'.
   - The owner of the frog is on the far right (8), so we place 'frog' in position 6 under 'Pet'.
   - The person drinking mirinda is the owner of the rabbit (12), so we place 'rabbit' in position 5 under 'Pet'.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far right (30), so we place 'card-games' in position 6 under 'Hobby'.
   - The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (11), so we can place 'puzzles' in position 3 under 'Hobby'.
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left or far right (14, 16), but it can't be far right because card-games is there (30). So, it must be far left, which means the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the far right (28). So, we place 'filmmaking' in position 6 under 'Hobby'.
   - The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (15), so we can place 'skydiving' in position 2 under 'Hobby'.
   - The person who's hobby is writing is not specified yet, but it must be in position 2 under 'Hobby' because the photographer is on its right (22). So, we place 'writing' in position 2 under 'Hobby'.

2. Now let's place the people with their jobs:

   - The photographer is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (28), so we place 'photographer' in position 6 under 'Job'.
   - The bartender is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (16), so we place 'bartender' in position 5 under 'Job'.
   - The librarian is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (28), so we place 'librarian' in position 6 under 'Job'.
   - The electrician drinks juice (13), so we place 'electrician' in position 3 under 'Job'.
   - The nurse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis (10), but it can't be on the right because the bartender is there (16). So, it must be on the left. The only available position is 1 under 'Job'.
   - The dancer is the person drinking tea (4), so we have already placed it under 'Job'.

3. Now let's place the people with their pets:

   - We have already placed 'frog' (8), 'rabbit' (12), and 'rabbit' (5) under 'Pet'.

   - The owner of the horse is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (28), so we place 'horse' in position 6 under 'Pet'.
   - The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person driving the van (6), so we can place 'goldfish' in position 4 under 'Pet'.
   - The owner of the water is not specified yet, but it must be in position 6 under 'Beverage' because soul is on the right of it (9, 24). So, we place 'water' in position 6 under 'Beverage'.
   - The owner of the juice is the electrician (13), so we place 'juice' in position 3 under 'Beverage'.
   - The owner of the mirinda is the person who's hobby is card-games (30), so we place 'mirinda' in position 6 under 'Beverage'.

4. Now let's place the people with their sports:

   - The person who's sport is rowing is between the dancer and the owner of the horse (3), so we place 'rowing' in position 4 under 'Sport'.
   - The person who's sport is surfing is between the fan of indie and the dancer (20), so we place 'surfing' in position 2 under 'Sport'.
