|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Movie-Genre | Documentary |  |  |  | Western |

2. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies. Since we already placed the western movies on the far right, let's place musical movies to the left of satire movies.

4. The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Since we already placed the documentary movies on the far left, it can only be on the right of satire movies. Let's swap the positions of documentary and satire movies.

Lv3-1x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fisherman is not in the first position (as the architect must be to his right), so the fisherman can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, we know that the fisherman is not in the third position (as the entrepreneur must be to his right), so the fisherman can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the architect can be in any position except the first (as the fisherman is to his right) and the last (as the mechanic is to the right of the entrepreneur, who is to the left of the architect). So, the architect can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

4. If the architect is in position 2, then the fisherman must be in position 3 and the entrepreneur in position 4. But this would mean the mechanic must be in position 1, which is not possible as the architect is to the left of the mechanic (rule 4). So, the architect cannot be in position 2.

5. If the architect is in position 3, then the fisherman must be in position 4 and the entrepreneur in position 5. But this would mean the mechanic must be in position 1, which is not possible as the architect is to the left of the mechanic (rule 4). So, the architect cannot be in position 3.

6. If the architect is in position 4, then the fisherman must be in position 5 and the entrepreneur in position 1. The mechanic can be in any of the remaining positions (2 or 3).

So, the final solution is:

|       |     1     |     2     |     3     |      4       |    5     |

Lv3-1x5-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the fisherman is on the right of the coach, they can't be in the first column (as the coach can't be in the last column due to the security-guard being on the far left or far right). So, the fisherman can only be in columns 2, 3, or 5.

2. If the fisherman is in column 2, the coach must be in column 1. But this would mean the security-guard has to be in column 5, which is not possible because the dancer must be on the left or right of the coach. So, the fisherman can't be in column 2.

3. If the fisherman is in column 3, the coach can be in either column 1 or 2. If the coach is in column 1, the security-guard must be in column 5, which again doesn't work because the dancer must be on the left or right of the coach. So, the coach must be in column 2, and the security-guard can be in column 1. But this leaves column 5 for the dancer, which means the dancer must be on the left of the coach, contradicting the rule that the dancer is on the left or right of the coach. So, the fisherman can't be in column 3 either.

4. If the fisherman is in column 5, the coach can be in either column 1, 2, or 4. If the coach is in column 1, the security-guard must be in column 3, and the dancer can be in column 2. This satisfies all the conditions.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv3-1x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the bus is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column with 'bus'.

|   | Bus |   |      |   |   |
|--|-----|----|------|---|---|

2. The taxi is to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bus is on the far left, the taxi must be in the second column.

|   | Bus | Taxi|      |   |   |
|--|-----|-----|------|---|---|

3. The person driving the helicopter is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the car. Since the bus and taxi are already placed, the helicopter must be in the third column.

|   | Bus | Taxi| Helicopter|   |   |
|--|-----|-----|-----------|---|---|

4. The person driving the car can be either to the left or right of the bus. If the car is to the left of the bus, it would violate rule 3 because the helicopter is already in the third column. So, the car must be on the right of the bus.

|   | Bus | Taxi| Helicopter| Car|   |
|--|-----|-----|-----------|----|---|

5. Now, the only remaining transport is the bike. Since the bus is on the far left, the bike must be in the first column.

| Bike | Bus | Taxi| Helicopter| Car|   |

Lv3-1x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person watching crime movies is in the middle, so they must be in the second position. Let's place crime in position 2.

2. Since crime is in the middle, the person watching sports movies must be on the left or right of crime, but not in the first or last position (as the sports person is to the left of the western person, and we haven't placed western yet). So, sports can only be in position 3 or 5. Let's try sports in position 3 for now.

3. If sports is in position 3, then crime is in the middle, and crime is on the left or right of musical. This means musical can only be in position 1 or 5. But if musical is in position 1, then the person watching horror movies must be in position 2, which contradicts our first placement of crime. So, musical must be in position 5.

4. Now, we know that sports is in position 3, crime in position 2, and musical in position 5. This means the person watching horror movies must be in position 1.

5. The last genre left is western. Since sports is in position 3 and western must be to the left of sports, western can only be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv3-1x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the hamster (P5).
2. We also know that the owner of the hamster is not the first or the last (since there are only 5 pets and the pony is to the left of the hamster). So, the possible positions for the hamster are 2, 3, or 4.
3. The owner of the cat is either to the left or right of the hamster (P3). If the hamster is in position 2, then the cat cannot be in position 1 (since the pony is to the left of the hamster). If the hamster is in position 3, then the cat can be in position 1 or 2. If the hamster is in position 4, then the cat can be in position 1, 2, or 3.
4. The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the goat (P3). This means the horse cannot be in position 5. If the hamster is in position 2, then the horse can be in position 1. If the hamster is in position 3, then the horse can be in position 1 or 2. If the hamster is in position 4, then the horse can be in position 1, 2, or 3.
5. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the horse and the owner of the pony (P4). This means the goat cannot be in position 1 or 5. If the hamster is in position 2, then the goat can be in position 3. If the hamster is in position 3, then the goat can be in position 4. If the hamster is in position 4, then the goat can be in position 5.

Now, let's combine these conditions:

- If the hamster is in position 2, then the possible arrangement is: [Cat, Hamster, Horse, Goat, Pony]
- If the hamster is in position 3, then the possible arrangements are: [Cat, Horse, Hamster, Goat, Pony] or [Cat, Hamster, Goat, Horse, Pony]
- If the hamster is in position 4, then the possible arrangements are: [Cat, Horse, Goat, Hamster, Pony], [Cat, Hamster, Goat, Pony, Horse], or [Horse, Cat, Goat, Hamster, Pony]

Since the hamster must be between the cat and the pony (P3), the only valid arrangement is [Cat, Hamster, Goat, Horse, Pony].

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-1x5-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 5 beverages, and we know the positions of sprite and juice. Let's place sprite on the far left (position 1) and juice on the far right (position 5).

   | Beverage   | sprite|       |      |         |     juice|

2. Now we know that the person drinking cola is between mirinda and juice. Since mirinda can't be in position 1 (because sprite is there), and it can't be in position 5 (because juice is there), it must be in position 2 or 3. If it were in position 2, then cola would have to be in position 3, but that would mean there's no room for the person drinking soy-milk. So, mirinda must be in position 3.

   |            |   1   |   2   |  3   |    4    |    5     |

3. Now we know that cola is between mirinda and juice. Since cola can't be in position 1 (because sprite is there), and it can't be in position 5 (because juice is there), it must be in position 2 or 4. If it were in position 2, then there would be no room for soy-milk. So, cola must be in position 4.

   | Beverage   | sprite| cola | mirinda| soy-milk|     juice|

4. Finally, we know that soy-milk must be in position 3, because it can't be in position 1 (because sprite is there), position 2 (because cola is there), or position 5 (because juice is there).

   | Music-Genre   | d&b | pop  | metal|     |       |

2. The fan of dubstep is between the fan of pop and the fan of metal, so dubstep must be either 1 or 3. If it were 1, then the fan of metal would have to be 2, which contradicts the fact that pop is in the middle. So, dubstep must be 3.

   |               |  1  |  2   |  3  |    4    |   5   |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b | pop  | dubstep| metal|       |

3. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of soul. Since d&b is already in the 3rd position, soul must be in the 1st or 2nd position. If soul were in the 1st position, it would be on the left of pop, which contradicts the fact that pop is in the middle. So, soul must be in the 2nd position.

   |               |  1  |  2   |  3  |    4    |   5   |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b | soul | dubstep| metal|       |

   | Music-Genre   | d&b | soul | dubstep|   | metal|

5. Now, the fan of metal is in the 5th position, and the fan of pop is in the middle (2nd position). The only remaining genre is pop, so it must be in the 4th position.

Lv3-1x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the lawyer is in the middle, we know that the jobs to the left and right of the lawyer are different. So, the possible arrangements for the first three jobs (from left to right) are:
   - Freelancer, Lawyer, Scientist/Chef/Social-worker
   - Lawyer, Freelancer, Scientist/Chef/Social-worker
   - Lawyer, Scientist, Freelancer/Chef/Social-worker

2. The freelancer is on the left of the chef. This means that the freelancer cannot be in the middle position (as the lawyer is there), so the first arrangement is not possible.

3. Now, let's consider the second arrangement: Lawyer, Freelancer, Scientist/Chef/Social-worker. Since the freelancer is on the left of the chef, the chef cannot be in the third position. So, the arrangement becomes: Lawyer, Freelancer, Scientist.

4. The scientist is on the left of the social-worker. This means that the scientist cannot be in the first position, so the arrangement becomes: Freelancer, Lawyer, Scientist, Social-worker.

5. However, the puzzle states that the chef is to the left of the freelancer, which contradicts our current arrangement. The only way to resolve this is to swap the positions of the chef and the social-worker, resulting in the final arrangement: Freelancer, Lawyer, Scientist, Chef, Social-worker.

So, the final solution table is:

2. Since the person who plays ice-hockey is to the right of the person who plays cycling, cycling cannot be in the last column. So, cycling can be in columns 1, 2, or 3.

3. Now, the person who plays handball is on the left of the person who plays cycling. If cycling is in column 1, then handball must be in column 2. If cycling is in column 2, then handball must be in column 3. If cycling is in column 3, then handball must be in column 1.

4. The person who plays badminton is on the left or right of the person who plays handball. Since handball is now placed, we know that badminton cannot be in the same column as handball. So, badminton can be in columns 1, 2, 4, or 5 (excluding the column of handball).

5. Since we have placed ice-hockey in the last column, badminton cannot be in the last column either. So, badminton can be in columns 1, 2, or 4.

6. Now, let's place badminton. If badminton is in column 1, then handball must be in column 2 and cycling can be in any of the remaining columns. If badminton is in column 2, then handball must be in column 1 and cycling can be in any of the remaining columns. If badminton is in column 4, then handball must be in column 3 and cycling can be in any of the remaining columns.

7. Let's place cycling. If cycling is in column 1, then the only sport left is tennis for column 2. If cycling is in column 2, then the only sport left for column 1 is badminton, and tennis can be in column 3 or 4. If cycling is in column 3, then the only sport left for column 1 is badminton, and tennis can be in column 2, 4, or 5.

8. Let's place tennis. If cycling is in column 1, then tennis must be in column 2. If cycling is in column 2, then tennis can be in any of the remaining columns. If cycling is in column 3, then tennis can be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5.
