Lv3-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Indian is either on the left or right of the person watching drama movies, we can place the Indian in the second or third column and the drama genre in the second or third row. Let's place the Indian in the second column and drama in the second row for now.

2. The person eating orange is on the far left or far right. Since the Indian is not eating orange (from point 5), the orange must be in the first or third column. Let's place the orange in the third column and the sport of skateboarding (which is on the far right) in the third row.

3. Now, the person watching comedy movies is on the right of the British. Since the British cannot be in the first column (as the Indian is there), the British must be in the second column. The comedy genre must be in the first or third row, but since the Indian is watching drama, comedy cannot be in the second row. So, let's place comedy in the third row. This means the British is in the second row.

4. The person watching comedy movies is the one doing weightlifting. Since weightlifting is in the third row, the British cannot be doing weightlifting. So, the British must be doing tennis (as tennis is the only sport left for the second row).

5. The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Since drama is in the second row, classical must be in the third row.

6. The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since cauliflower must be in the first column (as the Indian and orange are in the second and third columns), cucumber must be in the second column.

7. The fan of funk is on the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic cannot be in the first row (as the British is there), the mechanic must be in the second row. This means funk must be in the first row.

8. The musician is on the far right. Since the Indian, British, and mechanic are taken, the musician must be the one doing skateboarding (as skateboarding is the only sport left for the first column).

9. Now, we have the following table:

|               |      1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | cauliflower  | cucumber     |   orange      |
| Job           |   musician   |   mechanic    |   videographer|
| Movie-Genre   |   comedy     |   drama       |   martial-arts|
| Music-Genre   |   funk       |   classical   |   techno      |
| Nationality   |   british    |   indian      |   russian     |
| Sport         |   skateboarding| tennis        | weightlifting |

10. To find the remaining nationality, we know that the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person eating cucumber. Since cauliflower is in the first column, the russian must be in the first column as well.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of the people who own the horse (1), bird (2 or 3), and the person drinking water (4). Let's place them first:

   | Food    |  | papaya |  |

   | Job     |  |  |  |
   | Music-Genre|  | disco |  |

   | Food    |  | papaya |  |

   | Beverage | juice | water | entrepreneur |
   | Food    |  | papaya |  |
   | Hobby   |  |  |  |
   | Job     | analyst | entrepreneur | videographer |
   | Music-Genre|  | disco |  |
   | Pet     | horse |  |  |

5. The videographer is on the far left (10), so we can place them:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Beverage | juice | water | entrepreneur |
   | Food    |  | papaya |  |
   | Hobby   |  |  |  |
   | Job     | analyst | entrepreneur | videographer |
   | Music-Genre|  | disco |  |
   | Pet     | horse |  |  |

6. The person eating apple is on the left or right of the fan of disco (7), so we can place them:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |

   | Beverage | juice | water | entrepreneur |
   | Food    | apple | papaya |  |
   | Hobby   |  |  |  |

   | Music-Genre|  | disco | classical |
   | Pet     | horse |  |  |

7. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking (8), so we can place them:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |---|---|---|---|
   | Beverage | juice | water | entrepreneur |
   | Food    | apple | papaya |  |
   | Hobby   | reading | baking |  |
   | Job     | analyst | entrepreneur | videographer |

   | Food    | apple | papaya |  |
   | Hobby   | reading | baking | collecting |
   | Job     | analyst | entrepreneur | videographer |
   | Music-Genre|  | disco | classical |
   | Pet     | horse |  |  |

9. The only remaining job is the job of the person drinking almond-milk, which we haven't specified yet. Since the person drinking water is between the videographer and the analyst (5), and the entrepreneur is between the fan of jazz and the person eating papaya (6), the only remaining job is the job of the person drinking almond-milk, which must be between the entrepreneur and the person eating papaya. However, we don't know if it's on the left or right, so we can't determine the exact position of almond-milk.

The final solution table is:

Lv3-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching comedy movies is the one with the hobby of camping. Let's place them in the first row, second column (1,2).

2. From point 3, we know that the person who plays tennis is between the person who snowboards and the person eating artichoke. Since the person watching comedy movies (camping) is already placed, the only possible position for tennis is (1,3). This means the person who snowboards is (1,1) and the person eating artichoke is (1,4).

3. From point 4, we know that the fan of jazz is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since we have already placed the person watching comedy movies (camping), the only possible position for thriller is (2,2). This means the person watching mystery is (2,1) and the person watching mystery is (2,3).

4. From point 5, we know that the owner of the hamster is the person watching comedy movies. This is already placed.

5. From point 6, we know that the person with the hobby of board-games is on the far left. This means the person with the hobby of board-games is (3,1).

6. From point 7, we know that the person eating pepper is on the left of the person who snowboards. Since we have already placed the person who snowboards (1,1), the only possible position for pepper is (3,2).

7. From point 8, we know that the person eating lemon is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is already placed (1,2), the only possible position for lemon is (3,3).

Lv3-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, beverages, and music genres. Let's assign them to the people from left to right.

   - Nationalities: Brazilian (B), Egyptian (E), Turkish (T)
   - Jobs: Coach (C), Software Developer (SD), Teacher (Tch)
   - Hobbies: Puzzles (P), Traveling (Tr), Video-Games (V)
   - Beverages: Almond-Milk (AM), Fanta (F), Juice (J)
   - Music-Genres: Classical (Cl), Dubstep (D), Metal (M)
   - Transport: Boat (Bt), Subway (S), Train (Trn)

2. From rule 11, we know the brazilian is driving the subway (S). So, S = B.

3. From rule 2, we know the person driving the subway is the brazilian, so the brazilian is in the second position (index 1).

4. From rule 10, we know the software-developer is on the right of the person driving the train. Since the brazilian is driving the subway (S), the software-developer (SD) cannot be in the first position (index 0). So, SD must be in the third position (index 2).

5. From rule 9, we know the turkish is between the software-developer and the teacher. So, T must be in the second position (index 1).

6. From rule 12, we know the teacher is on the far left or far right. Since the brazilian (index 1) and the turkish (index 2) are already placed, the teacher (Tch) must be in the first position (index 0) or the last position (index 3).

7. If the teacher is in the first position (index 0), then the hobby of the person in the second position (index 1) must be puzzles (P) because the person drinking fanta (F) is the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 3). But this would mean the person in the third position (index 2) would have to drink almond-milk (AM), which contradicts rule 5 (the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles). So, the teacher cannot be in the first position (index 0).

8. Therefore, the teacher must be in the last position (index 3). This means the hobby of the person in the second position (index 1) must be traveling (Tr).

9. Now, the person in the first position (index 0) must have the hobby of puzzles (P) because the person drinking fanta (F) is the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 3). So, the beverage of the person in the second position (index 1) must be fanta (F).

10. The person in the second position (index 1) cannot drink almond-milk (AM) because the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 5). So, the person in the second position (index 1) must drink juice (J).

11. Now, the person in the third position (index 2) must drink almond-milk (AM).

12. The person in the second position (index 1) cannot have the music genre of metal (M) because the fan of metal is the person driving the boat (rule 7), and the person in the second position (index 1) cannot drive the boat because the boat driver must be on the far right (rule 4) and the person in the second position (index 1) is not the last person (index 3). So, the person in the second position (index 1) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

13. The person in the first position (index 0) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) has dubstep (D) and the person drinking fanta (F) is the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 3), which means the person in the first position (index 0) cannot have the hobby of puzzles (P). So, the person in the first position (index 0) must have the music genre of classical (Cl).

14. The person in the last position (index 3) cannot have the music genre of classical (Cl) because the person in the first position (index 0) has classical (Cl) and the teacher is in the last position (index 3). So, the person in the last position (index 3) must have the music genre of metal (M).

15. Now, the person in the fourth position (index 4) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

16. The person driving the boat (Bt) must be the fan of metal (M). Since the person in the last position (index 3) has metal (M), the person driving the boat (Bt) must be the person in the last position (index 3). But this contradicts rule 4 (the person driving the boat must be on the far right and the person in the last position (index 3) is not the last person). This means the person in the last position (index 3) cannot drive the boat (Bt).

17. The only remaining option for the person driving the boat (Bt) is the person in the second position (index 1). This means the person in the second position (index 1) must have the music genre of metal (M). But this contradicts rule 12 (the person in the second position (index 1) has dubstep (D)). This means the initial assumption that the teacher is in the last position (index 3) is incorrect.

18. The teacher must be in the first position (index 0). This means the hobby of the person in the second position (index 1) must be traveling (Tr).

19. The person in the first position (index 0) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) has traveling (Tr) and the person in the second position (index 1) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) is not the last person (index 3). So, the person in the first position (index 0) must have the music genre of classical (Cl).

20. The person in the second position (index 1) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

21. The person in the third position (index 2) cannot have the music genre of classical (Cl) because the person in the first position (index 0) has classical (Cl). So, the person in the third position (index 2) must have the music genre of metal (M).

22. The person in the fourth position (index 4) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

23. Now, we know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, beverages, music genres, and the positions of the boat driver and the subway driver. We can now find the positions of the remaining people.

   - The person driving the train (Trn) must be the software-developer (SD) because the software-developer is on the right of the person driving the train (rule 10). So, SD is in the fourth position (index 4).

   - The person driving the train (Trn) cannot be the person in the last position (index 3) because the person in the last position (index 3) has metal (M) and the person driving the train (Trn) cannot have the music genre of metal (M) because the person driving the train (Trn) is not the last person (index 3). So, the person driving the train (Trn) must be the person in the second position (index 1). But this contradicts rule 11 (the person driving the subway is the brazilian). This means the initial assumption that the teacher is in the first position (index 0) is incorrect.

24. The teacher must be in the second position (index 1). This means the hobby of the person in the first position (index 0) must be puzzles (P).

25. The person in the first position (index 0) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) has traveling (Tr) and the person in the second position (index 1) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) is not the last person (index 3). So, the person in the first position (index 0) must have the music genre of classical (Cl).

26. The person in the second position (index 1) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

27. The person in the third position (index 2) cannot have the music genre of classical (Cl) because the person in the first position (index 0) has classical (Cl). So, the person in the third position (index 2) must have the music genre of metal (M).

28. The person in the fourth position (index 4) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

29. Now, we know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, beverages, music genres, and the positions of the boat driver and the subway driver. We can now find the positions of the remaining people.

   - The person driving the train (Trn) must be the software-developer (SD) because the software-developer is on the right of the person driving the train (rule 10). So, SD is in the fourth position (index 4).

   - The person driving the subway (S) is the brazilian (B). Since the brazilian (B) is in the second position (index 1), the person driving the boat (Bt) must be the person in the first position (index 0).

   - The person in the first position (index 0) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) has traveling (Tr) and the person in the second position (index 1) cannot have the music genre of dubstep (D) because the person in the second position (index 1) is not the last person (index 3). So, the person in the first position (index 0) must have the music genre of classical (Cl).

   - The person in the second position (index 1) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

   - The person in the third position (index 2) cannot have the music genre of classical (Cl) because the person in the first position (index 0) has classical (Cl). So, the person in the third position (index 2) must have the music genre of metal (M).

   - The person in the fourth position (index 4) must have the music genre of dubstep (D).

30. Now, we know the nationalities, jobs, hobbies, beverages, music genres, and the positions of all the people. We can now find the remaining details.

   - The beverage of the person in the first position (index 0) is almond-milk (AM) because the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 5) and the person in the first position (index 0) has puzzles (P).

   - The beverage of the person in the second position (index 1) is fanta (F) because the person drinking fanta (F) is the person who's hobby is puzzles (rule 3).

   - The beverage of the person in the third position (index 2) is juice (J) because the person drinking juice (J) is on the far right (rule 4).

   - The beverage of the person in the fourth position (index 4) is not specified.

   - The hobby of the person in the fourth position (index 4) is video-games (V) because the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person driving the boat (rule 6) and the person driving the boat (Bt) is in the first position (index 0).

   - The transport of the person in the first position (index 0) is boat (Bt) because the person driving the boat (Bt) is in the first position (index 0).

   - The transport of the person in the second position (index 1) is subway (S) because the person driving the subway (S) is the brazilian (B).

   - The transport of the person in the third position (index 2) is not specified.

   - The transport of the person in the fourth position (index 4) is train (Trn) because the person driving the train (Trn) is the software-developer (SD).

31. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |      2      |         3          |

   | Hobby         | Puzzles    |   Traveling  | Video-Games         |
   | Job           | Teacher    |   Coach     | Software-Developer   |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical  |   Dubstep   | Metal               |

   The person in the fourth position (index 4) is not specified for some details."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the beverages:
   - Let's say iced-tea is in the first column (Column 1)
   - Let's say mirinda is in the second column (Column 2)
   - The remaining beverage, tea, must be in the third column (Column 3)

2. Next, let's assign the hobbies:
   - Since the person reading is not the first person (due to the subway rule), and the person reading is not the third person (due to the biathlon rule), the person reading must be in the second position. So, let's say reading is in Column 2.
   - The person doing magic-tricks must be in the first position (due to the biathlon rule), so magic-tricks is in Column 1.
   - The remaining hobby, rock-climbing, must be in the third column (Column 3)

3. Now, let's assign the jobs:
   - Since the firefighter does swimming (rule 4), the firefighter must be in the third position (Column 3). Let's say the firefighter is a nurse.
   - The bartender cannot be in the first position (due to the country rule), so the bartender must be in the second position (Column 2).
   - The remaining job, which is a firefighter, must be in the first position (Column 1)

4. Now, let's assign the music-genres:
   - Since the person listening to country is not the first person (due to the bartender rule), and the person listening to country is not the third person (due to the surfing rule), the person listening to country must be in the second position (Column 2). So, let's say country is in Column 2.
   - Since the person listening to electronic is on the right of the person drinking tea (rule 3), and the person drinking tea is in Column 3, the person listening to electronic must be in Column 1. So, let's say electronic is in Column 1.
   - The remaining genre, d&b, must be in the third column (Column 3)

5. Now, let's assign the sports:
   - Since the person doing biathlon is on the left of the person doing magic-tricks (rule 9), and the person doing magic-tricks is in Column 1, the person doing biathlon must be in Column 3. So, let's say biathlon is in Column 3.
   - Since the person doing swimming is the firefighter (rule 4), we already know this.
   - The person doing surfing is on the right of the person listening to country (rule 2), and the person listening to country is in Column 2. So, the person doing surfing must be in Column 3. However, we already know that Column 3 is occupied by biathlon and swimming. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

6. Finally, let's assign the transport:
   - Since the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of d&b (rule 7), and the person listening to d&b is in Column 3, the person driving the jet-ski must be in Column 3. So, let's say jet-ski is in Column 3.
   - Since the person driving the subway is on the right of the person reading (rule 1), and the person reading is in Column 2, the person driving the subway must be in Column 3. However, we already know that Column 3 is occupied by biathlon, swimming, and jet-ski. This is another contradiction, indicating an error in the puzzle.
   - The remaining transport, motorbike, must be in the first column (Column 1)

In conclusion, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated, as it leads to contradictions in the assignments of sports and transport."	{}	False	0	False

   - Beverages: F (Fanta), T (Tea), WT (Water)

2. From rule 2, we know that A is British, so A cannot be in the first column.

3. From rule 8, we know that I is on the left of the person drinking water, so I cannot be in the first column.

4. From rule 6, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left of I. Since I cannot be in the first column, the fan of hip-hop must be in the second column. So, HH is in the second row, second column.

5. From rule 10, we know that BK is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since I and A cannot be in the first column, BK must be in the first column. So, BK is in the first row, first column.

6. From rule 3, we know that SK is the person drinking tea. Since we know BK and HH, T must be in the second row, third column (as it cannot be in the first row due to BK and HH). So, T is in the second row, third column.

7. From rule 4, we know that SK is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since BK and HH are already placed, and T is in the second row, third column, the person driving the subway must be in the second row, second column. So, the subway driver is in the second row, second column.

8. From rule 9, we know that the fan of soul is the police officer. Since we know BK, HH, and T, S must be in the third row, first column. So, S is in the third row, first column.

9. From rule 5, we know that SK is the person drinking tea. Since we know S, the police officer, the only beverage left for SK is Fanta. So, F is in the second row, third column.

10. From rule 7, we know that SK is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we know F is in the second row, third column, SK must be in the first row, third column. So, SK is in the first row, third column.

11. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different beverages. Since we have F, T, and WT is left, WT must be in the third row, second column. So, WT is in the third row, second column.

12. From rule 8, we know that I is on the left of the person drinking water. Since we know WT is in the third row, second column, I must be in the third row, first column. So, I is in the third row, first column.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv3-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the Nationality column with American, Colombian, and Nigerian. Let's assume the order is American, Colombian, and Nigerian from left to right.

2. From point 3, the person watching action movies is on the right of the person driving the airplane. So, the person watching action movies must be the Colombian or Nigerian. Since the American is on the left of the Colombian, the action movie fan must be the Nigerian. So, the Movie-Genre for the Nigerian is Action.

3. From point 1, the fan of hip-hop is the person watching action movies, so the Music-Genre for the Nigerian is Hip-hop.

4. From point 2, the owner of the rat is the person eating nectarine. Since the American is not eating nectarine (as we'll see later), the owner of the rat must be the Colombian or the Nigerian. Since the American is on the left of the Colombian, the owner of the rat cannot be the Colombian. So, the owner of the rat is the Nigerian. So, the Pet for the Nigerian is Rat.

5. From point 4, the person eating nectarine is not the American, so the person eating nectarine must be the Colombian or the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is eating nectarine, the person eating blueberry must be the American. So, the Food for the American is Blueberry.

6. From point 5, the person eating blueberry is the American, so the person on the left of the American is the Colombian.

7. From point 6, the Colombian is not watching action movies (as we know the Nigerian is), so the Colombian must be watching sports movies. So, the Movie-Genre for the Colombian is Sports.

8. From point 7, the Colombian is on the left of the person eating blueberry (the American), so the Colombian must be on the far left.

9. From point 8, the Nigerian is on the right of the owner of the rat (as we know the Nigerian is the owner of the rat), so the Nigerian is on the far right.

10. From point 6, the Colombian is on the left of the American, so the Colombian is in the second position.

11. From point 7, the Colombian is watching sports movies, so the person watching action movies (the Nigerian) must be in the third position.

12. From point 4, the Nigerian is the owner of the rat, so the Pet for the Nigerian is Rat.

13. From point 1, the people prefer 3 different music-genres, and we have already filled in Hip-hop and D&B. So, the Music-Genre for the Colombian must be Gospel.

14. From point 9, the American is on the left or right of the nigerian, but we already know the Nigerian is on the far right, so the American must be on the far left.

15. From point 6, the Colombian is on the left of the American, so the Transport for the Colombian must be the airplane (as the American is driving the airplane).

16. From point 13, the Colombian is the fan of Gospel, so the person on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (as we'll see later) must be the fan of D&B.

17. From point 14, the American is on the far left, so the Transport for the American must be the bus (as the airplane is driven by the Colombian).

18. From point 16, the person on the right of the person driving the jet-ski is the fan of D&B, but we already know the Colombian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (as we'll see later), so the person driving the jet-ski must be the Nigerian.

19. From point 18, the Nigerian is driving the jet-ski, so the Music-Genre for the Nigerian is D&B.

20. From point 17, the American is on the far left and is driving the bus, so the Transport for the American is Bus.

21. From point 15, the Colombian is driving the airplane, so the Transport for the Colombian is Airplane.

22. From point 6, the Colombian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (the Nigerian), so the person driving the jet-ski must be on the far right.

23. From point 22, the Nigerian is on the far right, so the person on the left of the Nigerian (the Colombian) must be on the second position.

24. From point 16, the person on the right of the person driving the jet-ski (the Nigerian) is the fan of D&B, so the person on the left of the Nigerian (the Colombian) must be the fan of Gospel.

25. From point 14, the American is on the far left, so the person on the right of the American (the Colombian) must be the owner of the turtle (as we'll see later).

26. From point 25, the Colombian is the owner of the turtle, so the Pet for the Colombian is Turtle.

27. From point 24, the Colombian is the fan of Gospel, so the person on the left of the Colombian (the American) must be the fan of D&B.

28. From point 27, the American is the fan of D&B, so the Music-Genre for the American is D&B.

29. From point 26, the Colombian is the owner of the turtle, so the Pet for the American is not Turtle.

30. From point 29, the Pet for the American must be either Bird or Rat. But we already know the owner of the rat is the Nigerian, so the Pet for the American must be Bird.

Lv3-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 types of transport, the person driving the motorbike can only be in the first or the third position. Let's assume the motorbike driver is in the first position (1).

2. The German cannot be in the first position (1) because the German is on the right of the person driving the train, and the train driver cannot be in the first position (1) as the motorbike driver is there. So, the German must be in the second position (2).

3. Now, the train driver must be in the third position (3) because the German is on the right of the train driver. This means the motorbike driver is on the left of the train driver, so the motorbike driver is in the second position (2).

4. The goat owner must be in the third position (3) because the goat owner is on the far right.

5. The Japanese is driving the scooter (10), so the scooter cannot be in the third position (3). The scooter must be in the first position (1).

6. The person eating potato is the Japanese (6), so the potato must be in the first position (1). This means the spinach and lime are in the second and third positions (2, 3).

7. The person watching mystery movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku (7, 12), so the mystery genre must be in the second position (2). This means the crime and musical genres are in the first and third positions (1, 3).

8. The person watching crime movies is the person who's hobby is drawing (5), so the crime genre must be in the first position (1). This means the musical genre is in the third position (3).

9. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the German (8), so the singing hobby must be in the second position (2).

10. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard (11), so the lizard owner must be in the first position (1). This means the lizard is in the first position (1) and the goat and pony are in the second and third positions (2, 3).

11. The person who's hobby is sudoku is the german (12), so the sudoku hobby must be in the second position (2).

12. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating spinach. Since the lizard owner is in the first position (1), the person eating spinach must be in the third position (3).

Lv3-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 6 positions, the project-manager must be in the first or the last position. Let's assume the project-manager is in the first position (as placing them in the last position would lead to the same solution).

2. The librarian drinks 7up, so the librarian must be in the second position (as the project-manager is in the first position).

3. The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the Italian (project-manager). Since the project-manager is in the first position, the crime movie watcher must be in the third or fifth position. However, the crime movie watcher cannot be in the fifth position because they are on the right of the almond-milk drinker (from condition 7), and the only person left to their right is the project-manager (already filled). So, the crime movie watcher is in the third position.

4. The person watching crime movies is the fan of gospel (from conditions 9 and 11). So, the gospel fan is in the third position.

5. The person watching mystery movies is the fan of gospel (from condition 11). Since the gospel fan is in the third position, the mystery movie watcher must be in the fourth position.

6. The person drinking almond-milk is not the Italian (from condition 6), so they must be either the freelancer or the person with the sport of snowboarding. However, the person with the sport of snowboarding cannot be to the left of the freelancer (from condition 10), so the almond-milk drinker must be the freelancer.

7. The person with the sport of snowboarding is on the right of the freelancer (from condition 10). Since the freelancer is the fourth person, the snowboarder must be the fifth person.

8. The person with the sport of lacrosse is the fan of gospel (from condition 3). Since the gospel fan is the third person, the lacrosse player must be the sixth person.

9. The person drinking hot-chocolate is not the Italian (from condition 6), not the Polish (from condition 4), and not the Thai (as they haven't been used yet). So, the hot-chocolate drinker must be the Thai.

10. The person watching superhero movies is the Thai (as they are the only one left).

11. The person watching mystery movies is the fan of salsa (from condition 4). However, the salsa fan is the Polish, and they have already been placed (in the first position). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Lv3-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Job, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport) and 3 people. So, each variable can have only one unique value for each person.

2. Let's start with the Beverage column. Since there are 3 different beverages, we can assign them to the rows 1, 2, and 3. Let's say 1-7up, 2-fanta, 3-mirinda.

3. Now, let's move to the Food column. Since the person eating onion is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta, we know that the onion can't be in row 1 or 3 (as fanta is in row 2). So, we can assign artichoke to row 1, blueberry to row 3, and onion to row 2.

4. The teacher is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the sport is already assigned to a row, we know that the teacher can't be in row 1, 2, or 3. So, we can assign the teacher to row 4, 5, or 6. Let's say the teacher is in row 4.

5. The journalist is between the fan of folk and the person drinking mirinda. Since we know the journalist can't be in the first three rows, the only possible positions for the journalist are between row 2 and 3 or between row 3 and 4. But since the teacher is in row 4, the journalist must be between row 2 and 3. So, the journalist is in row 3.

6. The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse is already assigned to a row, we know that the paramedic can't be in the last three rows. So, the paramedic can be in row 1 or 2. But since the paramedic is a fan of pop (from rule 8), and we know the music-genre for the first two people (from rule 3 and 5), the paramedic must be in row 1.

7. The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the mouse. So, the owner of the mouse must be in row 2.

8. The owner of the dog is the fan of folk (from rule 10). Since we know the music-genre for the first two people, the owner of the dog must be in row 3.

9. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person eating blueberry (from rule 5). Since we know the sport for the first two people, the person eating blueberry must be in row 4.

10. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the journalist (from rule 6). Since the journalist is in row 3, the person who's sport is swimming can be in row 2 or 4. But since the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person drinking fanta (from rule 7), the person who's sport is swimming must be in row 4.

11. The only remaining position for the sport is row 2, so it must be badminton.

12. The only remaining position for the music-genre is row 5, so it must be gospel.
