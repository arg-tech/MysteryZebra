Lv3-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching drama movies is between the person driving the helicopter and the dancer. Let's place the dancer on the far left (1st position) and the helicopter driver on the far right (3rd position). Since drama movies are in the middle, the person watching drama movies must be in the 2nd position.

2. The person driving the helicopter is the person drinking cola. So, cola goes in the 3rd position.

3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since cola is in the 3rd position, the skateboard driver must be in the 2nd position.

4. The chef is the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, hot-chocolate goes in the 1st position.

5. The person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right. Since we already have the dancer (drama) on the far left and the helicopter driver (cola) on the far right, satire must be in the 2nd position.

6. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since we don't know the position of biathlon yet, we can't place mystery for now.

7. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since mystery is not placed yet, we can't place hot-chocolate's position either.

8. The person who's sport is basketball is the person drinking cola. Since cola is in the 3rd position, basketball must be in the 2nd position.

9. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since basketball is in the 2nd position, biathlon must be in the 1st or 3rd position. If biathlon was in the 1st position, the person watching mystery movies would be in the 2nd position, which contradicts the fact that mystery is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, biathlon must be in the 3rd position.

10. Now we can place mystery in the 2nd position, as it is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (1st position).

11. The person watching satire movies is on the far left or far right. Since we have all other elements placed, satire must be in the 3rd position.

Lv3-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person driving the scooter is either to the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Let's assume the person eating cucumber is in the middle (position 3). This means the person driving the scooter can be in position 1 or 2.

2. From point 2, the person watching scientific movies is the person driving the subway. Since the subway is on the far right (point 4), the person watching scientific movies must be in position 3. So, the person driving the subway is eating scientific movies.

3. From point 3, the person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person eating pear and the architect. Since the architect is on the far left (point 5), the person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be in position 1. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 2 or 3. If the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2, then the person eating pear must be in position 1. But this would mean the person driving the scooter (who we assumed to be in position 1) would be eating cucumber, which contradicts point 1. So, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 3. This means the person eating pear is in position 2.

4. From point 6, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the bartender. Since the bartender is on the right of the person eating cucumber (point 5), the person eating cucumber must be in position 1. This means the person driving the scooter is in position 2.

5. From point 7, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching scientific movies (who we found to be the subway driver) is on the far right, the person watching satire movies must be in position 1. This means the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 3.

6. Now we know all the people and their hobbies, jobs, and food preferences. We can fill in the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |

Lv3-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows.

2. We know the hobby of the person in the first column is not hiking because the hiker is on the right. So, let's assume the first column is singing.

3. Since the hiker is on the right of the singer, the second column must be hiking.

4. Now, we know the person in the third column is not the hiker because the tea drinker is on the right. So, let's assume the third column is skydiving.

5. The person drinking tea must be in one of the remaining two rows. Since the person driving the train is on the right of the tea drinker, the fourth row must be tea. So, the first row is not tea.

6. The first row cannot be cola because the Indonesian drinks cola, and we haven't assigned any nationality yet. So, the first row is soy-milk.

7. Now, the second row is cola because the Indonesian drinks cola.

8. The third row is tea.

9. The nationality of the first row is Indonesian. The second row cannot be Indonesian because the Indonesian drinks cola, and we already have a cola drinker. So, the third row is Nigerian.

10. The fourth row is Turkish because the Turkish person is on the left or right of the epic movie watcher, and we haven't assigned any nationality yet that could be on the left or right of the epic movie watcher.

11. The movie genre of the first row is epic because the Turkish person is on the left or right of the epic movie watcher, and we already have a Turkish nationality.

12. The movie genre of the second row is family because the family movie watcher is on the right of the train driver, and we already have a movie genre for the first and third rows.

13. The movie genre of the third row is thriller because the bus driver watches thriller movies.

14. The hobby of the third row is hiking because the hiker is on the right of the hiking hobbyist, and we already have hobbies for the first and second rows.

15. The hobby of the second row is singing.

16. The beverage of the first row is soy-milk. The beverage of the second row is cola. The beverage of the third row is tea.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. First, let's assign the nationalities to the positions. Since the Brazilian is on the left of the techno fan (8), and the techno fan can't be in position 1 (because the person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour, and parkour can't be in position 1), the Brazilian must be in position 2. The German is the person eating papaya (10), so the Italian must be in position 3.

2. The person eating peach is on the left of the owner of the cat (2). Since the Brazilian can't be in position 1, the person eating peach must be in position 1. This means the cat owner is in position 3.

3. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person eating peach (3). So, snowboarding must be in position 2.

4. The person eating papaya is on the right of the Brazilian (7). So, papaya must be in position 3.

5. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the Brazilian (8). So, biathlon must be in position 1.

6. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient (6). Since the Brazilian is in position 2, the folk fan can't be in position 1 or 2. So, the folk fan must be in position 3, and the ambient fan must be in position 1.

7. The person eating pear is on the left of the owner of the lizard (9). Since the person eating peach is in position 1, the person eating pear must be in position 2. This means the lizard owner is in position 3.

8. The only remaining food is the peach, which must be in position 1. The only remaining sport is parkour, which must be in position 2. The only remaining nationality is the German, who is already assigned to position 1 (as the person eating papaya). The only remaining pets are the cat (already assigned to position 3) and the horse (not mentioned in the puzzle, so we can't place it). The only remaining music-genres are ambient (already assigned to position 1) and techno (already assigned to position 2).

So, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle as we can't place all the elements.

Here is the table with the information we could fill:

|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |

Lv3-5x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different beverages, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and pets. So, each row and each column should have a unique value.

2. From point 1, we can deduce that the beverage in the first column must be different from the beverage in the third column. Let's assume the first column has juice, the second column has mirinda, and the third column has soy-milk.

3. From point 2, the job in the first row must be different from the job in the third row. Let's assume the first row has coach, the second row has dressmaker, and the third row has manager.

4. Similarly, the movie-genre in the first column must be different from the movie-genre in the third column. Let's assume the first column has documentary, the second column has epic, and the third column has romance.

5. The nationality in the first row must be different from the nationality in the third row. Let's assume the first row has argentine, the second row has australian, and the third row has japanese.

6. The pet in the first row must be different from the pet in the third row. Let's assume the first row has ferret, the second row has horse, and the third row has pony.

7. From point 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is the owner of the ferret. So, the ferret must be in the second row.

8. From point 4, we know that the person watching epic movies is between the owner of the horse and the person watching romance movies. Since the horse is in the second row (from point 6), the epic movie-genre must be in the second column and the romance movie-genre must be in the third column.

9. From point 8, we know that the person watching romance movies must be in the third column. So, the nationality in the third row must be different from the nationality in the third column. Since the nationality in the third row is japanese (from point 5), the nationality in the third column must be argentine (as the only remaining option).

10. From point 7, we know that the person drinking mirinda is in the second row. Since the argentine is the coach (from point 7), the coach must be in the second row.

11. From point 9, we know that the argentine is in the third column. Since the coach is argentine (from point 10), the coach must be in the third column.

12. From point 8, we know that the epic movie-genre is in the second column. Since the coach is watching epic movies (as he is the argentine, who watches epic movies), the coach must be in the second column.

13. From point 9, we know that the argentine is in the third column. Since the coach is argentine and is in the third column (from point 12), the dressmaker must be in the first column.

14. From point 8, we know that the person watching romance movies is in the third column. Since the dressmaker is on the far left or far right (from point 8), the dressmaker must be in the first column.

15. From point 6, we know that the horse is in the second row. Since the dressmaker is the owner of the horse (from point 3), the dressmaker must be in the second row.

16. From point 14, we know that the dressmaker is in the first column. Since the dressmaker is the owner of the horse (from point 15), the horse must be in the first row.

17. From point 9, we know that the argentine is in the third column. Since the argentine is the coach (from point 11), the coach must be in the third column.

18. From point 1, we know that the beverage in the first column must be different from the beverage in the third column. Since the second column has mirinda (from point 7), the beverage in the first column must be juice and the beverage in the third column must be soy-milk.

19. From point 5, we know that the nationality in the first row must be australian. Since the horse is in the first row (from point 16), the manager must be australian.

20. From point 9, we know that the argentine is in the third column. Since the coach is argentine and is in the third column (from point 17), the manager must be in the first column.

21. From point 9, we know that the argentine is in the third column. Since the coach is argentine and is in the third column (from point 17), the job in the third row must be manager.

22. From point 19, we know that the manager is australian. Since the manager is in the first column (from point 20), the job in the first row must be coach.

23. From point 1, we know that the beverage in the first column must be juice. Since the coach is in the first row (from point 22), the beverage in the first row must be juice.

24. From point 1, we know that the beverage in the third column must be soy-milk. Since the job in the third row is manager (from point 21), the beverage in the third row must be soy-milk.

5. From point 8, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we already have the quad-bike on the left of the van (the pilot), the tennis player must be in the second position. We'll fill it with 'T' (tennis).

6. From point 2, we know the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in the second position, the horse owner can be in the first or third position. Let's try H in the first position and see if it satisfies the other conditions.

11. From point 1, we know the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in the second position and the horse owner is in the first position, the horse owner must be on the left of the tennis player. Let's try R (rat) in the third position.

This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption about the horse owner being on the left of the tennis player was incorrect. The horse owner must be on the right of the tennis player.

36. From point 1, we know the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is in the second position and we already have the horse on the right, the horse owner must be in the first position.

37. From point 7, we know the person eating banana is the person driving the ship, so the food in the first position must be 'Ship'.

39. From point 2, we know the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the climber is in the third position and we already have the horse on the left, the apricot eater must be in the second position. But we already have the apricot in the second position. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption about the horse owner being on the left of the tennis player was incorrect again. The horse owner must be on the right of the tennis player. Let's try R (rat) in the first position instead of A (apricot).

40. From point 3, we know the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the climber is in the third position and we already have the horse on the right, the apricot eater must be in the second position. Let's try A (apricot) in the second position.

Lv3-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Let's assume the person watching sports movies is on the right of the train driver for now. We'll check the consistency of this assumption later.

2. The person who's hobby is cooking is watching musical movies. So, cooking is in the first column, and musical is in the second row. Let's place them as follows:

   | Hobby | Cooking | Photography | Reading |
   |-------|--------|------------|---------|
   | Movie-Genre | Musical | Family | Sports |
   | Pet | | | |
   | Sport | | | |
   | Transport | | | |

3. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person who's sport is rowing. So, rowing goes in the third row. Let's place it:

   | Hobby | Cooking | Photography | Reading |
   |-------|--------|------------|---------|
   | Movie-Genre | Musical | Family | Sports |
   | Pet | | | |
   | Sport | Rowing | | Weightlifting |
   | Transport | | | |

4. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person watching musical movies. So, reading must be in the first column. Let's place it:

   | Hobby | Reading | Cooking | Photography |
   |-------|--------|--------|------------|
   | Movie-Genre | Family | Musical | Sports |
   | Pet | Turtle | Goat | Lizard |
   | Sport | Rowing | | Weightlifting |
   | Transport | | | |

5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, weightlifting must be in the fourth row. Let's place it:

   | Hobby | Reading | Cooking | Photography |
   |-------|--------|--------|------------|
   | Movie-Genre | Family | Musical | Sports |
   | Pet | Turtle | Goat | Lizard |
   | Sport | Rowing | | Weightlifting |
   | Transport | | | |

6. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the owner of the goat. The owner of the goat is in the third column. So, sports movies must be in the third row. But we already placed sports movies in the fourth row. This contradicts our assumption that the person watching sports movies is on the right of the train driver.

   Since our initial assumption was incorrect, the person watching sports movies is on the left of the train driver.

7. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the second row. But we already placed weightlifting in the fourth row. This contradicts our assumption that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the train driver.

   This means our puzzle has an inconsistency and cannot be solved with the given information.

Final solution table (with the inconsistency):

   | Hobby | Reading | Cooking | Photography |
   |-------|--------|--------|------------|
   | Movie-Genre | Family | Musical | Sports |
   | Pet | Turtle | Goat | Lizard |
   | Sport | Rowing | | Weightlifting |
   | Transport | | | |

The inconsistency is that the person watching sports movies cannot be on both the left and right of the person who's sport is weightlifting, and also on the left of the train driver."	{}	False	0	False

2. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since we know the sport of the person watching fantasy movies, we can place Basketball in the 1st row. As Basketball's owner has a hamster, we can place Hamster in the 1st column.

3. The owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is basketball, so the person who's sport is skateboarding must be the one who's hobby is skydiving. We can place Skateboarding in the 3rd row and Skydiving in the 3rd column.

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since we already have 3 hobbies, the person driving the bus must be the one who's hobby is puzzles. We can place Puzzles in the 1st row, so the person driving the bus is in the 2nd row.

6. The person driving the tram is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since we already have the owner of the hamster and the person driving the bus, the person driving the tram must be the owner of the pony. We can place Pony in the 2nd column.

   |               |    1    |     2      |       3       |

7. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we already have the person watching fantasy movies, we can place Skateboard in the 3rd row.

   | Transport     | Tram    | Skateboard|              |

8. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of puzzles. Since we already have the person driving the bus, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in the 2nd column.

   |               |    1    |     2      |       3       |

   | Sport         |         | Sailing   | Skateboarding |
   | Transport     | Tram    | Skateboard|              |

Now we have a complete table:

   |               |    1    |     2      |       3       |
   | Hobby         | Hamster | Puzzles   | Skydiving    |

   | Sport         |         | Sailing  | Skateboarding |
   | Transport     | Tram    | Skateboard| Bus         |

The final solution table is:

Lv3-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating pepper is the photographer (from point 6), we know that the trike is either to the left or right of the photographer. Let's assume the trike is to the right of the photographer (otherwise, we can just swap the positions of the people and transport).

2. The person who dances is on the left or right of the accountant. Since the photographer is the person eating pepper and we placed the trike (driven by an unknown person) to the right of the photographer, the accountant must be on the left of the photographer (and thus, the trike).

3. The owner of the horse is between the owner of the rabbit and the person who fishes. Since the person eating plum is in the middle (point 7), the horse cannot be in the middle, so it must be either to the left or right of the plum eater. Let's assume the horse is to the right of the plum eater (otherwise, we can just swap the positions of the people and pets).

4. The person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating plum (point 4).

5. The owner of the horse is on the right of the person driving the bus (point 5). Since the horse is to the right of the plum eater, the bus driver must be to the left of the plum eater.

6. The person eating plum is on the left of the person who dances (point 8). Since the plum eater is in the middle, the dancer must be on the right of the plum eater.

7. Now we have the following arrangement:

   |             |      1       |      2      |     3      |
   | Food        | Plum        | Spinach    | Pepper     |
   | Hobby       | Dancing     | Woodworking | Fishing    |
   | Job         | Accountant  | Engineer   | Photographer|
   | Pet         | Rabbit      | Horse      | Bird       |
   | Transport   | Bus         | Helicopter | Trike      |

   However, this arrangement violates point 3, as the horse is not between the rabbit and the fisherman. So, let's swap the positions of the horse and the helicopter:

   |             |      1       |      2      |     3      |
   | Food        | Plum        | Spinach    | Pepper     |
   | Hobby       | Dancing     | Woodworking | Fishing    |
   | Job         | Accountant  | Engineer   | Photographer|
   | Pet         | Rabbit      | Bird       | Horse      |
   | Transport   | Bus         | Trike      | Helicopter |

Now the arrangement satisfies all the conditions.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching satire movies is on the far left, so let's place Satire in the first row, first column (1,1).

2. Since the person driving the boat is either to the left or right of the person watching satire movies, we can't place the boat yet. Let's place the other two means of transport in the remaining two spots (1,3) and (3,3). We'll assume the boat is in the second row for now.

3. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we already have a hobby in the first column, let's place Gardening in the second column (2,2). Now, we can place Collecting in the third column (3,2) or the first column (1,3). Let's place it in the first column (1,3) for now.

4. The fan of salsa is on the far right, so we place Salsa in the third column (3,1). Since the chef is the fan of salsa, we know the chef must be in the first row (1,1).

5. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since Gardening is in the second column (2,2), we can place Drama in the third column (3,2).

6. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we already have Collecting in the first column (1,3), we can place Video-games in the third column (3,3).

7. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since Gardening is in the second column (2,2), we can't place Video-games in the second row. So, it must be in the first row, which is already occupied by the chef. This means Video-games must be in the second row (2,3).

8. The fan of jazz is on the right of the software-developer. Since we already have Software-developer in the second row (2,1), we can place Jazz in the third row (3,1).

9. Now, we can place the boat in the second row (2,3), as it's the only remaining spot.

10. Finally, we have one more hobby left, which is Metal. Since we already have Salsa in the third column (3,1), we can place Metal in the first column (1,2).

Here is the final solution table:
