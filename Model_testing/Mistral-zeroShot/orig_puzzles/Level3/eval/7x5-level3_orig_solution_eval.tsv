Lv3-7x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the table with 5 columns.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the adventure movie fan is on the far left (column 1).

3. From rule 7, the fan of folk is on the far left. So, the folk fan must be in column 1.

4. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle. Since we have filled columns 1 and 5, the collector must be in column 3.

5. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the spanish. Since the spanish is on the right of the japanese (rule 20), the hiker must be in column 2.

6. From rule 13, the fan of rock is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the badminton player is not yet determined, we can't place the rock fan yet.

10. From rule 17, the fan of blues is on the left or right of the japanese. Since the japanese is in column 2, the blues fan can be in either column 1 or 3. However, the fan of folk is already in column 1 (rule 3), so the blues fan must be in column 3.

11. From rule 18, the fan of rock is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane driver is not yet determined, we can't place the rock fan yet.

13. From rule 21, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is in column 5, the filmmaker can be in either column 4 or 5. However, the collector is already in column 3 (rule 4), so the filmmaker must be in column 5.

Since the sports movie fan is in column 5 (rule 6) and the crime movie fan is not yet determined, the crime movie fan can be in either column 1 or 2. However, the adventure movie fan is already in column 1 (rule 2), so the crime movie fan must be in column 2.

9. From rule 8, we know that the person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the fan of salsa is in column 4, the person eating pear must be in column 1, 2, 3, or 5. Since the person eating orange is already in column 2, the person eating pear cannot be in column 2. Since the fan of salsa is in column 4, the person eating pear cannot be in column 5. So, the person eating pear must be in column 1 or 3. Since the fan of house is already in column 1, the person eating pear must be in column 3.

|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |     4     |      5      |

| Pet           | goat      | goldfish   | guinea-pig| hedgehog  | horse       |

10. From rule 9, we know that the person eating pear is in column 3. Since the person eating pear is not the fan of salsa (which is in column 4), the person eating pear must be blueberry, onion, or spinach. Since the person eating orange is already in column 2, the person eating pear cannot be orange. So, the person eating pear must be either blueberry or spinach.

11. From rule 19, we know that the person eating orange is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is not yet determined, we cannot determine the position of the person eating orange at this moment.

17. From rule 17, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the person eating pear is in column 3, the owner of the goldfish must be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the person eating onion is in column 5, the owner of the goldfish cannot be in column 5. So, the owner of the goldfish can be in column 1, 2, or 4.

18. From rule 18, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left of the nigerian. Since the person eating onion is the person watching animation movies and is in column 5, the nigerian must be in column 6.

19. From rule 19, we know that the person eating orange is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is not yet determined, we cannot determine the position of the person eating orange at this moment.

20. From rule 20, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person eating pear is in column 3, the person who's hobby is photography must be in column 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the person eating onion is in column 5, the person who's hobby is photography cannot be in column 5. So, the person who's hobby is photography can be in column 1, 2, or 4.

21. From rule 21, we know that the person watching western movies is the fan of disco. Since the fan of disco is not yet determined, we cannot determine the position of the person watching western movies at this moment.

22. From rule 22, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person eating pear. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is not yet determined, we cannot determine the position of the person who's hobby is camping at this moment.

23. From rule 23, we know that the nigerian is on the far left or far right. Since the nigerian is in column 6, the nigerian is on the far right.

24. From rule 24, we know that the malaysian is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the person eating onion is the person watching animation movies and is in column 5, the malaysian can be in column 1, 2, 4, or 6. Since the nigerian is on the far right, the malaysian cannot be in column 6. So, the malaysian can be in column 1, 2, or 4.

25. From rule 25, we know that the fan of d&b is on the right of the person eating spinach. Since the person eating spinach is not yet determined (it can be in column 1, 3, or 5), the fan of d&b can be in column 2, 4, or 6.

At this point, we have determined the positions for most of the elements except for the fan of blues, the person who's hobby is woodworking, the fan of disco, and the person who's hobby is photography (the owner of the guinea-pig). We can continue to use the remaining rules to determine the positions of these elements. However, the puzzle becomes quite complex at this point, and it would require a more systematic approach to solve the remaining elements.

Here is the table with the elements we have determined so far:

|               |      1      |      2      |      3      |     4     |      5      |

21. Since the bird owner is left or right of the skier, we can place the skier (A, B, C, D, or E) and the bird owner (A, B, C, D, or E) in their positions, but we don't know their exact order yet.
22. Since the scooter driver is on the far right, we know that the scooter driver (E) is in the rightmost position.
23. Since the paramedic is between the water-polo player and the asparagus eater, we can place the paramedic (A, B, C, or D) in one of the positions between the water-polo player (B) and the asparagus eater (C).
24. Since the water drinker is right of the broccoli eater, we can place the water drinker (A, B, C, D, or E) to the right of the broccoli eater (B).
25. Since the fish owner is left of the radish eater, we know that the radish eater (A, B, C, D, or E) is to the right of the fish owner (A, B, C, D, or E).
26. Since the lettuce eater is on the far left, we know that the lettuce eater (A) is in the leftmost position.

At this point, we have placed all the people and items in their positions, but there are still some variables (the exact order of the goat owner, the fish owner, the nurse, the woodworker, the skier, and the swimmer) that we cannot determine with the given information. However, we can still present the final solution table with these variables:

Lv3-7x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the owner of the pony drinks fanta, so let's place fanta in the position of the pony owner.

| Beverage      | fanta  |     |     |     |     |
| Food          |        | apricot| blueberry| cherry| strawberry|

| Transport     |       |       |       |     |       |

2. The person drinking tea is between the person driving the van and the person eating radish. Since we already placed the pony owner (with fanta) and we know the pony owner drinks fanta, the person drinking tea cannot be on the far right (as the van driver is on the far right). So, let's place tea in the second position from the right.

| Beverage      | fanta  |     | tea   |     |     |
| Food          |        | apricot| blueberry| cherry| strawberry|

| Transport     | motorbike| roller|       |       | subway|

4. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we already placed coffee, tea, and fanta, let's place milk in the first position.

| Transport     | motorbike| roller|       |       | subway|

5. The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since we already placed the pony owner, let's place the mouse owner to the left of the pony owner.

| Beverage      | milk  | fanta  | tea   | coffee|     |
| Food          | apricot| blueberry| cherry| strawberry| mouse|

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is in the middle (V), we know that volleyball is not basketball, cricket, lacrosse, soccer, or plum (B, C, L, S, P). Let's assume the volleyball player is in the third position (V).
3. The mexican is the person driving the taxi (MX, Ta).
4. The person eating eggplant is on the left of the fan of trance. Since the trance fan is on the left of the gospel fan (R, T), the eggplant eater cannot be in the first position (P). Let's assume the eggplant eater is in the second position (E).

The scooter driver is in the third position (Sc).
19. The brazilian is on the left of the fan of trance (B, T).
20. The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the filmmaking hobby is in the second position (F), the hip-hop fan cannot be in the first position (P). Let's assume the hip-hop fan is in the fifth position (H).

Lv3-7x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people based on their sports. Since the person who's sport is surfing is on the far left or far right, let's place them at position 1 or 5. Let's place them at position 1 for now. So, Surfing = 1.

2. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since we already placed Surfing at position 1, the person watching mystery movies must be at position 2. So, Mystery = 2.

3. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since we placed Surfing at position 1, Sailing must be at position 3. So, Sailing = 3.

4. The person driving the train is the fan of rock. Since we know the positions of Surfing, Mystery, and Sailing, we can place Rock at position 4. So, Rock = 4.

5. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the fan of trance. Since we placed Rock at position 4, Trance must be at position 5. So, Trance = 5.

6. The owner of the goat is the person watching satire movies. Since we placed Mystery at position 2, Satire must be at position 3. So, Satire = 3.

7. The owner of the frog is in the middle. Since we placed Mystery at position 2 and Satire at position 3, Frog must be at position 4. So, Frog = 4.

12. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since we placed Rock at position 4 (who is watching epic movies), Metal can be at position 3 or 5. Since the owner of the goat (who is watching satire movies) is on the left of the person driving the trike, the only position left for Metal is position 3. So, Metal = 3.

13. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since we placed Coffee at position 3, Skateboarding can be at position 2 or 4. Since the owner of the goat (who is watching satire movies) is on the left of the person driving the trike, the only position left for Skateboarding is position 4. So, Skateboarding = 4.

14. The fan of classical is between the dressmaker and the person drinking juice. Since we placed Frog at position 4 and Juice at position 3, Classical must be at position 2. So, Classical = 2.

15. The owner of the rabbit is the electrician. Since we placed Skateboarding at position 4, the only remaining position for Rabbit is position 5. So, Rabbit = 5.

16. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since we placed Iced-tea at position 5, the only remaining position for Jet-ski is position 1. So, Jet-ski = 1.

Lv3-7x5-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Assign jobs to the people (5 positions)
1. The firefighter is on the far left or far right. Let's place the firefighter at position 1 (far left) for now.
2. The analyst is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the firefighter is at position 1, the analyst must be at position 2.
3. The designer is the person eating kiwi. Since we don't know the position of kiwi yet, we can't place the designer yet.
4. The electrician, engineer, and engineer's pet (ferret) are not yet placed, so we can't place them either.

Step 2: Assign movie-genres to the people (5 positions)
1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far left or far right. Since the firefighter is at position 1, the fantasy movies person can't be at position 1 or 5. So, let's place the fantasy movies person at position 2 (left of the analyst).
2. The person watching time-travel movies is to the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is at position 2, the time-travel movies person must be at position 3.
3. The person watching epic movies is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike and to the right of the person drinking tea. Since we don't know the positions of the quad-bike, tea, and the person driving the quad-bike yet, we can't place the epic movies person yet.
4. The person watching documentary, thriller, and documentary-time-travel combinations are not yet placed, so we can't place them either.

Step 3: Assign pets to the people (5 positions)
1. The owner of the mouse is on the far left. Since the firefighter is at position 1, the mouse owner can't be at position 1. So, let's place the mouse owner at position 5 (far right).
2. The owner of the cat is between the person driving the airplane and the person watching thriller movies. Since we don't know the positions of the airplane, thriller movies, and the cat yet, we can't place the cat owner yet.
3. The owner of the rat is to the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since we don't know the position of the person drinking tea yet, we can't place the rat owner yet.
4. The owner of the guinea-pig, rat, and the person driving the subway are not yet placed, so we can't place them either.

Step 4: Assign sports to the people (5 positions)
1. The person playing surfing eats potato. Since we don't know the position of potato yet, we can't place the surfer yet.
2. The person playing lacrosse drinks cola. Since we don't know the position of cola yet, we can't place the lacrosse player yet.
3. The person playing rowing is the designer. Since the designer is at position 2, the rower must be at position 2 as well.
4. The person playing water-polo is on the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is at position 2, the water-polo player must be at position 1 (left of the analyst).
5. The person playing skiing is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we don't know the position of soy-milk yet, we can't place the skier yet.
6. The person playing lacrosse, rowing, skiing, and the person driving the motorbike are not yet placed, so we can't place them either.

Step 5: Assign beverages to the people (5 positions)
1. The person drinking almond-milk is not yet placed, so we can't place them yet.
2. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person playing water-polo. Since the water-polo player is at position 1, the cola drinker must be at position 2 (left of the water-polo player).
3. The person drinking mirinda is the person eating cauliflower. Since we don't know the position of cauliflower yet, we can't place the mirinda drinker yet.
4. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person playing skiing. Since we don't know the position of the skier yet, we can't place the soy-milk drinker yet.
5. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person playing lacrosse. Since the lacrosse player is at position 4, the tea drinker must be at position 5 (right of the lacrosse player).

Step 6: Assign foods to the people (5 positions)
1. The person eating blueberry is not yet placed, so we can't place them yet.
2. The person eating cauliflower is the mirinda drinker. Since we don't know the position of mirinda yet, we can't place the cauliflower eater yet.
3. The person eating kiwi is the designer. Since the designer is at position 2, the kiwi eater must be at position 2 (eating kiwi).
4. The person eating orange is not yet placed, so we can't place them yet.
5. The person eating potato is the surfer. Since we don't know the position of potato yet, we can't place the surfer yet.

Step 7: Assign transport to the people (5 positions)
1. The person driving the airplane is to the left of the person watching thriller movies and to the right of the cat owner. Since we don't know the position of the cat owner yet, we can't place the airplane driver yet.
2. The person driving the helicopter is to the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the tea drinker is at position 5, the helicopter driver can be at position 4 or 5.
3. The person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person watching epic movies and to the right of the person drinking tea. Since the tea drinker is at position 5, the quad-bike driver can be at position 3 or 4.
4. The person driving the motorbike is to the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the cauliflower eater is not yet placed, we can't place the motorbike driver yet.
5. The person driving the subway is to the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is at position 5, the subway driver can be at position 4 or 5.

At this point, we have placed some people in their positions, but we still have many variables that are not yet resolved. It seems that we need more clues or a way to deduce the positions of the remaining variables to solve the puzzle completely.

Lv3-7x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person drinking coffee (magic-tricks hobby) in any position. Let's place them at position 1.
2. Since the Colombian is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee, place the Colombian in either position 2 or 3. Let's place them at position 2 for now.
3. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the Colombian is in position 2, the turtle owner cannot be in position 1. So, place the turtle owner in position 4.
4. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the Colombian is in position 2, the hedgehog owner cannot be in position 1. So, place the hedgehog owner in position 5.
5. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle owner is in position 4, place the volleyball player in position 3.
6. The fan of electronic is on the far right. Since the turtle owner is in position 4, the electronic fan cannot be in position 5. So, place the electronic fan in position 1.
7. The polish is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the Colombian is in position 2, the polish cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, place the polish in position 2 (already occupied by the Colombian). Swap the hobbies of the Colombian and the polish. So, the polish is now card-games and the Colombian is traveling.
8. The owner of the turtle is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person drinking tea. Since the polish is now card-games, the turtle owner cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, place the turtle owner in position 3.
9. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the Colombian. Since the Colombian is now traveling, the turtle owner cannot be in position 2 (already occupied by the Colombian). So, place the turtle owner in position 4.
10. The person who's sport is basketball is the polish. Since the polish is now traveling, the basketball player cannot be in position 2. So, place the basketball player in position 1.
11. The person drinking 7up is the person driving the scooter. Place the 7up drinker in position 5.
12. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the 7up drinker is in position 5, place the roller driver in position 4.
13. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the fan of country. Since the electronic fan is in position 1, the video-games person cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, place the video-games person in position 3.
14. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 5, place the cricket player in position 6.
15. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog owner is in position 5, place the indie fan in position 4.
16. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the magic-tricks person is in position 1, place the sprite drinker in position 2.
17. The fan of indie is between the person who's sport is sailing and the french. Since the indie fan is in position 4, the sailing person cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, place the sailing person in position 2. The french cannot be in position 1 or 6, so place the french in position 6.
18. The turkish is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since the punk fan is not placed yet, we can't determine their position yet.
19. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the basketball player is in position 1, the chinchilla owner cannot be in position 2. So, place the chinchilla owner in position 3.
20. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left. Place the jet-ski driver in position 1.
21. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the video-games person is in position 3 and the volleyball player is in position 3, this condition is already satisfied.
22. The fan of punk is the person driving the motorbike. Since the punk fan is not placed yet, we can't determine their position yet.
23. The malaysian is on the right of the owner of the frog. Since the chinchilla owner is in position 3, the frog owner cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, place the frog owner in position 5.
24. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far right. Since the chinchilla owner is already in position 3, this condition is already satisfied.

Now, let's place the remaining people:
- The fan of country cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by the jet-ski driver) or position 6 (already occupied by the french). So, place the fan of country in position 2.
- The sailing person cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by the jet-ski driver) or position 5 (already occupied by the frog owner). So, place the sailing person in position 4.
- The cricket player is already in position 6.
- The fan of punk is the person driving the motorbike. Since the cricket player is in position 6, the punk fan cannot be in position 5 (already occupied by the frog owner). So, place the punk fan in position 4.
