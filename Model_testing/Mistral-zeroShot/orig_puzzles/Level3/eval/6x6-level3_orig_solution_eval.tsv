Lv3-6x6-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the beverages, hobbies, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport to the columns from 1 to 6.

1. We know that the person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is surfing. Let's assign surfing to the sport of the person in column 2. Since there are 6 sports, we can assign the remaining 5 sports to the other columns.

2. Now, let's assign the music-genres. Since the fan of rock is on the far left or far right, we can assign rock to either column 1 or 6. Let's assign it to column 1 for now. The remaining 5 music-genres can be assigned to the other columns.

3. The fan of salsa is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is on the left of the person driving the bike (rule 20), the fan of salsa must be in column 3.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the ferret (rule 4). Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing (rules 25 and 26), the hobby of fishing must be in column 5.

5. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer (rule 5). Since the person who's sport is surfing is the person who's hobby is woodworking (rule 21), and surfing is in column 2, soccer must be in column 4 or 6. Since the fan of rock is on the far left (rule 7), soccer cannot be in column 1. So, soccer is in column 6.

6. The person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is rowing (rule 16). Since soccer is in column 6, 7up must be in column 5.

7. The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (rule 6). Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the owner of the goat (rule 18), the owner of the goat must be in column 4. So, reggae is in column 3.

8. The fan of classical is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit (rule 9). Since the owner of the rabbit is on the far left (rule 13), the fan of classical must be in column 2.

9. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right (rule 10). Since soccer is in column 6, the person who's sport is surfing (which is also in column 2) must be in column 1.

10. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (rule 11). Since the owner of the goat (who's sport is lacrosse) is in column 4, rock-climbing must be in column 3.

12. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left (rule 13). Since the fan of classical is on the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 8), the fan of classical must be in column 2.

13. The fan of house is on the far left or far right (rule 23). Since the fan of rock is on the far left (rule 7), the fan of house must be in column 6.

14. The person driving the train is on the left of the fan of classical (rule 14). Since the fan of classical is in column 2, the person driving the train must be in column 1.

15. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the fan of reggae (rule 15). Since reggae is in column 3, the owner of the turtle must be in column 4.

20. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 3). Since iced-tea is in column 3, sprite can be in either column 2 or 4. However, since the fan of salsa is in column 3, sprite cannot be in column 3. So, sprite is in column 2 or 4. Since the fan of disco is in column 5, sprite must be in column 4.

21. The person who's sport is surfing is the person who's hobby is woodworking (rule 21). Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is in column 1, the person who's sport is surfing is also in column 1.

Lv3-6x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction based on the given clues. Let's start by assigning each person a job, nationality, pet, sport, and movie-genre, and then assign each means of transport.

1. The Chinese is driving the train, so let's assign the Chinese to the Train row and the job of Driver.
2. The person watching sports movies is the person who's sport is swimming, so let's assign Swimming to the Sport column for the person watching sports movies.
3. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the photographer, so let's assign Time-Travel to the Movie-Genre column for the person on the left or right of the Photographer. Since there are only two empty spots left on the left and right of the Photographer, we can assign Time-Travel to one of those spots. Let's assign Time-Travel to the person on the left of the Photographer for now.
4. The Manager is on the left of the Egyptian, so let's assign the Manager to the row above the Egyptian.
5. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is not yet assigned, we can't proceed with this clue yet.

Lv3-6x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's solve it step by step:

1. Let's start by placing the people and their sports:
   - The person playing water-polo is drinking soy-milk (clue 25). Let's place it in column 6.
   - The person playing parkour is drinking tea (clue 9). Let's place it in an empty column.
   - The person playing climbing is driving the subway (clue 1). Let's place it in an empty row.
   - The person playing baseball is on the left or right of the chef (clue 26). Since there's only one empty spot left for the chef, the baseball player must be in the same row as the chef. Let's place the chef in the row with the subway driver (since the subway driver is playing a different sport).
   - The person playing rugby is not specified yet, but we'll place it later.
   - The person playing volleyball is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli (clue 24). Since there's only one empty spot left for broccoli, the volleyball player must be in the same column as broccoli.

2. Let's place the pets:
   - The owner of the goldfish is between the owner of the hamster and the person drinking tea (clue 19). Since the goldfish owner is in the same row as the tea drinker (the parkour player), the hamster owner must be in the same column as the goldfish owner (column 4). Let's place the hamster owner there. The goldfish owner will be in column 5.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person drinking water (clue 18). Since there's only one empty spot on the left of the water drinker, the hedgehog owner must be in the same row as the water drinker. Let's place the water drinker in the row with the subway driver (since the subway driver is playing a different sport).
   - The owner of the goat is on the right of the person eating broccoli (clue 21). Since the broccoli eater is in the same column as the volleyball player, the goat owner will be in the same row as the broccoli eater.
   - The owner of the pony and rabbit are not specified yet, but we'll place them later.

3. Let's place the jobs:
   - The architect is on the right of the person eating broccoli (clue 12) and on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 13). Since the architect is in the same row as the broccoli eater, the architect must be in the same column as the soy-milk drinker (column 5).
   - The manager is on the left of the person eating papaya (clue 10). Since the papaya eater is in the same row as the chef, the manager must be in the same column as the chef (column 3).
   - The security-guard is on the left of the firefighter (clue 17). Since there's only one empty spot on the left of the firefighter, the security-guard must be in the same row as the firefighter.

4. Let's place the food:
   - The person eating papaya is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 8). Since the architect is drinking soy-milk, the papaya eater must be in the same row as the architect.
   - The person eating zucchini is on the right of the analyst (clue 16) and on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (clue 24). Since the volleyball player is in the same column as the broccoli eater, the zucchini eater must be in the same row as the analyst.
   - The person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating zucchini (clue 6) and the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person eating tomato (clue 3). Since the goldfish owner is in the same row as the tea drinker (the parkour player), the tomato eater must be in the same column as the zucchini eater (column 2).
   - The person eating pineapple is the person driving the scooter (clue 22). Since the scooter driver is on the right of the car driver (clue 14), the pineapple eater must be in the same row as the car driver.
   - The person eating broccoli is on the right of the owner of the goat (clue 21). Since the goat owner is in the same row as the broccoli eater, the broccoli eater must be in column 1.
   - The person eating zucchini is on the left of the analyst (clue 16). Since the zucchini eater is in the same row as the analyst, the analyst must be in column 4.

5. Let's place the remaining people and their sports:
   - The person driving the car is the person eating zucchini (clue 23). Since the car driver is in the same row as the pineapple eater, the car driver must be in column 5.
   - The person driving the motorbike is the person drinking tea (clue 20). Since the tea drinker is in the same row as the architect, the motorbike driver must be in column 5.
   - The person driving the trike is between the person driving the scooter and the owner of the rabbit (clue 4). Since the scooter driver is in the same row as the car driver, the trike driver must be in the same column as the car driver (column 5). The rabbit owner must be in the same row as the trike driver.
   - The person playing rugby is on the right of the person eating broccoli (since there's only one empty spot on the right of the broccoli eater, the rugby player must be in the same row as the broccoli eater). Since the broccoli eater is in column 1, the rugby player must be in column 2.
   - The person eating the remaining fruit (which is either fanta or water) is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini (clue 11). Since the zucchini eater is in the same row as the analyst, the fanta or water drinker must be in the same column as the analyst (column 4). However, the analyst is already drinking coffee, so the fanta or water drinker must be in column 6. Since the water-polo player is already drinking soy-milk, the fanta drinker must be in column 6.

Lv3-6x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's the solution:

1. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Polish is a rock-climber (from step 22), we can place them in position 6. The Polish is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess (from step 21), so the chess player is in position 5.

2. The person watching adventure movies is the person eating artichoke (from step 20), so artichoke goes in position 1. The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (from step 23), so video-games goes in position 2.

3. The person driving the bus is the person watching thriller movies (from step 24), so thriller goes in position 6. The person driving the bus is on the far left or far right (from step 13), so it must be in position 1 or 6. Since the Polish is already in position 6, thriller must be in position 1.

4. The person watching time-travel movies is the person driving the scooter (from step 26), so time-travel goes in position 5.

5. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies (from clue 1), so soy-milk can't be in position 1 or 6. So, soy-milk goes in position 2 or 4. But since the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (from step 11), and mirinda is already in position 4, soy-milk goes in position 2.

6. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the Australian (from step 6), but we haven't placed the Australian yet. Let's place the Australian in position 3 for now. So, cola goes in position 4 or 5. But since the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking cola (from step 12), and mirinda is already in position 4, cola goes in position 5.

7. The person watching musical movies is on the far right (from step 15), so musical goes in position 6. The person driving the motorbike is the person watching musical movies (from step 7), so motorbike goes in position 6.

8. The person driving the helicopter is the person eating artichoke (from step 9), so helicopter goes in position 1.

9. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person drinking juice (from step 2), but we haven't placed the juice yet. Let's place the juice in position 3 for now. So, mystery goes in position 2 or 4. But since the person eating watermelon is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (from step 3), and rock-climbing is already in position 6, watermelon goes in position 5. This means juice goes in position 4.

10. The person eating water is the person eating watermelon (from step 14), so water goes in position 5.

11. The person watching thriller movies is the person eating pineapple (from step 19), so pineapple goes in position 3.

12. The person eating broccoli is on the left or right of the indonesian (from step 17), but we haven't placed the indonesian yet. Let's place the indonesian in position 4 for now. So, broccoli goes in position 2 or 6. But since the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (from step 11), and soy-milk is already in position 2, broccoli goes in position 6.

13. The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking 7up (from step 11), but we haven't placed the 7up yet. Let's place the 7up in position 5 for now. So, musical goes in position 1 or 3. But since the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the canadian (from step 8), and the helicopter is already in position 1, musical goes in position 3.

14. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up (from step 16), but we haven't placed the gardening hobby yet. Let's place the gardening hobby in position 2 for now. So, gardening goes in position 1 or 4.

Lv3-6x6-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6 represent the six types of food, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6 for hobbies, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5, J6 for jobs, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, M6 for music-genres, N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6 for nationalities, and P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, P6 for pets.

2. Next, let's use the given clues to make deductions. For example, from clue 1, we know that J1 (engineer) is to the left of J4 (paramedic).

3. Continue solving the clues one by one, using the information from previous deductions to help with future ones. For example, from clue 12 and 13, we know that P3 (designer) is to the left of N3 (indian), and P3 is also the owner of A1 (ambient). So, A1 must be to the left of N3.

4. As you solve more clues, you'll start to have overlapping information that can help you narrow down the possibilities. For example, from clues 24 and 25, we know that H4 (singing) is to the left or right of F3 (corn), and W1 (writing) is to the left or right of P2 (cat). If we know that P2 is not F3 (from other clues), then P2 must be either to the left or right of F1, F2, F4, F5, or F6. If we also know that F1, F2, F4, F5, and F6 are not corn (from other clues), then P2 must be corn's neighbor.

5. Continue this process until you have solved all the variables.

6. Once you have all the variables filled, put '#############' around the final solution table.
