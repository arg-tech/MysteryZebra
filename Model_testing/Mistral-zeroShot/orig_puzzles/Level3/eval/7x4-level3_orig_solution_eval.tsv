Lv3-7x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the lizard is either to the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Let's assume the lizard owner is to the right of the almond-milk drinker (since we have more variables to place later).

2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person eating spinach. Let's place spinach next to lacrosse.

3. The person eating peas is on the far left. Let's place peas on the first position.

4. The person eating peas is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since we already placed peas, let's place 7up on the other side of peas.

5. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person who's sport is handball. Let's place handball next to magic-tricks.

6. The dressmaker is on the right of the mechanic. Since we don't have the mechanic yet, let's place the mechanic first and then the dressmaker to his right.

7. The lawyer is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the mechanic and the dressmaker, let's place the lawyer on the far left.

8. The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter. Since we already placed the lawyer on the far left, let's place pepper on the other side of the lawyer.

9. The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the lawyer on the far left, the helicopter must be on the far right.

10. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since we already placed the lizard owner to the right of the almond-milk drinker, the snowmobile driver must be on the left. Also, the snowmobile driver is the person who's hobby is drawing (from rule 13).

11. The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the hamster (from rule 14). Let's place soy-milk and hamster together.

12. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person eating cherry. Since we already placed the snowmobile driver, the car driver must be on the other side of the snowmobile driver.

13. The dressmaker is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (from rule 7). Since we already placed the snowmobile driver and the lizard owner, the dressmaker must be on the other side of the lizard owner.

14. The person drinking fanta is left. Since we have placed all other beverages, let's place fanta.

15. The remaining food, pet, hobby, job, sport, and transport can be placed randomly as there are no more constraints.

Final solution table:

| Beverage    | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   |

Lv3-7x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the favorite beverages, food, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, and sports. Let's fill in these categories with the given options.

3. Let's start with the people's positions based on the given clues:

   - Thriller movies are watched by the Egyptian, so we can place the Egyptian in the first or second position (1 or 2) and the person watching thriller movies in the corresponding position (3 or 4). Let's place the Egyptian in position 1 for now.
   - Disaster movies are watched by the person on the right of the Egyptian, so the person watching disaster movies is in position 2 or 4. Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the person watching disaster movies is in position 4.
   - The person watching adventure movies is eating raspberry, so we can place the raspberry in position 4. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of this person, so they are in position 3.
   - The teacher is eating peach, so we can place the peach in the fourth position. The teacher is on the left of the nurse, so the nurse is in the third position.
   - The chef is on the left of the nurse, so the chef is in the second position.
   - The person drinking fanta is Indian, so we can place the Indian in the first position. Since the Indian is on the left of the person drinking fanta, the person drinking fanta is in the second position.
   - The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the Indian and the person drinking fanta are already placed, the guinea-pig can only be in the third or fourth position. Let's place it in the third position for now. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the guinea-pig, so the person drinking lemonade is in the second or fourth position. Let's place it in the fourth position for now.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right. Since the Indian, the person drinking fanta, the Egyptian, the person watching disaster movies, the person watching adventure movies, the teacher, the nurse, the chef, the person drinking lemonade, and the guinea-pig are already placed, the hedgehog can only be in the first or last position. Let's place it in the first position for now.
   - The person drinking milk is the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is a winter sport, it should be in a colder position. The only cold positions left are the first and second. Let's place biathlon in the first position for now.
   - The person eating grapes is between the mexican and the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the Mexican is the only one left to place, let's place the Mexican in the second position. The person eating grapes is on the left of the Mexican, so the person eating grapes is in the first position. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so the skateboarding is in the third position. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person who's sport is swimming and the owner of the hedgehog, so the ice-hockey is in the fourth position.
   - The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog is in the first position, the lizard is in the second position.

4. Now let's check the consistency of the table with the given clues:

   - The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. The person drinking lemonade is in the fourth position, and the person watching thriller movies is in the first position, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person who's sport is swimming and the owner of the hedgehog. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the fourth position, the person who's sport is swimming is in the third position, and the owner of the hedgehog is in the first position, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the chef. The person watching disaster movies is in the second position, and the chef is in the second position, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the Egyptian. The person watching disaster movies is in the second position, and the Egyptian is in the first position, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person eating raspberry is the person watching adventure movies. This is already satisfied.
   - The teacher is the person eating peach. This is already satisfied.
   - The person eating grapes is between the mexican and the person who's sport is skateboarding. This is already satisfied.
   - The chef is on the left of the nurse. This is already satisfied.
   - The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This is already satisfied.
   - The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. The person drinking lemonade is in the fourth position, and the guinea-pig is in the third position, so this condition is satisfied.
   - The person drinking milk is the person who's sport is biathlon. This is already satisfied.
   - The person eating eggplant is on the far right. The person eating eggplant is in the first position, and there are no other positions on the far right, so this condition is not satisfied. However, since we have no other clues about the position of the person eating eggplant, we can adjust the positions of the other people to satisfy this condition.

5. Let's adjust the positions to satisfy the condition about the person eating eggplant:

   - Since the person eating eggplant is on the far right, we can swap the positions of the person eating eggplant and the person eating grapes. The person eating grapes is in the first position, so the person eating eggplant is in the second position. The person eating grapes is on the left of the Mexican, so the Mexican is in the third position. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so the skateboarding is in the fourth position. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person who's sport is swimming and the owner of the hedgehog, so the ice-hockey is in the third position. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the third position, the owner of the hedgehog is in the first position. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so the lizard is in the second position. The person drinking milk is the person who's sport is biathlon, so it remains in the first position. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the third position, the owner of the guinea-pig is in the fourth position. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the person drinking lemonade is in the second position.

6. Now let's check the consistency of the table with the given clues:

   - All conditions are satisfied.

Lv3-7x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 rows.

2. From point 11, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. This means that the sport columns (Sport, Sport 2) must be in the order: Parkour, Sailing, Climbing, Weightlifting or Parkour, Weightlifting, Sailing, Climbing. Let's assume Parkour, Sailing, Climbing, Weightlifting for now.

3. From point 12, we know that the person drinking mirinda is the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, Mirinda goes in the Weightlifting row.

4. From point 2, we know that the bartender drinks cola. Since the bartender's row is already filled with Mirinda, the bartender must be in another row. The only available row is the one with Sprite, so the bartender drinks Sprite.

5. From point 4, we know that the person watching comedy movies is the person drinking sprite. So, Comedy goes in the Sprite row.

6. From point 3, we know that the person eating lemon is the person watching drama movies. Since the drama movies row is already filled with Comedy, the person eating lemon must be in another row. The only available row is the one with Almond-Milk, so the person eating lemon eats Almond-Milk.

7. From point 6, we know that the architect is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the architect can't be in the Almond-Milk row (it's already filled), the architect must be in another row. The only available row is the one with Cola, so the architect drinks Cola.

8. From point 7, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the drama movies row is already filled with Comedy, the owner of the cat must be in the Drama row. So, the cat owner eats Lemon.

9. From point 8, we know that the person eating lemon is the person watching drama movies. This contradicts our previous placement of the person eating lemon. So, our initial assumption about the sport order (Parkour, Sailing, Climbing, Weightlifting) was incorrect. Let's try Parkour, Weightlifting, Sailing, Climbing instead.

10. From point 10, we know that the person eating pumpkin is on the far right. Since the only available spot on the far right is the one with Mirinda (weightlifting), the person eating pumpkin is the one drinking Mirinda (weightlifting).

11. From point 11, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. So, the sport columns must be in the order: Parkour, Weightlifting, Sailing, Climbing.

12. The rest of the placements can be made based on the remaining clues. Here is the final solution:

Lv3-7x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the coach on the far left (position 1) as per condition 4.
2. Since the coach can't be the person drinking milk (as milk is on the left of skateboarding and coach is on the far left), the coach can only drink water, 7up, or lemonade. Let's assume the coach drinks water (position 1, row 6).
3. Now, the person drinking milk must be in position 3 or 4. If the person drinking milk is in position 3, the person skateboarding must be in position 2. But this would mean the coach is not on the far left (contradicting condition 4). So, the person drinking milk is in position 4.
4. The person skateboarding must be in position 2, and the person on the left of skateboarding is drinking milk (position 1).
5. The person driving the quad-bike (who is drinking lemonade, as per condition 3) must be in position 3 or 4. If the person driving the quad-bike is in position 3, the person driving the scooter must be in position 2. But this would mean the person driving the scooter is on the right of the person drinking water (contradicting condition 5). So, the person driving the quad-bike is in position 4.
6. The person driving the scooter must be in position 2.
7. The person driving the subway must be in position 1 or 3. If the person driving the subway is in position 1, the fisherman must be in position 4. But this would mean the person driving the subway is not on the left of the fisherman (contradicting condition 11). So, the person driving the subway is in position 3.
8. The fisherman must be in position 4.
9. The person playing soccer must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the person playing soccer is in position 1, the fan of salsa must be in position 4. But this would mean the person playing soccer is not on the left or right of the fan of salsa (contradicting condition 13). So, the person playing soccer is in position 2.
10. The fan of blues can't be in position 1 (as it would mean the fan of blues is between the fan of punk and the person playing soccer, but the fan of blues is not between them). The fan of blues can't be in position 4 (as it would mean the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person playing soccer, but the fan of blues is not on the left or right of the person playing soccer). So, the fan of blues is in position 3.
11. The fan of punk can't be in position 1 (as it would mean the fan of blues is between the fan of punk and the person playing soccer, but the fan of blues is not between them). The fan of punk can't be in position 4 (as it would mean the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person playing soccer, but the fan of punk is not on the left or right of the person playing soccer). So, the fan of punk is in position 2.
12. The fan of rock can't be in position 1 (as it would mean the fan of rock is on the left or right of the entrepreneur, but the fan of rock is not on the left or right of the entrepreneur). The fan of rock can't be in position 4 (as it would mean the fan of rock is on the left or right of the entrepreneur, but the fan of rock is not on the left or right of the entrepreneur).

Lv3-7x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking 7up is Brazilian. Let's place the Brazilian in the first position (1).

2. From rule 18, the person eating grapes is on the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the Brazilian is eating 7up, the person eating grapes must be in position 3 or 4. If the person eating grapes is in position 3, the person eating eggplant must be in position 1 or 2. But that would mean the Brazilian is not in position 1, which contradicts rule 13. So, the person eating grapes is in position 4, and the person eating eggplant is in position 2.

3. From rule 11, the person eating peas is the owner of the bird. Since the person eating grapes is in position 4, the person eating peas must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the person eating peas is in position 1, the person eating eggplant must be in position 2, which means the Brazilian is not in position 1, contradicting rule 13. If the person eating peas is in position 2, the person eating grapes must be in position 4, which we already know. So, the person eating peas must be in position 3.

4. From rule 14, the person drinking 7up is the owner of the bird. Since the Brazilian is drinking 7up and is in position 1, the bird must be with the Brazilian. So, the bird is in position 1.

5. From rule 15, the Indian is on the far right. Since the Brazilian is in position 1, the Indian must be in position 4.

6. From rule 16, the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Brazilian is drinking 7up and is not drinking hot-chocolate, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the person watching thriller movies is in position 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, but that would mean the Brazilian is not in position 1, contradicting rule 13. If the person watching thriller movies is in position 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 4, which means the Indian is watching thriller movies, but that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, the person watching thriller movies is in position 4.

7. From rule 12, the person driving the bus is on the left or right of the British. Since the British is not in position 1 (because the Brazilian is there), the British must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the British is in position 2, the person driving the bus must be in position 1, but that would mean the Brazilian is not in position 1, contradicting rule 13. If the British is in position 3, the person driving the bus must be in position 4, but that would mean the Indian is driving the bus, which is not possible because the Indian is in position 4. So, the British is in position 4, and the person driving the bus is in position 2.

8. From rule 1, the freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in position 4, the freelancer can be in position 3 or 4. If the freelancer is in position 3, the person driving the quad-bike (which the freelancer owns, from rule 2) must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But that would mean the Brazilian is not in position 1, contradicting rule 13. So, the freelancer is in position 4, and the person driving the quad-bike is in position 1.

9. From rule 3, the teacher is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the teacher can be in position 1 or 3. If the teacher is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, the teacher is in position 3, and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2.

10. From rule 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the Brazilian is drinking 7up and is in position 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2, 3, or 4. If the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2, the person drinking 7up must be in position 1, which means the Brazilian is not in position 1, contradicting rule 13. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, and the person drinking 7up is in position 1.

11. From rule 9, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1 or 2. If the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 2, and the person drinking water is in position 4.

12. From rule 10, the person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the turtle. Since the analyst is the owner of the turtle (from rule 4), the person drinking water must be in position 3 or 4. If the person drinking water is in position 3, the analyst must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, the person drinking water is in position 4, and the analyst is in position 1.

13. From rule 8, the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the British. Since the British is in position 4, the person driving the ship must be in position 1, 2, or 3. If the person driving the ship is in position 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, the person driving the ship is in position 2, and the person driving the snowmobile is in position 3.

14. From rule 7, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1 and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

15. From rule 10, the person drinking water is on the right of the owner of the turtle. Since the analyst is the owner of the turtle and is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in position 3 or 4. But that would mean the Indian is not in position 4, contradicting rule 15. So, this rule is a contradiction and cannot be satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know the number of items for each category, so we can fill in the categories with their respective items.

| Transport     | bus        | quad-bike   | ship        | train     |

2. From rule 3, we know the mechanic is on the far right. So, mechanic must be in the 4th position.

| Transport     | bus        | quad-bike   | ship        | train     |

3. From rule 11, we know that the person doing magic-tricks is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the mechanic is in the 4th position, and the mechanic is not the person doing magic-tricks (rule 3), the person doing magic-tricks must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

   If the person doing magic-tricks is in the 2nd position, then the person drinking cola must be in the 1st position and the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in the 4th position. However, this contradicts rule 5, as the person drinking water is the person who's hobby is skydiving.

   So, the person doing magic-tricks must be in the 3rd position.

|               |      1       |       2       |     3     |      4      |

4. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. So, the person in the 3rd position is drinking hot-chocolate.

5. From rule 15, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the lawyer. Since the mechanic is in the 4th position, the lawyer must be in the 2nd position.

|               |      1       |       2       |     3     |      4      |

6. From rule 16, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since the lawyer is in the 2nd position and the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the lawyer, the person watching horror movies must be in the 3rd position.

7. From rule 2, we know that the manager is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since the manager is in the 2nd position and the person watching horror movies is in the 3rd position, the manager must be in the 2nd position.

8. From rule 17, we know that the person doing magic-tricks is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching horror movies is in the 3rd position and the person watching adventure movies must be in the 1st position (as there are only 4 positions and all other positions are filled), the person doing magic-tricks must be in the 4th position.
