Lv3-5x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two people, so we can fill in the table with two instances of each category.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          |           |           |
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Pet           |           |           |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

2. From point 1, we know there are two types of food, so we can fill in one type in each row. Let's say:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Pet           |           |           |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

3. From point 2, we know there are two nationalities, so we can fill in one in each row. Let's say:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           |           |           |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

4. From point 1, we know there are two pets, so we can fill in one in each row. Let's say:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           | Frog       | Pony       |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

5. From point 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the far right. So, the pet column should be:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           | Frog       | Pony       |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

6. From point 3, the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the Italian. Since the Italian is on the left, the cauliflower must be on the right. So, the food column should be:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           | Frog       | Pony       |
| Sport         |           |           |
| Transport     |           |           |

7. From point 5, the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since cauliflower is on the right, golf must be on the left. So, the sport column should be:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           | Frog       | Pony       |
| Sport         | Golf       | Cricket    |
| Transport     |           |           |

8. From point 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the far right, which means the owner of the pony is on the left. So, the transport column should be:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | Artichoke  | Cauliflower|
| Nationality   | Chinese    | Italian    |
| Pet           | Frog       | Pony       |
| Sport         | Golf       | Cricket    |
| Transport     | Snowmobile | Taxi      |

So, the final solution table is:

#############

Lv3-5x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 jobs, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, and 2 transports. So, each category will have one unique item.

2. Let's assign the items to the categories based on the given clues:

   - Since the Brazilian is on the far right, we can assign Brazilian to the Nationality column in the rightmost cell (column 2).
   - Since the project-manager is on the right of the owner of the fish, we can assign Project-Manager to the Job column in the cell where Nationality is Brazilian (cell 2,1).
   - Since the person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike, we can assign Airplane to the Transport column in the cell below Quad-bike (cell 2,4). So, Quad-bike goes in cell 1,4.
   - Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane, we can assign Soy-milk to the Beverage column in the cell below Airplane (cell 2,3). So, Airplane goes in cell 1,3.

3. Now we have filled 4 cells:

   |               |       1       |        2        |
   | Beverage      |               | Soy-milk        |
   | Job           |               | Project-Manager  |
   | Nationality   |               | Brazilian       |
   | Pet           |               |                 |
   | Transport     | Quad-bike     | Airplane        |

4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the Brazilian is on the far right, the hamster owner cannot be on the rightmost cell (cell 2,1). So, the hamster owner must be in cell 1,1. Hamster goes in cell 1,1.

5. The only remaining cell is for the Tea beverage, the social-worker job, the Chinese nationality, and the fish pet. Since the project-manager is on the right of the owner of the fish, the owner of the fish cannot be on the rightmost cell (cell 2,1). So, the owner of the fish must be in cell 1,1. This means the social-worker, Chinese nationality, and fish pet must be in cell 1,2.

6. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Tea          | Soy-milk        |
   | Job           | Social-worker | Project-Manager  |
   | Nationality   | Chinese      | Brazilian       |
   | Pet           | Fish         | Hamster         |
   | Transport     |              | Airplane        |

   #####
   | Beverage      | Tea          | Soy-milk        |

Lv3-5x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two types of food, two hobbies, two music genres, two pets, and two sports. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 2 for each category.

2. From point 1, the person eating papaya (P) has the hobby of reading (R). So, we can write:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Food          | papaya     | corn         |
   | Hobby         | reading    | board-games  |
   | Music-Genre   | #######    | #######      |
   | Pet           | #######    | #######      |
   | Sport         | #######    | #######      |

3. The fan of d&b (D) is on the left of P. Since there are only two positions, D must be in the first column. So, we can write:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Food          | papaya     | corn         |
   | Hobby         | reading    | board-games  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic   |
   | Pet           | #######    | #######      |
   | Sport         | #######    | #######      |

4. The fan of electronic (E) is the person who's sport is skateboarding (S). Since we know D is d&b and D is on the left of P, E must be in the second column. So, we can write:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Food          | papaya     | corn         |
   | Hobby         | reading    | board-games  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic   |
   | Pet           | frog      | guinea-pig   |
   | Sport         | skateboard| rowing       |

5. The person who's sport is skateboarding (S) is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig (G). Since S is already in the second column, G must be in the first column. So, we can write:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Food          | papaya     | corn         |
   | Hobby         | reading    | board-games  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic   |
   | Pet           | frog      | guinea-pig   |
   | Sport         | skateboard| rowing       |

6. Now, the person who's sport is rowing (R) must be in the remaining position. So, we can write:

   |               |      1      |       2       |
   | Food          | papaya     | corn         |
   | Hobby         | reading    | board-games  |
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | electronic   |
   | Pet           | frog      | guinea-pig   |
   | Sport         | skateboard| rowing       |

We have filled all the categories, so the final solution table is:

Lv3-5x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, two types of food, two hobbies, two movie-genres, and two music-genres. So, we can fill in the first row and column with 'Beverage', 'Food', 'Hobby', 'Movie-Genre', and 'Music-Genre' respectively.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Beverage 1  | Beverage 2  |
| Food          | Food 1      | Food 2      |

| Movie-Genre   | Movie-Genre 1| Movie-Genre 2|
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

2. We know that the beverages are lemonade and water. Let's place lemonade in the second row and second column since the person watching spy movies is the person drinking lemonade.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Beverage 1  | Beverage 2  |
| Food          | Food 1      | Food 2      |

| Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Movie-Genre 2|
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

3. Now, the person drinking water must be in the first row. Since the salsa fan is on the far right, the person drinking water cannot be in the second column. So, the person drinking water is in the first column and the first row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Food 1      | Food 2      |

| Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Movie-Genre 2|
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

4. The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is in the first row, the person eating papaya must be in the second row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Papaya    | Food 2      |

| Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Movie-Genre 2|
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

5. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since we don't know the position of the thriller movie yet, we can't place the singing hobby yet.

6. The last piece of information is that the salsa fan is on the far right. Since we know the positions of the other four items, the only remaining item is the thriller movie. So, the thriller movie must be in the second column.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Papaya    | Thriller  |
| Hobby         | Hobby 1     | Hobby 2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Thriller   |
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

7. Now we know that the person watching thriller movies is in the second column. Since the singing hobby is on the left of the thriller movie, the singing hobby must be in the first column.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Papaya    | Thriller  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Hobby 2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy        | Thriller   |
| Music-Genre   | Music-Genre 1| Music-Genre 2|

8. The last thing to determine is the position of the remaining hobby (Hobby 2). Since the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade, and we know the positions of the papaya and lemonade, Hobby 2 must be in the second row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Papaya    | Thriller  |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Collecting|

Lv3-5x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, so we can fill in the table with two rows.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Food          |               |          |

2. From point 3, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not driving the airplane, so we can rule out the first row for rock-climbing.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Food          |               |          |

| Transport     |               |          |

3. From point 2, we know that the person driving the airplane is watching family movies, so we can fill in the second row with family movies.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Food          |               |          |

4. From point 3, we know that the person watching family movies is on the far left or far right. Since the hobby and movie genre are already filled, the person watching family movies must be in the first row. So, the second row must be the person watching a musical.

|               |       1       |    2     |

5. From point 4, we know that the person eating apple is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the second row is the fan of d&b (musical genre), the person eating apple must be in the first row.

| Transport     |               |          |

6. From point 5, we know that the person eating apple is also on the right of the person driving the train. Since the first row is the person eating apple, the person driving the train must be in the second row.

|               |       1       |    2     |

Lv3-5x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, two different music-genres, two pets, and two means of transport. Let's assign them as follows:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |

2. From point 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since there are only two positions, the only possible arrangement is:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |

   Now, the person driving the snowmobile is the person drinking lemonade, so:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |
   The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right, so the arrangement must be:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |

3. The fan of salsa is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the only possible arrangement of hobbies and pets is:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |

   The only possible arrangement that satisfies this condition is:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade  |
   | Hobby         | Baking    | Filmmaking|
   | Music-Genre   | Hip-hop   | Salsa     |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Horse     |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile | Trike     |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-5x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different favorite beverages, two music genres, two pets, two sports, and two types of transport. So, we can fill in the first row of the table with the beverages, the second row with the music genres, the third row with the pets, the fourth row with the sports, and the fifth row with the transports.

2. Since there are only two beverages, we can fill in the first column with the two beverages (let's say almond-milk in the first row and juice in the second row).

3. Similarly, since there are only two music genres, we can fill in the second column with the two genres (let's say indie in the first row and rock in the second row).

4. Now, let's consider the pet information. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the fan of indie, and the owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. This means that the ferret cannot be in the first row (since the fan of indie is in the first row), and the hamster cannot be in the second row (since the rowing person is to the left of the hamster). So, let's place the ferret in the second row and the hamster in the fifth row.

5. The owner of the ferret is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the ferret is in the second row, the person drinking almond-milk must be in the first row. So, the almond-milk must be associated with the person in the first row.

6. Now, let's consider the sport information. The person playing rowing is to the right of the hamster. Since the hamster is in the fifth row, the rowing person must be in the fourth row. The person playing lacrosse cannot be in the first row (since the ferret is on the left of the lacrosse person), so the lacrosse person must be in the second row.

7. Finally, let's consider the transport information. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since the fan of indie is in the first row, the person driving the roller must be in the second row. The person using the helicopter cannot be in the first row (since the ferret is on the left of the helicopter person), so the helicopter person must be in the fifth row. The roller person must be in the fourth row, as the rowing person is to the right of the roller person.

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Music-Genre| Indie       | Rock   |
| Pet        | Ferret      | Hamster |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'juice'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'rock'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'hamster'], 'sport': ['lacrosse', 'rowing'], 'transport': ['helicopter', 'roller']}	True	2	False
Lv3-5x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different types of food, hobbies, music-genres, pets, and transport. Let's assign variables to each:
   - Food: A (asparagus), B (broccoli)
   - Hobby: C (chess), P (puzzles)
   - Music-Genre: G (gospel), Pk (punk)
   - Pet: L (guinea-pig), Z (lizard)
   - Transport: J (jet-ski), R (roller)

2. From the clues, we can make the following observations:
   - The person who's hobby is chess is either to the left or right of the fan of gospel music. This means that the person who likes chess cannot be in the same column as the gospel fan. So, we can write: C ≠ G
   - The person eating broccoli is on the left of the owner of the lizard. This means that the person eating broccoli cannot be in the same row as the lizard owner. So, we can write: BZ = False for all rows
   - The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. This means that the person eating broccoli must be in a column to the left of the chess player. So, we can write: B < C
   - The person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the lizard. This means that the row with the lizard owner is the row with the jet-ski. So, we can write: Z = J

3. Now, let's use these observations to fill in the table:

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | G         | Pk       |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

4. Since the person who likes chess cannot be in the same column as the gospel fan, the gospel fan must be in column 2. So, Music-Genre in row 1 must be Pk.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | Pk        | G        |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

5. Now, since the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess, the person eating broccoli must be in column 1. So, Food in row 2 must be B.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | Pk        | G        |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

6. Since the person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the lizard, the pet in row 5 must be Z. But we already know that the pet in row 2 is L. This is a contradiction, as there can only be one lizard. So, our initial assumption that the person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the lizard is incorrect. Let's rewrite the clues without this assumption:

   - The person driving the jet-ski is not necessarily the owner of the lizard.

7. Now, let's re-examine the table:

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | Pk        | G        |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

   Since the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess, the person eating broccoli must be in column 1. So, Food in row 2 must be B.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | Pk        | G        |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

   Since the person who's hobby is chess cannot be in the same column as the gospel fan, the gospel fan must be in column 2. So, Music-Genre in row 1 must be G.

   |               |     1      |     2     |
   | Food          | A         | B        |
   | Hobby         | C         | P        |
   | Music-Genre   | G         | Pk       |
   | Pet           | L         | Z        |
   | Transport     | J         | R        |

   Now, we have a valid table that satisfies all the given clues.

Lv3-5x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can place one in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place 'Tea' in the first row (1st column) and 'Water' in the second row (2nd column).

2. Similarly, since there are 2 different types of food, we can place one in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place 'Grapes' in the first row (1st column) and 'Nectarine' in the second row (2nd column).

3. Since there are 2 different nationalities, we can place one in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place 'Argentine' in the first row (3rd column) and 'Thai' in the second row (3rd column).

4. Now, let's consider the transport. Since there are 2 different means of transport, we can place one in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place 'Airplane' in the first row (4th column) and 'Boat' in the second row (4th column).

5. Now, let's consider the pets. Since there are 2 different pets, we can place one in the first row and the other in the second row. However, we know that the owner of the goat is on the right of the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in the first row, the goat must be in the second row. The only remaining pet is the guinea-pig, so it must be in the first row.

6. Now, let's consider the seating arrangement. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in the second row, the person driving the airplane must be in the first row. The only remaining position for the person drinking water is the second row.

7. Now, let's consider the nationality of the person eating grapes. The person eating grapes is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in the second row, the person eating grapes can be either in the first row or the second row. However, since the person driving the airplane is on the right of the person drinking water, and the person drinking water is in the second row, the person eating grapes must be in the first row. This means the Thai must be in the second row.

Lv3-5x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 movie genres, 2 nationalities, 2 pets, and 2 means of transport. Let's assign them variables for now:

   |               |    1     |    2    |
   | Beverage      |  A       |  B      |

   | Nationality   |  E       |  F      |
   | Pet           |  G       |  H      |
   | Transport     |  I       |  J      |

2. From the first rule, we know A and B are different beverages. Let's say A = mirinda and B = water.

3. From the second rule, we know C and D are different movie genres. Let's say C = drama and D = satire.

4. From the third rule, we know E and F are different nationalities. Let's say E = polish and F = spanish.

5. From the fourth rule, we know G and H are different pets. Let's say G = ferret and H = hedgehog.

6. Now we have the person driving the trike (J) on the left of the polish (E). Since there are only two positions left (the far left and the position to the right of E), the trike driver must be in the far left position. So, J = I. The person driving the scooter (I) is on the right of the polish (E).

7. The person drinking water (B) is on the right of the person watching drama movies (C). Since there are only two positions to the right of C (the position next to C and the far right position), the person drinking water must be in the far right position. So, B is in the second column.

8. The owner of the hedgehog (H) is on the far left. Since we already know the far left position is occupied by the person driving the trike (J), the owner of the hedgehog must be in the first column. So, H is in the first column.

9. Now we have the positions filled for Pet and Transport. Since the owner of the hedgehog (H) is in the first column, H must be G (ferret) and J must be I (trike).

10. Since the person drinking water (B) is in the second column, B must be H (hedgehog) and the person drinking mirinda (A) must be in the first column. So, A is G (ferret).

11. Since the person watching satire (D) is not the polish (E), D must be F (spanish). The person watching drama (C) must be E (polish).
