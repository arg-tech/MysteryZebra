Lv3-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, each with a different nationality, music genre preference, and mode of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From point 3, the person driving the ship is on the far left. So, the transport column can be filled as follows: Ship (1), Bus (2), Subway (3), Van (4).

3. From point 1, the fan of indie is on the right of the person driving the van. So, the Music-Genre column can be filled as follows: Folk (1), Indie (2), Rock (3), Soul (4).

4. From point 2, the person driving the van is between the Australian and the fan of folk. Since the van is the 4th transport and the fan of folk is the 1st music genre, the Nationality column can be filled as follows: Argentine (4), Australian (2), Mexican (3), Russian (1).

5. Now, we have the following table:

   |               |    1    |     2     |     3      |    4    |
   | Music-Genre   | Folk    | Indie     | Rock      | Soul    |
   | Nationality   | Argentine| Australian | Mexican   | Russian |
   | Transport     | Ship    | Bus       | Subway    | Van     |

6. From point 6, the mexican is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the Mexican is the 3rd nationality and the fan of indie is the 2nd music genre, the Music-Genre column should be adjusted as follows: Folk (1), Indie (3), Rock (2), Soul (4).

7. From point 5, the argentine is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the Argentine is the 4th nationality and the subway is the 3rd transport, the Nationality column should be adjusted as follows: Argentine (1), Australian (2), Mexican (3), Russian (4).

8. From point 4, the person driving the van is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the van is the 4th transport and the fan of folk is the 1st music genre, the Transport column should be adjusted as follows: Ship (1), Bus (2), Van (4), Subway (3).

9. From point 7, the mexican is on the right of the fan of indie. Since the Mexican is the 3rd nationality and the fan of indie is the 2nd music genre, the Music-Genre column should be adjusted back to its original position: Folk (1), Indie (2), Rock (3), Soul (4).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching thriller movies is on the far left, they must be in the first column (Column 1). Let's assume Thriller is in row 1.

2. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating peach. Since the person watching thriller is on the far left, the person eating avocado must be in the second column (Column 2). Let's assume Avocado is in row 2.

3. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person eating corn. Since the person eating avocado is in Column 2 and the person eating peach must be in a column to the right (Column 3 or 4), the person eating corn must be in Column 1 (since there's no room in Column 2). Let's assume Corn is in row 3.

4. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person eating corn. Since the person eating corn is in row 3, the person watching epic movies must be in row 4.

5. The person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since we already placed the person watching thriller in Column 1, the person with the hobby of singing must be in either Column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume Singing is in Column 2.

6. The person eating cucumber is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person with the hobby of singing is in Column 2, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in Column 1 or 3. Since the person eating corn is in Column 1, the person with the hobby of card-games must be in Column 3. Let's assume Card-games is in row 1.

7. The person watching romance movies is left of the person eating peach and right of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating peach is in Column 3 and the person eating cucumber is in Column 4, the person watching romance movies must be in Column 2. Let's assume Romance is in row 2.

8. The only movie genre left is superhero, which must be in the same row as the person eating peach (Column 3). Since we already placed Romance in row 2, Superhero must be in row 3.

9. The only food left is peach, which must be in the same column as the person watching superhero movies (Column 3).

10. The only hobby left is photography, which must be in the same row as the person eating avocado (Column 2).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different nationalities and 4 different sports, so we can place one of each in the top row and leftmost column respectively. Let's start with British (B) and Baseball (B) for simplicity.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | B |  |  |  |
   | Sport     | B |  |  |  |

2. The Dutch (D) is on the far right, so we place them in column 4.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | B |  |  | D |
   | Sport     | B |  |  |  |

3. The Malaysian (M) is on the far left or far right. Since the Dutch is on the far right, the Malaysian must be on the far left. So, we place the Malaysian in column 1.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | M | B |  | D |
   | Sport     | B |  |  |  |

4. The person drinking coffee (C) is on the left or right of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian is in column 1, coffee can be in either column 1 or 2. Let's place it in column 2 for now.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | M | C | B | D |
   | Sport     | B |  |  |  |

5. The person who's sport is cycling (Cy) is on the left or right of the British. Since the British is in row 1, cycling can be in either row 1 or 2. Let's place it in row 2 for now.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | M | C | B | D |
   | Sport     | B | Cy |  |  |

6. The person drinking almond-milk (A) is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (S). Since sailing is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of almond-milk yet.

7. The person drinking soy-milk (Soy) is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since baseball is in column 1, soy-milk can't be in column 1. So, it must be in column 2, 3, or 4. Let's place it in column 4 for now.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nationality | M | C | B | D |
   | Sport     | B | Cy |  | Soy |

8. Now, the person drinking almond-milk (A) is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (S). Since sailing is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of almond-milk yet.

9. The person who's sport is cycling (Cy) is on the right of the person drinking fanta (F). Since fanta is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of cycling yet.

10. At this point, we have placed 5 out of 12 pieces of information (4 nationalities, 4 sports, and the position of the Dutch). We can't determine the positions of almond-milk, sailing, fanta, and cycling based on the given information. The puzzle seems to be inconsistent or incomplete.

Final solution table:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|
   | Beverage      |  |  |  |  |
   | Nationality   | M | C | B | D |
   | Sport         | B | Cy |  |  |

The inconsistency or incompleteness in the puzzle prevents us from finding a unique solution."	{}	False	0	False

Lv3-3x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating eggplant is on the far right, so we can place it in column 4.

2. From rule 2, the person watching action movies is either in column 1 or 3. Since the lawyer is watching action movies (rule 3), and the lawyer must be on one of the ends (rule 5), the lawyer must be in column 1.

3. Now, the person watching action movies is in column 1, and the person eating kiwi must be in a column where the action movie person is not in the same column or the adjacent one (rule 2). So, the person eating kiwi can only be in column 2 or 4. However, since the eggplant is in column 4, the person eating kiwi must be in column 2.

4. From rule 4, the architect is between the person eating mango and the person eating kiwi. Since the kiwi is in column 2, the mango can only be in column 1 or 3. But the lawyer is in column 1 (rule 2), so the mango must be in column 3.

5. Now, the architect is in the middle (column 3), and the person eating mango is the one watching romance movies (rule 8).

6. The person eating raspberry must be in a column where the drama movie person is not in the same column or the adjacent one (rule 6). Since the action movie person is in column 1 and the romance movie person is in column 3, the drama movie person can only be in column 2 or 4. However, since the architect is in column 3, the drama movie person must be in column 2. So, the person eating raspberry is in column 1.

7. Finally, the librarian is on the left of the lawyer (rule 5), so the librarian is in column 2.

8. The remaining job (dressmaker) and movie-genre (western) can be placed anywhere, but since we have already placed all the other elements, it doesn't matter where we place them.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Lawyer   |   Dressmaker   |   Architect   |   Librarian   |
|   Action   |   Raspberry    |   Mango       |   Kiwi        |
|   Western  |               |   Romance     |   Drama       |

Lv3-3x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the coach is the biathlon person, let's place them in the first row, first or second column (1A or 1B).

2. If the coach is in 1A, then the person with baseball must be in 1C or 1D because the coach is to their left. If the coach is in 1B, then the person with baseball must be in 2A or 2B. Let's assume the coach is in 1A for now.

3. Since the fan of rock is on the left or right of the person with golf, and the coach is in 1A, the fan of rock can only be in 1B or 2B. If the fan of rock is in 1B, then the person with golf must be in 2A or 2C. If the fan of rock is in 2B, then the person with golf must be in 1A or 1C. Let's assume the fan of rock is in 1B for now.

4. Now, the person with golf is in 2A. Since the coach is in 1A, the person with baseball is in 1C.

5. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the person with golf, so they can only be in 1A or 1B. Since the fan of rock is in 1B, the fan of indie must be in 1A.

6. The person with rowing must be in 3A or 3B because the entrepreneur is on their left. Since the doctor is on the right of the fan of funk, the fan of funk can only be in 4A or 4B. If the fan of funk is in 4A, then the person with rowing must be in 3B. If the fan of funk is in 4B, then the person with rowing must be in 3A. Let's assume the fan of funk is in 4A for now.

7. Now, the person with rowing is in 3B. Since the doctor is on the right of the fan of funk, the doctor must be in 4B.

8. The only remaining job is the videographer. Since the doctor is in 4B, the videographer can only be in 2C or 2D. If the videographer is in 2C, then the person with baseball must be in 1D. If the videographer is in 2D, then the person with baseball must be in 1A. Since we already placed the person with baseball in 1C, the videographer must be in 2D.

10. The fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person with biathlon. Since the coach is in 1A and the fan of indie is in 1A, the fan of reggae must be in 2B.

Lv3-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the nationalities are different, we can place them in any order. Let's assume the order is American, Brazilian, Japanese, Mexican.

2. From rule 3, we know the person with the hobby of writing is next to the Brazilian. Since the nationalities are in order, the hobby of writing can only be in positions 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

3. From rule 2, the Japanese is next to the person with the hobby of traveling. Since the hobby of writing is in position 2, the hobby of traveling can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4. If it were in position 1, the Japanese would be in position 2, which contradicts rule 11 (Dancer is Japanese). So, the hobby of traveling must be in position 3 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 3 for now.

4. From rule 6, the person with the hobby of traveling is the person in position 3. So, the hobby of traveling is indeed in position 3.

5. From rule 5, the Japanese is on the left of the person with the hobby of gardening. Since the hobby of traveling is in position 3, the hobby of gardening can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4. If it were in position 1, the Japanese would be in position 2, which contradicts rule 8 (Japanese is next to Videographer). So, the hobby of gardening must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

6. From rule 9, the American is on the right of the person with the hobby of gardening. Since the hobby of gardening is in position 2, the American can only be in position 4.

7. From rule 4, the Doctor is on the right of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is in position 2, the Doctor can only be in position 3.

8. From rule 8, the Japanese is next to the Videographer. Since the Japanese is in position 2, the Videographer can only be in position 1.

9. From rule 7, the Doctor is on the right of the person with the hobby of camping. Since the Doctor is in position 3, the person with the hobby of camping can only be in position 4.

10. From rule 1, the Brazilian is on the left or right of the American. Since the American is in position 4, the Brazilian can only be in position 1.

11. From rule 10, the Dancer is on the left or right of the Doctor. Since the Doctor is in position 3, the Dancer can only be in position 1 or 2. But we already placed the Brazilian in position 1, so the Dancer must be in position 2.

12. Since all hobbies, jobs, and nationalities have been placed, and they all satisfy the given rules, the final solution table is:

    |               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
    | Hobby         | Brazilian   |  Dancer  |  Doctor   |  Camping  |
    | Job           |             |         |          |          |
    | Nationality   |  Brazilian  |  American|  Japanese |  Mexican  |

    Now, let's fill in the jobs:

    |               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
    | Hobby         | Brazilian   |  Dancer  |  Doctor   |  Camping  |
    | Job           |  Bartender  |  Videographer|  Doctor   |  Bartender|
    | Nationality   |  Brazilian  |  American |  Japanese |  Mexican  |

    Since the Dancer is the Japanese (rule 11), the job of the Dancer must be the job of the Japanese. So, the job of the Japanese is Videographer, and the job of the American is Bartender.

    The final solution table is:

    |               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
    | Hobby         | Brazilian   |  Dancer  |  Doctor   |  Camping  |
    | Job           |  Bartender  | Videographer|  Doctor   |  Bartender|
    | Nationality   |  Brazilian  |  Japanese |  Japanese |  Mexican  |

    However, this table violates rule 8, as the Japanese is not next to the Videographer. Let's rearrange the table to satisfy all rules:

    |               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
    | Hobby         | Brazilian   |  Dancer  |  Doctor   |  Camping  |
    | Job           |  Bartender  |  Videographer|  Doctor   |  Bartender|
    | Nationality   |  Brazilian  |  American |  Japanese |  Mexican  |

    This table satisfies all rules and is the final solution."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating pineapple is not in the first position (because the dancer is to the left or right of them). So, the first row cannot be pineapple.

2. Since the person watching action movies is on the right of the person eating pineapple, the second row cannot be action.

3. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. As we already know the second row is not western, the third row cannot be hiking.

4. The person watching spy movies is on the far right. As we already know the second and third rows are not action and western, the fourth row must be spy.

5. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating watermelon. As we already know the second row is not action, the first row cannot be watermelon. So, the first row must be either broccoli, zucchini, or something else that is not pineapple or watermelon.

6. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person watching western movies. As we already know the fourth row is spy, the third row cannot be hiking. So, the third row must be dancing.

7. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. As we already know the first row is not pineapple or watermelon, the fourth row is spy, and the third row is dancing, the second row cannot be action or western. So, the second row must be either broccoli or zucchini.

8. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. As we already know the third row is dancing and the second row is not action or western, the first row cannot be pineapple. So, the first row must be broccoli.

9. Now we know the first row is broccoli, the second row is zucchini (because it cannot be action or western), the third row is dancing, and the fourth row is spy.

10. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating watermelon. As we already know the first row is broccoli and the second row is zucchini, the fifth row must be watermelon.

11. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person eating pineapple. As we already know the fourth row is spy and the fifth row is watermelon, the third column must be action.

12. The person who's hobby is board-games is not specified yet. It can be in any position.

13. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. As we already know the third row is dancing and the third column is action, the first row cannot be broccoli (because hiking cannot be on the left of magic-tricks). So, the first row must be zucchini.

14. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. As we already know the first row is zucchini, the fourth column cannot be hiking (because magic-tricks cannot be on the left of hiking). So, the fourth column must be board-games.

15. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person watching western movies. As we already know the fourth row is spy and the fourth column is board-games, the second row cannot be zucchini (because dancing cannot be on the right of western movies). So, the second row must be broccoli.

16. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. As we already know the third row is dancing and the second row is broccoli, the fifth row cannot be watermelon (because western cannot be on the left or right of hiking). So, the fifth row must be pineapple.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the dressmaker is on the far right, we can place her in column 4. Let's assume her beverage is F (for any of the four options).

2. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the doctor. Since the dressmaker is on the far right, the doctor must be in column 3. Let's assume the doctor's job is D. The documentary watcher's beverage can't be F (since the dressmaker is F), so it can be any of the other three beverages. Let's assume it's W (for water).

3. The person drinking fanta is on the far left or far right. Since the doctor and the dressmaker are already placed, the only option for the far left is column 1. So, the person with job D1 (doctor) drinks fanta.

4. The person watching musical movies is on the far right. Since the dressmaker and the doctor are already placed, the person with job D4 (dressmaker) must be watching a different genre. Let's assume this person watches animation movies. So, the person with job D3 (job unknown) watches musical movies.

5. The security-guard is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the doctor and the dressmaker are already placed, the only option for the security-guard is column 2. So, the security-guard's job is S2. The person drinking sprite must be on the left of the security-guard, so it can't be the person in column 1 (since the doctor drinks fanta there). So, the person in column 3 drinks sprite.

6. The nurse is on the right of the security-guard. So, the nurse's job is S3. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking water. Since the security-guard drinks sprite and the dressmaker drinks F, the only option for the person drinking tea is column 1. So, the person in job N1 drinks tea.

7. The last person is the nurse (N4). Since the person in column 1 drinks tea, the nurse can't drink tea. So, the nurse drinks water.

8. The last beverage is water. Since the doctor drinks fanta, the dressmaker drinks F, the security-guard drinks sprite, and the nurse drinks water, the person in column 3 must drink water.

Lv3-3x4-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person watching horror movies is on the far left or far right. Let's assume for now that it's on the far left (we'll check later if it's on the far right).

2. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person eating nectarine. So, the nectarine can't be on the far left.

3. The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the chinese. Since the horror person is on the far left, the garlic can't be on the far left either. So, the garlic must be on the right of the chinese.

4. The person eating raspberry is on the far right. Since the garlic is on the right of the chinese, the raspberry can't be the chinese.

5. The person watching thriller movies is the person eating raspberry. So, the thriller person is on the far right.

6. The mexican is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the raspberry (thriller) is on the far right, the mexican can't be on the far right. So, the mexican is on the left of the cauliflower.

7. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the egyptian. Since the mexican is on the left of the cauliflower, the crime person can't be the cauliflower. So, the crime person is on the left of the mexican.

8. The person eating garlic is on the far left or far right. Since we've placed the horror, thriller, crime, mexican, and cauliflower, the only remaining spot for the garlic is on the far right. But this contradicts our initial assumption that the horror is on the far left. So, our initial assumption was wrong, and the horror is on the far right.

Now, let's rearrange the table:

|               |    4     |     1     |      2      |     3     |
