Lv3-1x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, fanta and soy-milk.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is either on the far left or far right. Since there are only two positions, if one is occupied by soy-milk, the other must be fanta.

3. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

4. If the soy-milk drinker is on the far left, then fanta must be on the right, but this would mean both are on the same side, which contradicts the rule that the soy-milk drinker is on the far left or far right. So, the soy-milk drinker cannot be on the far left.

5. Therefore, the soy-milk drinker must be on the far right. This means fanta must be on the left.

The final solution table is:

  |            |    1     |   2   |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | fanta |

So, the solution is:

#############
|            |    1     |   2   |
|------------|----------|-------|
| Beverage   | soy-milk | fanta |

Lv3-1x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the two jobs are architect and electrician.

2. From the first rule, we know that the architect is either on the left or right of the electrician. If the architect were on the left, the electrician would have to be on the right, which would violate the second rule (the electrician is on the right of the architect). So, the architect must be on the right.

3. Now, since the architect is on the right, the electrician must be on the left.

4. Putting it all together, the final solution table is:

   |       |     1     |      2      |
   | Job   | Electrician | Architect |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|       |     1     |      2      |
| Job   | Electrician | Architect |
#############"	{'job': ['electrician', 'architect']}	True	0	False
Lv3-1x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the two people have different hobbies, so one person must be doing camping and the other woodworking.

2. The person who does woodworking is on the left or right of the person who does camping. Since the person who does woodworking is also on the left of the person who does camping (according to the second rule), it means the person who does camping must be on the right.

3. Now, let's place the hobbies in the table. Since the person who does woodworking is on the left, we can place 'Woodworking' in the first column. The person who does camping is on the right, so 'Camping' goes in the second column.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Woodworking | Camping |
#############"	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the two people prefer different music genres, so we can write down one genre in each row. Let's start with 'House' in the first row and 'Soul' in the second row.

   |               |  1   |   2   |
   | Music-Genre   | House| Soul  |

2. Now, we know that the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house. This means that 'Soul' should be in the first column and 'House' in the second column.

   |               |  1   |   2   |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul | House |

3. The third condition states that the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of soul. Since we've already placed the fan of soul on the left, the fan of house must be on the right.

   |               |  1   |   2   |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul | House|

So, the final solution is:

#############
|               |  1   |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | Soul | House|

Lv3-1x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs: manager and scientist.
2. The manager is on the far left, so the table looks like this:

   |       |    1    |     2     |
   | Job   | Manager | Scientist |

3. The scientist is on the left or right of the manager. Since the manager is already on the left, the scientist must be on the right.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|       |    1    |     2     |
| Job   | Manager | Scientist |
#############"	{'job': ['manager', 'scientist']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the two people have different hobbies, so one person must have camping and the other card-games.

2. From the second rule, the person who has camping is on the right of the person who has card-games.

3. Now, let's consider the first rule. Since the person with camping is on the right, the person with card-games must be on the left or in the first position. But if the person with card-games was in the first position, the person with camping would have to be in the second position, which contradicts the second rule. So, the person with card-games must be in the second position, and the person with camping must be in the first position.

The final solution table is:

|         |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Camping   | Card-games |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|         |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Camping   | Card-games |

Lv3-1x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, one driving a bike and the other driving a bus.

2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike. This means the bus cannot be in the first column (since there's no one to its left). So, the bus must be in the second column.

3. Now, we know the bus is on the right of the bike, but the bus is already in the second column. This means the bike must be in the first column.

4. Since the bus is on the right of the bike, the final arrangement is:

   |             |  1   |  2  |
   |------------|------|-----|
   | Transport   | Bike | Bus |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |  1   |  2  |
|------------|------|-----|
| Transport   | Bike | Bus |
#############"	{'transport': ['bike', 'bus']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs: coach and freelancer.
2. The freelancer is either on the left or right of the coach.
3. The freelancer is on the right of the coach.

From point 3, we can deduce that the coach must be on the left. Now we have one job (coach) on the left side.

Since there are only two jobs and one is already placed, the remaining job (freelancer) must be on the right side.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Coach   | Freelancer |
#############
```

This table represents the final solution to the puzzle. The coach is on the left, and the freelancer is on the right."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs: bartender and social-worker.

2. The social-worker is either on the left or right of the bartender, but not next to each other (since they have different jobs).

3. The social-worker is on the left of the bartender.

Given these clues, let's consider the possible arrangements:

- If the social-worker is on the left, the bartender must be on the right. But this would mean the social-worker is next to another social-worker (since there are only two jobs), which contradicts the given information.

- So, the social-worker must be on the right. This means the bartender is on the left. This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Social-worker | Bartender |
#############
```

This arrangement places the social-worker on the right and the bartender on the left, satisfying all the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages, cola and sprite.
2. The person drinking sprite is either to the left or right of the person drinking cola.
3. The person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking sprite.

From point 3, we can deduce that the person drinking cola must be on the far left, and the person drinking sprite must be on the right. So, the table would look like this:

|            |  1   |   2    |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Beverage  | Cola | Sprite |

Now, to ensure that the person drinking sprite is not on the left (which would contradict point 3), we need to make sure that the person drinking cola is not on the left either. So, we'll swap the positions:

|            |  2   |   1    |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Beverage  | Sprite| Cola   |

But since we want to keep the numbers 1 and 2 in their original positions, we can simply swap the beverages with their corresponding positions:

|            |  1   |   2    |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Beverage  | Cola | Sprite |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|            |  1   |   2    |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Beverage  | Cola | Sprite |
