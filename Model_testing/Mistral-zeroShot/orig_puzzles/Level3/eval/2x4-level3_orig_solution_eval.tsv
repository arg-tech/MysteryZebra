Lv3-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies and the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. This means they are in positions 1 and 2 respectively.

2. Now we know that the person watching thriller movies is driving the bike, so the first row should be:
   | Movie-Genre   | Bike (Thriller) |

3. Since the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies, they must be in position 2. But we know that the person driving the car is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching crime movies is not the first person, they cannot be driving the car. So, the second row should be:
   | Movie-Genre   | Thriller (Bike) | Crime

4. The person driving the car must be in the far right position, so the third row is:
   | Movie-Genre   | Thriller (Bike) | Crime | Car

5. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the car is already in the far right position, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 3. But we know that the person watching musical movies is not in the first position, so the fourth row should be:
   | Movie-Genre   | Thriller (Bike) | Crime | Car | Musical

6. The person driving the roller is between the person driving the car and the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the car is in position 3 and the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, the person driving the roller must be in position 2. But we know that the person watching crime movies is already in position 2. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given conditions.

Final solution table:

Lv3-2x4-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, each with a different music preference (gospel, hip-hop, rock, techno) and a different mode of transport (bus, helicopter, snowmobile, trike).

2. From point 1, we can start filling in the music genres:
   - Since the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, the person driving the helicopter can't be a hip-hop fan (as there's no one to their left). So, let's assume the helicopter driver is a gospel fan (as it's the only genre left).
   - The fan of hip-hop is now in the second position.

3. The person driving the trike is on the far left or far right. Since the helicopter driver is not a trike driver, the trike driver can't be in the first or last position. So, the trike driver is either in position 2 or 4.
   - If the trike driver is in position 2, the fan of techno, who is on the left of the trike driver, must be in position 1. This leaves rock for position 3 and gospel for position 4. However, this arrangement violates point 6 (the bus driver is on the far left). So, the trike driver can't be in position 2.
   - If the trike driver is in position 4, the fan of techno, who is on the left of the trike driver, must be in position 3. This leaves rock for position 1, hip-hop for position 2, and gospel for position 4. This arrangement satisfies all conditions, including point 6.

4. Now that we have the music genres, we can fill in the transport:
   - The helicopter driver is a gospel fan, so the helicopter is in position 4.
   - The fan of hip-hop is in position 2, so the person driving the helicopter (gospel fan) must be in position 1, making the transport in position 1 a bus (as the helicopter is in position 4).
   - The fan of techno is in position 3, so the person driving the trike (who is a rock fan) must be in position 2, making the transport in position 2 a snowmobile (as the trike is in position 4).
   - The fan of rock is in position 1, so the person driving the bus (who is a hip-hop fan) must be in position 3, making the transport in position 3 a trike (as the bus is in position 1).

Lv3-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The fan of jazz is on the far left, so we can place Jazz in the first column.
2. Since the owner of the snake is either to the left or right of the fan of jazz, we can't place the snake in the first row. So, let's place the snake in the second row.
3. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fan of rock. Since Jazz is on the far left, the rabbit can't be in the first row. So, let's place the rabbit in the second row. This means Rock must be in the third row.
4. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of house. Since we have already placed Jazz, Rabbit, and Rock, the only available spot for House is the fourth row. So, let's place House in the fourth row.
5. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the fan of pop. Since Rabbit is in the second row, Pop must be in the third column.
6. The only pet left is the cat. Since the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of house, the cat can be in either the first or fourth column. However, since we have already placed Jazz on the far left, the cat can't be in the first column. So, let's place the cat in the fourth column.

Lv3-2x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Indian is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Let's assume the hobby of the Indian is Hobby 1, and the hobby of the person who dances is Hobby 4.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the Egyptian. Since the Indian is on the left of the person who dances, the only possible position for the person who fishes is Hobby 2 or Hobby 3. If it were Hobby 2, the Egyptian would have to be Hobby 1, but then the Indian would be on the right of the Egyptian, which contradicts the given information. So, the person who fishes is in Hobby 3.

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who fishes is in Hobby 3, the person who dances must be in Hobby 4.

4. The Egyptian is on the left or right of the Indian. Since the Indian is in Hobby 1 and the person who dances is in Hobby 4, the only possible positions for the Egyptian are Hobby 2 or Hobby 4. If it were Hobby 4, the person who fishes would be on the right of the person who dances, which contradicts the given information. So, the Egyptian is in Hobby 2.

5. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who fishes is in Hobby 3, the person who collects must be in Hobby 1. So, the person who plays board-games is in Hobby 2.

Lv3-2x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hiking person is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column. Let's assume it's Hiking in the first row.

2. Since the hiking person is on the left of the drawing person (according to rule 3), the drawing person must be in the second column. Let's assume it's Drawing in the second row.

3. Now, we know that the hot-chocolate drinker is to the right of the fanta drinker (rule 2). So, the fanta drinker must be in the first three rows, and the hot-chocolate drinker in the remaining row. Let's assume Fanta is in the first row and Hot-Chocolate is in the third row.

4. The fanta drinker is to the right of the 7up drinker (rule 4), so 7up must be in the second row.

5. Now, we know that the woodworking person is the soy-milk drinker (rule 5). Since there's only one spot left, the soy-milk drinker must be in the fourth row.

6. Finally, we need to determine the hobbies for the remaining two people. Since the drawing person is to the left of the hiking person (rule 3), the hobby of the person in the third row must be something other than hiking. Let's assume it's Singing. The hobby of the person in the second row, who is drinking 7up, must be something other than drawing and hiking. Let's assume it's Hiking (to avoid repetition).

Here's the final solution table:

Lv3-2x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking juice. Let's place them like this: Juice - Soymilk.

2. The person driving the train is between the person driving the tram and the person drinking juice. Since the tram is on the far right, the train cannot be on the far left. Also, the train cannot be next to the soymilk drinker because the soymilk drinker is already on the right of the juice drinker. So, the possible positions for the train are between juice and tram, or between soymilk and tram. Let's try both possibilities:

   Case 1: Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk
   Case 2: Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk

3. The person driving the boat is between the person driving the train and the person drinking coffee. In Case 1, the boat cannot be on the far left because the train is there. So, the boat can only be in the positions: Train - Boat - Coffee or Boat - Train - Coffee. In Case 2, the boat can be in the positions: Juice - Boat - Train - Coffee or Boat - Juice - Train - Coffee.

   Case 1 (Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk): Boat - Train - Coffee
   Case 2 (Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk): Boat - Juice - Train - Coffee

4. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. In Case 1, the only possible position for fanta is Soymilk - Fanta. In Case 2, the possible positions for fanta are Juice - Fanta - Soymilk or Fanta - Juice - Soymilk.

   Case 1 (Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk - Fanta): Boat - Train - Coffee - Roller
   Case 2 (Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk - Fanta): Boat - Juice - Train - Coffee - Roller or Boat - Fanta - Juice - Train - Coffee

5. We don't have enough information to determine the transport for the roller. Let's try both possibilities:

   Case 1 (Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller): Boat - Train - Coffee - Roller
   Case 2 (Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller): Boat - Juice - Train - Coffee - Roller or Boat - Fanta - Juice - Train - Coffee - Roller

   Case 1 (Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller - Boat): Train - Tram - Juice - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller - Boat
   Case 2 (Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller - Boat): Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller - Boat or Fanta - Juice - Train - Tram - Soymilk - Fanta - Roller - Boat

We have two possible solutions, but the second one violates the rule that the person driving the boat is between the person driving the train and the person drinking coffee, as the boat is on the far left in this case. So, the final solution is:

#############
| Beverage   | Juice | Train | Tram  | Soy-milk | Fanta | Roller | Boat  |

Lv3-2x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 nationalities and 4 modes of transport, so each nationality will use a different mode of transport.

2. From point 1, we can assign the nationalities to the modes of transport as follows:
   - Egyptian: Van (since the van driver is on the right of the Egyptian)
   - French: Airplane (since the Egyptian is on the far left or far right, and the Egyptian is not on the far left, so the French must be on the far left, leaving the van for the Egyptian)
   - Indian: Ship (since the Indian is between the French and the Thai)
   - Thai: Snowmobile (since the Thai is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, and the Egyptian and French are already assigned)

3. Now we know the nationalities, let's assign the modes of transport to the rows:
   - Row 1: Egyptian (Van)
   - Row 2: French (Airplane)
   - Row 3: Indian (Ship)
   - Row 4: Thai (Snowmobile)

4. From point 3, we know that the person driving the ship is the person in row 3 (Indian).

5. From point 6, we know that the person driving the ship is between the person driving the snowmobile (Thai) and the Thai. Since the Thai is in row 4, the person driving the ship must be in row 3 (Indian), and the Thai must be in row 5 (which is not given, but we can assume it's empty).

6. From point 4, we know that the person driving the ship is the person in row 3 (Indian). From point 6, we also know that the person driving the ship is between the person driving the snowmobile (Thai) and the Thai. Since the Thai is in row 5, the person driving the snowmobile must be in row 4.

7. From point 5, we know that the Thai is in row 5 (Snowmobile). From point 3, we know that the Indian is in row 3 (Ship). Since the Indian is between the French and the Thai, the French must be in row 2 (Airplane).

8. From point 2, we know that the Egyptian is on the far left or far right. Since the French and Indian are already assigned to the leftmost and second-leftmost positions, the Egyptian must be in the far right position (Row 1, Van).

Lv3-2x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person watching scientific movies and on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This means that the fishing hobby must be in the first or second column. Since the hobbies are different, the fishing hobby can't be in the first column because the second person must have a different hobby (which is not fishing). So, the fishing hobby is in the second column, and the person who's hobby is fishing is watching mystery movies (let's denote this as M).

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the fishing hobby is in the second column, the filmmaking hobby must be in the third column (let's denote this as F).

3. Now, the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the filmmaking hobby is in the third column, the horror movie genre must be in the fourth column (let's denote this as H).

4. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the fishing hobby is in the second column, the board-games hobby must be in the first column (let's denote this as B).

5. The only remaining hobby is drawing. Since the board-games hobby is in the first column, the drawing hobby must be in the fourth column (let's denote this as D).

6. The person watching scientific movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing (since they are on opposite sides), and it's not the person who's hobby is filmmaking (since it's on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking). So, the scientific movie genre must be in the third column (let's denote this as S).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv3-2x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the fish is not on the far right (since the volleyball owner is there), so the fish cannot be in column 4.

2. Since the fish owner is not on the far right, the volleyball owner must be in column 4. Let's place the volleyball in the last row (row 4) and the snake in the same column (column 4).

3. Now, the owner of the fish must be in one of the first three columns. Since the fish owner is not on the far left (because the chinchilla owner is either on the far left or far right), the fish cannot be in column 1. So, the fish is in column 2 or 3.

4. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the fish, so the chinchilla cannot be in column 4. If the chinchilla were in column 1, the fish would have to be in column 2, but that would mean the fish owner is not between the skiing and basketball owners, which contradicts rule 6. So, the chinchilla is in column 3.

5. Now, the fish can only be in column 2. The owner of the fish is not on the far left, so the chinchilla is not on the far left either. This means the horse must be on the far left (column 1).

6. The owner of the horse is not the owner of the basketball, because the basketball owner is to the right of the fish owner, and the fish owner is to the right of the horse owner. So, the horse cannot be the owner of tennis or volleyball. The horse cannot be the owner of skiing either, because the fish owner is between the skiing and basketball owners, and the fish owner is to the right of the horse owner. So, the horse must be the owner of basketball.

7. Now, the only sport left is skiing. Since the fish owner is not on the far left, the skiing owner cannot be the horse owner (because the horse is on the far left). So, the skiing owner must be the owner of tennis.

1. We know that the argentine is on the right of the chinese, so we can place them in columns 2 and 3 respectively. Let's assume the argentine is in column 3 for now.

2. The fan of jazz is between the russian and the chinese. Since the chinese is in column 3, the russian must be in column 2. This means jazz must be in column 1.

3. The fan of electronic is the chinese, so we already know this.

4. The nigerian is on the left of the chinese, so the nigerian must be in column 2.

5. Now, the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the argentine. Since we assumed the argentine is in column 3, salsa can only be in column 1 or 2. However, we already placed the nigerian in column 2, so salsa must be in column 1.
