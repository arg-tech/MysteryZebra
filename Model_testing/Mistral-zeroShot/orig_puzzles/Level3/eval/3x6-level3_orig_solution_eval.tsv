Lv3-3x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 items in each category, we can assign a number from 1 to 6 to each food, nationality, and transport. We'll use the same number for each category.

2. From the given clues, we know that the mango eater is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the mango eater is on the far left (position 1). This means that the food in position 6 must be on the far right.

3. The Colombian is eating lime, so the lime eater is in position 3 (since there are only 5 remaining positions).

4. The British is eating cabbage, so the cabbage eater is in position 4.

5. The German is eating asparagus, so the asparagus eater is in position 5.

6. The asparagus eater is between the ship driver and the cabbage eater. Since the cabbage eater is in position 4, the asparagus eater cannot be in position 3 (as it would violate rule 10). So, the asparagus eater is in position 6, and the ship driver is in position 2.

7. The ship driver is Colombian (from rule 14), so the Colombian is in position 2.

8. The Colombian is on the left of the roller driver (from rules 15 and 14), so the roller driver is in position 3.

9. The Dutch is on the left or right of the roller driver (from rule 7), so the Dutch cannot be in position 1, 4, or 6. The Dutch must be in position 2, 5, or 5. Since the Dutch cannot be in position 5 (as it would violate rule 5), the Dutch must be in position 2.

10. The remaining nationality, Indian, is left. The Indian cannot be in position 1 (as it would violate rule 8), position 2 (as it would violate rule 9), position 3 (as it would violate rule 7), position 4 (as it would violate rule 4), or position 6 (as it would violate rule 2). So, the Indian must be in position 5.

11. The remaining food, pineapple, must be in position 1 (as it was stated to be on the far left in rule 9).

12. The remaining transport, jet-ski, can be in any position. Let's place it in position 6 (far right) for now.

13. The taxi driver must be in position 4 (as it was stated to be on the far right in rule 13).

14. The asparagus eater (German) is on the left of the train driver (from rule 6). Since the asparagus eater is in position 6, the train driver must be in position 5.

15. The remaining transport, airplane, must be in position 3 (as it was stated to be on the left of the asparagus eater in rule 6).

16. The remaining transport, ship, is already placed in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |     4     |   5    |   6   |

| Transport     |          |          |          |          |        | jet-ski|

However, we still need to determine the transport in the last row. Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the roller driver (rule 7), and the roller driver is in position 3, the jet-ski must be in position 1 (far left) or position 5 (right of the roller driver). Since the Indian is in position 5 (far right was already taken by the mango eater), the jet-ski must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |     4     |   5    |   6   |

Lv3-3x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. We'll start by placing the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (RC) and the person who's sport is baseball (B) because they are the same person according to rule 4. Let's place them in the first and sixth positions (1 and 6) respectively, with RC on the far left or far right (let's say on the far left for now).

   |         |       1       |      2      |     3      |    4     |      5      |     6      |

2. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (BG) according to rule 13, we can place BG in the second position.

   |         |       1       |      2      |     3      |    4     |      5      |     6      |

Lv3-3x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 music-genres, 6 nationalities, and 6 sports, we can assign one of each to each row and column intersection. Let's start by assigning the music-genres to the rows.

   Rows: [blues, d&b, metal, r&b, salsa, soul]

2. From rule 1, the fan of blues is on the right of the fan of metal. So, we can place the fan of blues in column 2 or more (since there are 6 columns). Let's place the fan of blues in column 2 for now.

   Column 2: blues

3. From rule 11, the malaysian is the fan of metal. So, we can place the Malaysian in row 3.

   Row 3: metal (Malaysian)

4. From rule 9, the fan of blues is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the fan of blues is in column 2, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in column 1 or 3. Let's place the skateboarder in column 1 for now.

   Column 1: skateboarding

5. From rule 3, the colombian is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. So, the colombian must be in column 2 or more.

6. From rule 10, the person who's sport is volleyball is the colombian. Since the colombian is in column 2 or more, the volleyball player must be in column 3 or more. Let's place the volleyball player in column 3 for now.

   Column 3: volleyball (Colombian)

7. From rule 7, the colombian is on the far left or far right. Since the colombian is already in column 3, they must be in the far right. So, we swap the positions of the volleyball player and the fan of blues.

   Column 2: blues
   Column 3: volleyball (Colombian)

8. From rule 14, the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of blues is in column 2, the fan of salsa must be in column 1 or 3. Let's place the fan of salsa in column 1 for now.

   Column 1: skateboarding, salsa

9. From rule 12, the indonesian is on the left of the fan of salsa. So, the Indonesian must be in column 2.

   Column 2: blues (Indonesian)

10. From rule 8, the russian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the skateboarder is in column 1 and the Indonesian is in column 2, the climber must be in column 3.

   Column 3: volleyball (Colombian), climbing (Russian)

11. From rule 13, the spanish is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the climber is in column 3, the sailor must be in column 4 or 6. Let's place the sailor in column 4 for now.

   Column 4: sailing (Spanish)

12. From rule 15, the russian is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the climber is already in column 3, the Russian must be in column 5 or 6. Let's place the Russian in column 5 for now.

   Column 5: climbing (Russian)

13. From rule 4, the pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of soul. Since the Indonesian is in column 2, the fan of soul must be in column 1 or 3. Let's place the fan of soul in column 1 for now.

   Column 1: skateboarding, salsa, soul

14. From rule 6, the fan of d&b is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the Russian is in column 5, the golfer must be in column 6.

   Column 6: golf

15. From rule 5, the fan of d&b is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. But we already placed the volleyball player in column 3. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it stands.

Final solution table (with the contradiction):

The puzzle seems to have an inconsistency, as placing the fan of d&b according to rules 5 and 6 leads to a contradiction with the placement of the volleyball player."	{'music-genre': ['skateboarding, salsa, soul', 'blues (indonesian)', 'metal (malaysian)', 'r&b', 'sailing (spanish)', 'golf'], 'nationality': ['skateboarding:?, salsa:?, soul:?', 'blues:indonesian', 'metal:malaysian', 'r&b:?', 'sailing:spanish', 'golf:?'], 'sport': ['skateboarding:?, salsa:?, soul:?', 'climbing:?, golf:?, rowing:?, sailing:?, skateboarding:?, volleyball:colombian', 'golf:?, rowing:?, sailing:?, skateboarding:?, volleyball:colombian', 'rowing:?, sailing:?, skateboarding:?, volleyball:?, climbing:?', 'sailing:spanish', 'climbing:?, golf:?, rowing:?, sailing:?, skateboarding:?, volleyball:?']}	True	0	False
Lv3-3x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is dancing is the owner of the goat. Let's place the goat owner (G) in the first or sixth position (since there are 6 people) and the goat (Go) in the corresponding position. Let's assume G is in position 1, so Go is in position 1.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person eating banana. Since we don't know the position of the banana eater yet, we can't place the fisherman (F) yet.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the owner of the goat. Since G is in position 1, the chess player (C) must be in position 0 or 2.

4. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person eating cranberry (Cb). We don't know the position of the cranberry eater yet, so we can't place the fisherman (F) yet.

5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening (Gd). We don't know the position of the gardener yet, so we can't place the skydiving person (S) yet.

6. The person who's hobby is gardening is the owner of the guinea-pig (Gp). Since G is in position 1, the guinea-pig owner must be in position 6. So, Gp is in position 6 and the guinea-pig (Gp) is in position 1.

Lv3-3x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is water-polo. Let's place water-polo in the 'Sport' column for row 6. Since the fan of gospel is the person playing water-polo (rule 13), we can place gospel in the 'Music-Genre' column for row 6.

2. Now, we know that the fan of gospel is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (rule 11). Since we don't know the position of swimming yet, let's assume it's in an empty spot. This means that gospel must be in a position to the right of that empty spot.

3. From rule 14, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person drinking water. Since we've placed water-polo (and thus gospel) to the right of the empty spot, cricket must be in a position to the left of the empty spot.

4. From rule 15, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since we don't know the position of d&b yet, let's assume it's in an empty spot. This means that 7up must be in a position to the right of that empty spot.

5. From rule 12, we know that the fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (which we've placed in row 6). Since we don't know the position of water-polo yet, let's assume it's in an empty spot. This means that funk must be in a position to the left of that empty spot.

6. From rule 9, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since we've placed d&b in an empty spot, house can be either to the left or right of that empty spot. Let's place house to the left of d&b for now.

7. From rule 16, we know that the fan of house is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is parkour. Since we've placed golf in row 2 (as the person drinking juice, rule 7), and parkour is still unknown, house must be in a position between row 2 and the empty spot where we've placed water-polo (row 6).

8. From rule 8, we know that the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since we've placed water-polo (and thus gospel) to the right of the empty spot, and we've placed house to the left of d&b, the only remaining empty spot to the left of water-polo is row 1. So, the person drinking juice is in row 1.

9. From rule 6, we know that the fan of house is between the person who's sport is golf (row 2) and the person who's sport is parkour. Since house is already placed between row 1 and row 6, parkour must be in row 3.

10. From rule 4, we know that the fan of gospel is on the far left or far right. Since we've placed gospel in row 6, it must be on the far right. This means that all other genres must be on the left. So, d&b is in row 1, funk is in row 5, and rock is in row 4.

11. From rule 3, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's sport is cricket. Since we've placed cricket in row 1, hot-chocolate must be in row 1 as well.

12. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is golf is the person drinking juice. We've already placed golf in row 2 and juice in row 1.

13. From rule 5, we know that the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since we've placed d&b in row 1, house must be in row 5.

14. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since we've placed rock in row 4, swimming must be in row 3.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

| Beverage      | 7up   | Coffee | Hot-chocolate | Juice | Sprite | Water |
| Music-Genre   | d&b   |        | gospel        |      | house  | rock  |
| Sport         |       |        | cricket       | golf | parkour | swimming | water-polo |

And we get:

| Music-Genre   | d&b   |        | gospel        |      | house  | rock  |

5. From rule 11, P2 eats carrot and is on the left or right of P3 (Freelancer). Since P3 is in the 1st column, P2 can be in either the 2nd or 5th column. Let's place P2 in the 2nd column for now.

6. From rule 14, P6 (Teacher) is on the left or right of P3 (Peach). Since P3 is in the 1st column, P6 can be in either the 3rd or 6th column. Let's place P6 in the 3rd column for now.

Lv3-3x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Indian is the police-officer and the police-officer is the person eating papaya (from rule 8), we can place the Indian (Police-Officer) in the 6th column and 5th row (since there are 6 types of food).

2. Now, the Indian (Police-Officer) is on the far left or far right (rule 5), so the other nationalities must be on the other side. Let's assume the Indian is on the far left. Then, the Australian, Brazilian, Canadian, German, and Mexican must be from left to right in the remaining columns.

3. The bartender is on the right of the german (rule 9), so the bartender must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. Since the Indian is on the far left, the bartender cannot be in the 1st column. So, the bartender can be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column.

4. The writer is on the left or right of the brazilian (rule 4), and the Indian is on the far left. So, the Brazilian must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column. If the bartender is in the 2nd column, the writer must be in the 1st column, which is not possible because the writer is on the left or right of the Brazilian. So, the bartender cannot be in the 2nd column. If the bartender is in the 3rd column, the writer can be in the 4th or 5th column. If the bartender is in the 4th column, the writer can be in the 5th column. If the bartender is in the 5th column, the writer can be in the 4th column. So, the bartender can be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th column.

5. The chef is on the left or right of the bartender (rule 10), and the bartender is in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th column. So, the chef can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 6th column.

6. The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the person eating avocado (rule 2). Since the avocado is not the first food, the cauliflower cannot be the first food either. So, the avocado must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd column, and the cauliflower must be in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column.

7. The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating grapefruit (rule 7). Since the grapefruit is not the last food, the cucumber cannot be the last food either. So, the grapefruit must be in the 4th, 5th, or 6th column, and the cucumber must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th column.

8. The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the german (rule 11), and the german is to the right of the bartender (rule 9). So, the cauliflower must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column.

9. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the canadian (rule 13). Since the cauliflower is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th column, the Canadian can be in the 1st, 5th, or 6th column.

10. The Australian is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke (rule 12). Since the Australian is to the right of the bartender (because the bartender is not in the 1st column), the Australian cannot be in the 6th column. So, the Australian can be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th column.

11. Now, let's place the remaining people and foods based on the available options:
   - The chef can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 6th column. If the chef is in the 1st column, the bartender must be in the 5th column, and the writer can be in the 4th column. If the chef is in the 2nd column, the bartender can be in any of the remaining columns, and the writer can be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th column. If the chef is in the 6th column, the bartender must be in the 3rd column, and the writer can be in the 4th column.
   - The fisherman must be in the 1st column (rule 6).
   - The remaining food can be placed based on the available columns for each food.

12. After trying all possible combinations, the final solution is:

Lv3-3x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the mechanic in the first row (row 1) and assign badminton as the sport.

2. Since the doctor is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton, place the doctor in either row 2 or row 3. Let's place the doctor in row 2 for now. We don't know the sport yet.

3. The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mechanic (badminton) is in row 1, the mouse owner must be in row 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the mouse owner in row 4 for now, and assign skiing as the sport.

4. The skiing person is between the fisherman and the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse is in row 4, the fisherman must be in row 3.

5. The person who's sport is basketball is the owner of the fish. Place the fish owner in row 5 and assign basketball as the sport.

6. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the chef. Since the chef is not placed yet, we can't determine the position of the dressmaker and the chef yet.

7. The person who's sport is climbing is the chef. Place the chef in row 6 and assign climbing as the sport.

8. The architect is on the left or right of the owner of the fish. Since the fish is in row 5, the architect can be in row 4 or 6. Let's place the architect in row 6 for now.

9. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the climber (chef) is in row 6, the turtle owner can be in row 5 or 7. Let's place the turtle owner in row 5 for now.

10. The fisherman is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the fisherman is in row 3, the climber (chef) must be in row 4 or 6. But the chef is already in row 6, so the climber must be in row 4.

11. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right. Since the far left and far right are already occupied (by the mechanic and the turtle owner), the hedgehog owner must be in one of the middle rows. Let's place the hedgehog owner in row 2 for now.

12. The owner of the frog is on the right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in row 3, the frog owner must be in row 4 or 6. But the mouse owner (skiing) is in row 4, so the frog owner must be in row 6.

13. The architect is on the left or right of the owner of the fish. Since the fish owner is in row 5, the architect must be in row 3 or 5. But the architect is already in row 6, so it must be a mistake, and the architect should be in row 3.

14. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarding person is not placed yet, we can't determine the position of the chinchilla owner and the snowboarder yet.

15. The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the hedgehog owner is in row 2, the dressmaker must be in row 1 or 3. But the dressmaker can't be in row 1 because she is on the left or right of the chef, and the chef is in row 6. So the dressmaker must be in row 3.

Now we have the following arrangement:

|         |     1     |     2      |      3       |    4     |     5      |       6       |
| Job     | mechanic | hedgehog  | fisherman    | mouse    |   chef     |   architect   |
| Pet     | chinchilla| frog      | turtle      | fish     |   -       |   -          |
| Sport   | badminton| -         | skiing      | basketball| climbing   |   -          |

We still need to place the snowboarder, the pet for the chef, and the pet for the architect. We also need to determine the pets and sports for rows 2, 4, and 5.

To find the remaining information, we would need more clues or to make some educated guesses based on the given information.

Lv3-3x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person eating cranberry (C) is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column. Since the fan of d&b (D) is the person eating cranberry, we can place D in the first row as well.

2. The owner of the cat (CAT) is on the left of the person eating pumpkin (P), so CAT cannot be in the first column. Let's place CAT in the second column. Since the owner of the cat is not eating any of the known foods, we can place P in the second row of the second column.

3. The owner of the hedgehog (HED) is on the right of the owner of the ferret (FER), so FER cannot be in the second column. Let's place FER in the third column. Since FER is eating orange (O), we can place O in the third row of the third column.

4. The owner of the lizard (LIZ) is on the left of the fan of rock (R), so LIZ cannot be in the third column. Let's place LIZ in the fourth column. Since LIZ is not eating any of the known foods, we can place R in the fourth row of the fourth column.

5. The person eating corn (COR) is on the right of the fan of country (COUN), so COR cannot be in the first or second column. Let's place COR in the fifth column. Since COR is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the fifth row empty for now.

6. The fan of salsa (SAL) is not mentioned in the given conditions, so we can place SAL in the sixth column. Since SAL is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the sixth row empty for now.

7. The fan of folk (FOLK) is between the fan of country and the fan of d&b (D), so FOLK cannot be in the first or sixth column. Let's place FOLK in the third column. Since FOLK is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the third row empty for now.

8. The person eating kale (KAL) is not mentioned in the given conditions, so we can place KAL in the second row of the fifth column.

10. The fan of r&b (R&B) is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog (HED), so R&B cannot be in the third column. Let's place R&B in the fourth column. Since R&B is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the fourth row empty for now.

11. The owner of the rat (RAT) is between the fan of country (COUN) and the fan of folk (FOLK), so RAT cannot be in the first or third column. Let's place RAT in the second column. Since RAT is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the second row empty for now.

12. The person eating pumpkin (P) is on the left of the person eating corn (COR), so P cannot be in the fifth column. Let's place P in the fourth column. Since P is eating pumpkin, we can place P in the fourth row of the fourth column.

13. The owner of the pony (PONY) is on the left or right of the fan of rock (R), so PONY cannot be in the fourth column. Let's place PONY in the fifth column. Since this contradicts the condition that PONY is on the left or right of R, we need to revise our placement of PONY. Let's place PONY in the sixth column instead.

14. Now, the owner of the pony (PONY) is eating zucchini (ZUC), so we can place PONY in the sixth row of the sixth column.

15. The person eating kale (KAL) is not eating any of the known foods yet, so we can leave KAL in the second row of the fifth column.

16. The fan of country (COUN) is on the right of the person eating corn (COR), so COUN cannot be in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place COUN in the first column. Since COUN is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the first row empty for now.

17. The fan of folk (FOLK) is between the fan of country (COUN) and the fan of d&b (D), so FOLK cannot be in the first or sixth column. Let's place FOLK in the sixth column. Since FOLK is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the sixth row empty for now.

18. The owner of the rat (RAT) is between the fan of country (COUN) and the fan of folk (FOLK), so RAT cannot be in the first or sixth column. Let's place RAT in the third column. Since RAT is not eating any of the known foods yet, we can leave the third row empty for now.

20. The person eating orange (O) is the owner of the ferret (FER), so we can place O in the third row of the third column.

Now, let's fill in the remaining foods:

- The person eating zucchini (ZUC) is the owner of the pony (PONY), so we already have ZUC in the sixth row of the sixth column.
- The person eating pumpkin (P) is on the left of the person eating corn (COR), so P cannot be in the fifth column. Let's place P in the third column. Since P is eating pumpkin, we can place P in the third row of the third column.

- The person eating kale (KAL) is not eating any of the known foods yet, so we can leave KAL in the second row of the fifth column.

Now, let's fill in the remaining music-genres:

- The fan of country (COUN) is on the right of the person eating corn (COR), so COUN is in the fifth column. Since COUN is the fan of country, we can place COUN in the first row of the fifth column.

Lv3-3x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, D, E, and F, where A is the first person, B is the second, and so on.

2. Let's start with the food preferences. Since there are 6 different types of food, each person must eat a unique food. Let's assign the foods to the people as follows:
   - A eats apple
   - B eats avocado (placed left of C according to 6)
   - C eats broccoli (placed right of D according to 13)
   - D eats mango (placed as E's right neighbor according to 10)
   - E eats nectarine (remaining option)
   - F eats pear (remaining option)

3. Now let's assign the movie-genres:
   - A watches crime movies (placed left of B according to 11)
   - B watches satire movies (since the fan of funk watches satire movies, and B is the only person left, B must be the fan of funk)
   - C watches spy movies (placed left or right of D according to 2.3, let's place it to the right of D for now)
   - D watches scientific movies (placed left of E according to 6)
   - E watches drama movies (placed between B and A according to 3)
   - F watches epic movies (remaining option, placed as D's left neighbor according to 10)

4. Now let's assign the music-genres:
   - A listens to classical music (placed left or right of B according to 12, let's place it to the right of B for now)
   - B listens to reggae (since B is the fan of reggae, and B is the only person left, B must be the fan of reggae)
   - C listens to d&b (remaining option for C, placed as F's left neighbor according to 8)
   - D listens to techno (placed on the far left or far right according to 5, let's place it as A's left neighbor for now)
   - E listens to salsa (remaining option, placed as C's right neighbor)
   - F listens to funk (already assigned to B)

5. Now we have a contradiction: D is supposed to listen to techno, but it's already assigned to A's left neighbor. However, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of d&b (8), so D cannot be the fan of techno. Let's swap D's and E's music-genres: D listens to techno, and E listens to salsa. Now the table is consistent.

The final solution table is:

  |               |   1    |   2   |    3     |    4    |     5      |     6     |
