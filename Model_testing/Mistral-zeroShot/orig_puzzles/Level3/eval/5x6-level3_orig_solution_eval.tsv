Music-Genre: country (S), funk (T), metal (U), pop (V), r&b (W), trance (X)
Nationality: american (Y), australian (Z), indian (a), italian (b), mexican (c), russian (d)

Lv3-5x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a number from 1 to 6, and let's place them in the table. We'll use the first row for hobbies, the second row for jobs, the third row for movie-genres, the fourth row for music-genres, and the fifth row for sports.

2. From the given information, we know that there are 6 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, and sports. So, each column and each row should have a unique value.

3. Let's start with the hobbies. Since we know that the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography, we can place the photography hobby on the far left (column 1) and the superhero movie-watcher on the right (column 6). The remaining hobbies can be filled in the middle columns.

4. The fan of gospel is the videographer, so we place gospel in the row corresponding to the videographer job. Since the gospel fan is on the far left, we place it in column 1. The remaining music-genres can be filled in the other rows.

5. The person watching family movies is on the far right, so we place family in the last column. Since the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching family movies, we can place superhero in the second-to-last column. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the other columns.

6. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the water-polo player is on the left of the manager, we can place water-polo in the first or second column. Since the filmmaker is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography, we can place filmmaking in the second or third column. The remaining sports can be filled in the other columns.

7. We can't place the sports or jobs yet because we have more constraints for them. Let's continue with the remaining hobbies, movie-genres, and music-genres.

8. The fan of ambient is on the right of the photographer, so we can place ambient in the second or third column. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton, so we can place house in the first or fifth column. The fan of punk is the manager, so we place punk in the fourth column. The remaining hobbies can be filled in the other columns.

9. The fan of country is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is the person who's sport is baseball, we can place martial-arts in the second or third row. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the fan of country, we can place camping in the first or fifth column. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the other rows.

10. The person who's sport is cricket is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball, we can place cricket in the first or sixth column. The remaining sports can be filled in the other columns.

11. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching zombie movies, so we place fishing in the row corresponding to the zombie movie-watcher. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person watching zombie movies, we can place dancing in the second or third column. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the other rows.

12. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the coach is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games, we can place board-games in the second or third column. The remaining hobbies can be filled in the other columns.

13. The nurse is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing, so we can place nursing in the fourth or fifth column. The remaining jobs can be filled in the other columns.

14. The manager is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, so we can place the manager in the second or third row. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo, we can place water-polo in the fourth or fifth row. The remaining sports can be filled in the other rows.

15. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the coach is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games, we can place board-games in the second or third column. The remaining hobbies can be filled in the other columns.

16. The person watching epic movies is on the left of the fan of house, so we can place epic in the first column. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the other columns.

19. The coach is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games, so we can place the coach in the fifth column. The remaining jobs can be filled in the other columns.

20. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching zombie movies, so we place fishing in the row corresponding to the zombie movie-watcher. The remaining movie-genres can be filled in the other rows.

21. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the manager is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, we can place dancing in the fourth column. The remaining hobbies can be filled in the other columns.

Now, we have filled most of the table. However, there are still some ambiguities due to the ""or"" conditions in the constraints. To solve these, we would need additional information or to make assumptions. Here is the table with the current solution:

```
                 |      1       |      2      |     3     |    4    |      5       |    6    |
Hobby           | board-games | fishing    | camping   | dancing | filmmaking  | photography |
Job             | coach      | photographer| nurse     | manager | videographer |
Movie-Genre     | epic       | zombie     | martial-arts| family  | superhero   | time-travel  |
Music-Genre     | ambient    | punk       | country   | house   | gospel      | dubstep    |
Sport           | badminton  | water-polo | cricket   | basketball| tennis     | baseball   |
```

The remaining ambiguities are:
- The fan of country can be in column 1 or 5.
- The person who's sport is cricket can be in column 1 or 6.
- The person who's hobby is camping can be in column 1 or 5.

Without additional information, we can't determine the exact positions for these three elements."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-5x6-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning each person a job, movie-genre, nationality, sport, and transport one by one, keeping in mind the given conditions.

1. Since the person driving the van is the one who does parkour, let's assign parkour to person 3 (as there are 6 sports, and we need to assign one to each person). So, person 3 is a parkour athlete.

2. Now, let's assign the nationalities. Since the Argentine is on the right of the person watching western movies, and the person driving the boat is on the left or right of the Mexican, we can't place the Argentine in position 1 or 6. So, let's place the Mexican in position 1 (far left) and the Argentine in position 2 (right of Mexican).

3. The Egyptian is on the right of the person watching drama movies, and the Egyptian is on the left of the person watching western movies. So, the Egyptian can't be in position 1, 2, 5, or 6. Let's place the Egyptian in position 3 (left of Argentine).

4. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the Mexican is in position 1 and the Argentine is in position 2, the person watching western movies can't be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the person watching western movies in position 4 (left of Egyptian).

5. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is in position 1, the person driving the boat can't be in position 1 or 6. Let's place the person driving the boat in position 5 (right of Mexican).

6. The engineer is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian, Argentine, and the person watching western movies are already placed, the engineer can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's place the engineer in position 6 (far right).

7. The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the French. Since the French nationality hasn't been assigned yet, we can't place the French yet. Let's continue with other assignments.

8. The person driving the trike is the bartender. Since the bartender is the person doing parkour (person 3), and the person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching drama movies, the person watching drama movies can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. Let's place the person watching drama movies in position 5 (left of Mexican).

9. The person driving the trike is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person doing parkour (person 3) is also doing baseball, the person doing baseball can't be in position 3. Let's place the person doing baseball in position 1 (far left).

10. The person watching animation movies is on the far left or far right. Since the Mexican is in position 1, the person watching animation movies can't be in position 1 or 6. Let's place the person watching animation movies in position 6 (far right).

11. The polish is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the Egyptian, Argentine, Mexican, and the person watching western movies are already placed, the person watching family movies can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the person watching family movies in position 6 (left of Polish).

12. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian hasn't been assigned yet, let's place the Malaysian in position 2 (left of Argentine).

13. The person watching adventure movies is on the far right. Since the person watching adventure movies can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (as all those positions are already assigned), let's place the person watching adventure movies in position 7 (not in the table yet).

14. The scientist is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in position 6, the scientist can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the scientist in position 5 (left of Mexican).

15. The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian hasn't been assigned yet, let's place the librarian in position 4 (left of Egyptian).

16. The person who's sport is swimming is the teacher. Since the teacher can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (as all those positions are already assigned), let's place the teacher in position 7 (not in the table yet).

17. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person doing parkour is person 3 (Mexican), the person doing skateboarding can't be in position 1. Let's place the person doing skateboarding in position 2 (left of Argentine).

18. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies is in position 5, the person driving the trike (bartender) is in position 6 (far right).

19. The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is in position 2, the person watching family movies can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the person watching family movies in position 4 (left of Egyptian).

20. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching drama movies. This is already satisfied (bartender in position 6, person watching drama movies in position 5).

21. The mexican is on the far left or far right. Since the Mexican is already in position 1, the mexican is in position 7 (not in the table yet).

22. The Egyptian is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching western movies is in position 4, the Egyptian is in position 3.

23. The person driving the trike is the person who's sport is baseball. This is already satisfied (bartender in position 6).

24. The bartender is the bartender. This is already satisfied.

25. The person watching animation movies is on the far right. This is already satisfied (in position 6).

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

- The person watching adventure movies is in position 7 (far right, as the Mexican is in position 1 and the person watching animation movies is in position 6).
- The person watching family movies is in position 4 (left of Egyptian).
- The person doing skateboarding is in position 2 (left of Argentine).
- The person doing swimming is the teacher, so the teacher is in position 7 (not in the table yet).
- The person driving the motorbike is in position 2 (left of Malaysian).
- The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian is in position 4, the person driving the subway can be in position 3 or 5. Let's place the person driving the subway in position 3 (left of Egyptian).
- The French is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is not yet assigned, let's place the French in position 6 (far right).
- The scientist is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is in position 4, the scientist can be in position 3 or 5. Let's place the scientist in position 5 (left of Mexican).
- The librarian is in position 4 (left of Egyptian).

So, the final solution table is:

22. The person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is puzzles (from clue 16). Since we already placed the puzzles hobby, we can place the juice in the same column as the puzzles hobby. Let's place the juice in column 6.

24. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (from clue 14). Since we already placed the tea and mirinda, we can ensure that they are in the correct order.

25. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (from clue 23). Since we already placed the tea and coffee, we can ensure that they are in the correct order.

27. The person drinking juice is on the far right (from unstated clue, since juice was not mentioned in the given clues). Since we already placed the juice, we can ensure that it is in the correct position.

Now that we have placed all the beverages, hobbies, nationalities, pets, and transports in the correct order, we can fill in the missing information:

We still need to fill in the nationality, pet, and hobby for the remaining people. However, we have enough information to determine their positions based on the given clues.

Since the nigerian is on the left or right of the american (from clue 13), the nigerian must be in column 1 or 4. Since the russian is the owner of the dog (from clue 15), the dog must be in the row with the russian.

Lv3-5x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person (e.g., B for beverage, M for movie genre, N for nationality, S for sport, T for transport). We'll use numbers 1-6 for each category and a letter (a, b, c, etc.) for each person.

2. From the given information, we can make some initial assumptions:
   - Each row represents a different person.
   - Each column represents a different category.
   - Each cell contains a value from the corresponding category for the person in that row.

3. Let's start with the nationalities (N):
   - The Russian is on the left of the Egyptian (N2 < N3).
   - The Australian is on the left of the Polish (N4 < N5).
   - The British is the person driving the snowmobile (T6).
   - The Australian is the person driving the motorbike (T5).
   - The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies (N3 < M4 or N3 > M4).
   - The Australian is the person drinking hot-chocolate (B4).
   - The Australian is also the person driving the motorbike (T5).
   - From these, we can deduce that N2 = Egyptian, N3 = Australian, N4 = Polish, N5 = British.

4. Let's move on to the sports (S):
   - The person whose sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person driving the roller (S3 < T4 or S3 > T4).
   - The person whose sport is swimming is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing (S4 > S3).
   - The person whose sport is cycling is the person drinking hot-chocolate (S2 = B4).
   - From these, we can deduce that S1 = 7up, S2 = cycling, S3 = surfing, S4 = swimming, S5 = parkour, S6 = soccer.

5. Now let's solve the movie genres (M):
   - The person watching mystery movies is on the far left (M1).
   - The person watching drama movies is on the right of the Australian (M4 > N4).
   - The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike (M4 > T5).
   - The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing (M4 > S3).
   - The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite (M4 > B6).
   - The person watching comedy movies is the person drinking sprite (M5 = B6).
   - The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (M2 < T6).
   - The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the Australian (M3 < N4 or M3 > N4).
   - The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the Egyptian (M3 < N3 or M3 > N3).
   - The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer (M1 < S5).
   - From these, we can deduce that M2 = crime, M3 = satire, M4 = drama, M5 = comedy, M6 = mystery.

6. Finally, let's solve the beverages (B):
   - The person drinking cola is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing (B2 > S3).
   - The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person watching drama movies (B6 > M4).
   - The person drinking sprite is the person watching comedy movies (B6 = M5).
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's sport is cycling (B2 = S2).
   - The person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is parkour (B1 = S5).
   - The person drinking water is the person driving the scooter (B6 = T4).
   - From these, we can deduce that B1 = 7up, B2 = cola, B3 = soy-milk, B4 = hot-chocolate, B5 = sprite, B6 = water.

7. Putting it all together, the final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |    2    |    3     |    4     |     5      |    6     |
   | Beverage      | 7up          | cola    | soy-milk | hot-chocolate| sprite   | water   |
   | Movie-Genre   |               |         |          |          |            |          |
   | Nationality   |               |         |          |          |            |          |
   | Sport         |               |         |          |          |            |          |
   | Transport     |               |         |          |          |            |          |

   - We can't determine the movie genres, sports, and transport without more information. However, we know the relationships between them. For example, we know that the person watching comedy movies (M5) is the person drinking sprite (B6), and the person whose sport is surfing (S3) is on the left or right of the person driving the roller (T4)."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-5x6-10	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each item and their positions:

1. Food: F1 (blueberry), F2 (carrot), F3 (peach), F4 (potato), F5 (strawberry), F6 (watermelon)
2. Hobby: H1 (board-games), H2 (dancing), H3 (hiking), H4 (puzzles), H5 (skydiving), H6 (traveling)
3. Music-Genre: M1 (dubstep), M2 (indie), M3 (punk), M4 (reggae), M5 (techno), M6 (trance)
4. Pet: P1 (cat), P2 (dog), P3 (goldfish), P4 (hedgehog), P5 (rabbit), P6 (rat)
5. Sport: S1 (basketball), S2 (biathlon), S3 (parkour), S4 (snowboarding), S5 (swimming), S6 (tennis)

Now let's use the given clues to deduce the positions of each item:

1. H6 (traveling) is on the far left or far right. Let's assume it's on the far left (H6 = F1).
2. H5 (skydiving) is on the left or right of H1 (board-games). Since H6 is on the far left, H5 must be on the right (H5 = F6).
3. H6 (traveling) is on the left or right of P5 (rabbit). Since H6 is on the far left, P5 must be on the far right (P5 = F6).
4. M2 (indie) is on the left or right of S5 (swimming). Since we don't know the position of S5 yet, we can't determine the position of M2 yet.
5. S5 (swimming) is on the left of P3 (goldfish). Since P5 is on the far right, S5 must be on the far left (S5 = F1).
6. M6 (techno) is the person eating watermelon (F6).
7. M4 (reggae) is on the left or right of S1 (basketball). Since we don't know the position of S1 yet, we can't determine the position of M4 yet.
8. S1 (basketball) is on the left or right of S2 (biathlon). Since S5 is on the far left, S1 must be on the far right (S1 = F6).
9. P1 (cat) is on the left of F3 (carrot).
10. F3 (carrot) is on the left of S1 (basketball).
11. H2 (dancing) is on the right of P2 (dog).
12. H2 (dancing) is on the far left or far right. Since H6 (traveling) is on the far left, H2 must be on the far right (H2 = F6).
13. H5 (skydiving) is on the left of S3 (parkour).
14. H3 (hiking) is on the left of H4 (puzzles).
15. P1 (cat) is on the left or right of M1 (dubstep). Since H2 (dancing) is on the far right, P1 must be on the far left (P1 = F1).
16. S6 (tennis) is on the right of F4 (potato).
17. S2 (biathlon) is on the right of M6 (techno).
18. P1 (cat) is the fan of trance (M6).
19. F2 (carrot) is on the far left or far right. Since P1 (cat) is on the far left, F2 must be on the far right (F2 = F6).
20. M3 (punk) is on the left or right of M6 (techno). Since P1 (cat) is on the far left, M3 must be on the far right (M3 = M6).
21. P6 (rat) is on the right of P5 (rabbit).
22. F3 (carrot) is on the far left or far right. Since we already know that F3 is on the far left, F3 cannot be on the far right.
23. P1 (cat) is on the left or right of P2 (dog). Since P1 is on the far left, P2 must be on the far right.
24. H4 (puzzles) is on the left of H1 (board-games).
25. M4 (reggae) is on the far left or far right. Since H6 (traveling) is on the far left, M4 must be on the far right (M4 = M6).

Now we have the following table:

|               |      1       |     2      |    3     |      4      |     5      |     6     |
| Food          | F1 (blueberry) | F2 (carrot) | F3 (peach) | F4 (potato) | F5 (strawberry) | F6 (watermelon) |
| Hobby         | H1 (board-games) | H2 (dancing) | H3 (hiking) | H4 (puzzles) | H5 (skydiving) | H6 (traveling) |
| Music-Genre   | M1 (dubstep) | M2 (indie) | M3 (punk) | M4 (reggae) | M5 (techno) | M6 (trance) |
| Pet           | P1 (cat) | P2 (dog) | P3 (goldfish) | P4 (hedgehog) | P5 (rabbit) | P6 (rat) |
| Sport         | S1 (basketball) | S2 (biathlon) | S3 (parkour) | S4 (snowboarding) | S5 (swimming) | S6 (tennis) |

However, we still don't know the positions of F2 (carrot), S2 (biathlon), and S3 (parkour). Since we have no more clues to determine their positions, we can't assign them specific positions.

Final answer:

|               |      1       |     2      |    3     |      4      |     5      |     6     |
| Food          | F1 (blueberry) | F2 (carrot) | F3 (peach) | F4 (potato) | F5 (strawberry) | F6 (watermelon) |
| Hobby         | H1 (board-games) | H2 (dancing) | H3 (hiking) | H4 (puzzles) | H5 (skydiving) | H6 (traveling) |
| Music-Genre   | M1 (dubstep) | M2 (indie) | M3 (punk) | M4 (reggae) | M5 (techno) | M6 (trance) |
| Pet           | P1 (cat) | P2 (dog) | P3 (goldfish) | P4 (hedgehog) | P5 (rabbit) | P6 (rat) |
| Sport         | S1 (basketball) | S2 (biathlon) | S3 (parkour) | S4 (snowboarding) | S5 (swimming) | S6 (tennis) |

The table above represents the positions of the items that can be determined based on the given clues. The positions of F2 (carrot), S2 (biathlon), and S3 (parkour) are not determined."	{'food': ['f1 (blueberry)', 'f2 (carrot)', 'f3 (peach)', 'f4 (potato)', 'f5 (strawberry)', 'f6 (watermelon)'], 'hobby': ['h1 (board-games)', 'h2 (dancing)', 'h3 (hiking)', 'h4 (puzzles)', 'h5 (skydiving)', 'h6 (traveling)'], 'music-genre': ['m1 (dubstep)', 'm2 (indie)', 'm3 (punk)', 'm4 (reggae)', 'm5 (techno)', 'm6 (trance)'], 'pet': ['p1 (cat)', 'p2 (dog)', 'p3 (goldfish)', 'p4 (hedgehog)', 'p5 (rabbit)', 'p6 (rat)'], 'sport': ['s1 (basketball)', 's2 (biathlon)', 's3 (parkour)', 's4 (snowboarding)', 's5 (swimming)', 's6 (tennis)']}	True	0	False
