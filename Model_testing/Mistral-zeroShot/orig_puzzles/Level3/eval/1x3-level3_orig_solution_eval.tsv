Lv3-1x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three different music genres: rock, soul, and trance.

2. The fan of trance is on the far left or far right. This means that either the first or the third column represents trance.

3. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance. If trance is in the first column, then soul must be in the second column. If trance is in the third column, then soul must be in the first column.

4. This leaves the remaining genre, rock, for the middle column.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|  1   |  2   |   3    |
| Rock  | Soul | Trance |

Lv3-1x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the snake is in the middle, so we can fill the middle row with the snake. Let's assume the snake is in the second column (column 2). So, the table looks like this:

   |       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
   | Pet   |         |   Snake|       |

2. Now, since the snake is on the right of the owner of the hamster, the hamster cannot be in the middle column. So, the hamster must be in either the first or the third column.

   If the hamster is in the first column, then the horse must be in the third column because the horse is not the owner of the snake (since the snake is in the second column) and is not on the far left (as per rule 1). This would mean the table looks like this:

   |       |    1   |   2   |   3   |
   | Pet   | Hamster| Snake | Horse|

   But this arrangement violates rule 1, as the horse is not on the far left or far right. So, the hamster cannot be in the first column.

   If the hamster is in the third column, then the horse must be in the first column because the horse is not the owner of the snake (since the snake is in the second column) and is not on the far right (as per rule 1). This would mean the table looks like this:

   |       |    1   |   2   |   3   |
   | Pet   | Horse | Snake | Hamster|

   This arrangement satisfies all the rules. So, the final solution is:

   |       |    1   |   2   |   3   |
   | Pet   | Horse | Snake | Hamster|
   ################

So, the final arrangement is: Horse on the far left, Snake in the middle, and Hamster on the far right."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three people, and they use three different means of transport: taxi, train, and tram.

2. The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right. Let's consider the tram driver on the far left first.

3. If the tram driver is on the far left, then the taxi driver must be on the far right (since the tram driver is on the left of the taxi driver). This leaves the train driver in the middle.

4. However, if the tram driver is on the far left, the puzzle states that the tram driver is not on the far right, which contradicts the position of the taxi driver. So, the tram driver cannot be on the far left.

5. Now, let's consider the tram driver on the far right. In this case, the taxi driver must be on the left (not the far left, because the tram driver is on the far right). This leaves the train driver in the middle.

6. The tram driver is on the right of the person driving the taxi, so the tram driver must be in the middle column and the taxi driver in the leftmost column.

7. The train driver must be in the rightmost column, as there are no other positions left.

So, the final solution table is:

  |             |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Transport   | Taxi | Tram | Train |
#############

Final answer: Taxi in the leftmost column, Tram in the middle column, and Train in the rightmost column."	{'transport': ['taxi', 'tram', 'train']}	True	0	False
Lv3-1x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of dancing is on the far left, we can place dancing in the first column.

| Hobby   | 1   |   2    |    3    |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| Hobby  | dancing|   |         |

2. Now, we know that the person with the hobby of writing is either on the far left or far right. Since the dancing person is already on the far left, the writing person must be on the far right.

| Hobby   | 1   |   2    |    3    |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| Hobby  | dancing| writing|         |

3. This leaves the middle column for the hobby of sudoku.

So, the final solution table is:

| Hobby   | 1   |   2    |    3    |
|--------|-----|--------|---------|
| Hobby  | dancing| writing| sudoku  |

Therefore, the final solution is:

Lv3-1x3-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the genres are classical, folk, and techno, and there are 3 people.

2. The fan of techno is on the far right, so we can place techno in the rightmost column.

3. Since there are only 3 genres and 1 is already placed, the other 2 genres (classical and folk) must be in the remaining columns.

4. If the fan of classical was on the far left, then classical would have to be in the leftmost column, and folk would be in the middle column. But this would mean that techno is in the rightmost column, which contradicts the fact that techno is on the far right.

5. Therefore, the fan of classical cannot be on the far left. This means the fan of classical must be in the middle column, and folk in the leftmost column.

6. So, the final solution table is:

   |               |     1     |  2   |   3    |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical | Folk | Techno |

Final answer: | Classical | Folk | Techno |"	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x3-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person watching documentary movies is in the middle. So, the arrangement can be:
   - Documentary - Martial Arts - Adventure
   - Adventure - Documentary - Martial Arts

2. The person watching martial arts movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. So, the possible arrangements are:
   - Documentary - Martial Arts - Adventure
   - Adventure (not possible because martial arts can't be on the left)

3. So, the final arrangement is:
   - Documentary - Martial Arts - Adventure

Now, let's put the movie genres in the table:

|               |     1     |      2      |      3       |

| Martial Arts  | Documentary|            |              |

But since the table is numbered from left to right, the correct arrangement is:

|               |     1     |      2      |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |              |

Lv3-1x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, we know that coffee cannot be in the rightmost position (position 3). So, coffee can only be in position 1 or 2.

2. If coffee was in position 1, then hot-chocolate would have to be in position 2. But since the person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right, tea would have to be in position 3. However, this would mean that the person drinking tea is between the two who drink coffee and hot-chocolate, which contradicts the rule that the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

3. Therefore, coffee must be in position 2. This means hot-chocolate is in position 1 and tea is in position 3.

So, the final solution table is:

```

   | Beverage   | Almond-milk |         |         |

2. Now, the person drinking mirinda is on the far left or far right. Since the almond-milk drinker is already on the far left, mirinda must be on the far right.

Lv3-1x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the manager cannot be in the middle, they must be either in the first or the third column. Let's assume the manager is in the first column (Job 1).

2. Now, the fisherman must be to the right of the manager, so they can only be in the second or third column. If the fisherman were in the third column, the manager would have to be in the first column, which contradicts our initial assumption. So, the fisherman must be in the second column (Job 2).

3. This leaves the third column (Job 3) for the firefighter, as it's the only remaining job and position.

The final solution table is:

Lv3-1x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Colombian is on the far left, we can place the Colombian in the first column. So, the first row will be filled with ""Colombian"".

2. Now, we know that the Turkish is to the right of the Mexican. This means the Turkish cannot be in the first column (since the Colombian is there) and cannot be in the first row (since the Colombian is above it). So, the Turkish must be in the second or third row and second or third column.

3. The Mexican can be either in the first or second column and second or third row, but not in the same row as the Turkish (since the Turkish is to the right of the Mexican). Also, the Mexican cannot be in the first row (since the Colombian is there).

4. Let's place the Mexican in the second row and second column. This means the Mexican is to the left of the Turkish (as per the third rule).

5. Now, the Turkish can only be in the third row and third column, as it is to the right of the Mexican.

So, the final solution table is:
