Lv3-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is drawing is driving the boat, so we can place 'drawing' in the first row under '1' and 'boat' in the corresponding row under 'Transport'.

2. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is in the middle, so we can place 'filmmaking' in the third row under '3'. Since there are only 5 hobbies, the person driving the van must be the filmmaker, so we can place 'van' in the third row under 'Transport'.

3. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the filmmaker is in the middle, the helicopter driver cannot be in the middle, so they must be in the first or second row. Let's assume the helicopter driver is in the first row for now. This means the trike driver must be in the second or third row. However, the trike driver cannot be in the third row because the filmmaker is there. So, the trike driver must be in the second row. This means the helicopter driver is in the first row. Therefore, we can place 'helicopter' in the first row under '1' and 'trike' in the second row under 'Transport'.

4. The person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the trike, so we can place 'helicopter' to the right of 'trike' in the 'Transport' column.

5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person driving the van, so we already know where the van is.

6. The person driving the scooter is the person who's hobby is chess, so we can place 'chess' in the fifth row under '5' and 'scooter' in the corresponding row under 'Transport'.

7. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person driving the scooter, so the drawing person must be in the fourth or fifth row. However, the drawing person cannot be in the fifth row because the scooter driver is there. So, the drawing person must be in the fourth row. This means the scooter driver is in the fifth row.

8. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter driver is in the first row, the hiker can be in the first or second row. Let's assume the hiker is in the first row for now. This means the hobby in the second row must be baking because the hiker cannot be the filmmaker (since the filmmaker is in the third row), the hiker cannot be the drawing person (since the drawing person is in the fourth row), and the hiker cannot be the scooter driver (since the scooter driver is the chess person and is in the fifth row). So, we can place 'hiking' in the first row under '1' and 'baking' in the second row under 'Hobby'.

9. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter, but we already placed the hiker in the first row. This means the hiker must be on the left of the helicopter driver. So, we can swap the positions of 'helicopter' and 'hiking' in the 'Transport' column.

Now, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Let's assume Drawing is in position 1 and Cooking is in position 2.

2. The Russian is the person who's hobby is baking, and the person who's hobby is baking is in the middle. So, Baking must be in position 3.

3. Since the Russian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing, the Russian (Baking) can't be in position 1 (Drawing) or position 2 (Cooking). So, the Russian must be in position 4 or 5. But since the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left, the Russian can't be in position 5. So, the Russian is in position 4.

4. Now, we know that the hobby in position 1 is Drawing, position 2 is Cooking, position 3 is Baking (Russian), and position 4 is Baking (Russian again, as it's the only nationality left for this position).

5. The hobby in position 5 must be Gardening, as the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.

6. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the Mexican. Since we already know the positions of Drawing, Cooking, Baking (twice), and Gardening, the only position left for Fishing is position 2.

7. The Chinese is on the right of the Thai. Since we already know the positions of Drawing, Cooking, Baking (twice), Gardening, and Fishing, the only positions left for Chinese and Thai are positions 1 and 2. But we know Fishing is in position 2, so the Thai must be in position 1 and the Chinese in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the roller. Let's place them in the table:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   |         |      |          |           |          |

   | Lemonade   | Roller  |      |          |           |          |

2. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person drinking lemonade is driving the roller, we can't place the taxi yet. Let's place the other transports:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| Roller   | Taxi    |

3. The person driving the taxi is between the person drinking mirinda and the person driving the roller. Since we know the roller is driving lemonade, the taxi must be between mirinda and tea. But we don't know the order yet. Let's place mirinda and tea:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| Roller   | Taxi    |

   | Lemonade   | Roller  |      |          | Mirinda   | Taxi    |
   | Mirinda    |         |      |          |           |         |
   | Tea        |         |      |          |           |         |

4. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we know the quad-bike is in the 3rd position, tea must be in the 5th position:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| Roller   | Taxi    |

   | Mirinda    |         |      |          |           |         |

5. The person drinking tea is on the far right. We already placed tea in the 5th position, so it's correct.

6. The person driving the taxi is the person drinking 7up. Since we know the taxi is in the 4th position, 7up must be in the 4th position:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| 7up      | Tea      |

   | Mirinda    |         |      |          | 7up       |         |

7. The person drinking mirinda is the person driving the boat. Since we know the boat is in the 2nd position, mirinda must be in the 2nd position:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| 7up      | Tea      |
   |------------|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
   | Lemonade   | Roller  | Mirinda| Quad-bike|           |         |

8. The person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we know the roller is in the 1st position and the quad-bike is in the 3rd position, the quad-bike must be in the 4th position:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |
   | Transport   | Airplane| Boat | Quad-bike| 7up      | Tea      |
   |------------|---------|------|----------|-----------|----------|
   | Lemonade   | Roller  | Mirinda|           | Quad-bike|         |

9. Now we can place the airplane and the boat:

   | Beverage    |    1    |  2   |    3     |     4     |    5     |

Lv3-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the musician is on the far left, we can place the musician in the first column. Let's put him as the beverage ""7up"" for now.

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              |          |             |

2. The coach is on the left of the dressmaker, so the coach must be in the second row and second column. Let's put him as the ""almond-milk"" for now.

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |
   |--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              |          |             |

3. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer, so the photographer must be in the second row and fifth column. Let's put him as the ""lemonade"" for now.

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |
   |--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              | Photographer|             |

4. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk is in the second column, iced-tea must be in the first column. Let's put it as the ""fanta"" for now.

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |
   |--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              | Photographer|             |

5. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, which contradicts our current arrangement. However, since the person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer, we can swap the positions of fanta and 7up.

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              | Photographer|             |

6. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Now, fanta is in the second column and iced-tea must be in the first column. So, iced-tea is ""fanta"" and fanta is ""7up"".

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |

   | Coach  | Dressmaker|              | Photographer|             |

7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Now, iced-tea is in the first column and almond-milk must be in the second column. So, almond-milk is ""dressmaker"" and dressmaker is ""almond-milk"".

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |
   |--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|

   | Coach  | Almond-milk|              | Photographer|             |

8. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Now, fanta is in the second column and iced-tea must be in the first column. So, iced-tea is ""coach"" and coach is ""iced-tea"".

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |

   | Coach  | Almond-milk|              | Photographer|             |

9. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Now, fanta is in the second column and iced-tea must be in the first column. This arrangement already satisfies this condition.

10. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer. Now, 7up is in the first column and photographer must be in the fifth column. So, photographer is ""lemonade"" and lemonade is ""photographer"".

   |    1    |    2     |      3       |    4     |      5      |
   |--------|----------|--------------|----------|-------------|

   | Coach  | Almond-milk|              |           |             |

Now, let's check the final arrangement:

- The person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer (Iced-tea -> Coach -> Almond-milk -> Fantas -> Iced-tea)
- The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (Iced-tea -> Coach -> Almond-milk)
- The musician is on the far left (7up)
- The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right (Almond-milk)
- The person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer (Iced-tea -> Coach -> Almond-milk -> Fantas -> Iced-tea)
- The coach is on the left of the dressmaker (Iced-tea -> Coach -> Dressmaker)
- The person drinking 7up is on the left of the photographer (Iced-tea -> Coach -> Almond-milk -> Fantas -> Iced-tea)

Lv3-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is rowing is the person who's sport is rowing (rule 4), we can fill that in as Rowing.
2. Rowing is between Fanta and Rugby (rule 2), so we can fill in Fanta and Rugby as well. Let's assume Fanta is on the left of Rowing and Rugby is on the right of Rowing.
3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person drinking 7up (rule 3), so 7up must be on the left of Skateboarding.
4. The person drinking lemonade is between Rowing and Tea (rule 5), so Lemonade must be on the right of Rowing and on the left of Tea.
5. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (rule 6), and we already know the position of Lemonade. Since there are only two empty spots left, Water must be on the other side of Lemonade.
6. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left (rule 8), so Biathlon goes in the first spot.
7. Now we have Biathlon, Rowing, Fanta, Lemonade, Tea, Water, and Skateboarding for sports and 7up, Lemonade, Tea, Water, and something for beverages. Since we know the positions of Biathlon, Rowing, Fanta, Lemonade, and Tea, the only possible position for 7up is the last one, and the only possible position for Skateboarding is the second to last.
8. The only beverage left is water, and since it's on the left or right of Lemonade (rule 6), it must be on the right of Lemonade, making the final solution:

Lv3-2x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who sings is to the left of the person who plays card-games, and the person who plays puzzles is to the left or right of the subway driver, we can place the person who sings and the person who plays card-games on opposite ends. Let's place the person who sings on the far left (column 1) and the person who plays card-games on the far right (column 5).

2. The person who plays puzzles is the driver of the roller. So, we place 'Puzzles' in the second column and 'Roller' in the corresponding row.

3. Since the person who plays puzzles is to the left of the subway driver, the subway driver must be in column 3 or 4. However, the subway driver cannot be in column 4 because the person who plays puzzles is already there. So, the subway driver is in column 3.

4. The person who plays card-games is to the right of the subway driver, so the person who plays card-games is in column 4.

5. The person who plays puzzles is to the left of the person driving the subway, so the person driving the subway (in column 3) cannot be driving the jet-ski (since the jet-ski driver is to the left of the ship driver according to rule 6). Therefore, the person driving the subway must be driving the ship, and the person driving the jet-ski must be in column 1. So, 'Jet-ski' goes in the first row and 'Ship' goes in the third row.

6. Since the person who plays card-games is in column 4, the person who plays collecting must be in column 5. So, 'Collecting' goes in the fifth column.

7. The person who plays card-games is to the right of the person who plays puzzles, so the person who plays puzzles (in column 2) cannot be driving the roller (since the person who plays collecting is to the right of the person driving the roller according to rule 5). Therefore, the person who plays puzzles must be driving the skateboard, and the person driving the roller must be in the fourth row. So, 'Roller' goes in the fourth row and 'Skateboard' goes in the second row.

8. The person who plays card-games is in column 4, and the person who plays puzzles is in column 2. Since the person who sings is to the right of the person who plays reading, and the person who plays card-games is to the right of the person who plays puzzles, the person who plays reading must be in column 1. So, 'Reading' goes in the first row.

9. Since the person who plays card-games is in column 4, the person who sings must be in column 3. So, 'Singing' goes in the third column.

Lv3-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the musical and comedy movie watchers are next to each other, so let's place them first. Let's assume Comedy is on the left (1st position) and Musical is on the right (2nd position).

2. The Fish owner is either on the left or right of the Bird owner. Since the Bird owner is on the far left or far right, the Fish owner can't be in the 1st or 5th position. So, the Fish owner can be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Let's place the Fish owner in the 3rd position for now.

3. The Drama movie watcher is the owner of the Goldfish. Since the Goldfish owner is in the 3rd position, the Drama movie watcher must be in the 4th position.

4. The Drama movie watcher is on the right of the Chinchilla owner. Since the Drama movie watcher is in the 4th position, the Chinchilla owner can be in the 1st, 2nd, or 5th position. Let's place the Chinchilla owner in the 1st position for now.

5. The Zombie movie watcher is on the left or right of the Fish owner. Since the Fish owner is in the 3rd position, the Zombie movie watcher can be in the 2nd, 4th, or 5th position. Let's place the Zombie movie watcher in the 5th position for now.

6. The Animation movie watcher is on the right of the Goldfish owner (who is in the 4th position). So, the Animation movie watcher can be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position. Let's place the Animation movie watcher in the 2nd position.

7. The Rabbit owner is on the far right. Since the Animation movie watcher is in the 2nd position, the Rabbit owner must be in the 5th position.

8. Now, we have a conflict with the Zombie movie watcher being in the 5th position and the Rabbit owner being in the 5th position. To resolve this, we need to move the Zombie movie watcher to the 4th position and the Rabbit owner to the 5th position.

Final solution:

Lv3-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the dressmaker eats cabbage and is either to the left or right of the firefighter. Let's assume the firefighter is in position 3 (since the dressmaker can't be in position 1 or 5 due to the corn and apricot conditions).

2. Since the scientist is between the person eating corn and the person eating cabbage, the scientist can't be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. So, the scientist must be in position 3. But this contradicts our assumption that the firefighter is in position 3. So, the firefighter can't be in position 3. Let's try placing the firefighter in position 2 instead.

3. Now, the dressmaker can be in positions 1, 4, or 5. If the dressmaker is in position 1, the scientist must be in position 5, which means the person eating corn must be in position 2. But this contradicts the condition that the person eating corn is on the left of the person eating artichoke. So, the dressmaker can't be in position 1.

4. If the dressmaker is in position 5, the scientist must be in position 1, which means the person eating corn must be in position 4. But this contradicts the condition that the person eating corn is on the far left or far right. So, the dressmaker can't be in position 5.

5. Therefore, the dressmaker must be in position 4. This means the scientist is in position 1, the firefighter is in position 2, and the dressmaker is in position 4.

6. The person eating corn is to the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the scientist is in position 1 and the dressmaker is in position 4, the person eating corn must be in position 2 and the person eating artichoke must be in position 3.

7. The scientist is between the person eating corn and the person eating cabbage. So, the person eating cabbage must be in position 5.

8. The dancer is on the right of the person eating apricot. Since the scientist is in position 1, the person eating apricot must be in position 3. But this contradicts the condition that the person eating corn is on the left of the person eating artichoke. So, there must be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore the condition that the dancer is on the right of the person eating apricot, the solution would be:

|        |      1       |     2     |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   | Scientist   | Corn     | Artichoke | Dressmaker  | Cabbage |
| Job    | Scientist   | Firefighter| Dancer    | Dressmaker  | None   |

But this solution contradicts the condition that the dancer is on the right of the person eating apricot, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle."	{'food': ['scientist', 'corn', 'artichoke', 'dressmaker', 'cabbage'], 'job': ['scientist', 'firefighter', 'dancer', 'dressmaker', 'none']}	True	0	False
Lv3-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Canadian is the fan of blues, so we can place the Canadian in the first row and first column (1,1) and write 'Canadian' in the Nationality column and 'Blues' in the Music-Genre column.

2. The fan of indie is on the far left, so it must be in the first row. Since the Canadian is already in the first row, the fan of indie must be in the second column (1,2). We write 'Indie' in the Music-Genre column for (1,2).

3. The fan of electronic is on the right of the American. Since the Canadian is not American, the American must be in the second row. The fan of electronic cannot be in the first column (2,1) because the fan of indie is there. So, the fan of electronic must be in the third column (2,3). We write 'Electronic' in the Music-Genre column for (2,3).

4. The fan of indie is on the left of the American. Since the fan of indie is in the second row and second column (1,2), the American must be in the third row.

5. The turkish is in the middle, so it must be in the third row and third column (3,3). We write 'Turkish' in the Nationality column for (3,3).

6. The turkish is on the left or right of the french. Since the french nationality has not been placed yet, let's assume the french is in the fourth column (4,4). If the turkish is on the right of the french, it should be in the fourth row and fourth column (4,4). If the turkish is on the left of the french, it should be in the fourth row and fifth column (4,5). Let's try both possibilities:

   a) If the turkish is in (4,4), the french must be in (5,4). We write 'French' in the Nationality column for (5,4). Since the fan of pop is the last genre, it must be in the fifth row and fifth column (5,5). We write 'Pop' in the Music-Genre column for (5,5).

   b) If the turkish is in (4,5), the french must be in (5,4) as before. However, the fan of pop cannot be in (5,5) because the fan of r&b is on the right of the turkish. So, let's try the fan of r&b in (5,5) and the fan of pop in (5,4). We write 'R&B' in the Music-Genre column for (5,5) and 'Pop' in the Music-Genre column for (5,4).

7. The fan of r&b is on the right of the turkish. In the first possibility, the fan of r&b is not on the right of the turkish because the fan of r&b is in (5,5) and the turkish is in (4,4). In the second possibility, the fan of r&b is on the right of the turkish because the fan of r&b is in (5,5) and the turkish is in (4,5).

Since the second possibility satisfies all the conditions, the final solution is:

Lv3-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person with the hobby of drawing is on the left of the owner of the dog, we can place the dog owner and the drawing hobby on the leftmost and second columns, respectively. Let's assume the hobby of drawing is in column 2.

4. The owner of the horse is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is baking. Since the skydiving hobby is in column 1, the horse hobby must be in column 2 or 4. Let's place it in column 2 for now.

| Hobby   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| Pet     | Skydiving| Horse  | Reading|      |      |
| Dog     |       |       |       |      |      |

5. The person with the hobby of skydiving is the owner of the rabbit. Since the skydiving hobby is in column 1, we can place the rabbit pet in column 1.

| Hobby   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4    | 5    |
| Pet     | Rabbit | Horse  | Reading|      |      |
| Dog     |       |       |       |      |      |

6. The owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the dog. Since the dog is in the first row, the rat must be in column 4 or 5. Let's place it in column 4 for now.

| Hobby   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5    |

| Dog     |       |       |       |       |      |

7. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the rabbit is in column 1, the hedgehog must be in column 2 or 3. Let's place it in column 2 for now.

| Hobby   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5    |
| Pet     | Rabbit | Hedgehog| Reading| Rat   |      |
| Dog     |       |       |       |       |      |

8. The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the drawing hobby is in column 2, the dog can be in column 1 or 3. Let's place it in column 3 for now.

| Pet     | Rabbit | Hedgehog| Reading| Rat   | Dog  |

9. The only hobby left is baking. Since it's not possible to place the horse, hedgehog, or dog in column 4 or 5, the only option left for baking is column 5.

| Hobby   | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5    |
| Pet     | Rabbit | Hedgehog| Reading| Rat   | Baking|

10. Now, let's check the pets. The only possible arrangement for pets is: Dog, Hedgehog, Rabbit, Rat, Horse.
