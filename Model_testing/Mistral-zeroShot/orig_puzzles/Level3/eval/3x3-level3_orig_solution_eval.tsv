Lv3-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of rock is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the fan of rock is on the far left (Rock on column 1).

2. Since the fan of rock is on the far left, the fan of folk (Folk on column 2) must be watching romance movies (from rule 3).

3. Now, the fan of reggae (Reggae on column 3) must be on the left of the person watching superhero movies (Superhero on column 2 or column 3). But since we already placed Folk (Romance) on column 2, Reggae must be on column 3.

4. Now, the person eating peach (Peach) must be between the person watching superhero movies and the person eating potato (from rule 5). Since we know Reggae (Superhero) is on column 3, Peach can only be on column 2 or column 3. But if Peach was on column 3, it would mean Potato is on column 1, which contradicts our initial assumption that Rock is on column 1. So, Peach must be on column 2.

5. Now, the only place left for Potato is on column 1.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1    |    2     |     3     |

Lv3-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 movie genres and 3 people, each person must watch a different genre. Let's assume the person on the far left watches crime movies (C). The person on the far right must watch either martial-arts (M) or romance (R). Let's assume the person on the far right watches M for now.

   | Movie-Genre | 1   | 2   | 3    |
   |------------|-----|-----|------|
   | Nationality |    |    |      |
   | Pet        |    |    |      |

   Now we know the person in the middle must watch romance (R).

2. The Russian (RU) is on the right of the person watching crime movies (C). So, the person in the middle (R) cannot be Russian. This means the person on the far right must be Russian (RU) and watching martial-arts (M).

   | Movie-Genre | 1   | 2 (R) | 3 (RU, M) |
   |------------|-----|-------|-----------|
   | Nationality |    |      |           |
   | Pet        |    |      |           |

3. The owner of the turtle (T) is on the left of the owner of the dog (D). Since the person in the middle (R) cannot be the owner of the turtle (T), the person on the far left must be the owner of the turtle (T).

   | Movie-Genre | 1 (T) | 2 (R) | 3 (RU, M) |
   |------------|-------|-------|-----------|
   | Nationality | IN   |      |           |
   | Pet        | T    |      |           |

4. Now we know the person on the far right is Indonesian (IN) and owns a dog (D). Since the person in the middle (R) is not German (DE), the person on the far left must be German (DE).

   | Movie-Genre | 1 (DE) | 2 (R) | 3 (IN, D) |
   |------------|--------|-------|-----------|
   | Nationality | DE    |      | IN        |

1. We know that the writer eats radish, so we can fill in the first column for the Food row: `Radish`
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far left, and the person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the writer eats radish, the avocado must be in the first column. So, the second column for the Food row is `Avocado`.
3. Now we know that the musician is in the middle, so the second column for the Job row is `Musician`.
4. Since the person eating avocado is the person who's sport is baseball, and we have avocado in the second column, the third column for the Sport row must be `Baseball`.
5. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person eating onion. Since we have baseball on the far left, basketball cannot be in the first column. So, the third column for the Sport row must be `Basketball`.
6. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since we have basketball in the third column, cycling must be in the second or third column. However, since the musician is in the middle, cycling cannot be in the second column. So, the second column for the Sport row is `Cycling`.
7. Now we know that the person eating onion is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball and on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since we have basketball and cycling in the second and third columns, the onion must be in the third column. So, the first column for the Food row is `Onion`.

The final solution table is:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person eating kiwi. Let's place photography on the far left and kiwi in the second column. So, the first row looks like this:

   | Hobby   | Photography |  |
   | Food    |            | Kiwi |

2. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person eating plum. Since plum is not placed yet, we can't determine the exact position of lacrosse yet. But we know that it can't be in the first column because photography is there. So, let's place plum in the third column for now:

   | Hobby   | Photography |  | Plum  |
   | Food    |            | Kiwi |       |

3. The person who's sport is climbing is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we don't know the exact position of lacrosse yet, we can't place climbing yet. But we know that it can't be in the first column because photography is there, and it can't be in the fourth column because soccer is there. So, climbing can only be in the second column.

   | Hobby   | Photography | Climbing | Plum  |
   | Food    |            |         |       |
   | Sport   |            |         |       |

4. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right. Since we already have three elements in the table, soccer must be in the third column:

   | Hobby   | Photography | Climbing | Plum  |
   | Food    |            |         | Soccer|
   | Sport   |            | Lacrosse|       |

5. Now we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is either in the first or second row. Since climbing is in the second row, lacrosse must be in the first row:

   | Hobby   | Photography | Climbing | Plum  |
   | Food    |            |         | Soccer|
   | Sport   | Lacrosse   |         |       |

6. The person eating plum is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since we don't know the exact position of puzzles yet, we can't determine the exact position of plum yet. But we know that plum can't be in the first column because photography is there, and it can't be in the third column because soccer is there. So, plum can only be in the second column. But since plum is already in the second column, it must be in its correct position.

   | Hobby   | Photography | Climbing | Plum  |
   | Food    | Corn       |         | Kiwi  |
   | Sport   | Lacrosse   | Soccer   |       |

7. The person who's hobby is puzzles is to the right of the person eating plum. Since plum is in the second column, puzzles must be in the fourth column:

   | Hobby   | Photography | Climbing | Plum  | Puzzles |
   | Food    | Corn       |         | Kiwi  |         |

Lv3-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Japanese is on the left of the owner of the bird, so we can place the Japanese in the first column and the bird in the second column. Let's place the Japanese in the first row and the bird in the second row (since the Japanese must be on the left). So, the first two rows look like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  |   Bird   |

   | Pet           |          |          |

2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the bird is in the second row, we can place the lizard in the third row. The lizard must be on the left or right of the owner of the horse, so let's place the lizard in the first column of the third row and the horse in the second column. The nationality of the owner of the lizard is not determined yet, but we know it's not Japanese (since the Japanese is on the left of the lizard). Let's place a Brazilian in the first row (since the Japanese is on the right of the Brazilian). So, the second and third rows look like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  |   Bird   |

   | Pet           |   Lizard  |          |

3. The person eating asparagus is on the far left. Since the Brazilian is on the far left, the asparagus must be eaten by the person in the first row. So, the first row looks like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  |   Bird   |

   | Pet           |   Lizard  |          |

4. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is in the first column of the third row, the cauliflower can be in the first or third column of the third row. Let's place it in the third column to avoid having two food items in the same column. So, the third row looks like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  |   Bird   |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian |          |

   | Food          | Asparagus|   Horse  |
   | Nationality   |          |          |
   | Pet           |   Lizard  | Cauliflower |

5. The person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is in the first column of the third row, the nationality of the owner of the cauliflower must be different from the nationality of the owner of the lizard (Japanese). Let's place a French in the second row (since the Brazilian is on the left of the French). So, the second row looks like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  |   Bird   |

   | Nationality   |          |          |
   | Pet           |   Lizard  | Cauliflower |

6. The person eating garlic is not on the far left or far right. Since the asparagus is on the far left and the cauliflower is in the third column, the garlic must be in the second column of one of the rows. Let's place it in the second column of the second row (since the horse is in the second column of the third row). So, the second row looks like this:

   |               |     1     |    2     |
   | Food          | Japanese  | Garlic  |
   | Nationality   | Brazilian | French   |

1. The person eating orange is on the far left, so Orange is in the first column.
2. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching musical movies, and the person eating orange is on the far left, the only possible position for Lemonade is the second column.
3. The person drinking water is on the far right, so Water is in the third column.
4. Now we know that the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since Water is in the far right, Mirinda must be in the second column, as it cannot be in the first column (orange) or the third column (water).
5. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since Cherry is Orange's left neighbor (first column), the only possible position for Comedy is the third column.
6. Now we know that the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since Lemonade is in the second column, the only possible position for Musical is the first column.

2. From point 1, we know that the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the van. So, we can place the bike driver in the second position (row 2) and the van driver in the third position (row 3).

3. From point 2, we know that the person driving the boat is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver is in the third position, the boat driver must be in the first position (row 1).

4. From point 3, we know that the owner of the goat is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since the boat driver is watching adventure movies (in row 1), the goat owner must be in row 2.

5. From point 4, we know that the owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the goat owner is in row 2, the hamster owner must be in row 3.

6. From point 5, we know that the person watching comedy movies is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the boat. Since the bike driver is in row 2 and the boat driver is in row 1, the comedy watcher must be in row 3.

7. Now we know the positions of all activities for each person. Let's fill in the table:

Lv3-3x3-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person eating radish is either on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Let's assume for now that the radish eater is on the left of action. This means the action movie watcher is in the middle, and the radish eater is in the first column.

2. The cucumber eater is on the far right, so they must be in the third column.

3. The hamster owner is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the action movie watcher (who is also the radish eater) is in the middle, the satire movie watcher must be on the right of the radish eater, and the hamster owner must be in the second column.

4. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the action movie watcher (radish eater) is in the first column, the thriller movie watcher must be in the middle.

5. The owner of the snake is on the far left. Since the radish eater is already in the far left, the snake owner must be in the first row.

Now, let's put the information into a table:

|               |   1    |    2     |    3     |
| Food          | Snake  | Hamster | Cucumber |
| Movie-Genre   | Action | Satire  | Thriller |
| Pet           | Frog   |        |          |

We still have an empty spot for the pet in the second row. Since the hamster owner is on the left of the satire movie watcher, and the satire movie watcher is on the right of the radish eater, the hamster owner cannot be on the right of the radish eater. Therefore, the hamster owner cannot be in the third column. So, the pet in the second row must be a frog.

Final solution:

1. The person who's sport is rowing is on the far left. So, Rowing goes in the first column (Column 1).

2. Since the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, and rowing is in the first column, the hobby of collecting must be in the second or third column. Let's assume it's in the second column for now. So, Collecting goes in the second row (Row 2).

3. Now, the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since collecting is in the second row, rugby must be in the third row. So, Rugby goes in the third row (Row 3).

4. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since rugby is in the third row, the taxi driver must be in the second row. So, Taxi goes in the second row (Row 2).

5. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi driver is in the second row, the motorbike driver must be in the third row. So, Motorbike goes in the third row (Row 3).

6. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the taxi driver is in the second row and the motorbike driver is in the third row, the quad-bike driver must be in the first row. So, Quad-bike goes in the first row (Row 1).

7. The only hobby left is video-games. Since it's not on the second column (where collecting is), it must be in the first column. So, Video-games goes in the first row (Row 1).

8. Now, we have the hobbies in the correct columns, and the sports in the correct rows. We just need to arrange the rows so that the sports are in the correct columns. Since rugby is on the right of collecting, and collecting is in the second column, rugby must be in the third column. So, we swap the second and third rows.

2. The person driving the car is on the right of the scientist, so the second row (Transport) can't have 'Car' in the second position. Let's fill the first and third positions:
   | Job   | Scientist | Security-guard | Architect  |
   |-------|----------|---------------|------------|
   | Pet   | Turtle   |               |            |
   | Transport| Car      | Helicopter    | Scooter    |

3. The security-guard is on the left of the scientist, so the second row (Job) can't have 'Security-guard' in the second position. Let's fill the second position with 'Scientist' and the third position with 'Architect':
   | Job   | Scientist | Scientist      | Architect  |
   |-------|----------|---------------|------------|
   | Pet   | Turtle   |               |            |
   | Transport| Car      | Helicopter    | Scooter    |

4. The security-guard is on the far left or far right. Since the first position is already filled with 'Scientist', the security-guard must be on the far right. Let's fill the first row (Job) accordingly:
   | Job   | Architect | Security-guard | Scientist  |
   |-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
   | Pet   | Turtle   |               |            |
   | Transport| Car      | Helicopter    | Scooter    |

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the 'Architect' is on the far right, the 'Chinchilla' must be in the third position of the Pet row. The 'Mouse' must be in the second position. Let's fill the Pet row:
   | Job   | Architect | Security-guard | Scientist  |
   |-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
   | Pet   | Chinchilla| Turtle        | Mouse      |
   | Transport| Car      | Helicopter    | Scooter    |

6. The person driving the scooter is on the far left. Since the 'Scientist' is already in the far left of the Job row, the 'Scooter' must be in the first position of the Transport row. Let's fill the Transport row:
   | Job   | Architect | Security-guard | Scientist  |
   |-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
   | Pet   | Chinchilla| Turtle        | Mouse      |
   | Transport| Scooter   | Car          | Helicopter |

So the final solution table is:

#############
| Job   | Architect | Security-guard | Scientist  |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| Pet   | Chinchilla| Turtle        | Mouse      |
| Transport| Scooter   | Car          | Helicopter |
