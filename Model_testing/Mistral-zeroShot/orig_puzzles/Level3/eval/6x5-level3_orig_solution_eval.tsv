Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1      |       2       |     3      |    4    |      5      |
| Food          | A          | B            | C          | G       | X           |
| Hobby         | B          | H            | Y          |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   |         |               |            | U       | O           |
| Pet           | F          | D            | J          | P       | V           |

| Transport     | F          | AA           |             |         | R           |

We still have some variables left without a definite position:

- B, C, G, H, J, K, P, Q, R, S, U, W, AA, X, V, Z

Now let's use the remaining clues to fill in the remaining positions:

26. Q is on the left or right of P (QP)
- Since Q is already placed, we know P must be in a position where Q can be on its left or right. So, P cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

27. W is on the left or right of P (WP)
- Since W is already placed, we know P must be in a position where W can be on its left or right. So, P cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

28. CC is on the left or right of Z (CZ)
- Since CC is already placed, we know Z must be in a position where CC can be on its left or right. So, Z cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

29. AH
- Since A and H are already placed, we know A must be in a position where H can be on its right. So, A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

30. AX
- Since A and X are already placed, we know X must be in a position where A can be on its left. So, X cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

31. SR
- Since S and R are already placed, we know S must be in a position where R can be on its right. So, S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Now we can place P, Z, and CC:

- Since P cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to Q or W, the only remaining position for P is 6.
- Since Z cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to C or S, the only remaining position for Z is 6.
- Since C cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to A or X, the only remaining position for CC is 6.

Now we can place A, X, and S:

- Since A cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to H or S, the only remaining position for A is 6.
- Since X cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to A or G, the only remaining position for X is 4.
- Since S cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to R or N, the only remaining position for S is 2.

Now we can place H, Q, and R:

- Since H cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, and it cannot be next to A or S, the only remaining position for H is 5.
- Since Q is on the left or right of P, and P is in position 6, the only remaining position for Q is 1.
- Since R is on the right of N, and N is in position 4, the only remaining position for R is 5.

Now we can place G, K, and W:

- Since G is the filmmaker (Y = G), and Y is already placed in position 4, the only remaining position for G is 3.
- Since K is the skateboarder (K = J), and J is in position 6, the only remaining position for K is 2.
- Since W is on the left or right of P, and P is in position 6, the only remaining position for W is 1.

Now we can place B, U, and O:

- Since B is between CC and M, and CC and M are already placed, the only remaining position for B is 6.
- Since U is on the left or right of T, and T is already placed in position 4, the only remaining position for U is 3.
- Since O is on the far right, and all other positions are already filled, the only remaining position for O is 5.

Now we can place M and V:

- Since M is not next to A or B, the only remaining position for M is 1.
- Since V is not next to D or P, the only remaining position for V is 5.

Now we have filled the table:

|               |      1      |       2       |     3      |    4    |      5      |
| Food          | M          | A            | G          | X       | V           |
| Hobby         | B          | H            | Y          | T       |             |
| Movie-Genre   | U          |               |            | O       |             |
| Pet           | F          | D            | J          | P       | V           |
| Sport         | E          | Q            | K          | W       | Z           |
| Transport     | F          | AA           |             | R       |             |

We have successfully filled the table according to the given clues.

Lv3-6x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A through E from left to right.

2. We know the nationalities, so we can fill in the Nationality column:
   A - Australian
   B - Brazilian
   C - Colombian
   D - Japanese
   E - Polish

3. We know the sports, so we can fill in the Sport column:
   A - Golf (Polish)
   B - Skiing (left of Brazilian)
   C - Volleyball (right or left of A)
   D - Sailing (left of Guinea-pig owner)
   E - Not determined yet

4. We know the pets, so we can fill in the Pet column for all but E:
   A - Not determined yet
   B - Goldfish (left of Satire movie watcher)
   C - Guinea-pig
   D - Not determined yet
   E - Snake (Helicopter driver)

5. We know the beverages, so we can fill in the Beverage column for all but A and E:
   B - 7up (left of Brazilian)
   C - Not determined yet
   D - Cola
   E - Soy-milk (left of Guinea-pig owner)
   A - Not determined yet

6. We know the movies, so we can fill in the Movie-Genre column for all but A and E:
   B - Adventure (Coffee drinker)
   C - Not determined yet
   D - Time-travel
   E - Satire (left of B)
   A - Not determined yet

7. We know the transport, so we can fill in the Transport column for all but A:
   B - Not determined yet
   C - Not determined yet
   D - Bus (right of Japanese)
   E - Skateboard (left of Tea drinker)
   A - Airplane (left of Skiing)

8. Now let's use the given conditions to fill in the remaining gaps:

   - The person watching sports movies is in the middle (C). So, Sport for C is Volleyball, and Movie-Genre for C is not sports (Time-travel).
   - The person drinking tea is on the left of the person driving the skateboard (E). So, Beverage for E is Tea, and Transport for E is not skateboard (Airplane, Bus, or Helicopter).
   - The owner of the fish is on the left or right of the person driving the train (D). So, Pet for D is Fish.
   - The person driving the train is on the left of the person who's sport is golf (A). So, Transport for A is Train, and Sport for A is Golf.
   - The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (B). So, Transport for B is Airplane.
   - The person watching satire movies is the person drinking tea (E). So, Movie-Genre for E is Satire.
   - The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (C). So, Beverage for C is Soy-milk.
   - The person watching adventure movies is the person drinking coffee (B). So, Movie-Genre for B is Adventure.
   - The brazilian is on the far left or far right. Since the brazilian is already in the middle (B), he must be on the far right (E). So, Nationality for E is Brazilian.
   - The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we don't know who watches zombie movies yet, we can't determine the Pet for D yet.
   - The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we already know the positions of A and C, we can't determine the Sport for A yet.
   - The person driving the bus is on the right of the japanese (D). So, Transport for D is Bus.

9. Now we have a contradiction: the brazilian (E) is on the far right, but the person watching zombie movies must be on the left or right of the owner of the snake (E). This means there is no possible solution for this puzzle.

So, the final solution table is impossible."	{}	False	0	False

Lv3-6x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the frog is on the far left, so the first row is filled: [Frog, _ , _ , _ , _]
2. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left or far right. Since the frog is already on the far left, the second row must be fishing: [Frog, Fishing, _, _, _]
3. The person watching western movies is the person who's sport is golf (3rd condition). Since we don't know the sports yet, let's assume the 3rd row is golf for now: [Frog, Fishing, Golf, _, _]
4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person eating peas (4th condition). Since we don't know the hobbies or food yet, let's assume the 2nd row is photography for now: [Frog, Photography, Golf, _, _] and the 5th row is peas for now: [_, _, _, Peas, _]
5. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby (5th condition). Since we don't know the movies or sports yet, let's assume the 4th row is family for now: [_, Family, _, Rugby, _]
6. The owner of the hamster is on the far left or far right (6th condition). Since the frog and fishing are already on the far left, the 1st row cannot be hamster. So, the 5th row must be hamster: [_, _, _, Hamster, _]

Lv3-6x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can represent them as P1, P2, P3, P4, and P5 from left to right.

2. Let's start with the beverages:
   - Almond-milk is eaten by P6 (from clue 6).
   - Sprite is watched by P5 (from clue 2).
   - Iced-tea is watched by P3 (from clues 11 and 15).
   - Juice is on the left or right of P4 eating pear (from clue 1). Let's say P4 drinks juice.
   - Hot-chocolate, iced-tea, and sprite are already assigned, so the remaining beverage (iced-tea) must be for P1.
   - The remaining beverage (hot-chocolate) must be for P2.
   - The remaining beverage (almond-milk) must be for P5.

3. Now let's assign the foods:
   - Carrot is drunk by P6 (from clue 6).
   - Grapes are eaten by the British (from clue 12). So, P2 eats grapes.
   - Pear is eaten by P4 (from clue 1).
   - The person eating pear is on the right of the owner of the pony (from clue 4). So, the pony owner is P5.
   - The remaining foods (onion, pumpkin) must be for P1 and P3 respectively (from clue 17).

4. Let's assign the movie-genres:
   - Disaster movies are watched by P3 (from clues 2, 7, 11, and 15).
   - Family movies are on the left or right of P4 eating pear (from clue 19). So, P1 watches family movies.
   - Western movies are watched by P5 (from clue 2).
   - Romance and zombie movies are left for P2 and P4 respectively.

5. Now let's assign the nationalities:
   - British is P2 (from clue 12).
   - Indian is on the left or right of the British (from clue 3). So, Indian is P1.
   - Malaysian is on the right of P4 eating pear (from clue 9). So, Malaysian is P5.
   - Egyptian, Mexican, and the remaining nationality (let's call it N) are left for P3, P4, and P1 respectively.

6. Let's assign the pets:
   - Pony is owned by P5 (from above).
   - Fish is on the left of the lizard (from clue 5). So, the lizard owner is P2.
   - The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk (from clue 16). So, P6 drinks almond-milk.
   - The remaining pets (bird, hedgehog) must be for P3 and P4 respectively (from clue 10).

7. Finally, let's assign the transport:
   - The person driving the skateboard is between the person driving the scooter and the person watching zombie movies (from clue 8). So, P4 drives the scooter, P5 drives the skateboard, and P3 watches zombie movies.
   - The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person drinking sprite (from clue 13). So, P4 drives the trike.
   - The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin (from clue 17). So, P1 drives the roller.
   - The remaining transport (roller, scooter, skateboard, trike) must be for P2, P5, P3, and P4 respectively (from clue 8).

The final solution table is:

Lv3-6x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the names of the people in the first column. Let's call them A, B, C, D, and E from left to right.

2. From point 14, we know that the doctor (D) is in the middle, so D goes in the third position.

3. From point 19, we know that the Indonesian (I) is on the left or right of the doctor. Since D is in the middle, I can only be on the left or right of A or E. Let's assume I is on the left of A (I=A). This means D is in the middle and A is the Indonesian.

4. From point 17, we know that the British (B) is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since A is the Indonesian and we don't know who is drinking milk yet, B can only be on the left of C, D, or E. Let's assume B is on the left of C (B=C). This means C is the British.

5. From point 18, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since we don't know who is driving the jet-ski yet, the person drinking fanta can only be D, E, or any of the people on the right of them. Let's assume D is drinking fanta (D=Fanta). This means D is the American.

6. From point 10, we know that the person eating lemon (L) is the person drinking milk. Since we know A is the Indonesian and C is the British, L can only be E or any of the people on the right of them. Let's assume E is eating lemon and drinking milk (E=Lemon). This means E is the person drinking milk.

7. From point 16, we know that the person eating cucumber (Cuc) is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we don't know who is driving the quad-bike yet, Cuc can only be D, E, or any of the people on the right of them. Let's assume D is driving the quad-bike (D=Quad-bike). This means D is the accountant.

8. From point 13, we know that the accountant is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. Since D is the accountant, the dog can only be A, C, or E. Let's assume A is the owner of the dog (A=Dog). This means A is the Italian.

9. From point 15, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the ferret. Since we know A is the owner of the dog and D is the American, the ferret can only be C, E, or any of the people on the right of them. Let's assume C is drinking soy-milk and is the owner of the ferret (C=Ferret). This means C is the videographer.

10. From point 11, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since D is the quad-bike driver, C must be on the right of D.

11. From point 1, we know that there are 5 different beverages. We have already assigned fanta, milk, and soy-milk to people. The remaining beverages are juice, juice##3, sprite. Since juice##3 is not a valid beverage, juice must be assigned to E (E=Juice).

12. From point 12, we know that the Turkish (T) is eating pear. Since we know A is the Indonesian, C is the videographer, and E is the person drinking juice, T can only be D or any of the people on the right of them. Let's assume D is the Turkish (D=Turkish). This means D is the person driving the tram.

13. From point 18, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since D is the American and D is the tram driver, the jet-ski driver can only be E. This means E is the person driving the jet-ski (E=Jet-ski).

14. From point 6, we know that E is eating lemon and drinking milk. Since we know A is the Indonesian, C is the videographer, D is the Turkish, and E is the jet-ski driver, the only remaining food for E is pear. However, since we know D is the Turkish, this would mean D is eating pear twice, which is not possible. This means our initial assumption that D is the Turkish is incorrect. Let's assume D is eating pear (D=Pear) and E is eating lemon and drinking milk (E=Lemon). This means E is the person driving the snowmobile (E=Snowmobile).

15. From point 9, we know that C is drinking soy-milk and is the owner of the ferret. Since we know D is the Turkish and E is the person driving the snowmobile, the only remaining job for C is accountant. This means C is the accountant (C=Accountant).

16. From point 8, we know that A is the owner of the dog. Since we know C is the accountant and E is the person driving the snowmobile, the only remaining nationality for A is Italian. This means A is the Italian (A=Italian).

17. From point 1, we know that there are 5 different foods. We have already assigned cherry, cucumber, lemon, and pear. The remaining food is peach. Since we know A is the Indonesian, C is the accountant, and E is the person driving the snowmobile, the only remaining food for A is peach. This means A is eating peach (A=Peach).

18. From point 5, we know that the owner of the ferret is the person drinking soy-milk. Since we know C is the accountant and A is eating peach, the only remaining beverage for C is soy-milk. This means C is drinking soy-milk (C=Soy-milk).

19. From point 15, we know that C is drinking soy-milk and is the owner of the ferret. Since we know A is the Indonesian and E is the person driving the snowmobile, the only remaining pet for C is the chinchilla. This means C is the owner of the chinchilla (C=Chinchilla).

20. From point 4, we know that the owner of the turtle is the person eating peach. Since we know A is eating peach, A is the owner of the turtle (A=Turtle).

Lv3-6x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the horse. Let's place the Drawing in the first hobby column and Horse in the fifth pet column. Since the person watching epic movies is on the left of the owner of the horse, we can place Epic in the second movie-genre column.

   |               |      1       |        2        |     3      |      4      |      5       |

2. The person watching adventure movies is the one eating kale. Let's place Adventure in the third movie-genre column and Kale in the second food column.

   |               |      1       |        2        |     3      |      4      |      5       |

3. The chef is the person driving the tram. Let's place Chef in the fourth job column and Tram in the fifth transport column. Since the chef is on the right of the person driving the tram, we can place the Chef in the fourth job column.

   |               |      1       |        2        |     3      |      4      |      5       |

4. The person eating radish is on the far right. Since we already have the Chef in the fourth job column, we can place Radish in the fifth food column.

   |               |      1       |        2        |     3      |      4      |      5       |

5. The person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the Chef is driving the tram, we can't place Pineapple next to Tram. So, let's place Pineapple in the first food column.

   |               |      1       |        2        |     3      |      4      |      5       |

Lv3-6x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the dressmaker is on the far left or far right, they can't be in the middle (position 4). So, they must be in either position 1, 2, 3, or 5.

2. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person driving the bike. Since the person eating onion is the one driving the bike (point 5), the dressmaker can't be in position 5. So, the dressmaker is either in position 1, 2, or 3.

3. The person driving the bike is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in position 1, 2, or 3, the person driving the bike can't be in position 1. So, the person driving the bike is either in position 2 or 3.

4. The person driving the helicopter is the fan of salsa. Since we know the person driving the bike, we can place the helicopter driver in the remaining positions (4 or 5). Let's place them in position 5 for now.

5. The person eating onion is the person driving the bike, so we know their position (either 2 or 3). Let's place them in position 3 for now.

6. The person eating radish is the person eating radish (point 6), so they must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since we have already placed the dressmaker, bike driver, and helicopter driver, the radish eater can't be in position 5. So, the radish eater is either in position 1, 2, or 4.

7. The owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating lime. Since the lime eater must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (as the radish eater and bike driver are already placed), the horse owner can't be in position 4. So, the horse owner is either in position 2 or 3.

8. The person eating onion is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies. Since the onion eater is in position 3, the crime watcher can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the crime watcher is either in position 2, 4, or 6.

9. The fan of rock is on the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is between the dressmaker and the radish eater (point 19), the software-developer can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the software-developer is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

10. The person driving the trike is the person watching musical movies (point 10). Since the software-developer is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6, the trike driver can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the trike driver is either in position 2 or 4.

11. The software-developer is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (point 11). Since the software-developer is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6, the disaster movie watcher can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the disaster movie watcher is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

12. The entrepreneur is on the left of the fan of soul (point 12). Since the software-developer is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6, the entrepreneur can't be in position 6. So, the entrepreneur is either in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

13. The person driving the quad-bike is the owner of the rabbit (point 13). Since the entrepreneur is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4, the quad-bike driver can't be in position 1. So, the quad-bike driver is either in position 2, 3, or 4.

14. The owner of the frog is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (point 14). Since the disaster movie watcher is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6, the frog owner can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the frog owner is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6.

15. The project-manager is in the middle (point 15).

16. The owner of the horse is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (point 16). Since the horse owner is either in position 2 or 3, the snowmobile driver can't be in position 1. So, the snowmobile driver is either in position 4 or 5.

17. The fan of classical is between the person driving the snowmobile and the fan of rock (point 17). Since the snowmobile driver is either in position 4 or 5, the fan of classical can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the fan of classical is either in position 2 or 6.

18. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies (point 18). Since the goat owner can't be in position 1 or 5 (as the horse owner and snowmobile driver are already placed), the goat owner can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the fan of classical is in position 2 or 6, the goat owner can't be in position 2. So, the goat owner is either in position 3, 4, or 6.

19. The software-developer is between the dressmaker and the person eating radish (point 19). Since the software-developer is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6, the radish eater can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the radish eater is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the software-developer is already placed, the radish eater must be in a different position than the software-developer. So, the radish eater is either in position 1 or 5.

20. The person eating pear is on the left or right of the dancer (point 20). Since the dancer can't be in position 1 or 5 (as the radish eater and goat owner are already placed), the dancer can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But since the software-developer is in position 3, the dancer can't be in position 3. So, the dancer is either in position 2, 4, or 6.

Now, let's place the remaining people and pets:
- The dancer can't be in position 6 (as the pear eater is not the dancer), so the dancer is in position 2.
- The pear eater can't be in position 3 (as the software-developer is already there), so the pear eater is in position 1.

Now, let's place the remaining people and pets:
- The quad-bike driver can't be in position 1 (as the pear eater is already there), so the quad-bike driver is in position 5.
