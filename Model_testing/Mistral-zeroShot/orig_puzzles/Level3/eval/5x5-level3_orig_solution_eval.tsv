3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of rock and on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since we placed raspberry (video-games) in position 5, almond-milk can't be in position 4 (left of video-games). So, almond-milk can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

3. The person watching time-travel movies is the person doing woodworking. Since the hiker is on the far right, the woodworker cannot be on the far right, so the woodworker must be on the far left.

|               |     1     |      2      |         3          |    4    |      5       |

4. The person watching drama movies is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the hiker is on the far right, the martial-arts person cannot be on the far left, so the martial-arts person must be on the far right. The guinea-pig owner cannot be on the far right because the pilot is there, so the guinea-pig owner must be on the far left.

|               |     1     |      2      |         3          |    4    |      5       |

14. The manager is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since the rock-climber is on the far right, the manager cannot be on the far right, so the manager must be on the far left.

|               |     1     |      2      |         3          |    4    |      5       |

15. The person eating orange is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the manager is on the far left, the mystery watcher cannot be on the far left, so the mystery watcher must be on the far right.

16. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the mystery watcher is on the far right, the turtle owner cannot be on the far right, so the turtle owner must be on the far left. This means the goat owner must be on the far right.

|               |     1     |      2      |         3          |    4    |      5       |

17. The person eating radish is on the far right. Since the goat owner is on the far right, the radish eater cannot be on the far right, so the radish eater must be on the far left.

Now we have filled all the cells, so the final solution table is:

Lv3-5x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the social worker is in the middle, so we can place them at position 3. Since the social worker is between the journalist and the person driving the ship, the journalist must be on the left (1) and the person driving the ship on the right (5).

2. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, so filmmaking must be in position 2.

3. Now we have the following arrangement:
   |    1     |    2     |       3       |       4       |     5      |

   | Pet     |         |               |               |            |

   | Transport|         |               |               |            |

   The social worker is a social worker, so their job is in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is the owner of the frog, so baking must be in position 4.

5. The owner of the frog is not the social worker (since the social worker is a social worker), so the journalist or the person driving the ship cannot be the owner of the frog. The only remaining option is the chef, so the chef is the owner of the frog in position 1.

6. The owner of the frog is the person who's hobby is baking, so baking is on the left of the chef.

7. The owner of the mouse is the person who's sport is volleyball, so volleyball must be in position 5.

8. The owner of the mouse is not the social worker, the chef, or the person driving the ship (since they are all occupied), so the only remaining options are the accountant, engineer, and journalist. The accountant and journalist cannot be the owner of the mouse because they are already occupied, so the engineer is the owner of the mouse in position 4.

9. The engineer is the owner of the bird, so the bird is in position 1.

10. The person who's sport is tennis is the owner of the snake, so tennis must be in position 2.

11. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since tennis is in position 2, cycling can be either 1 or 3. However, since the engineer (who is the owner of the bird and the mouse) is in position 4, cycling cannot be in position 3. So, cycling is in position 1.

12. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in position 6 (left of the person driving the roller), drawing must be in position 7.

13. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the chef. Since filmmaking is in position 2, the chef must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the chef is the owner of the frog (position 1), the chef must be in position 3. So, filmmaking is on the right of the chef in position 5.

14. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the jet-ski (position 5), the skateboard is in position 4.

15. The person driving the jet-ski is the owner of the guinea-pig, so the guinea-pig is in position 5.

16. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is not yet determined, let's place rock-climbing in position 6 for now.

17. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling is in position 1, swimming can be either 2 or 4. However, since the engineer (who is the owner of the bird and the mouse) is in position 4, swimming cannot be in position 4. So, swimming is in position 2.

18. The person who's hobby is writing is the only remaining hobby, so it must be in position 7.

19. The person who's sport is handball is the only remaining sport, so it must be in position 8.

20. The person who's job is accountant is the only remaining job, so it must be in position 9.

Now we have the final solution table:

We still need to fill in the jobs, sports, and pets for positions 2, 6, and 9. Since we don't have enough information to determine these exactly, we can only provide possible solutions:

For position 2 (hobby: drawing):

1. We can start by placing the people and their preferences in the table. Since there are 5 of each, we can fill in one column with any of the options. Let's start with the Food column:

   |               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
   | Food          | banana   | cauliflower | peas       | potato    | strawberry |

2. Now let's place the jobs. Since the dressmaker is to the left of the person watching epic movies, the only possible position for the dressmaker is 1 or 2. Let's place the dressmaker in position 1:

   |               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

   | Job           | dressmaker|              |            |           |            |

3. The musician is the person eating potato, so the musician must be in position 3. Since the software-developer is on the left of the dressmaker, the software-developer must be in position 2:

   |               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |
   | Food          | banana   | cauliflower | potatoes   | potato    | strawberry |
   | Job           | dressmaker| software-dev | musician   |           |            |

4. The writer is on the left of the person eating strawberry, so the writer must be in position 1:

   |               |    1     |         2          |      3      |     4      |     5      |

   | Job           | writer   | software-dev | musician   |           | writer     |

Lv3-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the chef drinks soy-milk (2), so we can place the chef in the first or fifth column. Let's assume the chef is in the first column (Column 1).

2. Since the chef is in Column 1, the soy-milk is placed. Now, we know that the almond-milk is not in Column 1 (because of rule 15), so it must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the dressmaker (4), and the chef is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (14). Since the chef is in Column 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the person driving the snowmobile is in Column 2. This means the dressmaker is in Column 3, 4, or 5. The sprite cannot be in Column 1 (because of rule 4), so it must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the sprite is in Column 3.

4. Now, the person drinking 7up must be in Column 1, 2, 4, or 5 (because it's not the chef or the sprite). The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person doing surfing (7), and the person doing surfing is on the left of the person drinking 7up (7 reversed). This means the surfing must be in Column 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the surfing is in Column 3. This means the person drinking 7up is in Column 4 or 5.

5. The person doing tennis is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up (4), and between the person drinking 7up and the person doing rowing (11). Since the person drinking 7up is in Column 4 or 5, the person doing tennis must be in Column 3. This means the person doing rowing is in Column 2.

6. The person doing biathlon is on the far right (3), so it must be in Column 5.

7. The person doing rock is between the person doing funk and the chef (10, 16), so it must be in Column 2 or 4. Since the person doing surfing is in Column 3, the person doing rock must be in Column 2. This means the person doing funk is in Column 4.

8. The person doing punk is on the left of the person doing soul (9), and the person doing soul is between the person doing punk and the person doing rock (8). This means the person doing punk is in Column 1, and the person doing soul is in Column 3.

9. The person doing r&b is not the chef (2), so it must be in Column 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the person doing funk is in Column 4, the person doing r&b must be in Column 2, 3, or 5. Since the person doing punk is in Column 1, the person doing r&b cannot be in Column 1. Let's assume the person doing r&b is in Column 5.

10. The person doing soul is between the person doing punk and the person doing rock (8), so it must be in Column 2 or 4. Since the person doing r&b is in Column 5, the person doing soul must be in Column 4.

11. The person doing water is not the chef (2), not the person drinking soy-milk (2), not the person drinking sprite (3), not the person drinking 7up (4), not the person doing surfing (3), not the person doing tennis (3), not the person doing biathlon (5), not the person doing rock (2), not the person doing funk (4), not the person doing punk (1), and not the person doing r&b (5). This means the person doing water must be in Column 2.

12. The person driving the bus is not the chef (2), not the person drinking soy-milk (2), not the person drinking sprite (3), not the person drinking 7up (4), not the person doing surfing (3), not the person doing tennis (3), not the person doing biathlon (5), not the person doing rock (2), not the person doing funk (4), not the person doing punk (1), not the person doing r&b (5), and not the person doing water (2). This means the person driving the bus must be in Column 4.

13. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the videographer (12), so it must be in Column 1, 2, or 3. Since the person driving the bus is in Column 4, the person driving the jet-ski must be in Column 1 or 2. Let's assume the person driving the jet-ski is in Column 1.

14. The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the project-manager (1), and the person driving the snowmobile is in Column 2. This means the person driving the skateboard must be in Column 3 or 4. Since the person driving the jet-ski is in Column 1, the person driving the skateboard must be in Column 4. This means the project-manager is in Column 2.

15. The person driving the train is in the middle (5), so it must be in Column 3.

16. The person doing soul is between the person doing punk and the person doing rock (8), so it must be in Column 2 or 4. Since the person doing soul is already placed in Column 4, the person doing punk must be in Column 1, and the person doing rock must be in Column 3.

17. The person doing r&b is not the chef (2), not the person drinking soy-milk (2), not the person drinking sprite (3), not the person drinking 7up (4), not the person doing surfing (3), not the person doing tennis (3), not the person doing biathlon (5), not the person doing rock (3), not the person doing funk (4), not the person doing punk (1), and the person doing soul is in Column 4. This means the person doing r&b must be in Column 5.

18. The person doing funk is between the person doing rock and the chef (10, 16), so it must be in Column 2 or 4. Since the person doing r&b is in Column 5, the person doing funk must be in Column 2.

19. The person drinking almond-milk is not the chef (2), not the person drinking soy-milk (2), not the person drinking sprite (3), not the person drinking 7up (4), not the person doing surfing (3), not the person doing tennis (3), not the person doing biathlon (5), not the person doing rock (2), not the person doing funk (2), not the person doing punk (1), and not the person doing r&b (5). This means the person drinking almond-milk must be in Column 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv3-5x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person eating peas, and the person drinking coffee is on the far left, the person eating peas cannot be on the far left. So, the person drinking 7up and the person eating peas must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating avocado, so the person eating avocado must be in position 3 (since position 1 is occupied by coffee).

3. The person eating avocado (woodworking) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since position 1 is occupied by coffee (which is not card-games), the person who's hobby is card-games must be in position 2 or 4.

4. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the person eating avocado (woodworking) is on the left of the fan of metal (from point 13), the person who's hobby is card-games must be in position 4.

5. The person eating banana is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Since the person who's hobby is card-games (in position 4) is on the left of the fan of metal, the person eating banana must be in position 2.

6. The person who's sport is soccer is the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes (soccer) is on the left of the fan of metal (from point 18), the person eating grapes must be in position 1.

7. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the person eating banana (puzzles) is in position 2, the fan of metal must be in position 5.

8. The fan of house is in the middle. Since the person eating banana (puzzles) is in position 2, the person eating grapes (soccer) is in position 1, and the person eating avocado (woodworking) is in position 3, the person eating cherry (house) must be in position 4.

9. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the person eating banana (puzzles) is in position 2, the person eating cherry (house) is in position 4, and the person eating avocado (woodworking) is in position 3, the person eating peas (swimming) must be in position 5.

10. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is the person who's hobby is woodworking (from point 16), the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1.

11. The person who's sport is skiing is the person drinking water. Since the person eating banana (puzzles) is in position 2, the person eating grapes (soccer) is in position 1, the person eating avocado (woodworking) is in position 3, the person eating peas (swimming) is in position 5, and the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1, the person who's sport is skiing (water) must be in position 4.

12. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is writing is in position 1, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 2. Since the person eating banana (puzzles) is in position 2, the person eating cherry (house) is in position 4, the person eating avocado (woodworking) is in position 3, the person eating peas (swimming) is in position 5, and the person who's sport is skiing (water) is in position 4, the person playing water-polo must be in position 3.
