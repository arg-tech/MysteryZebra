Lv3-6x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 6 variables (Beverage, Food, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport) with 2 options each, except for Pet and Sport which have 3 options. So, we need to place 6 variables in 4 positions.

2. From the first condition, we know that the two beverages (iced-tea and soy-milk) will be in positions 1 and 2. Let's place iced-tea in position 1 and soy-milk in position 2.

3. From the second condition, we know that the two foods (kiwi and strawberry) will be in positions 1 and 3 or 2 and 4. Since the person eating strawberry is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk (condition 3), the only possible arrangement for foods is kiwi in position 1 and strawberry in position 3.

4. From the third condition, we know that the analyst is not in position 1 (since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1) and is not in position 4 (since the turkish is on the right of the analyst, and the turkish cannot be in position 1 or 2). So, the analyst can only be in position 2 or 3. However, if the analyst was in position 2, the person eating strawberry would be on the right of the analyst, which contradicts condition 3. Therefore, the analyst must be in position 3.

5. From the fourth condition, we know that the turkish cannot be in position 1 or 2 (since the analyst is in position 3). So, the turkish can only be in position 4.

6. From the fifth condition, we know that the goldfish owner is in position 4 (since the person with the goldfish is on the far right).

7. From the sixth condition, we know that the person playing rowing is either in position 1 or 3. However, if the person playing rowing was in position 1, the person eating kiwi would be on the left of the person playing rowing, which contradicts the given information that the person playing rowing is to the left or right of the person eating kiwi (condition 2). Therefore, the person playing rowing must be in position 3.

8. Now we know the positions of 5 variables (Beverage, Food, Job, Nationality, Sport). The remaining variable is the Pet. Since the goldfish is in position 4, the only possible pet for position 1 is the frog, and for position 2, it can be either frog or goldfish. However, since the person with the goldfish is on the far right (condition 1), the pet in position 2 must be the frog.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv3-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different items for each category, so we can fill in the table with 6 unique items. Let's assign them temporary names A, B, C, D, E, F for now.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A         | B          |
| Food          | C         | D          |
| Music-Genre   | E         | F          |
| Nationality   | G         | H          |
| Pet           | I         | J          |
| Transport     | K         | L          |

2. From point 1, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right, so J must be in the rightmost column.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A         | B          |
| Food          | C         | D          |
| Music-Genre   | E         | F          |
| Nationality   | G         | H          |
| Pet           | I (Guinea-pig) | J |
| Transport     | K         | L          |

3. The german is on the left of the fan of pop. Since there are only 2 different nationalities, G must be on the left, and H must be on the right.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A         | B          |
| Food          | C         | D          |
| Music-Genre   | E         | F (Pop)    |
| Nationality   | G (German) | H          |
| Pet           | I (Guinea-pig) | J |
| Transport     | K         | L          |

4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop. Since we already placed the pop fan, we know the cola drinker cannot be in the same column as the pop fan. So, A cannot be in the same column as F.

5. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango. Since we know the nationality of the people and the pet owner, we can only consider the remaining items (Beverage, Food, and Transport) for this condition. If we place the taxi driver in the rightmost column, the only possible combination for the left column is (B, D, L), but this violates the condition that the cola drinker cannot be in the same column as the pop fan. So, the taxi driver cannot be in the rightmost column.

6. Now, let's place the taxi driver in the second column. The only possible combination for the left column is (A, C, K). This satisfies all the conditions, including the one that the cola drinker is not in the same column as the pop fan.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola     | Iced-tea  |
| Food          | Cabbage  | Mango     |
| Music-Genre   | Hip-hop  | Pop       |
| Nationality   | Dutch    | German    |
| Pet           | Goldfish | Guinea-pig|
| Transport     | Motorbike| Taxi      |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different hobbies, we can place them in the first two columns of the Hobby row. Let's say Singing in column 1 and Woodworking in column 2.

2. Since the person who sings is on the right of the person who does woodwork, we can't swap them. So, the Hobby row becomes:

   | Hobby | Singing | Woodworking |
   |-------|---------|-------------|

3. Similarly, since there are 2 different movie-genres, we can place them in the first two columns of the Movie-Genre row. Let's say Documentary in column 1 and Satire in column 2.

   | Movie-Genre | Documentary | Satire |
   |------------|-------------|--------|

4. Since the person watching Documentary movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing, we can't place Documentary in the same column as Skiing. So, let's place Skiing in the second column of the Sport row.

   | Sport | Climbing | Skiing |
   |-------|---------|--------|

5. Since the fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing, we can't place Reggae in the second column of the Music-Genre row. So, let's place Reggae in the first column and Indie in the second column of the Music-Genre row.

   | Music-Genre | Reggae | Indie |
   |------------|--------|-------|

6. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the chinese, we can't place the Chinese in the second column of the Nationality row. So, let's place the Chinese in the first column and the other nationality (Indonesian) in the second column of the Nationality row.

   | Nationality | Chinese | Indonesian |
   |------------|---------|------------|

7. Now, we have placed all the unique items in their respective rows and columns according to the given conditions. However, we don't have any information about the Beverage column. Since there are 2 different beverages, we can place them in the first two columns of the Beverage row. Let's say Coffee in column 1 and Lemonade in column 2.

   | Beverage | Coffee | Lemonade |
   |----------|--------|----------|

So, the final solution table is:

   ```
   | Beverage      | Coffee | Lemonade |
   | Hobby         | Singing | Woodworking |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Satire |
   | Music-Genre   | Reggae | Indie |
   | Nationality   | Chinese | Indonesian |
   | Sport         | Climbing | Skiing |
   ```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two different hobbies, puzzles and sudoku, we can place them in the first and second rows of the Hobby column. Let's say Puzzles in row 1 and Sudoku in row 2.

2. Similarly, since there are only two different jobs, lawyer and police-officer, we can place them in the first and second rows of the Job column. Let's say Lawyer in row 1 and Police-Officer in row 2.

3. Now, the person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since Sudoku is in row 2, the person watching scientific movies must be in row 3 or 4. Let's say Scientific movies are in row 3.

4. The fan of salsa is the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since Puzzles are in row 1, the person who likes salsa music must be in row 2, 4, 5, or 6. Let's say Salsa music is in row 4.

5. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right. Since the rabbit can't be in the first or last row (because of the hobby and job placements), it must be in row 2, 3, 5, or 6. Let's say the rabbit is in row 2.

6. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. So, the dog can't be in row 2. Let's say the dog is in row 3.

7. The person driving the tram is on the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in row 1, the tram can't be in row 1. Let's say the tram is in row 2.

8. The person watching martial-arts movies is in the remaining row (row 6).

9. The person who likes soul music is in the remaining row (row 5).

10. The remaining pet (pet in row 5) can be either a dog or a rabbit, but since the rabbit is already placed, it must be a dog.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1       |       2        |
| Hobby         | Puzzles     |   Sudoku       |

Lv3-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, two types of food, two hobbies, two movie-genres, two sports, and two types of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the person drinking water is on the right of the person watching western movies. So, we can write Water > Western.

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. So, Photography < Motorbike.

4. From rule 3, the person driving the scooter is the person who's sport is lacrosse. So, Scooter = Lacrosse.

5. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since we know that Water > Sprite (from rule 1), and we already placed the person drinking water, we can't place the person drinking sprite yet. So, for now, we can only say Reading is in the same row as Sprite.

6. From rule 5, the person watching western movies is the person eating avocado. So, Western = Avocado.

7. Now, we have two remaining items (Sprite and Peas) for Food, and Reading for Hobby. Since Reading is in the same row as Sprite, and we know that Reading is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite, we can place Reading in the first column, and Sprite in the second column. This leaves Peas for the first column.

8. For the remaining items (Badminton and Motorbike), we know that Photography < Motorbike. Since we already placed Photography, we can place Motorbike in the row where Photography is. Since Badmike is the only sport left, we can place it in the row where Scooter is (which we know is Lacrosse).

9. Finally, for the Transport, since Scooter = Lacrosse, the only remaining item is Motorbike. So, Motorbike can be placed in the last row.

Here is the final solution table:

```

4. The person eating apple is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since we know the first row is apple and we have filled in the job, we can deduce that the person driving the roller must be in the second row (software-developer). So, the first row must be the roller.

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |  Apple    |  Asparagus |
| Job           |  Roller  |  Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Transport     |  Software-developer |           |

5. The fan of funk is on the far left or far right. Since the first row is already filled, the fan of funk must be in the second row (Mechanic). So, the first row music-genre must be indie.

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |  Apple    |  Asparagus |
| Job           |  Roller  |  Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   |  Superhero | Scientific |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie    |  Funk     |
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Transport     |  Software-developer |           |

6. The software-developer is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since we know the positions of both, they must be in the same row, which means they are in the same nationality. Let's assume they are American.

|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          |  Apple    |  Asparagus |
| Job           |  Roller  |  Mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   |  Superhero | Scientific |
| Music-Genre   |  Indie    |  Funk     |
| Nationality   |  American |  American |
| Transport     |  Software-developer |           |

7. The American is on the right of the mechanic. Since we know their positions, this condition is already satisfied.

8. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the fan of indie. Since we know the positions of both, this condition is also satisfied.

9. The only remaining condition is the transport of the American. Since we know the American is the software-developer, and we know the software-developer is on the roller, the American must be on the roller.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the cat owner is on the far left, so let's place the cat owner in the first column and the cat in the Pet row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |

| Pet           | Cat         |            |

2. Since there are 2 different favourite beverages, and the soy-milk drinker is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games, the cola drinker must be on the left. Let's place cola in the first Beverage row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola       |            |

| Pet           | Cat         |            |

3. The fan of hip-hop is the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is on the left or right of the soy-milk drinker, and the soy-milk drinker is on the right, the snowmobile driver must be on the left. Let's place snowmobile in the Transport row and hip-hop in the Music-Genre row on the left.

|               |      1      |     2      |

| Transport     | Snowmobile  |            |

4. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk, so the soy-milk drinker must be in the second column. Let's place soy-milk in the second Beverage row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola       | Soy-milk   |

| Transport     | Snowmobile  |            |

5. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since the snowmobile driver (who is also the hip-hop fan) is on the left, the chinchilla owner cannot be on the left. So, the chinchilla owner must be in the second column, and the kiwi eater must be in the first column. Let's place kiwi in the first Food row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola       | Soy-milk   |

| Pet           | Cat         | Chinchilla  |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |            |

6. The remaining food is raspberry. Since we already have kiwi, let's place raspberry in the second Food row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola       | Soy-milk   |

| Pet           | Cat         | Chinchilla  |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |            |

7. The remaining hobby is collecting. Let's place collecting in the Hobby row.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola       | Soy-milk   |

Lv3-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, two jobs, two movie genres, two music genres, two nationalities, and two pets. Let's assign them as follows:

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Project-Manager |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action    | Comedy         |
   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep   | Trance         |
   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Bird      | Guinea-Pig     |

2. From point 1, we know that the fan of trance is watching action movies. So, the first row (Beverage) must be associated with the second column (Movie-Genre) as follows:

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Project-Manager |
   | Movie-Genre   | Action    | Comedy         |

   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Bird      | Guinea-Pig     |

   Now, the person drinking Fanta is watching Action movies.

3. The dressmaker is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the first row (Beverage) is associated with the second column (Movie-Genre), the dressmaker cannot be in the first row. So, the dressmaker must be in the second row (Job).

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Project-Manager |

   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Bird      | Guinea-Pig     |

   Now, the dressmaker is the Project-Manager.

4. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the dressmaker. So, the second column (Movie-Genre) must be associated with the third column (Job).

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Project-Manager |

   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Bird      | Guinea-Pig     |

   Now, the person watching Comedy movies is the Dressmaker.

5. The Spanish is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since the fourth column (Nationality) is already assigned, we need to swap the Spanish and the owner of the bird.

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |

   | Nationality   | Spanish   | Polish         |
   | Pet           | Guinea-Pig| Bird           |

   Now, the Spanish is the owner of the Guinea-Pig.

6. The owner of the fanta is watching action movies, and the owner of the guinea-pig is the Spanish. So, the Spanish cannot be in the first row (Beverage). The Spanish must be in the second row (Job).

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |
   | Job           | Dressmaker | Spanish        |

   | Music-Genre   | Dubstep   | Trance         |
   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Guinea-Pig| Bird           |

   Now, the Spanish is the Dressmaker.

7. The Polish is the Project-Manager.

8. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the dressmaker. So, the second column (Movie-Genre) must be associated with the third column (Job).

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |

   | Nationality   | Polish    | Spanish        |
   | Pet           | Guinea-Pig| Bird           |

   Now, the person watching Comedy movies is the Polish.

9. The owner of the fanta is watching action movies, and the owner of the guinea-pig is the Spanish. So, the first row (Beverage) must be associated with the first column (Job).

   |               |     1      |        2        |
   | Beverage      | Fanta     | Sprite         |

   Now, the person drinking Fanta is the Polish.

10. The person drinking sprite is the Spanish.

Lv3-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, jobs, beverages, movie-genres, nationalities, and means of transport. Let's assign them as follows:
   - Hobbies: Hiking (H) and Skydiving (S)
   - Jobs: Pilot (P) and Software-Developer (D)
   - Beverages: Hot-Chocolate (HC) and Iced-Tea (IT)
   - Movie-Genres: Family (F) and Western (W)
   - Nationalities: American (A) and Indian (I)
   - Transport: Boat (B) and Subway (Sb)

2. From point 1, we can place the hobbies, jobs, beverages, movie-genres, nationalities, and means of transport in the table as follows:

   |               |       1       |         2          |
   | Beverage      | HC/IT         |                    |
   | Hobby         | H/S           |                    |
   | Job           | P/D           |                    |
   | Movie-Genre   | F/W           |                    |
   | Nationality   | A/I           |                    |
   | Transport     | B/Sb          |                    |

3. From point 2, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person driving the boat. This means that H must be in the first column and B must be in the second row. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

   |               |       1       |         2          |
   | Beverage      | HC/IT         | IT                |
   | Hobby         | H             | S                 |

   | Transport     | B             | Sb                |

4. From point 2, we know that the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since H is in the first column, W can only be in the first or second column. However, from point 3, we know that W cannot be in the first column because it would violate point 2 (the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking). So, W must be in the second column.

   |               |       1       |         2          |
   | Beverage      | HC/IT         | IT                |

   | Transport     | B             | Sb                |

5. From point 2, we know that the American is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since HC is in the first row, A cannot be in the first column. So, A must be in the second column.

   |               |       1       |         2          |
   | Beverage      | HC           | IT                |

   | Movie-Genre   | F             | W                 |
   | Nationality   | I             | A                 |
   | Transport     | B             | Sb                |

6. From point 3, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the software-developer. Since D is in the second row, HC must be in the first row.

   |               |       1       |         2          |
   | Beverage      | HC           | IT                |

   | Transport     | B             | Sb                |

7. Now, we have filled all the cells except the cell for the beverage of person 2. Since there are only two beverages, the beverage of person 2 must be IT.
