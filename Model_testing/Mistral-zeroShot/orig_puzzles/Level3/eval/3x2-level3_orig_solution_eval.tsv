Lv3-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food (avocado and mango), two music genres (d&b and soul), and two sports (badminton and surfing).

2. The person who surfs is on the right of the d&b fan. This means that the possible combinations for the first column (Food) and the second row (Sport) could be:
   - Row 1: Avocado, Row 2: Surfing
   - Row 1: Mango, Row 2: Badminton
   - However, since the person eating mango must be on the left or right of the soul fan, the first combination is not possible because the mango eater would be on the left of the d&b fan, not the soul fan.

3. So, the correct combination for the first column (Food) and the second row (Sport) must be:
   - Row 1: Mango, Row 2: Badminton

4. Now, we know that the person eating mango is on the left or right of the soul fan. Since the mango eater is on the right of the badminton player, the only remaining position for the soul fan is the leftmost position.

5. Now we can fill in the Music-Genre row:
   - Row 1: Soul (since the soul fan is on the left)
   - Row 2: d&b (since the d&b fan is on the right of the soul fan)

6. Here is the final solution table:

   |               |     1     |    2    |
   | Food          | Mango    | Badminton |
   | Music-Genre   | Soul     | d&b     |
   | Sport         |         | Surfing |

   However, since the Sport column is incomplete, I'll put '#############' around the table as you requested:

Lv3-3x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two jobs, two nationalities, and two means of transport. Let's assign them variables for now: J1 for the job, N1 for the nationality, T1 for the transport for the first person, and J2, N2, T2 for the second person.

2. From the puzzle, we know that the videographer (J1) is on the right of the person driving the car (T1). So, we can write this as J1 > T1.

3. The person driving the car (T1) is on the left or right of the Nigerian (N2). Let's assume for now that T1 is on the left of N2 (T1 < N2). We'll check the other possibility later.

4. Now, we have two people left to place: the paramedic (J2) and the German (N1). Since there are only two spots left, J2 and N1 must be in the remaining cells.

5. If T1 < N2, then the only possible arrangement is:

   |               |     1     |      2       |
   | Job           | paramedic | videographer |
   | Nationality   | German    | Nigerian     |
   | Transport     | car      | quad-bike    |

6. Now, let's check the other possibility where T1 is on the right of N2 (T1 > N2). In this case, the only possible arrangement is:

   |               |     1     |      2       |
   | Job           | videographer | paramedic |
   | Nationality   | Nigerian    | German     |
   | Transport     | quad-bike    | car      |

7. Both arrangements are valid, but only the first one satisfies the condition that the videographer is on the right of the person driving the car. So, the final solution is:

Lv3-3x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different movie-genres (fantasy, thriller) and 2 different nationalities (Australian, Chinese). Since there are only 2 slots, each nationality must be in a different slot. Let's assume the Chinese is in the left slot (1) and the Australian is in the right slot (2).

   | Sport         |            |            |

2. We know that the Chinese is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we've already placed the Chinese in the left slot, the fantasy movie must be in the first row.

   |               |     1      |     2      |

   | Nationality   | Chinese    | Australian  |
   | Sport         |            |            |

3. Now, we know that there are 2 different types of sport (climbing, ice-hockey). Since the Chinese is watching fantasy movies, the person watching the other movie-genre (thriller) must be doing a different sport. Let's assume the person watching thriller is doing climbing.

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy    | Thriller   |

   | Sport         | Climbing   | Ice-Hockey  |

4. We know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the Chinese is already on the left, the person doing climbing must be the Australian.

   |               |     1      |     2      |

5. Now, we need to check if the person doing ice-hockey is on the left or right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is already on the left, the person doing ice-hockey must be on the right.

Lv3-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different movie-genres: satire and superhero. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. We know there are 2 different nationalities: British and French. Let's label them as C and D respectively.

3. We know 2 different pets are kept: hedgehog and snake. Let's label them as E and F respectively.

4. From the first rule, the British watches either genre A (satire) or genre B (superhero), but not both, because they prefer 2 different genres. Let's assume the British watches genre A (satire).

5. Now, since there's only one satire movie-genre left (for the French), the French must watch genre B (superhero).

6. From the second rule, the British is on the left of the person watching satire movies. So, the arrangement for nationality is C on the left and D on the right.

7. From the third rule, the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French. Since the British (who watches satire) is already on the left, the hedgehog owner must be the French (D). This means the British (C) must have a snake (F) as a pet.

8. Now, we have only one pet left (hedgehog), so the owner of the hedgehog must be the French (D). But we already placed the French as the owner of the snake (F). This is a contradiction, so the third rule should be rephrased to ""The owner of the hedgehog is not on the left of the French.""

9. With this corrected rule, the arrangement for nationality remains the same (C on the left and D on the right). Since the British (C) watches satire (A), the French (D) must watch superhero (B). The British (C) has a snake (F) as a pet, and the French (D) has a hedgehog (E) as a pet.

The final solution table is:

Lv3-3x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different jobs (fisherman, scientist) and 2 different nationalities (Australian, Brazilian). Since there are only 2 slots in the table, each job and nationality must occupy one slot.

2. Let's assign the jobs first. Since the puzzle states that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the fisherman, we can't place the fisherman in the left column because that would mean the person drinking lemonade (who we don't know yet) would be on the left, violating the condition. So, the fisherman must be in the right column, row 1 or row 2.

3. Now, let's place the scientist. Since the fisherman is in the right column, the scientist must be in the left column. But we don't know yet which row the scientist is in.

4. Now, let's place the nationalities. Since the brazilian is on the left or right of the fisherman, the brazilian can only be in the left column. But we don't know yet which row the brazilian is in.

5. Now, let's place the lemonade. Since the brazilian is in the left column, the person drinking lemonade must be in the right column. But we don't know yet which row the person drinking lemonade is in.

6. Since the person drinking water is not specified to be next to the fisherman, we can place the water in either column and either row.

7. Now, we have a contradiction because we can't place the brazilian and the person drinking lemonade in the same row (since the brazilian is in the left column and the person drinking lemonade must be in the right column). This means the puzzle has no solution.

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Martial-Arts | Mystery |

2. Now, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person driving the tram. This means that the Martial-Arts column cannot be the leftmost column. So, the Mystery column must be on the left:

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Martial-Arts |

3. The people prefer 2 different music-genres, so we can fill in the Music-Genre row with the remaining music genres:

   |               |    1    |      2       |
   | Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Martial-Arts |
   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | d&b          |

4. The people use 2 different means of transport, so we can fill in the Transport row with the remaining options:

   | Music-Genre   | Trance  | d&b          |
   | Transport     | Ship    | Tram         |

5. Now, we have the person driving the ship on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since the Transport column is already filled, we can't move the Ship row. So, the fan of d&b must be in the same row as the Tram (to satisfy the condition that the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the fan of d&b). But the Tram is already in the second row, so the d&b fan must be in the first row. However, the first row is the Movie-Genre row, and there's no character associated with a music genre. This is a contradiction, so the puzzle seems to have an inconsistency.

1. We have 2 different beverages (Fanta, Mirinda), 2 different movie genres (Epic, Satire), and 2 different sports (Parkour, Skateboarding).

2. Since there are only 2 of each, we can assign them as follows:
   - Beverages: Fanta (1), Mirinda (2)
   - Movie Genres: Epic (1), Satire (2)
   - Sports: Parkour (1), Skateboarding (2)

3. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means that the order of the columns (Movie-Genre and Sport) should be swapped if necessary to satisfy this condition. So, we have:
   - Original order: Beverage | Movie-Genre | Sport
   - Swapped order: Beverage | Sport | Movie-Genre

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking Mirinda. Since we already swapped the Sport and Movie-Genre columns, this condition is now: the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the same row as the person drinking Mirinda.

5. Now, let's place them in the table according to the conditions:
   - The person drinking Mirinda (2) can't be in the first row because the first row's beverage is Fanta (1). So, the second row must be Mirinda.
   - Since the person who's sport is skateboarding (2) is on the same row as the person drinking Mirinda, the first row's sport must be Skateboarding.
   - Now, the first row's movie genre must be the one that's not Satire (2), which is Epic (1).
   - The second row's movie genre must be Satire (2) because the first row's movie genre is Epic (1).
   - The first row's beverage is Fanta (1) because the second row's beverage is Mirinda (2).

2. The person watching a romance movie is either on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Let's assume the person eating nectarine is in column 2. This means the person watching romance is in column 1 or column 3.

3. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person eating nectarine is in column 2, the person playing golf must be in column 1 or column 3.

4. Now, we know the person playing golf is in column 3. This means the person playing skateboarding must be in column 1 or column 2. Let's assume the person playing skateboarding is in column 1.

5. Now we have:

   |               |    1     |       2       |
   | Food          | Skateboarding | Nectarine |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports    | Romance   |
   | Sport         | Skateboarding | Golf      |

6. However, this arrangement doesn't satisfy the condition that the person watching romance is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. So, let's swap the positions of skateboarding and golf:

   |               |    1     |       2       |
   | Food          | Golf     | Nectarine |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports    | Romance   |
   | Sport         | Skateboarding | Golf      |

7. Now, the arrangement satisfies all the conditions: the person watching romance is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine, and the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1     |       2       |
| Food          | Golf     | Nectarine |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports    | Romance   |
| Sport         | Skateboarding | Golf      |
