Lv3-4x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 4 variables: Beverage, Job, Nationality, and Transport. Each has 2 unique values.

2. We know that the social-worker is either to the left or right of the person drinking Fanta. Let's assume the social-worker is on the left (SW-L) for now. This means the person drinking Fanta must be on the right (F-R).

3. The musician is to the right of the social-worker. Since SW-L, the musician must be on the right (M-R).

4. Now, the person driving the bike is to the right of the Italian. Since we don't know the Italian's position yet, let's assume the Italian is on the left (I-L). This means the person driving the bike must be on the right (B-R).

5. However, if the Italian is on the left, there's no place left for the second nationality (Mexican) to be on the table. So, the Italian must be on the right (I-R).

6. Now, the person driving the bike is on the left (B-L), as there's no place left for the person driving the bike on the right.

7. The last position is for the second beverage (Soy-Milk). Since Fanta is on the right, Soy-Milk must be on the left.

8. The last two positions for jobs are left. Since the social-worker is on the left and the musician is on the right, the remaining job (musician or social-worker) must be on the left. Let's assume it's the social-worker (SW-L). This means the musician must be on the right (M-R).

9. But this contradicts our initial assumption that the musician is on the right. So, our initial assumption about the social-worker being on the left was incorrect. The social-worker must be on the right (SW-R).

10. Now, the musician is on the left (M-L). This means the person drinking Fanta is on the right (F-R).

11. The person driving the bike is on the left (B-L).

12. The Italian is on the right (I-R).

13. The second beverage is on the left (S-L).

14. The last two positions for jobs are left. Since the social-worker is on the right and the musician is on the left, the remaining job (musician or social-worker) must be on the left. This time, let's assume it's the musician (M-L). This is consistent with our current arrangement.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |        Soy-Milk       |     Fanta     |

Lv3-4x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, so we can fill in the first row of the table with the different types of food, music-genres, pets, and transport. Let's denote the two people as A and B.

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          |     |     |
| Music-Genre   |     |     |
| Pet           |     |     |
| Transport     |     |     |

2. From point 1.3, we know that the person driving the scooter is on the far left, so A drives the scooter. Let's fill in the Transport column:

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          |     |     |
| Music-Genre   |     |     |
| Pet           |     |     |
| Transport     | Scooter |     |

3. From point 1.1, we know that there are two different types of food. Since A is driving the scooter, the other food (let's say watermelon) must be for person B. So, we fill in the Food column:

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          | Cauliflower | Watermelon |
| Music-Genre   |     |     |
| Pet           |     |     |
| Transport     | Scooter |     |

4. From point 2.2, we know that the person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of r&b. Since we already know the food for person B, we can deduce that the r&b fan must be person A. Let's fill in the Music-Genre column:

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          | Cauliflower | Watermelon |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | Punk |
| Pet           |     |     |
| Transport     | Scooter |     |

5. From point 1.2, we know that there are two different pets. Since we have filled in the Food and Music-Genre columns, we can deduce that the cat must be person A's pet and the rabbit must be person B's pet. Let's fill in the Pet column:

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          | Cauliflower | Watermelon |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | Punk |
| Pet           | Cat | Rabbit |
| Transport     | Scooter |     |

6. From point 1.1, we know that there are two different means of transport. Since we have filled in the Food, Music-Genre, Pet, and Transport columns for person A, the remaining transport (airplane) must be for person B. Let's fill in the Transport column:

|               | A   | B   |
| Food          | Cauliflower | Watermelon |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | Punk |
| Pet           | Cat | Rabbit |
| Transport     | Scooter | Airplane |

7. Now we have filled in all the columns according to the given conditions. The final solution table is:

Lv3-4x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, and means of transport. Since there are two people, each person must have one of each.

2. Let's assign the hobbies first. Since one person is hiking and the other is into board-games, we can assign hiking to the left and board-games to the right.

3. Now let's assign the jobs. Since one person is an analyst and the other is a project-manager, we can assign analyst to the left and project-manager to the right.

4. Now let's assign the music-genres. Since one person prefers folk and the other prefers r&b, we can assign folk to the left and r&b to the right.

5. Now let's assign the means of transport. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b (who is on the right), and the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike, we can place the scooter on the left and the quad-bike on the right.

6. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst, and the analyst is on the left, the hiker must be in the first row. So, the final arrangement is:

   |               |         Hiking     |       Board-games      |
   | Hobby         |                   |                        |
   | Job           |                   |                        |
   | Music-Genre   |                   |                        |
   | Transport     |                   |                        |

7. Now we can fill in the remaining details. Since the hiker is on the left, the analyst must be in the second row. The analyst's job is 'analyst', so the first row is:

   |               |         Hiking     |       Board-games      |
   | Hobby         | Analyst           |                        |

8. Since the analyst is on the left, the hiker must be in the first row. The hiker's hobby is 'hiking', so the second row is:

   |               |         Hiking     |       Board-games      |
   | Hobby         | Project-Manager   |                        |
   | Job           | Analyst           |

9. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b (who is on the right), and the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike, the scooter must be in the first row and the quad-bike in the second row. The fan of r&b is on the right, so the second row is:

   |               |         Hiking     |       Board-games      |
   | Hobby         | Project-Manager   |                        |
   | Job           | Analyst           | Quad-bike             |

10. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b, the fan of r&b must be in the second row. The fan of r&b's music-genre is 'r&b', so the first row is:

   |               |         Hiking     |       Board-games      |
   | Hobby         | Project-Manager   | R&B                    |
   | Job           | Analyst           | Quad-bike             |

11. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b, the scooter must be in the first row. The scooter's transport is 'scooter', so the final solution table is:

Lv3-4x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different pets (hamster and rat), 2 different movie genres (action and epic), and 2 different music genres (disco and trance). Since there are only 2 people, each person must have a unique pet, movie genre, and music genre preference.

2. The person drinking tea is the owner of the hamster. So, we can place the hamster with the tea drinker. Let's put the hamster with the person in the first column (Column 1).

3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since we already placed the hamster (and its corresponding tea drinker) in Column 1, the cola drinker must be in Column 2.

4. Now, we know that the cola drinker is watching epic movies. Since we already placed the hamster (and its corresponding tea drinker) in Column 1, the person watching action movies must be in Column 1.

5. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the hamster owner is in Column 1, the rat owner must be in Column 2. The disco fan cannot be the person drinking cola (since they are in different columns), so the disco fan must be the person watching action movies in Column 1.

6. The only music genre left is trance. Since the person watching action movies is a disco fan, the person watching epic movies must be a trance fan.

7. The last pet, the rat, must be with the trance fan (since the hamster is with the disco fan).

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############

|-----------|------------|------------|-------|
| Tea       | Action     | Disco      | Hamster|

Lv3-4x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different beverages (7up, fanta), 2 different foods (kale, kiwi), 2 different jobs (accountant, entrepreneur), and 2 different sports (climbing, tennis).

2. Since there are 2 people, we can label them A and B.

3. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are 2 different beverages, neither person A nor person B can have both 7up and fanta. So, let's assume person A has 7up and person B has fanta.

4. Now, let's move to the foods. Since the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up, and the person eating kiwi is not person A (because person A is drinking 7up), person B must be eating kiwi. This means person A is eating kale.

5. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale. So, the arrangement is A(kale) - B(kiwi).

6. The accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know the arrangement of food, the only possible arrangement of jobs is A(accountant) - B(entrepreneur).

7. Finally, let's place the sports. Since the accountant is on the left, the person playing tennis must be person B. The only sport left for person A is climbing.

The final solution table is:

Lv3-4x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages (Mirinda and Sprite), two different foods (Asparagus and Garlic), two different hobbies (Hiking and Skydiving), and two different pets (Bird and Goldfish).

2. From the given conditions, we can start by placing the hobbies:
   - Since the person doing skydiving is on the left or right of the person drinking Mirinda (1.1), we can't place the skydiving hobby in the first column. So, let's place it in the second column.
   - Now, we know that the person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person doing skydiving (1.1), so we can't place the Mirinda in the second row. Let's place it in the first row.
   - Now, we know that the person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the bird (2.2), and the person eating asparagus is on the left of the owner of the bird (3). So, the bird can't be in the same row as the asparagus. Let's place the bird in the first row (since Mirinda is already there).
   - Now, we know that the person eating asparagus is on the left of the owner of the bird (3), so the asparagus must be in the second row.
   - The only food left is garlic, so it must be in the second row as well.
   - The only hobby left is hiking, so it must be in the first column.
   - The only beverage left is Sprite, and since the person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the bird (2.2), it must be in the second row.

Here is the final solution table:

In this table, the beverage in the second row is Sprite, but we don't know if it's on the left or right of the bird. Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact position of Sprite, we can't fill in the exact position.

Lv3-4x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different hobbies, two different movie genres, two different pets, and two different means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

   Hobby: 1 (video-games), 2 (writing)
   Movie-Genre: 1 (drama), 2 (epic)
   Pet: 1 (goat), 2 (pony)
   Transport: 1 (scooter), 2 (skateboard)

2. From the third rule, the person driving the scooter is watching drama movies, so the scooter is associated with movie genre 1. Let's assign scooter to row 1 and movie genre 1 to column 1.

   | Hobby | Movie-Genre | Pet | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-----|-----------|
   |       | 1 (drama)  |     | 1 (scooter)|
   |       | 2 (epic)   |     | 2 (skateboard)|

3. From the first rule, the person driving the scooter is not the owner of the pony. Since the scooter is already assigned, the pony cannot be in the same row. Let's assign the pony to the second row.

   | Hobby | Movie-Genre | Pet | Transport |
   |-------|------------|-----|-----------|
   | 1 (video-games) | 1 (drama)  | 2 (pony) | 1 (scooter)|
   | 2 (writing)     | 2 (epic)   | 1 (goat) | 2 (skateboard)|

4. From the second rule, the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the hobbies are already assigned, the skateboard must be in the first column and the person with the hobby of writing must be in the second column.

Lv3-4x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

2. Now we know the person driving the roller is not the sailor (since the sailor is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing and the sailor already has a position). Let's place the roller driver. Since the roller driver is not the bartender (because the bartender is on the left of the roller driver), the roller driver must be the lawyer.

   | Sport       | swimming  |   sailing|
   | Transport   | lawyer (roller) |         |

3. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender. Since the roller driver is the lawyer and the bartender is already in place, the quad-bike driver must be on the left of the bartender. However, the only empty spot on the left of the bartender is the transport spot. But a person can't drive a job, so we need to assign a pet or a sport to that spot. Since the pet and sport for the sailor are already assigned, let's assign the dog to the empty pet spot on the left of the bartender.

4. From point 3, the owner of the cat is on the right of the Nigerian. Since we already know the nationality of person 1, person 2 must be Nigerian. But the owner of the cat cannot be Nigerian because of point 3. So, the owner of the cat must be person 1.

   | Sport         | Climbing  | Golf   |

5. Now, we have one pet left, the rat. Since the owner of the cat is Mexican, the owner of the rat must be Nigerian (person 2).

6. Finally, from point 1, we know that the people prefer 2 different types of sport. Since we already have climbing and golf, the other sport must be either climbing or golf. But since climbing is already assigned to person 1, the other sport must be golf. However, this would mean that person 1 and person 2 would be watching the same sport, which contradicts the information given in the puzzle.

Unfortunately, there seems to be a contradiction in the given information, and it's not possible to fill in the table as per the given conditions.

The final solution table would be:

But there's a contradiction in the given information, so the puzzle might need to be revised."	{'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'sports'], 'nationality': ['mexican', 'nigerian'], 'pet': ['cat', 'rat'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'golf']}	True	4	False
Lv3-4x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food, 2 music-genres, 2 pets, and 2 sports. Since there are 4 variables and only 2 positions in the table, each variable must be repeated in one of the positions.

2. From the third rule, we know that the person who likes folk music is not on the same side as the person who owns the turtle. Let's assume the turtle owner is on the left (position 1). Then, the person who likes folk music must be in position 2.

3. From the second rule, the person eating cauliflower is on the right of the turtle owner. Since the turtle owner is in position 1, the cauliflower eater must be in position 2.

4. Now we know the food and music-genre for positions 1 and 2. Since there are only 2 types of each, we can deduce the food and music-genre for position 1. Let's assume position 1 is eating asparagus and likes metal.

5. From the first rule, the person who plays basketball is either on the left or right of the turtle owner. Since the turtle owner is in position 1 and we already have a food and music-genre for position 1, the basketball player must be in position 2.

6. The last variable is the pet. Since we know the positions of the food, music-genre, and sport, the only remaining variable is the pet. Let's assume the pet in position 1 is a ferret and the pet in position 2 is a turtle.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | asparagus | cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   | metal    | folk       |
| Pet           | ferret   | turtle     |
| Sport         | basketball| climbing    |
