Lv3-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, the person driving the quad-bike is on the far left. So, the quad-bike is in column 1.

2. From point 2, the person drinking milk is the person eating pineapple. Since the quad-bike is in column 1, the pineapple must be in column 2. So, the milk is in row 2.

3. From point 7, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the milk is in row 2, mirinda must be in row 1.

4. From point 8, the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating grapes. Since the pineapple is in column 2, the grapes must be in column 3 or 4. If grapes were in column 3, the tea would be in row 3, but that would violate point 1 (quad-bike is in column 1). So, grapes must be in column 4, and tea is in row 4.

5. From point 6, the person eating grapes is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the grapes are in column 4, the cat must be in column 1, 2, or 3. If the cat were in column 1, the quad-bike driver (who owns the cat) would be in the far right, which violates point 3. So, the cat must be in column 2.

6. From point 11, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the almond-milk is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the chinchilla yet.

7. From point 10, the owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is in column 1, the dog must be in column 2, 3, or 4. If the dog were in column 4, the person eating grapes (who owns the dog) would be in the far right, which violates point 6. So, the dog must be in column 2 or 3.

8. From point 5, the quad-bike driver (who owns the cat) is in column 1. Since the cat is in column 2, the quad-bike driver must be in row 3 (to be on the far left). So, the cat is in row 3, column 2.

9. Now we know the cat is in row 3, column 2. Since the cat is the owner of the quad-bike driver, the quad-bike driver cannot be the owner of the dog (as the dog is in column 2). So, the dog must be in column 3.

10. Now we know the dog is in column 3. Since the dog is on the right of the chinchilla, the chinchilla must be in column 1.

11. Now we know the chinchilla is in column 1. Since the chinchilla is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk, the almond-milk must be in row 1.

Lv3-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the electrician (Australian) in one of the positions. Let's place him in position 1 (nationality column). Since the electrician can't be the bartender (from rule 4), he can't be in position 2, 3, or 4 (job column). So, he must be in position 1 (job column).

2. Since the electrician is in position 1, the bartender can't be in position 1 (from rule 4). So, the bartender must be in position 2, 3, or 4 (job column). But the bartender can't be in position 4 (from rule 2, as the bartender can't be on the left of the person driving the car, and the electrician is in position 1). So, the bartender must be in position 3.

3. Now we know the electrician is in position 1 (job and nationality), and the bartender is in position 3 (job). This means the person in position 1 (job) can't be the bartender. So, the person in position 1 (job) must be the photographer (as the other options are the electrician and the bartender, and the electrician is in position 1). This means the photographer is driving the tram (from rule 3).

4. Since the photographer is in position 1 (job), the person in position 3 (job) can't be the photographer. So, the person in position 3 (job) must be the police-officer (as the other option is the bartender).

5. Now we know the police-officer is in position 3 (job). Since the police-officer can't be the person driving the car (from rule 4), he can't be in position 1, 2, or 4 (transport column). So, he must be in position 3 (transport). This means the person in position 3 (transport) is the police-officer.

6. Since the police-officer is in position 3 (transport), the person in position 3 (sport) can't be soccer (from rule 1, as soccer is on the left of rowing, and the police-officer is in position 3). So, the person in position 3 (sport) must be rowing, ice-hockey, or tennis (as the other option is soccer). But the person in position 3 (sport) can't be ice-hockey (from rule 7, as ice-hockey is on the far right, and the police-officer is in position 3). So, the person in position 3 (sport) must be rowing.

7. Since the person in position 3 (sport) is rowing, the person in position 1 (sport) can't be rowing (from rule 1). So, the person in position 1 (sport) must be soccer, ice-hockey, or tennis (as the other option is rowing). But the person in position 1 (sport) can't be ice-hockey (from rule 7, as ice-hockey is on the far right, and the electrician is in position 1). So, the person in position 1 (sport) must be soccer.

8. Since the person in position 1 (sport) is soccer, the person in position 2 (sport) can't be soccer (from rule 1). So, the person in position 2 (sport) must be ice-hockey, rowing, or tennis (as the other option is soccer). But the person in position 2 (sport) can't be rowing (from rule 6, as rowing is in position 3). So, the person in position 2 (sport) must be tennis.

9. Since the person in position 2 (sport) is tennis, the person in position 4 (sport) can't be tennis (from rule 6, as the person driving the trike is the person who's sport is tennis). So, the person in position 4 (sport) must be ice-hockey or rowing (as the other option is tennis). But the person in position 4 (sport) can't be rowing (from rule 6, as rowing is in position 3). So, the person in position 4 (sport) must be ice-hockey.

10. Since the person in position 4 (sport) is ice-hockey, the person in position 2 (sport) can't be on the far right (from rule 7, as ice-hockey is on the far right). So, the person in position 2 (transport) must be car or roller (as the other option is trike). But the person in position 2 (transport) can't be car (from rule 5, as the police-officer is in position 3 and can't be on the left of the person driving the car). So, the person in position 2 (transport) must be roller.

11. Since the person in position 2 (transport) is roller, the person in position 1 (transport) can't be roller (from rule 5, as the police-officer is in position 3 and can't be on the left of the person driving the roller). So, the person in position 1 (transport) must be car or tram (as the other option is trike). But the person in position 1 (transport) can't be car (from rule 5, as the police-officer is in position 3 and can't be on the left of the person driving the car). So, the person in position 1 (transport) must be tram.

12. Since the person in position 1 (transport) is tram, the person in position 4 (transport) can't be tram (from rule 3, as the photographer is in position 1). So, the person in position 4 (transport) must be car or trike (as the other option is roller). But the person in position 4 (transport) can't be car (from rule 5, as the police-officer is in position 3 and can't be on the left of the person driving the car). So, the person in position 4 (transport) must be trike.

13. Since the person in position 4 (transport) is trike, the person in position 2 (nationality) can't be Malaysian (from rule 6, as the person driving the trike is the person who's sport is tennis, and the Malaysian is on the left of the person driving the trike). So, the person in position 2 (nationality) must be Australian, Indian, or Turkish (as the other option is Malaysian). But the person in position 2 (nationality) can't be Australian (from rule 1, as the electrician is the Australian). So, the person in position 2 (nationality) must be Indian.

14. Since the person in position 2 (nationality) is Indian, the person in position 1 (nationality) can't be Indian (from rule 9, as the Indian is on the left of the Turkish). So, the person in position 1 (nationality) must be Australian, Malaysian, or Turkish (as the other option is Indian). But the person in position 1 (nationality) can't be Australian (from rule 1, as the electrician is the Australian). So, the person in position 1 (nationality) must be Malaysian.

15. Since the person in position 1 (nationality) is Malaysian, the person in position 4 (nationality) can't be Malaysian (from rule 9, as the Malaysian is on the left of the Turkish). So, the person in position 4 (nationality) must be Australian, Indian, or Turkish (as the other option is Malaysian). But the person in position 4 (nationality) can't be Indian (from rule 13, as the person in position 2 (nationality) is Indian). So, the person in position 4 (nationality) must be Turkish.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      1      |     2     |       3        |      4       |

Lv3-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From rule 3, the person eating potato is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since there are only two positions left for ice-hockey (either B or C), let's place ice-hockey at B for now. This means potato is at A or D. Let's place potato at A for now.

3. From rule 8, the owner of the cat is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey (B) and the fan of gospel. Since gospel can only be at A, C, or D, and cat can only be at B or D, let's place cat at D for now. This means gospel is at A or C.

4. From rule 4, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling can only be at A, B, or C, and hedgehog can only be at C or D, let's place cycling at A for now. This means hedgehog is at C.

5. From rule 6, the person who's sport is cycling (A) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball can only be at B or D, let's place volleyball at B for now.

6. From rule 1, the fan of indie is the person eating peach. Since peach can only be at A, B, or C, and we've placed potato at A, let's place peach at B.

7. From rule 7, the fan of folk is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since cricket can only be at A, C, or D, and we've placed indie (peach) at B, let's place folk at A.

8. From rule 10, the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person eating potato (A). Since we've placed peach (indie) at B and potato at A, grapefruit can only be at C or D.

9. From rule 9, the person eating potato (A) is on the left of the person eating cauliflower. Since cauliflower can only be at B or D, let's place cauliflower at D.

10. Now, we have no more rules to apply, so the final solution table is:

Lv3-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching family movies is on the left of the person watching epic movies, we can place the 'Family' in the first column and 'Epic' in the second column.

2. The Australian is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching satire movies is on the far left (rule 4), the Australian cannot be in the first or fourth column. So, the Australian can be in the second or third column. Let's place the Australian in the third column for now.

3. The Photographer is the person watching scientific movies (rule 3). Since the Australian is in the third column and the Canadian is on the far left or far right (rule 6), the Photographer (scientific movies) must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Let's place the Photographer in the first column for now.

4. The French is the person watching scientific movies (rule 5). Since the Photographer is in the first column (our assumption), the French must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Let's place the French in the second column for now.

5. The Canadian is on the far left or far right (rule 6). Since the Australian, Photographer, and French are all placed, the Canadian can only be in the first or fourth column. However, the Canadian cannot be in the first column because the Canadian is not watching scientific movies (our assumption about the first column), and the Canadian cannot be in the fourth column because the person watching satire movies is on the far left (rule 4). So, the Canadian must be in the second column.

6. The person watching satire movies is on the far left (rule 4). Since the Canadian is in the second column, the person watching satire movies must be in the first column.

7. The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the snake (rule 7). Since the person watching satire movies is in the first column (our conclusion), the owner of the rabbit must be in the first column, and the owner of the snake must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

8. The Videographer is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Polish (rule 8). Since the owner of the rabbit is in the first column (our conclusion), the Videographer cannot be in the first column. The owner of the chinchilla and the Polish can only be in the second, third, or fourth column. If the owner of the chinchilla is in the second column, the Videographer would be in the third column, but the Polish cannot be in the third column because the Videographer is between the owner of the chinchilla and the Polish (rule 8). So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the third column, and the Videographer and Polish can be in the second and fourth columns.

9. The Librarian is on the left or right of the owner of the snake (rule 9). Since the owner of the snake is in the second column (our conclusion), the Librarian can be in the first or third column. However, if the Librarian is in the first column, the Polish would be in the second column, but the Polish cannot be in the second column because the Videographer is in the second column (our conclusion from rule 8). So, the Librarian must be in the third column.

Now, let's put the jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and pets in their respective columns:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D, reading from left to right.

2. Let's start with the sports. Since the person playing badminton is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi (#3), and the person playing ice-hockey is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (#5), we can place badminton and ice-hockey in positions A and D. Let's say A is badminton and D is ice-hockey.

3. Now, the person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the person eating carrot (#2), and the person eating zucchini is on the right of the person eating carrot (#4). So, zucchini must be B and carrot must be C.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person eating pineapple (#3), so almond-milk must be A. This means pineapple must be D.

5. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball (#9), so basketball must be C. This means the person playing basketball is B.

6. The person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right (#6), but we already know the positions of almond-milk, badminton, carrot, ice-hockey, and pineapple. So, soy-milk must be C. This means the person drinking soy-milk is eating carrot.

7. The fan of funk is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini (#7), and zucchini is B. So, funk must be A or D. Since the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating kiwi (#8), and we know the position of kiwi (C), fanta must be D. This means funk is A.

8. The person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating kiwi (#8), and we know the position of kiwi (C). So, fanta must be B.

9. The fan of trance is between the person drinking almond-milk and the fan of reggae (#10). Since almond-milk is A and reggae must be on the right of the person eating zucchini (#7), reggae must be D. This means trance is C.

3. From point 2, the person driving the train (T) is either A or B, but not C or D (since T cannot be D due to point 4). Let's assume T = A. Then, the person driving the train is on the left of W, so W > T.

Lv3-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 hobbies, music-genres, pets, and sports. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 1, the hobby of hiking is on the left of both the fan of gospel and the owner of the mouse. Since there are only 3 positions to the left of the hiking hobby, the hobby of hiking must be in the first position. So, Hobby[1] = hiking.

3. From rule 2, the hobby of hiking is also on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the hobby of hiking is already placed in the first position, the owner of the mouse must be in the second position. So, Pet[2] = mouse.

4. From rule 3, the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the mouse is in the second position, the owner of the horse must be in the third position. So, Pet[3] = horse.

5. From rule 4, the person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is already placed in the second position, the person who's sport is parkour can be either in the first or fourth position. However, from rule 10, the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking, which means Sport[1] or Sport[4] cannot be baseball. So, Sport[4] = parkour.

6. From rule 5, the person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's hobby is collecting and the person who's sport is baseball. Since we know that the person who's sport is parkour is in the fourth position, the person who's sport is basketball must be in the third position. So, Sport[3] = basketball.

7. From rule 6, the fan of salsa is the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know that the person who's sport is parkour is in the fourth position, the person who's sport is tennis must be in the fifth position. So, Sport[5] = tennis.

8. From rule 8, the fan of pop is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since we have placed all other hobbies, the hobby of magic-tricks must be in the fourth position. So, Hobby[4] = magic-tricks.

9. From rule 9, the fan of gospel is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since we know that the person who's sport is basketball is in the third position, the fan of gospel must be in the fourth position. So, Music-Genre[4] = gospel.

10. From rule 10, the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is in the first position, the person who's sport is baseball can be either in the first or second position. However, from rule 4, the person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse, which means Sport[2] cannot be parkour. So, Sport[1] = baseball.

11. From rule 7, the owner of the bird is between the person who's sport is parkour and the fan of salsa. Since we know that the person who's sport is parkour is in the fourth position and the fan of salsa is in the fifth position, the owner of the bird must be in the third position. So, Pet[3] = bird.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |      4       |

| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | tennis    | parkour     |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left or far right, and it's also on the far left (as per point 7), it must be in the first column. Let's place it in the first row (1).

2. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the ice-hockey person is in the first column and the scientific movies person can't be in the first row (as per point 10), the handball person must be in the second row.

3. The Egyptian is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the ice-hockey person is in the first column and the iced-tea person can't be in the second row (as per point 11), the Egyptian must be in the third row.

4. The polish is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the handball person is in the second row and the Egyptian is in the third row, the musical movies person must be in the fourth row. Also, the polish is drinking fanta (as per point 9), so let's place the polish in the second column of the fourth row.

5. The person watching epic movies is on the left of the Malay. Since the musical movies person is in the fourth row, the epic movies person must be in the third row.

6. The pakistani is on the far left or far right. Since the Egyptian is in the third row, the pakistani can't be in the third column. So, the pakistani must be in the first column. Since the ice-hockey person is in the first row and the Egyptian is in the third row, the pakistani must be in the first row as well. But we already placed the ice-hockey person in the first row, so the pakistani must be in the first column of the first row.

7. The person drinking cola is the pakistani (as per point 11), so let's place the pakistani in the first column of the first row.

8. The person watching scientific movies can't be in the first row (as per point 10) or the second column (as per point 2), so it must be in the second row of the third column.

9. The person drinking iced-tea can't be in the first row (as per point 3) or the fourth column (as it's occupied by the polish), so it must be in the third row of the second column.

10. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the handball person is in the second row, the hot-chocolate person must be in the first row. Since the pakistani and the Egyptian are in the first column, the hot-chocolate person must be in the second column. But the polish is already in the second column of the fourth row, so the hot-chocolate person must be in the second column of the third row.

11. The person who's sport is surfing can't be in the first row (as per point 6) or the fourth column (as it's occupied by the polish), so it must be in the third row of the fourth column.

3. The journalist is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant. Since the journalist is in the 3rd column, the eggplant must be in the 2nd or 4th column. Let's place the eggplant in the 4th column for now.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

4. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person watching horror movies. Since there are only 4 hobbies, the dancing hobby must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. Let's place dancing in the 1st column for now.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

7. The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person eating banana. Since the banana is in the 2nd column, the superhero movies must be in the 1st or 3rd column. Let's place superhero in the 3rd column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

8. The chef is between the person watching comedy movies and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since comedy movies and board-games must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column, the chef must be in the 3rd column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

   | Movie-Genre   | superhero | comedy   |            |             |

9. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the chef. Since the chef is in the 3rd column, the comedy movies must be in the 2nd column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

   | Movie-Genre   | superhero |         |            |             |

10. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the comedy movies are in the 2nd column, the board-games hobby must be in the 4th column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |

   | Movie-Genre   | superhero |         |            |             |

Now we have filled all the jobs, hobbies, and movie-genres. To find the remaining food, we can use the information that the person eating banana is on the left of the engineer. Since the engineer must be in the 4th column (as the board-games hobby is in the 4th column), the banana must be in the 3rd column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |
   | Food          | artichoke  | comedy   | banana     | board-games  |
   | Hobby         | dancing   | horror   |            |             |
   | Job           |             | paramedic| journalist  | engineer    |
   | Movie-Genre   | superhero |         |            |             |

Finally, the remaining food is eggplant, which must be in the 1st column.

   |               |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4       |
   | Food          | artichoke  | comedy   | banana     | board-games  |
   | Hobby         | dancing   | horror   |            |             |
   | Job           |             | paramedic| journalist  | engineer    |
   | Movie-Genre   | superhero |         |            |             |

Lv3-4x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the owner of the pony is the person who's sport is volleyball, so we can place the volleyball in the 4th row and the pony in the 3rd column.

2. The designer is between the owner of the dog and the owner of the pony. Since we already placed the pony, the designer must be in the 2nd row. The dog cannot be in the 3rd column because it would be next to the pony, so the dog must be in the 1st or 2nd column. If the dog were in the 1st column, the designer would have to be in the 2nd row, but that would mean the teacher (who is yet to be placed) would have to be in the 1st row, which is not possible because the teacher is to the left of the owner of the fish (which we will place later). So, the dog must be in the 2nd column.

   |         |     1      |    2     |      3       |       4       |

3. The owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since we placed the pony and the dog, the only possible place for the fish is the 1st column.

4. The owner of the fish is on the right of the owner of the pony. This means the fish must be in the 4th column.

Since the teacher is in the 4th row, the writer cannot be in the 4th column because that would mean the sudoku hobby is in the 3rd column, and the writer would have to be in the 2nd row, which is not possible because the designer is already there. So, the writer must be in the 1st column.

7. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the writer. Since the writer is in the 1st column, the sudoku hobby must be in the 3rd column.

8. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the teacher is in the 4th row, the magic-tricks hobby must be in the 2nd or 4th column. If it were in the 4th column, the swimming sport would have to be in the 1st column, but that would mean the writer would have to be in the 2nd row, which is not possible because the designer is already there. So, the magic-tricks hobby is in the 2nd column.

9. The person who's hobby is dancing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the person who's hobby is writing. Since the swimming sport is in the 1st row and the writing hobby is in the 1st column, the dancing hobby must be in the 2nd row and 2nd column.

   | Sport   | swimming  |          | volleyball    |              |

10. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person who's sport is rugby. Since we placed the swimming sport, the rugby sport must be in the 2nd row. But the designer is already in the 2nd row, so the rugby sport must be in the 3rd row.

    This creates a contradiction because the pony (which is the pet of the person who's sport is volleyball) is already in the 3rd column, and we cannot have two pets in the same column.

   It seems that there is no valid solution for this puzzle as it is currently stated. The given conditions lead to a contradiction."	{}	False	0	False
