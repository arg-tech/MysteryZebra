Lv3-1x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking juice is not in the first or last position (due to rule 4). So, the possible positions for juice are 2, 3, 5, or 6.

2. Since the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking juice (rule 3), and the person drinking juice is not in the first position, the possible positions for cola are 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. Now, the person drinking milk must be on the left or right of the person drinking juice (rule 2). If the person drinking juice is in position 2, then the person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 4 (right). If the person drinking juice is in position 3, then the person drinking milk can be in position 2 (left) or 5 (right). If the person drinking juice is in position 5, then the person drinking milk must be in position 6 (right). If the person drinking juice is in position 6, then the person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 7 (right).

4. The person drinking 7up must be on the far left or far right (rule 4), so it cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the person drinking juice is in position 6, then the person drinking 7up can be in position 1 (left) or 7 (right). If the person drinking juice is in position 2, then the person drinking 7up must be in position 7 (right).

5. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite (rule 6), so they cannot be in the same row. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1 or 7, the possible positions for lemonade are 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If the person drinking juice is in position 2, then the person drinking lemonade can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. If the person drinking juice is in position 3, then the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. If the person drinking juice is in position 5, then the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. If the person drinking juice is in position 6, then the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person drinking iced-tea must be on the left or right of the person drinking 7up (rule 8), and on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 9). So, if the person drinking 7up is in position 1, then the person drinking iced-tea can be in position 2 or 3. If the person drinking 7up is in position 7, then the person drinking iced-tea can be in position 6 or 7.

7. Now, we have two possibilities for the positions of juice, 7up, and iced-tea. Let's check each possibility:

   - If juice is in position 2, 7up in position 1, and iced-tea in position 6: This is possible because the person drinking cola can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the person drinking lemonade can be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. The person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 5 (right).

   - If juice is in position 2, 7up in position 7, and iced-tea in position 6: This is not possible because the person drinking cola must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, but there is no position for cola on the right of juice and left of iced-tea.

   - If juice is in position 3, 7up in position 1, and iced-tea in position 5: This is possible because the person drinking cola can be in position 4, 5, or 6, and the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. The person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 7 (right).

   - If juice is in position 3, 7up in position 7, and iced-tea in position 7: This is not possible because the person drinking cola must be in position 4, 5, or 6, but there is no position for cola on the right of juice and left of iced-tea.

   - If juice is in position 5, 7up in position 1, and iced-tea in position 4: This is possible because the person drinking cola can be in position 6, and the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. The person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 7 (right).

   - If juice is in position 5, 7up in position 7, and iced-tea in position 6: This is not possible because the person drinking cola must be in position 6, but there is no position for cola on the right of juice and left of iced-tea.

   - If juice is in position 6, 7up in position 1, and iced-tea in position 3: This is possible because the person drinking cola can be in position 5, and the person drinking lemonade can be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. The person drinking milk can be in position 1 (left) or 7 (right).

   - If juice is in position 6, 7up in position 7, and iced-tea in position 5: This is not possible because the person drinking cola must be in position 5, but there is no position for cola on the right of juice and left of iced-tea.

8. Out of the eight possibilities, only the following arrangement is valid:

   | Beverage   |  1   |   2   |  3   |   4    |    5     |    6     |  7  |
   |-----------|------|-------|------|--------|----------|----------|------|
   | 7up       | ###  |       |      |        |          |          | ###  |
   | Cola      |      |       |      |        |          |          |      |
   | Juice     |      |       |      |        |          |          |      |
   | Iced-tea  |      |       |      |        |          |      | ###  |
   | Lemonade  |      |       |      |        |       ### |          |      |
   | Milk      | ###  |       |      |        |          |          | ###  |
   | Sprite    |      |       |      | Sprite |          |      |      |

   The solution is: 7up (1, 7), Cola (3), Juice (5), Iced-tea (3), Lemonade (4), Milk (1, 7), Sprite (6)"	{}	False	0	False
Lv3-1x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the pilot is on the far right, we know that the chef is not in the last two positions (1 and 6). So, the chef can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. The pilot is on the left or right of the chef, so if the chef is in position 2, the pilot must be in position 1. If the chef is in position 3, the pilot can be in position 4 or 5. If the chef is in position 4, the pilot must be in position 5. If the chef is in position 5, the pilot must be in position 6.

3. The chef is on the right of the photographer, so if the chef is in position 2, the photographer must be in position 1. If the chef is in position 3, the photographer can be in position 2 or 4. If the chef is in position 4, the photographer must be in position 3. If the chef is in position 5, the photographer must be in position 6.

4. Now, let's place the videographer. The designer is on the left or right of the videographer, so if the videographer is in position 1, the designer can be in position 2 or 3. If the videographer is in position 2, the designer must be in position 3. If the videographer is in position 3, the designer must be in position 2.

5. The videographer is on the left or right of the electrician, so if the videographer is in position 1, the electrician can be in position 2 or 6. If the videographer is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 1. If the videographer is in position 3, the electrician can be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. But since the electrician is on the left of the photographer, the electrician can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the electrician must be in position 2 if the videographer is in position 3.

6. The electrician is on the left of the photographer, so if the electrician is in position 2, the photographer must be in position 3.

7. The designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker, so if the videographer is in position 1 and the designer is in position 3, the dressmaker must be in position 2. If the videographer is in position 2 and the designer is in position 3, the dressmaker can be in position 4 or 5. But since the electrician is on the left of the photographer, the dressmaker can't be in position 5. So, the dressmaker must be in position 4 if the videographer is in position 2.

8. Now, if the videographer is in position 1 and the designer is in position 3, the only remaining position for the dressmaker is position 6. But this contradicts the fact that the electrician is on the left of the photographer, as the electrician would be in position 5. So, the videographer can't be in position 1.

Therefore, the videographer must be in position 2, the designer in position 3, the chef in position 5, the pilot in position 6, the electrician in position 2, the photographer in position 3, the dressmaker in position 4, and the job for position 1 is unknown due to the contradiction found.

The final solution table is:

```

Lv3-1x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, the American cannot be in the first or last position because the Argentine must be on the far left or far right. So, the Argentine can only be in positions 1 or 7, and the American can only be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6.

2. From rule 2, the American cannot be in position 2 because the Colombian must be to the right of the American. So, the American can only be in positions 3, 5, or 6.

3. From rule 4, the American cannot be in position 3 because the Argentine must be to the left or right of the American. So, the American can only be in positions 5 or 6.

4. From rule 5, the Turkish cannot be in position 1 because the Indian must be to the left of the Turkish. So, the Indian cannot be in position 7. Therefore, the Indian can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.

5. From rule 6, the Turkish cannot be in position 4 because the Indian must be to the left of the Turkish. So, the Turkish can only be in positions 1, 2, or 5.

6. From rule 7, the Indian cannot be in position 1 because the Canadian must be to the left or right of the Indian. So, the Indian can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 6.

7. Since the Turkish cannot be in position 4 (from rule 6), and the Indian cannot be in position 1 (from rule 4), the Canadian must be in position 1.

8. Now, the Indian cannot be in position 6 (from rule 7), so the Indian must be in position 2.

9. The Turkish cannot be in position 5 (from rule 5), so the Australian must be in position 5.

10. The Argentine cannot be in position 7 (from rule 1), so the Argentine must be in position 1.

11. The American must be in position 6 because all other positions are occupied.

12. The Colombian must be in position 3 because all other positions are occupied and the Colombian must be to the right of the American (rule 3).

Lv3-1x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 6, we know that the fan of pop is in the middle, so we can mark it as 'P' in the third position.

2. Since the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of country, we can place country either to the left or right of pop. Let's place it to the left for now (1st position).

3. From point 3, the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since we've placed pop and country, hip-hop must be in the remaining two positions (2nd and 6th). Let's place hip-hop in the 2nd position for now.

4. From point 5, the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of indie. So, indie must be in the 6th position.

5. Now, we have pop (P), country, hip-hop, indie, and we still have dubstep, r&b, and reggae to place. Since the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of dubstep, dubstep must be in the 1st position.

6. From point 4, the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of r&b. Since we've placed dubstep, country, pop, hip-hop, and indie, r&b and reggae must be in the 2nd and 3rd positions. However, we've already placed hip-hop in the 2nd position. So, r&b must be in the 2nd position, and reggae in the 3rd position.

7. From point 1, the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan of indie. Since we've placed hip-hop in the 2nd position and indie in the 6th position, hip-hop can't be on the right of indie. So, hip-hop must be on the left of indie, which means it should swap places with indie.

8. Now, the final arrangement is:

   |               |  1  |   2    |    3    |  4  |   5   |    6    |    7    |
   | Music-Genre   | D   | H     | R      | P   | I    | E      | G      |

   Where D is dubstep, H is hip-hop, R is reggae, P is pop, I is indie, and E is either country or r&b (we can't determine which one).

Since we can't determine the exact position of country or r&b, the final solution table is:

#############

| Music-Genre   | D   | H     | R      | P   | I    | E      | G      |

Lv3-1x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that writing is in the middle, so we can place it at position 4.

2. Since writing is to the left of rock-climbing and writing is to the right of photography, we can place photography at position 3 and rock-climbing at position 5.

3. Film making is to the right of puzzles. Since writing is in the middle, and writing is to the left of rock-climbing, puzzles must be to the left of filmmaking. So, we can place puzzles at position 2. This means filmmaking must be at position 6.

4. Now, filmmaking is on the right of puzzles, and photography is to the left or right of filmmaking. Since we already placed photography at position 3, it must be on the left of filmmaking, so filmmaking is at position 4 and photography at position 3.

5. Fishing is between rock-climbing and dancing. Since rock-climbing is at position 5 and dancing must be at position 1 (as it's the only position left), fishing must be at position 2.

6. Finally, we know that photography is on the left of writing, so photography is at position 3 and writing is at position 4.

The final solution table is:

2. The fan of trance is to the left of the fan of d&b, so we can place 'trance' in the 3rd position.

4. The fan of soul is either to the left or right of the fan of gospel. Since the fan of gospel can't be in the first or last position (as per rule 4), let's place 'gospel' in the 2nd position and 'soul' in the 6th position.

5. The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of trance, so it should be in the 1st position. However, this would violate rule 4 as disco would be in the far left. So, let's swap gospel and disco, placing 'disco' in the 2nd position and 'gospel' in the 6th position.

   |               | disco | gospel|  d&b | trance| metal| soul  |   7    |

8. The fan of reggae is on the far left or far right. Since the table is already filled, the only possible position for reggae to be on the far right would violate rule 4. So, reggae must be on the far left.

2. Now, we know that lacrosse is to the left of swimming, so lacrosse must be in one of the first three positions (1, 2, or 3). Let's try placing lacrosse in position 1 for now.

3. Ice-hockey is to the right of swimming, so it must be in one of the last three positions (5, 6, or 7). Since ice-hockey is also to the far left or far right, it can only be in position 7 or 6. Let's try placing ice-hockey in position 7 for now.

4. Skiing is to the left of tennis, so skiing must be in one of the first three positions (1, 2, or 3). Since skiing is also to the left of volleyball, skiing cannot be in position 1. So, skiing must be in either position 2 or 3. Let's try placing skiing in position 2 for now.

5. Volleyball is to the left of skiing, so volleyball must be in one of the first two positions (1 or 2). Since volleyball is also to the left or right of swimming, volleyball cannot be in position 1 (because it would be to the left of swimming, which is in position 4). So, volleyball must be in position 2.

Since the Spanish is on the right of the Dutch, the Spanish cannot be in the first column (1) because the Egyptian is there, and the Dutch cannot be in the first row because the Argentine cannot be in the first column. So, the Dutch must be in either row 2, 3, 4, or 5, and the Spanish must be in either row 3, 4, 5, or 6.

6. Since the Russian is on the right of the Spanish, the Russian cannot be in the first row because the Spanish cannot be in the first row. So, the Russian must be in either row 2, 4, 5, or 6.

7. Since the Russian is also on the left or right of the Mexican, the Russian and the Mexican cannot be in the same row. So, the Mexican cannot be in row 2, 4, or 6 because the Russian is in those rows. Therefore, the Mexican must be in row 3, 5, or 7.

8. Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the Argentine, and the Argentine cannot be in the first row or the sixth row (because the Russian is there), the Argentine must be in either row 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already know that the Mexican cannot be in row 3, so the Argentine cannot be in row 3 either. So, the Argentine must be in row 2, 4, or 5.

9. Since the Spanish is on the right of the Dutch, and we know the Dutch is not in the first row, the Spanish cannot be in the first row either. So, the Spanish must be in either row 2, 4, 5, or 6. But we already know that the Argentine cannot be in row 2, so the Spanish cannot be in row 2 either. So, the Spanish must be in row 4, 5, or 6.

10. Since the Russian is on the right of the Spanish, and we know the Spanish is not in the first row, the Russian cannot be in the first row either. So, the Russian must be in either row 2, 4, 5, or 6. But we already know that the Argentine cannot be in row 2, and the Spanish cannot be in row 4, so the Russian must be in row 5 or 6.

11. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the Russian, and we know the Russian is in row 5 or 6, the Mexican cannot be in row 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the Mexican must be in row 5, 6, or 7. But we already know that the Argentine cannot be in row 3, so the Mexican cannot be in row 7 either. So, the Mexican must be in row 5.

12. Since the Dutch is on the left or right of the Argentine, and we know the Argentine is in row 5, the Dutch cannot be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. So, the Dutch must be in row 5 or 7. But we already know that the Mexican is in row 5, so the Dutch must be in row 7.

13. Since the Spanish is on the right of the Dutch, the Spanish cannot be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7. So, the Spanish must be in row 6.

14. Since the Russian is on the right of the Spanish, the Russian must be in row 6.

15. Since the Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian, and we know the Egyptian is in the first column, the Chinese cannot be in the first column. So, the Chinese must be in either column 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But we already know that the Mexican is in column 5, the Dutch is in column 7, and the Spanish is in column 6, so the Chinese must be in column 2, 3, 4, or 5. But we already know that the Argentine is not in column 3, so the Chinese must be in column 2.

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Egyptian   | Chinese | Mexican | Argentine | Dutch   | Spanish | Russian |
|-----------|---------|---------|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| 1         | 2       | 5       | 4         | 7       | 6       | 6       |

Lv3-1x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the pilot is in the middle, we know that the jobs on the left and right of the pilot are 3 jobs each.

2. Let's place the pilot in the middle (3rd position). Now we have 3 jobs on the left and 4 jobs on the right.

3. The pilot is on the left or right of the designer. Since the pilot is in the middle, the designer must be on the other side. Let's place the designer on the right side (4th position). Now we have 2 jobs left on the left side.

4. The freelancer is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the designer is on the right, the freelancer must be on the left (1st position). Now we have 1 job left on the left side.

5. The software-developer is on the left or right of the police-officer. Since the freelancer is on the left, the police-officer must be on the right (6th position). Now we have 2 jobs left on the right side.

6. The designer is on the left of the teacher. Since the designer is on the right, the teacher must be on the 7th position.

7. The only job left is the fisherman. Since the pilot is in the middle, the fisherman must be on the other side. So, the fisherman is on the left (2nd position).

Here is the final solution table:
