Lv3-1x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is on the far left, we can place the bartender in the first column (1).
2. The pilot is on the left of the project-manager, so the pilot cannot be in the first column (1). Let's place the pilot in the second column (2).
3. Now, the project-manager must be in the third column (3) because the pilot is on the left of the project-manager, and the bartender is on the left or right of the pilot.
4. The fisherman is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the project-manager is in the third column (3), the fisherman cannot be in the fourth column (4). So, the fisherman must be in the fifth column (5).
5. The engineer can be in either the fourth or sixth column. If the engineer is in the fourth column (4), the fisherman would be on the right of the engineer, which contradicts the given information. So, the engineer must be in the sixth column (6).
6. Finally, the writer is the only remaining job, so it must be in the fourth column (4).

The final solution table is:

```
#############
| Bartender | Pilot | Project-Manager | Fisherman | Writer | Engineer |

Lv3-1x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the watermelon is not in the first position (as it must be to the right of the orange, which can't be in the last position). So, watermelon is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. From rule 2, if watermelon is in position 2, then papaya must be in position 1. But this contradicts rule 3, as apricot must be on the left or right of lettuce, and there's no lettuce in position 1. So, watermelon can't be in position 2.

3. Now, let's assume watermelon is in position 3. This means papaya is in position 4. From rule 3, apricot can't be in position 1 (as it must be on the left or right of lettuce, and there's no lettuce in position 1). So, apricot can only be in position 2 or 5. But if apricot is in position 2, it would violate rule 6 (nectarine must be on the left or right of apricot, but there's no nectarine in position 1). So, apricot must be in position 5. This means lettuce is in position 1.

4. Now, let's place the remaining fruits. From rule 4, papaya is to the right of watermelon, so papaya is in position 4.

5. From rule 5, orange can be in position 1, 2, or 6. But if orange is in position 1, it would violate rule 7 (nectarine must be to the left of orange, but there's no nectarine in position 2). So, orange can't be in position 1. If orange is in position 2, it would violate rule 6 (nectarine must be on the left or right of apricot, but apricot is in position 5). So, orange can't be in position 2 either. This means orange must be in position 6.

6. From rule 6, nectarine can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But if nectarine is in position 1, it would violate rule 7 (nectarine must be to the left of orange, but orange is in position 6). So, nectarine can't be in position 1. If nectarine is in position 2, it would violate rule 6 (nectarine must be on the left or right of apricot, but apricot is in position 5). If nectarine is in position 4, it would violate rule 4 (papaya is to the right of watermelon, but watermelon is in position 3). So, nectarine must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
| lettuce   | apricot | nectarine | watermelon | papaya     | orange    |

Lv3-1x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From points 3 and 4, we know that the carrot and kiwi cannot be in the first two positions (1 and 2) because if they were, it would violate both conditions. So, let's place kiwi in position 3 and carrot in position 2 (left of kiwi).

2. Now, we can place lime to the right of kiwi (position 4) as per point 2.

3. Point 5 tells us that asparagus cannot be in the first three positions (1, 2, 3) because it would violate both conditions. So, let's place asparagus in position 5 (to the right of lime).

4. Point 6 tells us that pomegranate is to the right of asparagus, so it goes in position 6.

5. Now, we have to place cranberry. From point 7, we know that cranberry is to the left of pomegranate and to the right of asparagus. The only available position is position 4, so cranberry goes there.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv3-1x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left or far right, it can't be in the middle (positions 3, 4, or 5). So, it must be in either position 1 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.

2. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. If fishing is in position 1, then photography must be in position 2.

3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. If fishing is in position 1, then woodworking must be in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. If gardening is not in position 1 (since fishing is there), it can't be in position 6 because then it would be on the right of board-games, and we have a rule that it must be on the left or right. So, gardening must be in position 2 or 4. If it's in position 2, then board-games must be in position 5, but that would mean gardening is not on the left of board-games, which contradicts the rule. So, gardening must be in position 4.

5. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in position 3, dancing can't be in position 1 (because of rule 2). So, dancing must be in position 6.

6. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since gardening is in position 4, board-games must be in position 5.

Now, let's check the consistency of our solution:

- The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left or far right, and it's in position 1.
- The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing, and it's in position 2.
- The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing, and it's in position 3.
- The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games, and it's in position 4.
- The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, and it's in position 6.
- The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games, and it's in position 4.

Everything checks out, so the final solution table is:

Lv3-1x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The airplane is on the far left (A).
2. The helicopter is to the right of the airplane (H).
3. The taxi is either to the left or right of the helicopter. Let's place it to the left of the helicopter for now (T). This leaves the far right for the trike (K).
4. The subway cannot be in the far left because the trike is there (5), so it must be in the remaining positions. Since the helicopter is to the right of the airplane (2), the subway cannot be to the left of the helicopter (3), so it must be to the right of the helicopter (S).
5. Now we have: A H T S K. Since the taxi is to the left of the helicopter (3), the helicopter must be in the second position. So, the arrangement is: A H T S K.
6. The only remaining transport is the train. Since the trike is on the far right (5), the train must be in the second-to-last position (E).

Lv3-1x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching family movies is on the far left, so we can place it in the first column (column 1).

2. Since family movies are on the left of scientific movies, we can place scientific movies in the second column (column 2).

3. Now, we know that sports movies are on the right of epic movies. Since sports movies are also to the left of horror movies, and family movies are on the far left, we can place epic movies in the third column (column 3). This means sports movies must be in the fourth column (column 4).

4. Now, the person watching horror movies must be in the fifth column (column 5), as it is to the left of sports movies and to the right of the person watching musical movies.

5. Finally, the person watching musical movies is to the right of the person watching horror movies, so it must be in the sixth column (column 6).

Lv3-1x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the person who plays skiing is between volleyball and rugby. Since volleyball is on the right of lacrosse (rule 4), and the person who plays skiing cannot be on the left of the person who plays lacrosse (rule 7), the person who plays skiing must be to the right of both volleyball and lacrosse.

2. From rule 6, we know that the person who plays skiing is on the left of the person who plays rugby. So, the order is now: [lacrosse, volleyball, skiing, rugby].

3. From rule 1, we know that the person who plays golf is between rugby and water-polo. Since we already placed skiing, rugby, and volleyball, the only remaining spots are to the left of skiing and to the right of water-polo. However, golf cannot be to the right of water-polo because of rule 2. So, golf must be to the left of skiing.

4. From rule 5, we know that the person who plays volleyball is on the left or right of the person who plays skiing. But we already placed volleyball to the right of skiing. So, volleyball must be to the left of skiing. This contradicts our previous placement of volleyball to the right of skiing. This means our initial assumption that volleyball is to the right of skiing is incorrect.

5. Let's try placing volleyball to the left of skiing instead. This means the order is now: [lacrosse, volleyball, skiing, rugby].

6. From rule 2, we know that the person who plays golf is between rugby and water-polo. So, the order is now: [lacrosse, volleyball, golf, rugby, water-polo].

7. From rule 3, we know that the person who plays skiing is between volleyball and rugby. But we already placed skiing between volleyball and rugby. So, the conditions are satisfied.

8. From rule 4, we know that the person who plays volleyball is on the right of the person who plays lacrosse. So, the final order is: [lacrosse, golf, volleyball, rugby, water-polo].

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x6-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the doctor is on the far right, we can rule out the first two columns for the doctor. This leaves us with columns 3, 4, and 5 for the doctor.

2. The doctor cannot be in column 3 because the videographer must be in one of the two remaining columns (4 or 5). If the doctor were in column 3, the videographer would have to be in column 1 or 2, which contradicts the fact that the doctor is on the far right.

3. Now, let's consider column 5 for the doctor. If the doctor were in column 5, the videographer would have to be in column 4. However, this would mean that the police-officer, who must be on the left or right of the videographer, would have to be in column 3. But if the doctor is in column 5, the scientist, who is on the left of the engineer, would have to be in column 4. This would place the engineer in column 5, which is not possible because the doctor is in column 5.

4. So, the doctor must be in column 4. This means the videographer is in column 5 and the police-officer is in column 3.

5. Now, the scientist must be in column 2 because the bartender is on the left of the scientist and the scientist is on the left of the engineer (who is not in column 1 because the doctor is in column 4).

6. This leaves us with column 1 for the engineer.

Lv3-1x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating cauliflower is on the far left, we can place it in position 1.
2. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. If we place avocado to the right of carrot, then carrot must be in position 2. But this would mean avocado is in position 3, which contradicts the fact that cauliflower is in position 1 (since avocado is to the right of cauliflower). So, avocado must be in position 2, and carrot in position 3.
3. Now, the person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating onion. If eggplant is in position 1, then onion must be in position 6, but this would mean the person eating cauliflower is on the right of the person eating onion, which contradicts the given information. So, eggplant cannot be in position 1. If eggplant is in position 6, then onion must be in position 5. But this would mean the person eating carrot is on the left of the person eating onion, which also contradicts the given information. So, eggplant cannot be in position 6 either. The only remaining position for eggplant is 4.
4. Now, the person eating onion is on the right of the person eating carrot. So, onion must be in position 5, and carrot in position 3.
5. Finally, the person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating cauliflower. So, avocado must be in position 4, and cauliflower in position 1.
6. The only food left is garlic. Since there are no restrictions on its position, it can be placed in any of the remaining positions (2, 5, or 6). Let's place it in position 6 for now.

Final solution table:

```
#############
|  Cauliflower| Carrot  | Eggplant | Avocado | Garlic   | Onion    |

Lv3-1x6-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that 7up is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column with 7up.

|     |  1  |   2    |    3    |       4       |  5  |    6     |
|-----|-----|--------|----------|--------------|-----|----------|
| Beverage| 7up |        |          |              |     |          |

2. Since the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, mirinda cannot be in the second column (as it would be to the left of 7up). So, mirinda must be in the third, fourth, or sixth column.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since 7up is already in the first column, iced-tea cannot be in the first or sixth column. So, iced-tea can only be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

4. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since 7up is in the first column, coffee cannot be in the first or sixth column. So, coffee can only be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

5. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. This means that if coffee is in the second column, mirinda cannot be in the first or third column. If coffee is in the third column, mirinda cannot be in the first or fifth column. If coffee is in the fourth column, mirinda cannot be in the second or sixth column. If coffee is in the fifth column, mirinda cannot be in the first, third, or sixth column.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

- If coffee is in the second column, mirinda can only be in the fourth or fifth column. But if mirinda is in the fifth column, it would violate the rule that iced-tea is on the far left or far right, as iced-tea cannot be in the second column. So, coffee cannot be in the second column.
- If coffee is in the third column, mirinda can only be in the fourth or sixth column. But if mirinda is in the sixth column, it would violate the rule that iced-tea is on the far left or far right, as iced-tea cannot be in the second column. So, coffee cannot be in the third column.
- If coffee is in the fourth column, mirinda can only be in the fifth column. This is a valid arrangement as it doesn't violate any rules.
- If coffee is in the fifth column, mirinda can only be in the sixth column. But if mirinda is in the sixth column, it would violate the rule that iced-tea is on the far left or far right, as iced-tea cannot be in the second column. So, coffee cannot be in the fifth column.

So, coffee must be in the fourth column. This means that mirinda must be in the fifth column and iced-tea can be in any of the remaining columns (second, third, or sixth).

Now, we have filled in 3 columns:

|     |  1  |   2    |    3    |       4       |  5  |    6     |
|-----|-----|--------|----------|--------------|-----|----------|
| Beverage| 7up | iced-tea| coffee    | mirinda       | tea |          |

The only remaining beverage is hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, hot-chocolate must be in the second column.

So, the final solution table is:
