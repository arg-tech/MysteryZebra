Lv3-7x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different nationalities, 2 different pets, and 2 different sports. So, we have 12 unique items in total.

2. Let's assign the items to the columns and rows. We'll start with the beverages:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea |

3. Next, let's assign the foods:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry |

4. Now, let's assign the hobbies:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading |

5. Next, let's assign the jobs:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 | Job 1 | Job 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading | analyst | social-worker |

6. Now, let's assign the nationalities:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 | Job 1 | Job 2 | Nationality 1 | Nationality 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading | analyst | social-worker | brazilian | malaysian |

7. Next, let's assign the pets:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 | Job 1 | Job 2 | Nationality 1 | Nationality 2 | Pet 1 | Pet 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading | analyst | social-worker | brazilian | malaysian | chinchilla | horse |

8. Now, let's assign the sports:

   | Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 | Job 1 | Job 2 | Nationality 1 | Nationality 2 | Pet 1 | Pet 2 | Sport 1 | Sport 2 |
   |-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
   | hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading | analyst | social-worker | brazilian | malaysian | chinchilla | horse | golf | volleyball |

9. Now we have the following constraints:

   - The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since there are only 2 positions left for raspberry, it must be in the second column. So, the chinchilla owner is in the first column.
   - The owner of the horse is on the left of the malaysian. Since the malaysian is in the second row, the horse owner must be in the first row. So, the horse owner is the person drinking hot-chocolate.
   - The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the chess hobby is in the first column, the reading hobby must be in the second column. So, the person reading is the social-worker (since the hobby is already assigned to the analyst in the first column).
   - The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate is already assigned to the horse owner, the raspberry eater must be on the other side. Since the social-worker is already assigned to the reading hobby, which is on the same side as the raspberry, the raspberry eater must be the analyst.
   - The person who's sport is volleyball is the person who's hobby is reading. Since the reading hobby is already assigned to the social-worker, the volleyball player is the social-worker. But this contradicts the previous constraint that the social-worker is the raspberry eater. So, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

The final solution table, considering the contradiction, is:

```
#############
| Beverage 1 | Beverage 2 | Food 1 | Food 2 | Hobby 1 | Hobby 2 | Job 1 | Job 2 | Nationality 1 | Nationality 2 | Pet 1 | Pet 2 | Sport 1 | Sport 2 |
|-----------|-----------|--------|--------|---------|---------|-------|-------|---------------|--------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| hot-chocolate | tea | pineapple | raspberry | chess | reading | analyst | social-worker | brazilian | malaysian | chinchilla | horse | golf | volleyball |
#############
```

However, the puzzle seems to have a contradiction, as mentioned above."
Lv3-7x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies (dancing, writing), we can fill the first row with one hobby in the first column and the other hobby in the second column. Let's say the first person's hobby is dancing and the second person's hobby is writing.

   | Hobby | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Job   |     |     |
   | Movie |     |     |
   | Music |     |     |
   | Nationality |     |     |
   | Pet   |     |     |
   | Transport |     |     |

2. Similarly, we can fill the second row with the other two jobs (entrepreneur, social-worker), the other two movie-genres (horror, western), the other two music-genres (folk, trance), the other two nationalities (pakistani, russian), the other two pets (goat, mouse), and the other means of transport (snowmobile, van).

   | Hobby | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Job   | entrepreneur | social-worker |
   | Movie | horror | western |
   | Music | folk | trance |
   | Nationality | pakistani | russian |
   | Pet   | goat | mouse |
   | Transport | snowmobile | van |

3. Now, let's apply the given conditions:

   a) The russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. So, the russian must be in the second column.

   b) The fan of folk is on the left of the social-worker. This means the social-worker must be in the second row and the second column (since the fan of folk is already in the first row and first column).

   c) The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since we know the social-worker is driving the van and watching horror movies, the social-worker must be in the first row and first column.

   d) The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the russian is the one who's hobby is dancing and is in the second column, the goat can be in either the first or second row. However, since the social-worker is already in the first row and first column, the goat must be in the first row and second column.

   e) Now, we have the following arrangement:

   | Hobby | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Job   | social-worker | entrepreneur |
   | Movie | horror | western |
   | Music | folk | trance |
   | Nationality | pakistani | russian |
   | Pet   | goat | mouse |
   | Transport | van | snowmobile |

   f) To find the remaining positions, we can use the information that the person who's hobby is writing must be in the second row and the second column (since the russian is in the second column and the social-worker is in the first row and first column).

   g) The remaining positions for job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, and transport can be filled randomly, as long as they are different from the already filled positions.

4. The final solution table is:

   | Hobby | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Job   | social-worker | entrepreneur |
   | Movie | horror | western |
   | Music | folk | trance |
   | Nationality | pakistani | russian |
   | Pet   | goat | mouse |
   | Transport | van | snowmobile |

   | Job   | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Hobby | writing | dancing |
   | Movie | mystery | comedy |
   | Music | jazz | classical |
   | Nationality | indian | chinese |
   | Pet   | dog | cat |
   | Transport | bike | car |

   ##### Final Solution:

   | Hobby | 1   | 2   |
   |-------|-----|-----|
   | Job   | social-worker | entrepreneur |
   | Movie | horror | western |
   | Music | folk | trance |

Lv3-7x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 different items for each category (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Sport, Transport). Since there are 2 pairs for each category, we can place one item from each pair in the first row and the other in the second row.

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      |               |           |
   | Food          |               |           |
   | Hobby         |               |           |
   | Job           |               |           |
   | Nationality   |               |           |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

2. Let's start with the Beverage category. We know there are 2 different beverages: hot-chocolate and soy-milk. Since we have 2 rows, we can place one beverage in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place hot-chocolate in the first row (1) and soy-milk in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          |               |           |
   | Hobby         |               |           |
   | Job           |               |           |
   | Nationality   |               |           |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

3. Now let's place the Food items. We know there are 2 different foods: lettuce and pomegranate. Since we have 2 rows, we can place one food in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's place lettuce in the first row (1) and pomegranate in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         |               |           |
   | Job           |               |           |
   | Nationality   |               |           |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

4. Next, let's place the Hobby items. We know there are 2 different hobbies: puzzles and rock-climbing. Since we have 2 rows, we can place one hobby in the first row and the other in the second row. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk, we know that rock-climbing cannot be in the same row as soy-milk (2). So, let's place rock-climbing in the first row (1) and puzzles in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
   | Job           |               |           |
   | Nationality   |               |           |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

5. Now let's place the Job items. We know there are 2 different jobs: dancer and teacher. Since the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the dancer, the dancer cannot be in the same row as the taxi driver. Since the taxi driver is in the second row (2), the dancer must be in the first row (1). Let's place the dancer in the first row (1) and the teacher in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Dancer        | Teacher   |
   | Nationality   |               |           |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

6. Next, let's place the Nationality items. We know there are 2 different nationalities: argentine and egyptian. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the argentine, the argentine cannot be in the second row (2). Let's place the argentine in the first row (1) and the egyptian in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Dancer        | Teacher   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine     | Egyptian  |
   | Sport         |               |           |
   | Transport     |               |           |

7. Now let's place the Sport items. We know there are 2 different sports: climbing and ice-hockey. Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in the first row (1). Let's place the person who's sport is ice-hockey in the second row (2) and the person who's sport is climbing in the first row (1).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Dancer        | Teacher   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine     | Egyptian  |
   | Sport         | Climbing      | Ice-hockey |
   | Transport     |               |           |

8. Finally, let's place the Transport items. Since the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person eating lettuce and on the left or right of the argentine, the person driving the scooter cannot be in the second row (2) and cannot be on the right of the argentine (1). So, the person driving the scooter must be in the first row (1) and the taxi driver must be in the second row (2). Let's place the scooter in the first row (1) and the taxi in the second row (2).

   |               |       1       |     2     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
   | Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
   | Job           | Dancer        | Teacher   |
   | Nationality   | Argentine     | Egyptian  |
   | Sport         | Climbing      | Ice-hockey |
   | Transport     | Scooter       | Taxi      |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |       1       |     2     |
| Beverage      | Hot-chocolate | Soy-milk  |
| Food          | Lettuce       | Pomegranate|
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing  | Puzzles   |
| Job           | Dancer        | Teacher   |
| Nationality   | Argentine     | Egyptian  |
| Sport         | Climbing      | Ice-hockey |
| Transport     | Scooter       | Taxi      |

Lv3-7x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different favorite beverages, so we can fill the first row with two different beverages. Let's say Almond-Milk in the first column and Juice in the second column.

2. Similarly, we know that there are two different types of food, so we can fill the second row with two different foods. Let's say Apricot in the first column and Strawberry in the second column.

3. Now, we know that there are two different hobbies. Since the person who plays card-games is on the right of the person eating strawberry, we can place Card-Games in the third column to the right of Strawberry. The remaining hobby, Rock-Climbing, goes in the fourth column.

4. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the trike. Since the first column is already filled with a beverage, the tram driver must be in the second row (Food). The trike driver must be in the sixth row (Transport). So, we can place Tram in the third column (Hobby) and Trike in the fifth column (Music-Genre).

5. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the fourth column is already filled with Rock-Climbing, the goldfish owner must be in the fifth column (Music-Genre). The salsa fan must be in the second column (Food). So, we can place Goldfish in the sixth column (Sport) and Salsa in the first column (Beverage).

6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person eating strawberry. Since we've already placed Card-Games in the third column, the person eating strawberry must be in the first column (Beverage).

7. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since we've already placed Trike in the fifth column (Music-Genre), the person playing water-polo must be in the sixth column (Sport).

8. The only remaining options for the person playing water-polo are the first row (Beverage) and the fourth row (Hobby). Since the first row is already filled, the person playing water-polo must be in the fourth row (Hobby).

9. Now, the only remaining option for the person driving the tram is the second row (Food). So, we can place Cycling in the first row (Beverage) and Water-Polo in the fourth row (Hobby).

10. The only remaining option for the person driving the trike is the sixth row (Sport). So, we can place Jazz in the second column (Food), Trike in the fifth column (Music-Genre), and Hedgehog in the sixth column (Pet).

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Beverage   | Almond-Milk | Juice      |
| Food       | Apricot    | Strawberry |
| Hobby      | Card-Games  | Rock-Climbing|

Lv3-7x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different people for each category, we can fill in the table with 2 rows for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the rabbit owner is in the first column (Column 1). So, the pet in Column 2 is the pony.

3. From rule 3, the person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the subway. Since we know the pet in Column 2 is the pony, we can place soy-milk in Row 2, Column 2. Now, the beverage in Column 1 is milk.

4. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is traveling is the person eating peas. Since the pet in Column 1 is the rabbit, the food in Row 1, Column 1 must be peas. Now, the food in Row 2, Column 1 can be apricot.

5. From rule 5, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we know the pet in Column 1 is the rabbit and the food in Row 1, Column 1 is peas, the hobby in Row 1, Column 2 must be cooking. So, the transport in Row 1, Column 2 is jet-ski. Now, the hobby in Row 2, Column 2 can be traveling.

6. From rule 6, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit owner is in Column 1, the person watching thriller movies can be in either Column 1 or Column 2. However, from rule 2, the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since we have already placed the pet, beverage, food, hobby, and transport in Column 1, the only option left for Column 2 is the thriller movie-genre. So, the person watching thriller movies is in Column 2.

7. From rule 2, the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since we have already placed the pet, beverage, food, hobby, transport, and movie-genre in Column 1, the only option left for Column 1 is the soccer sport.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```
#############
| Beverage   | milk | soy-milk |
| Food       | apricot | peas |
| Hobby      | cooking | traveling |

The remaining sport and hobby in Row 2 can be filled with any two different sports and hobbies that the people don't have yet."
Lv3-7x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different beverages, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, sports, and means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. Since there are two different beverages, let's assign Cola to 1 and Iced-Tea to 2.

3. From point 3, we know that the Brazilian is the person drinking Iced-Tea, so Brazilian is assigned to 2.

4. Since the person drinking Cola plays Handball (point 4), and there are two different sports, let's assign Handball to 4 and the other sport to 5.

5. From point 5, we know that the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the firefighter. Since there are two different means of transport, let's assign Helicopter to 6 and Skateboard to 3. So, the firefighter is assigned to 6.

6. Now, let's assign the jobs. Since there are two different jobs, let's assign Firefighter to 6 and Videographer to 5.

7. From point 2, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking Cola. Since the firefighter (6) is the one drinking Cola, the sports movie watcher is either 1 or 4. But the sports movie genre is different from the documentary genre (point 2), so the sports movie watcher can't be the one watching documentaries (1). So, the sports movie watcher is 4.

8. From point 2, we also know that the person watching documentaries is on the right of the person drinking Cola. So, the person watching documentaries is 1.

9. From point 2, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking Cola. So, the person watching sports movies is 4.

10. Now, let's assign the movie-genres. Since there are two different movie-genres, let's assign Documentary to 1 and Sports to 4.

11. From point 2, we know that the person preferring Pop is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the videographer is 5, the person preferring Pop can be either 2 or 6. But the person preferring Pop can't be the one preferring Indie (point 2), so the person preferring Pop is 6.

12. From point 2, we know that the person preferring Indie is on the other side of the videographer. So, the person preferring Indie is 2.

13. Now, let's assign the music-genres. Since there are two different music-genres, let's assign Indie to 2 and Pop to 6.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Cola         | Iced-Tea    |

Lv3-7x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two nationalities, the person driving the van must be Pakistani (P5).

2. Since the Pakistani is on the right side of the skateboard driver (P4), the skateboard driver must be Indian (I1).

3. Since the skateboard driver is the security-guard (J2), the doctor (J1) must be on the other side, which means he is not I1 or I2. So, the doctor must be the person eating avocado (F1).

4. Now, we know the doctor is not I1, so he must be I2. This means I1 is eating plum (F3).

5. Since the person watching western movies (M2) is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (S3), the rower cannot be I1 or I2. So, the rower must be P4.

6. Now, we know the rower is P4, so the person watching western movies (M2) must be on the left of P4, which means M2 is I3.

7. Since the fan of techno (M3) is on the left of P5, M3 must be I1 or I2. But since I1 is already assigned, M3 must be I2.

8. Since the person eating plum (F3) is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard (I1), F3 can be either I1 or I2. But since I1 is already assigned, F3 must be I2.

9. Now, the only remaining food, avocado (F1), must be assigned to I1.

10. Since the remaining music-genre, R&B (M1), is the only genre left, it must be assigned to I1.

11. Since the remaining movie-genre, animation (M1), is the only genre left, it must be assigned to I1.

12. Since the remaining job, doctor (J1), is the only job left, it must be assigned to I1.

13. Since the remaining sport, basketball (S1), is the only sport left, it must be assigned to I1.

14. Since the remaining transport, van (T2), is the only transport left, it must be assigned to P5.

15. Since the remaining food, plum (F3), is already assigned to I2, the remaining food, avocado (F2), must be assigned to I2.

16. Since the remaining music-genre, techno (M3), is already assigned to I2, the remaining music-genre, R&B (M4), must be assigned to I2.

17. Since the remaining movie-genre, western (M4), is already assigned to I3, the remaining movie-genre, animation (M3), must be assigned to I3.

18. Since the remaining job, security-guard (J2), is already assigned to I1, the remaining job, doctor (J3), must be assigned to I3.

19. Since the remaining sport, rowing (S2), is already assigned to P4, the remaining sport, basketball (S3), must be assigned to I3.

20. Since the remaining transport, skateboard (T1), is already assigned to I1, the remaining transport, car (T3), must be assigned to I3.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |       1        |     2     |     3     |
| Food          | Avocado       | Plum      | Avocado  |

Lv3-7x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different favorite beverages, so let's label them as A (iced-tea) and B (juice).

2. Similarly, for food, we have K (kale) and O (orange).

3. For jobs, we have L (lawyer) and A (analyst).

4. Movie-genres are D (disaster) and S (superhero).

5. Pets are C (cat) and D (dog).

6. Sports are C (cricket) and S (surfing).

7. Transport is T (trike) and S (snowmobile).

Now let's apply the given conditions:

1. The owner of the dog is either on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Let's assume the dog owner is drinking A (iced-tea). So, the person drinking B (juice) must have a dog.

2. The person eating orange is the owner of the cat. So, the person eating K (kale) must have a cat.

3. The person watching superhero movies is the lawyer. Since we know the lawyer is not drinking juice (from point 1), the lawyer must be eating K (kale) or T (taking transport). Let's assume the lawyer is eating K (kale).

4. The person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since the dog owner is drinking A (iced-tea), the person driving the trike must be on the right of the dog owner. But the lawyer is eating K (kale) and cannot drive the trike (from point 3), so the person driving the trike must be the one who prefers surfing (S).

5. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person driving the trike is surfing, the person playing cricket must be on the right of the person driving the trike. But the person driving the trike is on the right of the dog owner (from point 4), so the person playing cricket must be on the left of the dog owner.

6. The analyst is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the dog owner is drinking iced-tea and the lawyer is not (from point 3), the analyst must be on the other side of the dog owner. But the analyst cannot be on the left of the person playing cricket (from point 5), so the analyst must be on the right of the dog owner.

Now we have some placements:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A       | B         |
| Food          | K       | O         |
| Job           | L       | A         |
| Movie-Genre   | D       | S         |
| Pet           | C       | D         |
| Sport         | C       | S         |
| Transport     | T       | S         |

The analyst (A) is on the right of the dog owner (A), and the person playing cricket (C) is on the left of the dog owner (A). But we don't know the exact positions of the analyst and the cricket player. Let's assume the analyst is on the right of the dog owner (A) and the cricket player is on the left of the dog owner (A).

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A       | B         |
| Food          | K       | O         |
| Job           | L       | A         |
| Movie-Genre   | D       | S         |
| Pet           | C       | D         |
| Sport         | C       | S         |
| Transport     | T       | S         |

Now, the only remaining position for the person eating orange (O) is the one who is watching disaster movies (D).

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | A       | B         |
| Food          | K       | O         |
| Job           | L       | A         |
| Movie-Genre   | D       | S         |
| Pet           | C       | D         |
| Sport         | C       | S         |
| Transport     | T       | S         |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-7x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two people, so we can fill in the table with two rows.

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          |         |         |
| Hobby         |         |         |
| Job           |         |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

2. From point 1, we know there are two types of food, so we can fill in the food column:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         |         |         |
| Job           |         |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

3. From point 5, the fan of disco (Orange) is Person 1, so we can fill in the Music-Genre column:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         |         |         |
| Job           |         |         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

4. From point 4, the librarian is on the left of the person eating papaya. Since we already know the music genre of Person 1, we can deduce that Person 2 must be the librarian:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         |         |         |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

5. From point 1, we know there are two different hobbies, so we can fill in the Hobby column:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Drawing |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

6. From point 3, the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we already know the hobbies and the food of both people, we can't determine the exact position of the quad-bike driver yet. Let's fill in the Sport column with the available options:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Drawing |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           |         |         |
| Sport         | Biathlon| Parkour |
| Transport     |         |         |

7. From point 2, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we already know the hobbies of both people, we can deduce that Person 1 must have a chinchilla:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Drawing |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           | Chinchilla|         |
| Sport         | Biathlon| Parkour |
| Transport     |         |         |

8. From point 6, the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we know the pets and the hobbies of both people, we can deduce that Person 2 must be driving the quad-bike. Let's fill in the Transport column:

|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Drawing |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           | Chinchilla|         |
| Sport         | Biathlon| Parkour |
| Transport     | Quad-bike| Train   |

Now we have filled in the table with all the given information. However, we still don't know the exact position of the quad-bike driver (Person 2) and the train user (Person 1). Since we don't have enough information to determine their exact positions, we can't fill in the table completely.

The final solution table is:

#############
|               | Person 1 | Person 2 |
| Food          | Orange  | Papaya  |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Drawing |
| Job           | Librarian|         |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   |         |
| Pet           | Chinchilla|         |

Lv3-7x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the electrician is on the far right and the rock-climber is also on the far right, they must be in the same column. Let's place the electrician in the rightmost column (Column 2) and the rock-climber in the same column.

2. The owner of the pony is the electrician, so the pony must be in Column 2.

3. Since the pony is in Column 2, we know that the cat must be in Column 1 (as there are only two pets).

4. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the rock-climber is in Column 2, the scooter must be in Column 1.

5. The person eating carrot is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the pony (which we know is in Column 2) is not a food, the carrot must be in Column 1. So, the fan of funk must be in Column 2.

6. We know the jobs are electrician and librarian, and the electrician is in Column 2. So, the librarian must be in Column 1.

7. The remaining options for Column 1 are hobby (video-games), job (librarian), food (cucumber), and sport (golf). Since the librarian is already in Column 1, the hobby must be video-games. The sport must be golf as it's the only sport left, and it can't be on the right of the fan of funk (Column 2) because the carrot eater is there. So, the sport is golf in Column 1.

8. The remaining options for Column 1 are food (cucumber) and transport (jet-ski). Since the librarian is in Column 1, the food must be cucumber. The transport must be jet-ski as it's the only transport left, and it can't be on the left of the person who drives the scooter (Column 2) because of condition 4. So, the transport is jet-ski in Column 1.

9. The remaining options for Column 2 are hobby (rock-climbing), job (electrician), music-genre (gospel), sport (climbing), and transport (scooter). Since the electrician is already in Column 2, the hobby must be rock-climbing. The music-genre must be gospel as it's the only genre left. The sport must be climbing as it's the only sport left, and it can't be on the left of the scooter driver (Column 1) because of condition 4. So, the sport is climbing in Column 2. The transport must be scooter as it's the only transport left.

Here is the final solution table:
