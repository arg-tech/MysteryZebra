17. British (Br): Nx, Fx (from 20)
   - Since Br is on the left of Spinach (from 20), Br can't be N7 (since Spinach is N5). So Br can be N1, N2, N4, N6, or N7.
   - Since Br is on the left of Australian (from 29), Br can't be N7 (since Australian is not yet placed). So Br can't be N7.
   - Now Br can be placed as N2 (since Br is on the left of Spinach, and Spinach is F5).

18. Australian (Au): Nx, Fx (from 29)
   - Since Au is on the left or right of Spinach (from 29), and Spinach is F5, Au can't be N1 (since Spinach is on the left of Australian). So Au can be N2, N3, N4, N6, or N7.
   - Since Au is not yet placed, we can't place Au yet.

19. Canadian (Ca): Nx, Fx (from 28)
   - Since Ca drinks Iced-Tea (from 28), Ca can be N1, N2, N4, N5, or N7.
   - Since Ca is not yet placed, we can't place Ca yet.

20. Boat (Bo): Tx, Nx (from 27)
   - Since Bo is on the right of Drama (from 27), Bo can't be T1 (since Drama is M1). So Bo can be T2, T3, T5, T6, or T7.
   - Since Bo is not yet placed, we can't place Bo yet.

21. Drama (Dr): Mx, Nx (from 27)
   - Since Dr is on the right of Boat (from 27), Dr can't be M1 (since Boat is T1). So Dr can be M2, M3, M4, M5, or M6.
   - Since Dr is not yet placed, we can't place Dr yet.

22. Helicopter (He): Tx, Nx (from not given)
   - Since He is on the right of Mirinda (from 31), He can't be T1 (since Mirinda is S3). So He can be T2, T3, T5, T6, or T7.
   - Since He is not yet placed, we can't place He yet.

23. Pakistani (Pk): Nx, Fx (from 23)
   - Since Pk is on the left of Watermelon (from 23), Pk can't be N7 (since Watermelon is F7). So Pk can be N1, N2, N3, N4, or N6.
   - Since Pk is not yet placed, we can't place Pk yet.

24. Train (Tr): Tx, Nx (from 24)
   - Since Tr is the French (from 24), Tr is N4 (since the French is N4).
   - Since Tr is not yet placed, we can't place Tr yet.

25. Thriller (Th): Mx, Nx (from 25)
   - Since Th is on the right of Disaster (from 25), Th can't be M1 (since Disaster is M2). So Th can be M3, M4, M5, M6, or M7.
   - Since Th is not yet placed, we can't place Th yet.

26. Disaster (Dis): Mx, Nx (from 25)
   - Since Dis is on the left of Thriller (from 25), Dis can't be M7 (since Thriller is M6). So Dis can be M1, M2, M3, M4, or M5.
   - Since Dis is not yet placed, we can't place Dis yet.

Now we have placed most of the people, but we still have some unplaced people: Australian, Canadian, Boat, Drama, Helicopter, Pakistani, Train, Thriller, and Disaster. We can't place them yet because of the dependencies on other people that are not yet placed.

We can continue solving the puzzle by finding more relationships between the unplaced people and the already placed people, and then using those relationships to place more people. However, the puzzle as it stands has a circular dependency between some of the unplaced people, which makes it impossible to solve with the given information.

Final solution table:

  |               |      1       |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |     6      |     7      |
| Beverage      | Cola         | Mirinda     | Soy-Milk  | Lemonade    | Iced-Tea    | Sprite     |            |
| Food          | Broccoli     | Zucchini    | Radish    | Watermelon   | Spinach     | Potato     | Grapefruit  |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster     | Scientific  | Epic      | Thriller    | Drama       | Animation   | Sports      |
| Nationality   | British      | Canadian    | Japanese   | Pakistani    | Australian   |            | French      |
| Sport         | Swimming     | Golf       | Volleyball | Skateboarding | Basketball   | Skiing      | Snowboarding |

The table is incomplete because some people are still unplaced: Australian, Pakistani, Canadian, Boat, Drama, Helicopter, Train, Thriller, and Disaster. The puzzle has a circular dependency between some of the unplaced people, which makes it impossible to solve with the given information."
Lv3-6x7-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's solve it step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let B1, B2, ..., B7 be the beverages, J1, J2, ..., J7 be the jobs, M1, M2, ..., M7 be the movie genres, N1, N2, ..., N7 be the nationalities, S1, S2, ..., S7 be the sports, and T1, T2, ..., T7 be the transports.

2. Let's start with the transport. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - T7 is the taxi (clue 2)
   - T6 is the bus (clue 3)
   - T1 is the airplane (clue 13)
   - T5 is the subway (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - T4 is the car (since it's not listed elsewhere and must be to the left of the bus, which is T6)
   - T3 is the jet-ski (since it's not listed elsewhere and must be to the left of the airplane, which is T1)
   - T2 is the quad-bike (from clue 1, we know it's either T1 or T2, and it can't be T1 because the airplane is on the far right, so it must be T2)

3. Now let's work on the nationalities. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - N2 is British (clue 3)
   - N6 is German (clue 2)
   - N5 is Egyptian (clue 5)
   - N3 is Australian (clue 26)
   - N7 is Malaysian (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - N4 is Brazilian (from clue 11, we know it's either N4 or N7, and it can't be N7 because the Malaysian is already assigned, so it must be N4)
   - N1 is Japanese (from clue 4, we know it's either N1 or N3, and it can't be N3 because the Australian is already assigned, so it must be N1)

4. Let's work on the jobs. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - J6 is the mechanic (since it's not listed elsewhere and must be to the left of the bus, which is J6)
   - J5 is the paramedic (from clue 10, we know it's either J5 or J7, and it can't be J7 because the journalist is already assigned, so it must be J5)
   - J7 is the journalist (from clue 22, we know it's either J7 or J5, and it can't be J5 because the paramedic is already assigned, so it must be J7)
   - J4 is the architect (from clue 19, we know it's either J4 or J6, and it can't be J6 because the mechanic is already assigned, so it must be J4)
   - J3 is the dressmaker (from clue 21, we know it's either J3 or J7, and it can't be J7 because the journalist is already assigned, so it must be J3)
   - J2 is the designer (from clue 28, we know it's either J2 or J6, and it can't be J6 because the mechanic is already assigned, so it must be J2)
   - J1 is the freelancer (since it's not listed elsewhere and must be to the left of the milk drinker, who is J1 from clue 29)

5. Let's work on the sports. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - S1 is cricket (from clue 16, we know it's either S1 or S4, and it can't be S4 because the designer is already assigned, so it must be S1)
   - S2 is ice-hockey (from clue 12, we know it's either S2 or S5, and it can't be S5 because the sport for S5 is not yet determined, so it must be S2)
   - S3 is lacrosse (from clue 1, we know it's either S3 or S2, and it can't be S2 because the quad-bike is already assigned, so it must be S3)
   - S4 is rugby (from clue 23, we know it's either S4 or S6, and it can't be S6 because the sport for S6 is not yet determined, so it must be S4)
   - S5 is surfing (from clue 20, we know it's either S5 or S3, and it can't be S3 because the sport for S3 is already determined, so it must be S5)
   - S6 is tennis (from clue 14, we know it's either S6 or S4, and it can't be S4 because the sport for S4 is already determined, and it must be to the left of the bus, which is S6)
   - S7 is either rowing or soccer (since it's not listed elsewhere)

6. Let's work on the movie genres. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - M1 is action (from clue 8, we know it's either M1 or M3, and it can't be M3 because the comedy is already assigned to be in the middle, so it must be M1)
   - M2 is comedy (from clue 15, we know it's the middle one)
   - M3 is either disaster or time-travel (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - M4 is mystery (from clue 25, we know it's the one on the far right)
   - M5 is either sports or epic (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - M6 is either time-travel or disaster (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - M7 is either epic or disaster (since it's not listed elsewhere)

7. Let's work on the beverages. From the clues, we can deduce the following:
   - B1 is 7up (from clue 17, we know it's either B1 or B6, and it can't be B6 because the sport for S6 is already determined, so it must be B1)
   - B2 is almond-milk (from clue 12, we know it's either B2 or B5, and it can't be B5 because the sport for S5 is already determined, so it must be B2)
   - B3 is fanta (from clue 6, we know it's either B3 or B5, and it can't be B5 because the sport for S5 is not yet determined, so it must be B3)
   - B4 is milk (from clue 4, we know it's either B4 or B1, and it can't be B1 because the Australian is already assigned, so it must be B4)
   - B5 is either hot-chocolate or mirinda (since it's not listed elsewhere)
   - B6 is soy-milk (since it's not listed elsewhere and must be to the right of the Japanese, who is B1 from clue 4)
   - B7 is either rowing or soccer (since it's not listed elsewhere)

8. Now we have enough information to fill in the table. However, there are still some ambiguities with the sports and movie genres (S5, S7, M5, M6, M7). To solve these, we would need additional clues or assumptions.

Here is the final solution table with the information we have:

The remaining ambiguities (S5, S7, M5, M6, M7) can be resolved with additional clues or assumptions."
Lv3-6x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with nationalities. Since the Mexican is in the middle, we can place them in the 4th position. The Argentine is on the left of the traveler, so they go in the 3rd position. The rest of the nationalities can be placed based on the clues given.

   | Nationality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |------------|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
   |           |   |   | ARG | MEX |   |   |   |

2. The Egyptian is watching adventure movies, so they are in the 3rd row. Since the Egyptian is not in the 3rd column (as the Mexican is there), they must be in the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th, or 6th column. However, the Egyptian cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the hedgehog owner is there), the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there), or the 6th column (as the pony owner is there). So, the Egyptian must be in the 4th column.

   | Nationality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |------------|---|---| ARG | MEX |   |   |   |
   |           |   | EGY |   |   |   |   |   |

3. The fan of reggae owns a turtle, and the turtle is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the Egyptian is watching adventure movies and is not the comedy watcher, the comedy watcher must be in the 2nd row. So, the turtle owner (reggae fan) is in the 1st row.

   | Nationality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
   |------------|---|---| ARG | MEX |   |   |   |
   | Turtle     | REG |   |   |   |   |   |   |
   | Comedy    |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |

4. The fan of reggae cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the hedgehog owner is there), the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there), or the 6th column (as the pony owner is there). So, the reggae fan must be in the 3rd, 4th, or 7th column. However, the reggae fan cannot be in the 7th column (as the Mexican is there), so the reggae fan must be in the 3rd or 4th column. Since the reggae fan is not the Egyptian (who is in the 4th column), the reggae fan must be in the 3rd column.

   | Nationality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |

5. The fan of d&b is the Pakistani, and the hedgehog owner is on the right of the fan of d&b. The hedgehog owner cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the Egyptian is there), the 4th column (as the reggae fan is there), or the 7th column (as the Mexican is there). So, the hedgehog owner must be in the 3rd, 5th, or 6th column. However, the hedgehog owner cannot be in the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there), so the hedgehog owner must be in the 3rd, 6th, or 7th column. Since the hedgehog owner is not the Egyptian (who is in the 3rd row), the hedgehog owner must be in the 6th or 7th row. But the hedgehog owner cannot be in the 7th row (as the Mexican is there), so the hedgehog owner must be in the 6th row.

The fan of d&b (Pakistani) cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the Egyptian is there), the 4th column (as the reggae fan is there), or the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there). So, the Pakistani must be in the 3rd, 6th, or 7th column. However, the Pakistani cannot be in the 3rd column (as the reggae fan is there), so the Pakistani must be in the 6th or 7th column. Since the Pakistani is not the Egyptian (who is in the 3rd row), the Pakistani must be in the 6th column.

7. The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the japanese. The japanese is the fan of blues, and the fan of blues cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the Egyptian is there), the 4th column (as the reggae fan is there), or the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there). So, the japanese must be in the 3rd, 6th, or 7th column. However, the japanese cannot be in the 3rd column (as the reggae fan is there), so the japanese must be in the 6th or 7th column. Since the japanese is not the Egyptian (who is in the 3rd row), the japanese must be in the 7th column.

The person eating corn cannot be in the 1st column (as the Mexican is there), the 2nd column (as the Egyptian is there), the 4th column (as the reggae fan is there), or the 5th column (as the goldfish owner is there). So, the person eating corn must be in the 3rd, 6th, or 7th column. However, the person eating corn cannot be in the 3rd column (as the reggae fan is there), so the person eating corn must be in the 6th or 7th column.

Lv3-6x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category and person:

|               |      1      |      2       |      3      |      4      |     5     |     6      |      7      |
| Beverage      | A          | B           | C           | D           | E         | F          | G           |

Now, let's solve the puzzle using the given clues:

1. XC is French, and P is camping. So, XC < P
2. S is board-games. If S is on the left of 7up (A), then A < S. If S is on the right of 7up, then S < A. Let's assume A < S for now.
3. T is traveling. T = F (Fanta)
4. Q is martial-arts. Q < XK (snowmobile) and P < Q (from clue 1)
5. If XB is Polish, then XB < Q or Q > XB. Let's assume XB < Q for now.
6. XK = S (from clue 3)
7. R is board-games. R = F (from clue 6)
8. XI is airplane. XI is on the left or right of H (cauliflower). Let's assume XI < H for now.
9. XD is nigerian. XD < B (sprite) or B < XD. Let's assume B < XD for now.
10. XJ is Australian. XJ = bus
11. XL is ship. L = puzzles
12. XG is Brazilian. XG > J (bus) and XG < K (pomegranate)
13. XC < XA (from clue 1) and XA < XC (from clue 12)
14. XD < XA (from clue 9)
15. XH is on the far right
16. Q is between C (tea) and T (singing)
17. If XB is Polish, then Q > XB (from clue 5). So, XB > Q. Therefore, Q < XB.
18. XJ = XA (from clue 9)
19. V is on the far left
20. Z is in the middle
21. XD is on the left or right of XM (skateboard)
22. XI is on the far left or far right
23. L = M (grapes) and M = fishing
24. XI is on the left or right of N (kiwi)
25. M is on the left of Z (sports movies)
26. W is between Z and N (lime)
27. K is on the left or right of L (ship)
28. XI is between XJ (bus) and XW (adventure movies)
29. A is on the far left
30. XC is on the left or right of XJ (from clue 30)
31. XE is on the left of XF (lemonade)

Now, let's arrange the table with the final solution:

|               |      1      |      2       |      3      |      4      |     5     |     6      |      7      |
| Beverage      | A          | B           | C           | D           | E         | F          | G           |
| Food          | H          | I           | J           | K           | L         | M          | N           |
| Hobby         | O          | P           | Q           | R           | S         | T          | U           |
| Movie-Genre   | V          | W           | X           | Y           | Z         | AA         | BB          |

| Transport     | airplane   | bus         | jet-ski     | ship        | skateboard | snowmobile | van         |

Note that some assumptions were made during the solution process, and the final solution might not be unique due to the ambiguity in some clues (e.g., ""on the left or right"").

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv3-6x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the variables
We have 7 people, 7 hobbies, 7 jobs, 7 movie genres, 7 music genres, 7 pets, and 7 means of transport. Let's denote the people with numbers 1 to 7, and use the same numbers for their corresponding hobbies, jobs, movie genres, music genres, pets, and means of transport.

Step 2: Identify the relationships
From the given clues, we can deduce various relationships between the variables. For example, we know that person 3 is an engineer (job), person 4 watches animation movies (movie-genre), and person 5 owns a guinea-pig (pet). We can write these relationships as:

3-Engineer, 4-Animation, 5-Guinea-pig

We can continue this process for all the given clues.

Step 3: Solve the relationships
Now, we can start solving the relationships using the given clues. For example, from clue 1, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig (5) is to the right of the fan of salsa (let's say 6). This means that 5 > 6. From clue 26, we know that the fan of salsa (6) is on the left of the teacher (let's say 8). This means that 6 < 8. So, we have 5 > 6 and 6 < 8, which means 5 = 8 (since the numbers are consecutive and only 7 people). This means that the teacher is also the owner of the guinea-pig.

We can continue this process for all the given clues to fill in the relationships table.

Step 4: Arrange the variables
Once we have solved all the relationships, we can arrange the variables (people) according to the solved relationships. For example, from clue 14, we know that the person watching superhero movies (let's say 6) is on the far left or far right. Since the teacher (8) is already assigned to superhero movies, we can place 8 at the far left or far right. Let's place 8 at the far left for now.

We can continue this process for all the variables to arrange them in the final solution table.

Step 5: Final solution
Here is the final solution table:

|               |      1       |      2       |      3      |      4      |       5        |     6     |      7      |
| Hobby         | Teacher      | Board-games  | Engineer    | Animation   | Guinea-pig    | Superhero | Camping     |
| Job           | Teacher      | Dressmaker    | Engineer    | Lawyer      | Electrician   | Security-guard| Photographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation    | Drama        | Disaster    | Documentary | Martial-arts  | Spy        | Superhero    |
| Music-Genre   | Classical    | Jazz         | Metal       | Reggae      | Salsa         | D&B        | Soul         |
| Pet           | Guinea-pig   | Bird         | Chinchilla   | Horse       | Turtle        | Pony       | Hedgehog     |
| Transport     | Train        | Bike         | Helicopter  | Jet-ski     | Skateboard    | Trike       | Scooter      |

Note that the final arrangement of the variables (people) is not unique due to the ""far left"" and ""far right"" clues. The above arrangement is one possible solution.
