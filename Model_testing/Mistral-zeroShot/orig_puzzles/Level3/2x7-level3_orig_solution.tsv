Lv3-2x7-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rat (from point 1), so they can't be in the first column. Let's place them in the second column.

2. The owner of the frog is the person watching western movies (from point 2), so they must be in the sixth column.

3. The person watching mystery movies can't be in the first or seventh column (from point 3), so they can be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's place them in the second column for now.

4. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog (from point 7), so the owner of the mouse must be in the first, second, or third column. Since the mystery movie watcher is in the second column, the owner of the mouse can't be there, so they must be in the first column.

5. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the owner of the lizard (from point 5), and the owner of the lizard can't be in the sixth column (since the frog owner is there), so the lizard owner can be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Let's place them in the third column for now. This means the crime movie watcher is in the fourth column.

6. The person watching epic movies is on the left of the owner of the lizard (from point 6), so they can be in the first, second, or fifth column. Since the mystery movie watcher is in the second column and the lizard owner is in the third column, the epic movie watcher can't be in the second column. Let's place them in the fifth column.

7. The owner of the snake is on the left or right of the owner of the goat (from point 8), and the goat owner is the person watching family movies (from point 10). Since the family movie watcher can't be in the first or seventh column (from point 10), the goat owner can be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth column. Let's place them in the fourth column for now. This means the snake owner is in the fifth or sixth column. Since the epic movie watcher is in the fifth column, the snake owner can't be in the fifth column. So, the snake owner is in the sixth column.

8. The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person watching epic movies (from point 11), so they can be in the first, second, or fifth column. Since the mystery movie watcher is in the second column, the goldfish owner can't be there. Let's place them in the fifth column. This means the person watching epic movies is in the sixth column.

9. The person watching family movies is between the owner of the goldfish and the person watching epic movies (from point 11), so they must be in the fourth column. This confirms our placement of the goat owner in the fourth column.

10. The owner of the rat is on the right of the owner of the mouse (from point 12), so they can be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column. Since the mouse owner is in the first column and the goat owner is in the fourth column, the rat owner can't be in the fourth column. Let's place them in the fifth column. This means the owner of the lizard is in the third column.

11. Now we have filled all the columns with pets and movie watchers except for the first column. The only remaining option for the first column is the disaster movie watcher.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |   2    |   3   |    4    |   5   |    6     |    7    |

Lv3-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Russian is in the middle, we know that positions 2, 4, and 6 are occupied by other nationalities. So, the nationalities in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 8 are left.

2. The Mexican is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk, so it can't be in position 1 (as there's no one on its left). Therefore, the Mexican is in position 3, 5, or 7.

3. The Polish is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk, so the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 1, 3, or 7. So, the almond-milk drinker is in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. But since the Russian is in position 5, the almond-milk drinker can't be there. So, the almond-milk drinker is in position 2, 4, or 6.

4. The person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right, so it can't be in position 2, 4, or 6 (as the almond-milk drinker and the Russian are there). So, the lemonade drinker is in position 1, 3, or 7.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, so it can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7 (as the Mexican, almond-milk drinker, Russian, and lemonade drinker are there). So, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 2, 4, or 6.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is between the polish and the colombian. Since the Polish can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7, the Colombian can't be in position 1, 3, or 7 either. So, the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Therefore, the iced-tea drinker is in position 2, 4, or 6.

7. The chinese is on the right of the colombian, so the colombian can't be in position 7. So, the colombian is in position 1, 3, or 5.

8. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, the nigerian can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the nigerian is in position 3, 5, or 6.

9. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the Mexican is in position 3 and can't be the soy-milk drinker (as it's on the left of the 7up drinker), the 7up drinker is in position 1, 5, or 7. But since the Mexican is on the left of the nigerian, the nigerian can't be in position 7. So, the 7up drinker is in position 1 or 5.

10. The Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, so the nigerian can't be in position 1. So, the nigerian is in position 3 or 5. But since the 7up drinker is in position 1, the nigerian can't be in position 5. So, the nigerian is in position 3.

11. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking 7up, so the soy-milk drinker is in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the Mexican is in position 3, the soy-milk drinker can't be in position 3. So, the soy-milk drinker is in position 2 or 6.

12. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, the Mexican can't be in position 3. So, the Mexican is in position 5 or 7. But since the iced-tea drinker is between the polish and the colombian, the colombian can't be in position 5. So, the Mexican is in position 7.

13. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, the nigerian can't be in position 5. So, the nigerian is in position 3.

14. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, the 7up drinker (who is on the left of the soy-milk drinker) must be in position 1.

15. Since the Mexican is on the left or right of the nigerian, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 6.

16. Since the Polish is on the right of the almond-milk drinker, the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 7. So, the almond-milk drinker is in position 2 or 4. But since the Russian is in position 5, the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 4. So, the almond-milk drinker is in position 2.

17. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the far left or far right, the lemonade drinker can't be in position 2, 4, or 6 (as the almond-milk drinker, Russian, and soy-milk drinker are there). So, the lemonade drinker is in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the colombian is in position 1 and the Mexican is in position 7, the lemonade drinker can't be in position 1. So, the lemonade drinker is in position 3.

18. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 2, 4, or 6 (as the almond-milk drinker, Russian, and soy-milk drinker are there). So, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the colombian is in position 1 and the Mexican is in position 7, the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 1. So, the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 5.

19. Since the chinese is on the right of the colombian, the colombian can't be in position 7. So, the colombian is in position 1 or 3. But since the 7up drinker is in position 1, the colombian can't be in position 1. So, the colombian is in position 3.

20. Since the person drinking iced-tea is between the polish and the colombian, the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the iced-tea drinker is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But since the Russian is in position 5, the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 5. So, the iced-tea drinker is in position 2, 3, or 6. But since the almond-milk drinker is in position 2, the iced-tea drinker can't be in position 2. So, the iced-tea drinker is in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

   (C = Chinchilla)

7. The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the ferret owner. Since the ferret owner is in the 3rd position, the rat can be in the 2nd or 4th position. However, the rat cannot be in the 2nd position because the bird is already there. So, the rat goes in the 4th position.

   |    1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |      5      |       6       |     7      |

8. The board-games owner is on the left or right of the video-games owner. Since the video-games owner is not yet determined, we can't place the board-games owner yet.

9. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the drawing owner is in the 6th position, the video-games owner can be in the 5th or 7th position. However, the video-games owner cannot be in the 7th position because the puzzle owner is already there. So, the video-games owner goes in the 5th position.

   |    1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |      5      |       6       |     7      |

    (B = Board-games)

11. The owner of the chinchilla is in the 5th position, so the chinchilla is not the puzzle owner. This means the chinchilla is the card-games owner. Since the card-games owner is the bird owner, the bird is not the chinchilla. So, the bird is the hamster.

    |    1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |      5      |       6       |     7      |

    (H = Hamster, C = Chinchilla)

12. The owner of the rat is in the 4th position, so the rat is not the video-games owner. This means the rat is the board-games owner.

    (R = Board-games)

13. The owner of the snake is in the 6th position, so the snake is not the drawing owner. This means the snake is the reading owner.

    (R = Reading)

14. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the rat is in the 4th position, the ferret can be in the 3rd or 5th position. However, the ferret cannot be in the 5th position because the video-games owner is already there. So, the ferret goes in the 3rd position.

    |    1     |    2    |     3      |      4      |      5      |       6       |     7      |

    (F = Ferret)

15. The owner of the drawing is in the 7th position, so the drawing owner is not the puzzle owner. This means the drawing owner is the rock-climbing owner.

    (D = Rock-climbing)

16. The owner of the puzzle is in the 5th position, so the puzzle owner is not the chinchilla. This means the puzzle owner is the drawing owner. However, this contradicts our previous step where the drawing owner is the rock-climbing owner. This means our initial placement of the rock-climbing owner in the 4th position was incorrect. The rock-climbing owner should be in the 5th position, and the drawing owner should be in the 7th position.

The hobbies and pets are not in the correct order, but the positions of the hobbies and pets that are related to the given conditions are correct. To get the hobbies and pets in the correct order, you would need additional information."
Lv3-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the argentine is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column. Let's put them in position 1.

2. Since the nigerian is either to the left or right of the argentine, the nigerian can only be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 7.

3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the german. Since the argentine is in position 1, the german can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. If the german was in position 2, the juice would have to be in position 3, but then the nigerian couldn't be in position 2 because the juice is to the right of the german. So, the german must be in position 3. This means the juice can only be in positions 4, 5, or 7.

4. The person drinking sprite is on the far right, so they must be in position 7.

5. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the german is in position 3 and sprite is in position 7, the only possible positions for cola and lemonade are 1, 2, 4, and 6. If cola was in position 1, lemonade would have to be in position 2, but then the nigerian couldn't be in position 2 because the juice is to the right of the german. So, cola must be in position 2 and lemonade in position 4.

6. The nigerian is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking 7up. Since lemonade is in position 4 and sprite is in position 7, the nigerian can only be in position 5.

7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the russian. Since the russian can't be in position 3 (because the german is there), they can only be in positions 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But we've already placed the russian in position 4 (as hot-chocolate), so that's correct.

8. The mexican is on the right of the russian, so they can only be in positions 5, 6, or 7. But since the nigerian is in position 5, the mexican can't be in position 5. So, the mexican must be in position 7, and the malaysian must be in position 6.

9. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since juice is in position 4 and the mexican is in position 7, the only possible position for milk is 6.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the fan of r&b is on the left or right of the chef (1), and the fan of r&b cannot be on the far left (5), the chef cannot be on the far left either. So, the chef, r&b, and the person to the right of the chef will occupy positions 2, 3, and 4. Let's assume the chef is in position 3, r&b in position 2, and the person to the right of the chef in position 4.

2. Now, the fan of r&b is to the left of the fan of d&b (3). Since the fan of r&b is in position 2, the fan of d&b must be in position 1.

3. The fan of metal is on the left or right of the police-officer (2), and the police-officer is on the left of the nurse (7). So, the police-officer cannot be on the far left (5), and the nurse cannot be on the far right (11). Therefore, the police-officer and the nurse will occupy positions 5 and 6. Let's assume the police-officer is in position 5 and the nurse in position 6.

4. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the entrepreneur (4). Since the entrepreneur cannot be on the far left (5), the entrepreneur must be in position 7. So, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 4.

5. The entrepreneur is on the far left or far right (5). Since the entrepreneur is in position 7, the far right must be occupied by someone else. So, the freelancer, who is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop (12), must be in position 1.

6. The fan of salsa is on the left of the pilot (10). Since the fan of salsa cannot be on the far left (5), the pilot must be in position 1. So, the fan of salsa must be in position 2.

7. The fan of rock is the project-manager (8). Since the project-manager cannot be on the far right (11), the project-manager must be in position 6.

8. The chef is on the left or right of the freelancer (9). Since the chef is in position 3 and the freelancer is in position 1, the chef must be in position 4 and the freelancer in position 2.

9. The fan of dubstep is on the far right (11). Since the fan of rock is in position 6, the fan of dubstep must be in position 7.

2. From point 1, we know the Japanese is the accountant, so we can place the Japanese as the accountant in the table:

6. From point 5, we know the Indonesian is on the left of the American. Since the Indonesian is already in position 6, the American must be in position 5:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     |         4          |   American  | Firefighter|    7     |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |                    |             |             | Firefighter|
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|                    |             | Indonesian  |          |

7. From point 6, we know the entrepreneur is on the left of the Indonesian (firefighter). Since the entrepreneur must be one of the remaining jobs (accountant, doctor, librarian, software-developer), we can try each one:

   a. If the entrepreneur is the accountant, the accountant would be in position 4, but that would mean the entrepreneur is on the left of the Japanese, which contradicts point 10. So, the entrepreneur cannot be the accountant.

   b. If the entrepreneur is the doctor, the doctor would be in position 4, and the entrepreneur in position 2. This satisfies point 4 and does not contradict any other points. So, the entrepreneur is the doctor, and the doctor is in position 4:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter|    7     |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             | Firefighter|
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |          |

   c. If the entrepreneur is the librarian, the librarian would be in position 7, and the entrepreneur in position 2. This satisfies point 8 and does not contradict any other points. So, the entrepreneur is the librarian, and the librarian is in position 7:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Librarian  |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  | Mexican    |

   d. If the entrepreneur is the software-developer, the software-developer would be in position 5, and the entrepreneur in position 2. This satisfies point 10 and does not contradict any other points. So, the entrepreneur is the software-developer, and the software-developer is in position 5:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer|
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |              |

8. Now we have placed the entrepreneur, so we can place the remaining jobs (accountant, doctor, librarian, firefighter) in the remaining positions (4, 6, and 7) based on the given conditions. We will try each job in each position:

   a. If the accountant is in position 4, the accountant would be to the left of the argentine (since the accountant is already in position 1 and the argentine is to the right of the librarian, who is in position 7). This satisfies point 12. So, the accountant is in position 4:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer| Accountant  |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |             |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |              |            |

   b. If the accountant is in position 6, the accountant would be to the right of the argentine. This contradicts point 12, so the accountant cannot be in position 6.

   c. If the accountant is in position 7, the accountant would be to the right of the argentine. This also contradicts point 12, so the accountant cannot be in position 7.

   d. If the doctor is in position 4, the doctor would be to the left of the librarian, which satisfies point 11. So, the doctor is in position 4:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer| Accountant  | Librarian  |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |             |            |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |              |            | Mexican    |

   e. If the doctor is in position 6, the doctor would be to the right of the librarian. This contradicts point 11, so the doctor cannot be in position 6.

   f. If the doctor is in position 7, the doctor would be to the right of the argentine. This contradicts point 12, so the doctor cannot be in position 7.

   g. If the librarian is in position 4, the librarian would be to the left of the doctor, which satisfies point 11. So, the librarian is in position 4:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer| Accountant  | Librarian  | Argentine |
   | Job           | Accountant| Brazilian | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |             |            |            |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Brazilian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |              |            | Mexican    | Argentine |

   h. If the librarian is in position 6, the librarian would be to the right of the doctor. This contradicts point 11, so the librarian cannot be in position 6.

   i. If the librarian is in position 7, the librarian would be to the right of the argentine. This satisfies point 8, so the librarian is in position 7:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer| Accountant  | Librarian  | Argentine | Brazilian |
   | Job           | Accountant|           | Analyst  |              |             |             |             |             |            |            |          |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Indonesian|  American|              |             |            |              |            | Mexican    | Argentine | Brazilian |

9. Now we have placed the librarian, so we can place the remaining jobs (firefighter, software-developer) in the remaining positions (5 and 6) based on the given conditions. We will try each job in each position:

   a. If the firefighter is in position 5, the firefighter would be to the left of the argentine. This contradicts point 12, so the firefighter cannot be in position 5.

   b. If the firefighter is in position 6, the firefighter would be to the right of the argentine. This satisfies point 12, so the firefighter is in position 6:

   |               |     1     |     2     |     3     | Doctor       |   American  | Firefighter| Software-developer| Accountant  | Librarian  | Argentine | Brazilian |
   | Job           | Accountant|           | Analyst  |              |             | Firefighter |             |             |            |            |          |
   | Nationality   | Japanese  |  Indonesian|  American|              |             | Indonesian  |              |            | Mexican    | Argentine | Brazilian |

   c. If the software-developer is in position 5, the software-developer would be to the left of the argentine. This contradicts point 12, so the software-developer cannot be in position 5.

   d. If the software-developer is in position 6, the software-developer would be to the right of the argentine. This contradicts point 12, so the software-developer cannot be in position 6.

10. Since we have placed all jobs and nationalities, and we have not found a valid position for the software-developer, it seems there is no solution to the puzzle with the given conditions.

Final solution: There is no valid solution to the puzzle with the given conditions."
Lv3-2x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the nationalities and the means of transport, so we can start filling in the table. Let's start with the given information:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            |           |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            |           |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            |           |
| 7            |           |

2. From point 2, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far right, so we can place the jet-ski in the last column (column 7). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            |           |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            |           |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            |           |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

3. From point 1, the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the nigerian (##3), so the nigerian cannot be in the first or last column. Let's place the nigerian in the second column (column 2). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            |           |
| 2            | Nigerian  |
| 3            | Scooter   |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            |           |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

4. From point 3, the australian is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the jet-ski is on the far right, the snowmobile must be on the leftmost side. The only nationality left for the snowmobile is the first one (column 1). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Australian |
| 2            | Nigerian  |
| 3            | Scooter   |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            |           |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

5. From point 5, the australian is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since the australian is on the leftmost side, the bike must be on the rightmost side (column 7). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Australian |
| 2            | Nigerian  |
| 3            | Scooter   |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

6. From point 4, the mexican is the person driving the car. Since the bike is on the rightmost side, the car must be on the leftmost side (column 1). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Mexican   |
| 2            | Nigerian  |
| 3            | Scooter   |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

7. From point 6, the pakistani is between the mexican and the person driving the snowmobile (##2). Since the mexican is on the leftmost side and the snowmobile is on the first column, the pakistani must be in the second column (column 2). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Mexican   |
| 2            | Pakistani |
| 3            | Scooter   |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

8. From point 7, the nigerian is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (##3). Since the pakistani is in the second column, the nigerian cannot be in the first or last column. The only remaining column for the nigerian is the third column (column 3). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Mexican   |
| 2            | Pakistani |
| 3            | Nigerian |
| 4            |           |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

9. From point 8, the british is in the middle. Since the nigerian is in the third column, the british must be in the fourth column (column 4). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Mexican   |
| 2            | Pakistani |
| 3            | Nigerian |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

10. From point 9, the person driving the car is between the thai and the pakistani (##2). Since the pakistani is in the fourth column, the car cannot be in the first or last column. The only remaining column for the car is the second column (column 2). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Mexican   |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

11. From point 10, the thai is on the left of the person driving the car (##1). Since the car is in the second column, the thai must be in the first column (column 1). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            |           |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

12. From point 6, the nigerian is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (##3). Since the thai is in the first column, the ship cannot be in the first or last column. The only remaining column for the ship is the fifth column (column 5). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            | Ship      |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

13. From point 12, the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the ship (point 7). Since the ship is in the fifth column, the bike must be in the sixth column (column 6). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            | Ship      |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

14. From point 13, the only remaining nationality is the turkish. Since the jet-ski is on the far right, the turkish must be driving the roller (since roller and rollerboard are not given, we'll assume roller). Now we have:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            | Ship      |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

15. From point 14, the only remaining transport is the roller. Now we have the final solution:

| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |
| 4            | British  |
| 5            | Ship      |
| 6            | Bike      |
| 7            | Jet-ski   |

So the final solution is:

#############
| Nationality   | Transport |
|--------------|-----------|
| 1            | Thai      |
| 2            | Car       |
| 3            | Pakistani |

Lv3-2x7-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies are collecting, dancing, filmmaking, fishing, reading, video-games, and writing, and the music-genres are blues, d&b, indie, pop, r&b, soul, and trance.

2. Let's assign the hobbies to the columns and music-genres to the rows. We'll use the numbers 1-7 for hobbies and A-G for music-genres.

3. From rule 11, we know that the fan of trance is on the left or right of the fan of soul. Since the fan of trance can't be in the middle (rule 8), it must be in the first or last column. Let's assume it's in the first column (A). So, the fan of trance is hobby 1 (collecting).

4. From rule 9, we know that the fan of r&b is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since filmmaking can't be in the first or last column (rule 8), it must be in the middle column (D). So, the fan of r&b is hobby 4 (reading).

5. From rule 10, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the fan of soul. Since the fan of trance is in the first column (A), the fan of soul can't be in the first or last column. Let's assume it's in the last column (G). So, the person who's hobby is fishing is in the second last column (F).

6. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle column (D).

7. From rule 13, we know that the fan of blues is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking (D) and the person who's hobby is writing. Since the fan of r&b (D) and the person who's hobby is fishing (F) are already placed, the only available hobbies for the fan of blues are dancing, video-games, and reading. Since the fan of blues can't be in the first or last column (rule 8), it must be in the middle column (D). But that's already occupied by the fan of r&b. So, the fan of blues must be in the second last column (F).

8. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b (1) is in the first column, the person who's hobby is dancing can't be in the first or last column. Let's assume it's in the second column (B). So, the person who's hobby is dancing is hobby 2 (collecting).

9. From rule 7, we know that the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in the second column (B), the person who's hobby is video-games is in the third column (C). So, the person who's hobby is video-games is hobby 3 (dancing).

10. From rule 6, we know that the fan of pop is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading (D). Since the person who's hobby is reading is in the fourth column (D), the fan of pop is in the fifth column (E). So, the fan of pop is hobby 5 (writing).

11. From rule 4, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the fan of trance (A). Since the fan of trance is in the first column (A), the person who's hobby is reading is in the second column (B). But that's already occupied by the person who's hobby is dancing. So, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the third column (C). So, the person who's hobby is reading is hobby 3 (dancing). This is a contradiction with rule 8, so we made a mistake in our assumptions. Let's try another arrangement.

12. Let's assume the fan of trance is in the last column (G). So, the person who's hobby is fishing is in the second last column (F). The fan of r&b is in the middle column (D). The fan of blues is in the second column (B). The person who's hobby is dancing is in the first column (A). The person who's hobby is video-games is in the third column (C). The fan of pop is in the fifth column (E). The person who's hobby is reading is in the fourth column (D). The person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle column (D).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |     4      |     5      |    6    |      7      |
| Hobby         | collecting| dancing | video-games| reading | writing | pop | trance |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |         |            |            |         |             |

This arrangement satisfies all the rules."
Lv3-2x7-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball, we can place them in positions 1, 2, 6, or 7. Let's place spinach at position 1 for now.

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person eating tomato. Since spinach is at position 1, we can place tomato at position 6 (to avoid having two people on the same side).

3. The person who's sport is cricket is on the far left or far right. Since we already have a person on the far left (spinach), cricket must be on the far right. So, cricket goes at position 7.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person eating cranberry. Since cricket is at position 7, cranberry must be on the left of swimming, so cranberry goes at position 5.

5. The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since tomato is at position 6, eggplant can be either at position 5 (left) or 7 (right). Let's place eggplant at position 5 for now.

6. The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since swimming is at position 5, badminton must be at position 6.

7. The person eating lemon is the person who's sport is handball. Since handball must be on the left of watermelon (from rule 11), and we already have people at positions 1, 5, and 6, lemon must be at position 2.

8. The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating tomato. Since we placed eggplant at position 5, and we can't have two people on the same side, tomato must be at position 3.

9. The person eating corn is on the right of the person eating tomato. So, corn goes at position 4.

10. The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since we placed lemon at position 2 (handball), watermelon must be at position 1.

11. The person eating corn is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since we placed corn at position 4, swimming must be at position 2.

Now, let's check the consistency of the solution:
- All 7 different types of food are used.
- All 7 different types of sports are used.
- No person is eating the same food as another person.
- No person is doing the same sport as another person.

So, the final solution table is:

|         |    1     |       2       |    3     |    4     |     5     |    6     |     7      |
| Food    | watermelon| lemon        | tomato   | corn     | eggplant  | swimming  | cranberry  |
| Sport   | baseball | handball     | cricket   | golf     | badminton | swimming  | weightlifting|
