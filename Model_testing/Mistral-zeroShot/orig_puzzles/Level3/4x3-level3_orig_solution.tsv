Lv3-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Japanese is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding, the Japanese cannot be in the last column (as the snowboarder would be on the rightmost side). So, the Japanese can only be in the first or second column.

2. The Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Japanese is driving the roller (from condition 6), the Indonesian cannot be in the first column (as the roller driver is on the left of the American, and the American cannot be in the first column due to condition 3). So, the Indonesian can only be in the second or third column.

3. The dancer is on the left of the American. Since the Japanese is in the first column (from the previous step), the dancer cannot be in the first row. So, the dancer can only be in the second or third row.

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarder is in the second column (from the first step), the skateboarder must be in the first column.

5. Now we know the skateboarder is in the first column, the person driving the bus (designer) must be in the second or third row and not in the second column (as the Indonesian is there).

6. The manager is left with one possible job, as the dancer, designer, and Japanese are already placed. So, the manager must be in the third row.

7. Now we know the manager is in the third row, the person driving the jet-ski (Indonesian) must be in the third column.

8. The only job left for the second row is the manager, but we placed the manager in the third row. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it is currently stated.

However, if we assume that the puzzle has a mistake and the manager can be in the second row, then we can continue:

9. The person driving the roller (Japanese) must be in the first row.

10. The person who's sport is handball is left with one possible job (manager), one possible nationality (American), and one possible sport (snowboarding). But we already placed the manager and the snowboarder. This is another contradiction, so there seems to be another error in the puzzle.

In conclusion, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it is currently stated, and it is not possible to solve it with the given conditions."
Lv3-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the goldfish (point 3), so we can place the goldfish in the 3rd column.

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is between the owner of the frog and the person drinking almond-milk (point 2). Since we know the position of the goldfish (almond-milk drinker), we can place the frog in the column where the drawing hobby is not between it and the goldfish. Let's place the frog in column 1 for now.

3. Now, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (point 1). Since we placed the goldfish (almond-milk drinker) in column 3, the iced-tea drinker must be in column 1 or 2.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is collecting (point 5), so the collecting hobby must be in the same column as the goldfish (almond-milk drinker). Since we placed the frog in column 1, the collecting hobby cannot be in column 1. So, the collecting hobby must be in column 3.

5. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person driving the train (point 6). Since the train driver is the almond-milk drinker (point 4), the motorbike driver must be in column 1 or 2. However, the motorbike driver cannot be in column 1 because the frog owner (drawing hobby) is already there, and the collecting hobby (almond-milk drinker) is in column 3. So, the motorbike driver must be in column 2.

6. Now, we have placed the frog, goldfish, motorbike, and almond-milk (train) in their respective columns. The remaining beverages (iced-tea and coffee) and hobbies (collecting, drawing, and dancing) can be placed randomly in the remaining columns and rows.

Here is the final solution table:

|             |     1     |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage    | iced-tea | coffee   | almond-milk |

Lv3-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, nationalities, and pets, we can fill in one of each in the first row. Let's start with hobbies:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games |   |   |   |
   | drawing  |   |   |   |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

2. Since the designer is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games, the designer cannot be in the first column. So, the designer must be in the second or third column. Let's place the designer in the second column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games | designer |   |   |
   | drawing  |   |   |   |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

3. The analyst is on the far left or far right. Since the designer is not on the far left, the analyst must be in the first column. Let's place the analyst in the first column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games | analyst |   |   |
   | drawing  | designer |   |   |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

4. The Italian is the Italian, so we can fill in the nationality column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games | analyst | Italian  |   |
   | drawing  | designer |   |   |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

5. The Italian is on the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is in the first column, the Italian must be in the third column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games | analyst | Italian  |   |
   | drawing  | designer |   |   |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

6. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since we don't know the order yet, let's place the bird owner in the second column and the lizard owner in the first column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | board-games | analyst | Italian  | bird  |
   | drawing  | designer |   | lizard |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

7. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left or far right. Since the Italian is in the third column, the drawing hobby must be in the first column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | drawing | analyst | Italian  | bird  |
   | board-games | designer |   | lizard |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

8. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the Italian. Since the drawing hobby is in the first column and the Italian is in the third column, the board-games hobby must be in the second column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | drawing | analyst | Italian  | bird  |
   | board-games | designer |   | lizard |
   | video-games |   |   |   |

9. The manager is not the Italian (since the Italian is in the third column), not the designer (since the designer is in the second column), and not the analyst (since the analyst is in the first column). So, the manager must be in the third column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | drawing | analyst | Italian  | bird  |
   | board-games | designer |   | lizard |
   | video-games | manager |   |   |

10. The spanish is on the left or right of the analyst. Since the analyst is in the first column, the spanish can be in either the second or third column. Let's place the spanish in the second column:

   | Hobby   | Job    | Nationality | Pet   |
   |--------|--------|------------|-------|
   | drawing | analyst | Italian  | bird  |
   | board-games | designer | Spanish  | lizard |
   | video-games | manager |   |   |

11. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the bird and the manager. Since the bird owner is in the second column and the manager is in the third column, the lizard owner must be in the second column. But we already have the lizard owner in the second column. This is a contradiction, so there is no solution for this puzzle.

Final answer: There is no solution for this puzzle."
Lv3-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the far left, we can place it in the first column. Let's put it in the first row (row 1, column 1).

2. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the lemonade is on the far left, the cola must be in the second row (row 2). The hobby of the person drinking cola cannot be puzzles (because the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles), so the hobby of the person drinking cola can be either singing or writing. Let's assume the hobby of the person drinking cola is singing. This means the hobby of the person drinking sprite (which is on the far right) must be puzzles.

3. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person drinking cola (singing) is in the second row, the person drinking sprite (puzzles) must be in the third row.

4. The Australian is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the person drinking cola (singing) is in the second row, the Australian must be in the third row as well.

5. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person drinking sprite (puzzles) is in the third row, the person eating kiwi must be in the second column of the second row.

6. The person eating zucchini is between the nigerian and the person eating carrot. Since the person eating kiwi is in the second column of the second row, the person eating carrot must be in the first column of the second row. This means the nigerian must be in the first column of the third row.

7. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the canadian. Since the nigerian is in the first column of the third row, the canadian must be in the second column of the third row. This means the person eating zucchini must be in the first column of the third row.

8. The only food left is the food for the first column of the first row. Since the person eating kiwi is in the second column of the second row, the food for the first column of the first row must be carrot.

Lv3-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the scooter driver is between the cola and milk drinker. Let's place the scooter driver in the middle (position 2). Since there are only three options for beverages, the cola drinker must be in position 1 and the milk drinker in position 3. So, the Beverage column is: [Cola, Milk, Sprite]

2. The milk drinker is on the left or right of the eggplant eater. Since the scooter driver is in the middle, the milk drinker (who is to the left or right of the scooter driver) cannot be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, the eggplant eater must be in position 1, and the milk drinker can be either in position 2 or 3. Let's place the milk drinker in position 3 for now. So, the Food column is: [Eggplant, Pepper, Radish]

3. The sprite drinker is on the right of the milk drinker. Since the milk drinker is in position 3, the sprite drinker must be in position 2. So, the Beverage column is now [Cola, Sprite, Milk]

4. The pepper eater is on the right of the classical fan. Since the sprite drinker is in position 2, the classical fan cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the classical fan must be in position 1 or 3. Let's place the classical fan in position 1 for now. So, the Music-Genre column is: [Classical, Folk, Indie]

5. The sprite drinker is between the pepper eater and the radish eater. Since the sprite drinker is in position 2 and the radish eater must be in position 3 (as the classical fan is in position 1), the pepper eater must be in position 1. So, the Food column is now [Eggplant, Pepper, Radish]

6. The pepper eater is driving the train. Since the pepper eater is in position 1, the train driver is in position 1. So, the Transport column is: [Roller, Scooter, Train]

7. The scooter driver is on the left of the indie fan. Since the scooter driver is in position 2 and the indie fan is in position 3, the indie fan must be in position 3. So, the Music-Genre column is now [Classical, Folk, Indie]

8. The classical fan cannot be in position 2 or 3 because the scooter driver and the indie fan are already there. Therefore, the classical fan must be in position 1. So, the final solution table is:

   | Beverage      | Food          | Music-Genre   | Transport     |
   |--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
   | Cola         | Eggplant      | Classical    | Roller       |

Lv3-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the chef. Let's place golf on the right of chef (2nd column, 3rd row).
2. The accountant is the owner of the pony. Since the accountant is drinking lemonade (6th condition), let's place the accountant in the 1st column, 3rd row (as there's only one empty spot left for him). This means the pony is in the 3rd column, 3rd row.
3. The owner of the lizard is in the middle. Since the lizard can't be in the 1st or 3rd column (as they are occupied), it must be in the 2nd column. However, the sport of the person on the left of the lizard is skateboarding (7th condition), so the lizard must be in the 2nd row. This means the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the 2nd column, 1st row.
4. The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is rugby. Since the cat can't be in the 3rd column (as it's occupied), it must be in the 1st column. The only empty spot for the cat is the 1st row, so the person who's sport is rugby is in the 1st column, 1st row.
5. The person who's sport is golf is on the far right. Since golf is already in the 2nd column, 3rd row, this condition is satisfied.
6. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since skateboarding is in the 2nd column, 1st row, and 7up is not yet placed, we can't verify this condition yet.
7. Now let's place 7up. Since it can't be in the 3rd column (as it's occupied), it must be in the 1st or 2nd column. If it's in the 1st column, the person who's sport is skateboarding would be on the left of 7up, which contradicts the 7th condition. So, 7up must be in the 2nd column, 2nd row.
8. The only beverage left is lemonade. Since the accountant is drinking lemonade (6th condition), it must be in the 1st column, 1st row (as it's not occupied yet).

Final solution table:

```
#############
|   Lemonade |  7up   | Soy-milk |

Lv3-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the teacher drives the bus, so let's place the teacher in the first row, first column (1-1). Since the teacher owns a frog, we can place the frog in the first row, second column (1-2).

2. The person with the hobby of photography cannot be in the first column because they are to the right of the person with the mouse (from rule 2). So, the person with the hobby of photography must be in the second column or the third column. Let's assume they are in the second column (2-2). This means the pet of the person with the hobby of photography is a guinea-pig (2-3).

3. The fisherman is either in the first row or the third row. If the fisherman were in the first row, the person with the hobby of photography would have to be in the third column (3-3), but we placed the photographer in the second column (2-2). So, the fisherman must be in the third row (3-1).

4. The person with the hobby of woodworking cannot be in the first column because they are to the left of the person with the mouse (from rule 4). They also cannot be in the second column because the photographer is there (from step 2). So, the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in the third column (3-3).

5. Since the person with the hobby of woodworking is driving the trike (from rule 5), they must be in the third row (3-3). This means the transport in the first row must be the jet-ski (1-3).

6. Now, the only remaining hobby is baking. Since the teacher is already placed (1-1), the person with the hobby of baking must be in the second row (2-1).

7. The job of the person in the second row is either fisherman, paramedic, or teacher. Since the fisherman is in the third row (3-1), and the teacher is in the first row (1-1), the person in the second row must be a paramedic (2-1).

8. The pet of the person in the second row is a mouse (2-3).

9. The transport of the person in the second row is the bus (1-2) because the teacher drives the bus.

2. The person drinking milk is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the soul fan can't be on the leftmost position (as the banana eater is there), the soul fan must be in the middle or rightmost position. If the soul fan is in the middle, the milk drinker must be on the leftmost position, but that contradicts the banana eater being on the right of the helicopter driver. So, the soul fan must be on the rightmost position.

   |         | banana | soul      | helicopter |
   | almond-milk | folk  |           | bike      |
   | coffee    |      |           | bus       |
   | milk      | blueberry |           | pineapple |

5. The person drinking milk is the person eating blueberry. So, we can fill in the food for the milk drinker.

   |---------|------|------------|-----------|
   |         | banana | soul      | helicopter |
   | almond-milk | folk  |           | bike      |
   | coffee    | blueberry |           | bus       |
   | milk      | blueberry |           | pineapple |

6. The person driving the bike is the fan of folk. So, we can fill in the transport for the folk fan.

   | Beverage | Food | Music-Genre | Transport |
   |---------|------|------------|-----------|
   |         | banana | soul      | helicopter |
   | almond-milk | folk  |           | bike      |
   | coffee    | blueberry |           | bus       |
   | milk      | blueberry |           | pineapple |

Now, we have filled all the positions, and we can see that the person eating banana is not on the left of the person driving the helicopter. This contradicts our initial assumption. So, the banana eater must be on the left of the helicopter driver.

Let's rearrange the table:

   | Beverage | Food | Music-Genre | Transport |
   |---------|------|------------|-----------|
   |         | banana | soul      | helicopter |
   | almond-milk |      | folk      | bike      |
   | coffee    |      |           | bus       |
   | milk      | blueberry |           | pineapple |

Now, let's rearrange the people to satisfy the condition that the banana eater is on the left of the helicopter driver:

   | Beverage | Food | Music-Genre | Transport |
   |---------|------|------------|-----------|
   |         | banana | soul      | helicopter |
   | coffee    |      |           | bus       |
   | almond-milk | folk  |           | bike      |
   | milk      | blueberry |           | pineapple |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the nationalities:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | A |  |  |
   | Russian      | R |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  |  |

2. From point 6, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is between the Argentine and the Russian. So, the soy-milk must be in the middle:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | A | S | R |
   | Russian      | R |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  |  |

3. From point 7, we know that the fan of d&b is the Argentine, so the Argentine must be drinking soy-milk:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | S |  | R |
   | Russian      | R |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  |  |

4. From point 4, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the Argentine (d&b fan) is already on the left, the kale must be on the right of the Argentine:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | S | K | R |
   | Russian      | R |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  |  |

5. From point 1, we know that there are 3 different favorite beverages: lemonade, soy-milk, water. Since we have soy-milk and water is not listed, the person on the far right must be drinking water:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | S | K | W |
   | Russian      | R |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  | W |

6. From point 5, we know that the person drinking lemonade is not the Argentine (since he drinks soy-milk) and not the Thai (since the Thai drinks water). So, the person drinking lemonade must be the Russian:
   | Nationality   | 1 | 2 | 3 |
   |--------------|---|---|---|
   | Argentine    | S | K | W |
   | Russian      | L |  |  |
   | Thai         | T |  | W |

7. From point 5, we know that the person drinking water is the Thai.

8. From point 5, we know that the fan of classical is the person drinking lemonade (Russian).

9. Since there are 3 different music-genres: blues, classical, d&b, and we have filled in the music-genre for the Argentine and the Russian, the person on the far left must be a fan of blues:
   |               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-Milk | Water     |
   | Food          |         | Eggplant | Spinach   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues    | D&B      | Classical |
   | Nationality   | Russian  | Argentine| Thai      |

10. Since the person eating spinach is on the far left (point 1), the food must be eggplant on the right of the spinach:
    |               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
    | Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-Milk | Water     |
    | Food          | Spinach  | Eggplant | Kale      |
    | Music-Genre   | Blues    | D&B      | Classical |
    | Nationality   | Russian  | Argentine| Thai      |

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-Milk | Water     |
| Food          | Spinach  | Eggplant | Kale      |
| Music-Genre   | Blues    | D&B      | Classical |
| Nationality   | Russian  | Argentine| Thai      |
