Lv3-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fantasy movie watcher is on the left of the western movie watcher. Let's place them in the first two spots. Let's assume the fantasy movie watcher is in position 1 (F) and the western movie watcher is in position 2 (W).

2. The doctor is on the right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in the middle (as the airplane driver), the doctor must be in position 3 (D) and the pilot in position 4 (P).

3. The person driving the airplane is in the middle, so this is already filled.

4. The person driving the skateboard is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the fantasy movie watcher, the skateboard driver must be in position 5 (S).

5. The paramedic drives the bike. Since the paramedic is on the left of the person watching crime movies and the crime movie watcher is on the far right (from rule 10), the paramedic must be in position 2 (B).

6. The analyst is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in position 2 (B), the analyst must be in position 1 (A).

7. The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the western movie watcher is in position 2 (W), the motorbike driver must be in position 3 (M).

8. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard driver is in position 5 (S), the mystery movie watcher must be in position 4 (M).

9. This rule is already satisfied as the motorbike driver (M) is on the left of the western movie watcher (W).

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      1       |     2     |    3     |     4     |     5      |
| Job           | analyst (A)   | paramedic (B) | pilot (P) | mystery movie watcher (M) | skateboard driver (S) |
| Movie-Genre   | crime (C)    | fantasy (F)  | western (W) | mystery (M) | western (W) |
| Transport     | motorbike (M) | bike (B)    | airplane (A) | taxi (T) | skateboard (S) |

Since the jobs, movie genres, and transport are all different, this solution should be correct. However, the table format might not display correctly in this text format."
Lv3-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the person who drinks coffee (C) and the owner of the lizard (L) in the first two positions. Since C is on the left of L, we can place C in the first column and L in the second.

2. The owner of the lizard (L) is on the right of the owner of the rabbit (R), so we can place R in the third column.

3. The owner of the goldfish (G) is on the left of the gardener (G), so we can place G in the first column and G in the fourth or fifth column. Let's place G in the fourth column for now.

4. The owner of the goldfish (G) is on the right of the owner of the pony (P), so we can place P in the fifth column.

5. The owner of the horse (H) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing (W). Since we don't know the exact position of W yet, we can't place H yet.

6. The person who's hobby is sudoku (S) is on the left of the owner of the lizard (L), so we can place S in the second column.

7. The person who's hobby is gardening (G) is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing (W), so we can place W in the third column.

8. The person drinking iced-tea (I) is the owner of the horse (H), so we can place I in the fifth column.

9. The person drinking lemonade (Lm) is on the right of the owner of the lizard (L), so we can place Lm in the third column.

10. The person drinking 7up (7) is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening (G). Since G is already placed, we can place 7 in the fourth column.

11. The owner of the pony (P) is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (Ph), so we can place Ph in the second or fifth column. Since Ph can't be in the second column because it's already occupied by S, Ph must be in the fifth column.

Now we have the following arrangement:

| Beverage   | 7up | Sudoku | Coffee | Gardening | Lemonade |
|-----------|-----|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Hobby     |     |       |        |           |          |
| Pet       |     |       |        |           |          |

We still need to place the hobby and pet for each person. Let's start with the hobbies:

12. The gardener (G) is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing (W), so W must be in the first column. So, the hobbies are: Writing, Sudoku, Gardening, Cooking, Photography.

13. The owner of the horse (H) is the person who drinks iced-tea (I), so H must be the person who does photography (Ph). So, the pets are: Goldfish, Rabbit, Lizard, Pony, Horse.

Now we have the final solution:

| Beverage   | 7up | Sudoku | Coffee | Gardening | Lemonade |
|-----------|-----|-------|--------|-----------|----------|
| Hobby     | Writing | Sudoku | Coffee | Gardening | Photography |
| Pet       | Goldfish | Rabbit |        | Lizard    | Horse     |"
Lv3-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 11, we know that the Brazilian is on the far right, so we can place them in the last column (column 5).

2. Since the Mexican is the chef (rule 4), we can place them in the first row (job 1).

3. Now, the Argentine is the freelancer (rule 8), and the freelancer owns the pony (rule 6). Since the British is on the left of the owner of the pony (rule 9), the Argentine (freelancer) must be in the second column (column 2).

4. The British is the nurse (rule 10), so they go in the third row (job 3).

5. The owner of the fish is on the left of the coach (rule 7), and the coach can't be in the first column because the Mexican is there (rule 4). So, the coach must be in the second, third, or fourth column. If the coach were in the second column, the British (nurse) would be on the left of the coach, which contradicts rule 3. If the coach were in the fourth column, the Argentine (freelancer) would be on the right of the coach, which also contradicts rule 4. Therefore, the coach must be in the third column (column 3).

6. Now, the fish owner is in the first or fourth column. If the fish owner were in the first column, the coach would be on the right of the fish owner, which contradicts rule 7. So, the fish owner must be in the fourth column (column 4).

7. The owner of the pony (Argentine) is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (rule 5). Since the Argentine is already placed in the second column, the hamster owner must be in the first, third, or fifth column. If the hamster owner were in the first column, the Argentine would be on the right of the hamster owner, which contradicts rule 5. If the hamster owner were in the fifth column, the Brazilian (on the far right) would be on the left of the hamster owner, which also contradicts rule 1. Therefore, the hamster owner must be in the third column (column 3).

8. The only job left is the social-worker. Since the Argentine (freelancer) and the British (nurse) are already placed, the social-worker must be the coach (column 3) or the chef (column 1). If the social-worker were the chef, the Mexican (chef) would be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 11. So, the social-worker must be the coach (column 3).

9. The only pet left is the goat. Since the fish is in the fourth column (column 4), the goat can't be in the fourth column because the owner of the goat must be on the left of the coach (rule 5), which would place the goat owner in the third column, where the social-worker is. Therefore, the goat must be in the first column (column 1).

10. The only job left for the first column is the job of the owner of the goat. Since the Mexican (chef) is in the first row, the owner of the goat must be the chef.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv3-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the coach is on the far left (row 1, column 1), we know that the jobs in columns 2-5 are not coach.

2. The fan of trance is on the right of the electrician (row 2, column 3 is not trance). So, trance can only be in columns 1, 4, or 5.

3. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the electrician (row 3, column 2 is not skateboard). So, skateboard can only be in columns 1, 4, or 5.

4. Since the security-guard is on the left or right of the fan of pop (row 4, column 5 is not security-guard), and we know that the coach is on the far left, the only possible positions for security-guard are columns 1, 2, or 3.

5. The fan of classical is on the right of the person driving the skateboard (row 5, column 1 is not classical). So, classical can only be in columns 2, 3, or 4.

6. The person driving the ship is the fan of classical (row 5, column 4 or 5 is classical).

7. Now, we know that classical is in column 4 or 5, and the person driving the ship is the fan of classical. So, the person driving the ship is in row 5, column 4.

8. The fan of disco is the police-officer (row 2, column 3 is disco).

9. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the fan of metal (row 3, column 1 is not helicopter). So, helicopter can only be in columns 2, 4, or 5.

10. Since the security-guard is on the left of the police-officer (row 4, column 3 is not security-guard), and we know that the coach is on the far left, the only possible positions for security-guard are columns 2 or 4. But we already know that classical is in column 4, so the security-guard must be in column 2.

11. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard (row 3, column 3 is not motorbike). Since we know that the skateboard is in column 2, the motorbike can only be in columns 1, 4, or 5. But we know that the security-guard is in column 2, so the motorbike must be in column 1.

12. The only job left for column 1 is electrician. So, the electrician is in row 1.

13. The only job left for column 5 is videographer. So, the videographer is in row 1 or 2, but we know that the electrician is in row 1, so the videographer is in row 2.

14. The only job left for column 3 is police-officer (since we know that the fan of disco is the police-officer).

15. The only job left for column 4 is metal (since we know that the person driving the ship is the fan of classical).

So, the final solution table is:

```
|               |      Coach      | Electrician | Police-Officer | Security-Guard | Videographer  |
| Music-Genre   | Classical      |             | Disco          |                | Metal         |

Lv3-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 hobbies, nationalities, and sports, so we can fill in the first row with the hobbies, second row with nationalities, and third row with sports.

2. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the Mexican. So, the hobby of the Mexican cannot be reading. Let's place the hobby of reading in the first column, and the Mexican in the second column.

3. The brazilian is on the far left or far right. Since the Mexican is not in the first or last column, the Brazilian must be in the first column (as it's the only remaining option).

4. The turkish is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since we don't know the position of climbing yet, let's assume climbing is in the third column for now. This means the Turkish must be in the fourth or fifth column.

5. The person who's sport is rugby is on the far left or far right. Since the Brazilian and Mexican are already placed, and the Turkish cannot be in the first or last column, rugby must be in the second column. This means the Turkish must be in the fifth column.

6. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. So, skateboarding must be in the fourth column.

7. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since we don't know the position of photography yet, let's assume photography is in the fifth column for now. This means filmmaking can be in the first, second, or fourth column. However, since the Brazilian is in the first column, filmmaking cannot be in the first column. So, filmmaking must be in the fourth column.

8. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far right. Since we have placed all other hobbies, card-games must be in the first column.

9. The spanish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball. Since we don't know the position of handball yet, let's assume handball is in the second column for now. This means the Spanish can be in the first or third column. However, since the Brazilian is in the first column, the Spanish cannot be in the first column. So, the Spanish must be in the third column.

10. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since we have placed filmmaking in the fourth column, photography must be in the fifth column.

11. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since we have placed rugby, skateboarding, and climbing, cricket must be in the third column.

12. The person who's sport is handball is in the second column, as it's the only remaining option for the Spanish to be on its left or right.

So, the final solution table is:

| Sport         | Cricket    | Rugby      | Handball    | Climbing    | Skateboarding|

However, this table doesn't follow the rule that each nationality, hobby, and sport is unique in each column. To make it valid, we can swap the nationalities in the second and third columns, and the sports in the second and third rows:

Lv3-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Thai is eating eggplant (clue 2), we can place the Thai in the second column and the eggplant in the second row.

2. Now, we know that the Indonesian is on the far left (clue 9), so the Indonesian goes in the first column, and the food in the first row remains unknown.

3. The Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon (clue 4), and the Canadian is eating watermelon (clue 8), so the Russian cannot be in the second column (since the Canadian is in the second column). Therefore, the Russian must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

4. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog (clue 3). Since the Indonesian is in the first column and the Thai is in the second column, the frog cannot be in the first or second row. So, the frog must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row.

5. The Russian is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 6). Since the Indonesian is in the first column and the Thai is in the second column, the chinchilla cannot be in the first or second row. So, the chinchilla must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row.

6. The owner of the ferret is in the middle (clue 7). Since the Indonesian is in the first column and the Thai is in the second column, the ferret must be in the third row.

7. Now, we know that the ferret is in the third row, so the food in the third row cannot be radish (since the radish is on the left or right of the ferret). Therefore, the food in the third row must be either avocado, tomato, or watermelon. But we already know that the Canadian is eating watermelon (clue 8), so the food in the third row cannot be watermelon. Therefore, the food in the third row must be either avocado or tomato.

8. Since the Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon (clue 4), the Russian cannot be in the third column (since the watermelon is in the second column). Therefore, the Russian must be in the fourth or fifth column.

9. The person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (clue 5). Since the Indonesian is in the first column, the goldfish cannot be in the first row. So, the goldfish must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth row.

10. Since the Russian is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 6), the Russian cannot be in the fifth column (since the chinchilla is in the third row). Therefore, the Russian must be in the fourth column.

11. Now, we know that the Russian is in the fourth column and the food in the third row is either avocado or tomato. Since the Russian is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 6), the food in the third row must be avocado (since the tomato is on the left of the goldfish, and the goldfish cannot be in the first row).

12. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog (clue 3). Since the Russian is in the fourth column, the radish cannot be in the fourth column. Therefore, the radish must be in the first, second, or fifth column. Since the Indonesian is in the first column, the radish cannot be in the first column. Therefore, the radish must be in the second or fifth column.

13. Since the Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon (clue 4), the person eating watermelon must be in the fifth column. Since the Canadian is eating watermelon (clue 8), the Canadian must be in the fifth row.

14. Now, we know that the Canadian is in the fifth row and the food in the third row is avocado. Since the person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog (clue 3), the radish cannot be in the fifth column (since the Canadian is in the fifth column). Therefore, the radish must be in the second column.

15. The person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (clue 5). Since the Canadian is in the fifth row and the radish is in the second column, the goldfish cannot be in the second row. Therefore, the goldfish must be in the fourth row.

16. Since the person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (clue 5), the tomato must be in the first column.

17. The last food, watermelon, is being eaten by the Canadian (clue 8), so it must be in the fifth column.

Here is the final solution table:

Now, we need to find the nationalities and pets. Since the Indonesian is on the far left (clue 9), the Indonesian is in the first row. Since the person eating tomato is in the first column (solution above), the Indonesian is eating tomato.

Since the Russian is in the fourth column (solution above), the Russian is in the fourth row. Since the Russian is on the right of the person eating watermelon (clue 4), the person eating watermelon must be in the third row. Therefore, the Canadian is in the third row.

Since the owner of the ferret is in the middle (clue 7), the ferret is in the second row. Since the person eating radish is on the left or right of the owner of the frog (clue 3), the frog cannot be in the second row. Therefore, the frog must be in the fifth row.

Since the person eating radish is in the second column (solution above), the frog must be in the fourth column.

Since the person eating eggplant is the Thai (solution above), the Thai is in the second row. Since the Thai is the person eating eggplant (clue 2), the eggplant must be in the second row.

Since the person eating avocado is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla (solution above), the chinchilla must be in the third column. Since the Russian is in the fourth column (solution above), the chinchilla must be in the fifth column.

Since the Canadian is in the third row (solution above), the chinchilla must be in the third row.

Since the goldfish is in the fourth row (solution above), the goldfish owner must be in the fifth row. Since the person eating tomato is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (clue 5), the goldfish owner must be in the fourth column.

Here is the final solution table:

We still don't have the pet for the first row. Since the Indonesian is in the first row, the pet for the first row cannot be the chinchilla (since the chinchilla is in the third row), the ferret (since the ferret is in the second row), or the goldfish (since the goldfish is in the fifth row). Therefore, the pet for the first row must be the frog or the pony. Since the frog is in the fourth column (solution above), the pet for the first row cannot be the frog. Therefore, the pet for the first row must be the pony.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-3x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, nationalities, and sports are unique to each person.

2. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is traveling is in the middle. So, we can place 'Traveling' in the 3rd column.

3. Since traveling is in the middle, the sports on the left and right must be parkour (rule 2). So, we can place 'Parkour' in the 1st and 5th rows.

4. From rule 3, the Italian is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since we know parkour is on the left, the Italian must be in the 1st row. So, we can place 'Italian' in the 1st row.

5. From rule 7, the person who's hobby is card-games is the person who's sport is soccer. Since soccer is on the right of parkour (1st row), the hobby card-games must be in the 5th row. So, we can place 'Card-games' in the 5th row.

6. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is camping is between the person who's sport is skiing and the Brazilian. Since we know parkour (1st row) and soccer (5th row), the only possible place for skiing is the 2nd row. So, we can place 'Skiing' in the 2nd row. Now, the only place left for camping is the 4th row. So, we can place 'Camping' in the 4th row.

7. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is tennis. Since we know camping is in the 4th row, tennis must be in the 4th row as well.

8. From rule 6, the person who's sport is skiing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we know skiing is in the 2nd row and camping is in the 4th row, skiing must be on the right of camping. So, we can place 'Skiing' in the 2nd row and 'Camping' in the 4th row.

9. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is camping is the Thai. Since we know camping is in the 4th row, the Thai must be in the 4th row as well.

10. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we know camping is in the 4th row, the only place left for woodworking is the 3rd row. So, we can place 'Woodworking' in the 3rd row.

11. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since we know parkour is in the 1st row, the only possible nationality left is Brazilian. So, the Brazilian must be in the 2nd row.

12. From rule 1, the person who's hobby is dancing is not Turkish (rule 3). So, the only nationality left for the person who's hobby is dancing is Malaysian or Thai. Since we know the Thai is the person who's hobby is camping, the person who's hobby is dancing must be Malaysian. So, we can place 'Dancing' in the 1st or 5th row (since parkour is in the 1st and 5th rows). Let's place 'Dancing' in the 1st row for now.

13. From rule 11, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we know dancing is in the 1st row, woodworking must be in the 5th row.

14. From rule 3, the Turkish is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since we know dancing is in the 1st row and woodworking is in the 5th row, the Turkish must be in the 3rd row.

Now, the final solution table is:

Lv3-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is on the far left (8) and the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting (1), the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in the first position. So, the sport of weightlifting must be either 2, 3, 4, or 5.

2. The fan of dubstep is in the middle (7), so it must be in position 3. Therefore, the music-genres are: 1 - classical, 3 - dubstep, 5 - ?

3. The person drinking water is the person who's sport is lacrosse (2), so the beverages are: 1 - lemonade, 2 - water (lacrosse), 3 - ?, 4 - ?, 5 - ?

4. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is golf (3), so the sports are: 1 - golf, 2 - lacrosse, 3 - volleyball, 4 - ?, 5 - weightlifting

8. The fan of classical is on the far left (10), so the music-genres are: 1 - classical, 3 - dubstep, 5 - ?

9. The only remaining beverage is hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball (5), the sports are: 1 - golf, 2 - lacrosse, 3 - volleyball, 4 - weightlifting, 5 - hot-chocolate

10. The only remaining music-genre is punk. So, the final table is:

| Beverage      |     1     |     2      |       3       |       4       |     5      |

Lv3-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hobbies, jobs, and music-genres are all different for each person. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 5 for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person with hobby 5 (sudoku) is not in the first column because the camper is to the left of the designer (hobby 2). So, hobby 5 must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

3. From rule 3, we know that hobby 5 is not in the first column because the fisher (hobby 4) is to the right of hobby 5. So, hobby 5 must be in the second, third, or fifth column.

4. From rule 4, we know that the doctor (job 3) is to the right of hobby 5. So, hobby 5 cannot be in the second column because the entrepreneur (job 4) is between hobby 5 and hobby 1 (baking). Therefore, hobby 5 must be in the third or fifth column.

5. From rule 5, we know that the entrepreneur is between hobby 5 and hobby 1. Since hobby 5 cannot be in the second column, the entrepreneur must be in the second row and hobby 5 must be in the fifth column.

6. Now, we know that hobby 5 is in the fifth column and the entrepreneur is in the second row. So, the entrepreneur is job 4.

7. From rule 7, we know that hobby 1 (baking) is also the fan of classical music. So, classical music must be in the first row.

8. From rule 8, we know that hobby 3 (chess) is the fan of pop music.

9. From rule 9, we know that the fan of r&b is either to the left or right of hobby 1 (baking). Since the entrepreneur is to the right of hobby 5 and the doctor is to the right of hobby 5, the only remaining spot for r&b is to the left of hobby 1. So, r&b is in the first column and the dancer (who prefers r&b) is in the first row.

10. From rule 10, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of hobby 4 (fishing). Since the doctor is to the right of hobby 5 and the entrepreneur is in the second row, the only remaining spot for techno is in the fourth column and the fisher is in the fourth row.

11. Now, we have placed all the hobbies, jobs, and music-genres. The final solution table is:

    | Hobby         |    1    |     2     |      3       |   4    |   5    |
    | Job           |         |           |              |        |        |
    | Music-Genre   | Classical|   R&B     |   Pop        | Techno  | Sudoku |
    | Hobby         | Baking  |   Camping |   Chess      | Fishing |        |
    | Job           | Teacher |   Designer|   Dancer     | Doctor  | Entrepreneur |

This is the final solution table."
