Lv3-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 different symbols (let's use A, B, and C).

|               |       A       |      B      |       C       |
| Beverage      |              |            |              |
| Hobby         |              |            |              |
| Job           |              |            |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |            |              |
| Pet           |              |            |              |
| Sport         |              |            |              |
| Transport     |              |            |              |

2. From point 1, we know that there are 3 different beverages, so we can fill in the beverages: 7up, cola, iced-tea.

|               |       A       |      B      |       C       |
| Beverage      | 7up          |  cola      |  iced-tea     |
| Hobby         |              |            |              |
| Job           |              |            |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |            |              |
| Pet           |              |            |              |
| Sport         |              |            |              |
| Transport     |              |            |              |

3. Similarly, we know that there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, pets, sports, and means of transport, so we can fill in the rest of the table with the remaining options.

|               |       A       |      B      |       C       |
| Beverage      | 7up          |  cola      |  iced-tea     |
| Hobby         | baking       | filmmaking  | woodworking   |
| Job           | coach       | entrepreneur | photographer  |
| Music-Genre   | pop         | reggae      | techno        |
| Pet           | cat         | guinea-pig  | turtle        |
| Sport         | climbing    | sailing     | water-polo    |
| Transport     | bike        | subway      | train         |

4. Now let's solve the conditions:

   From point 2, the person who's sport is climbing is the person drinking cola. So, B is drinking cola and B's sport is climbing.

   From point 3, the fan of techno is the person who's hobby is woodworking. So, C is woodworking and C's music-genre is techno.

   From point 3, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since A is baking, A cannot be on the far left, so A is on the right of filmmaking (B).

   From point 4, the entrepreneur is on the far right. Since C is on the far right, C is the entrepreneur.

   From point 5, the person who's sport is sailing is the person driving the train. Since B is sailing, B is driving the train.

   From point 6, the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left. Since A is not on the far left, A must be 7up or cola. But A is not cola (B), so A is 7up.

   From point 7, the person drinking cola is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the subway. Since B is drinking cola and B is driving the train, B cannot be between bike and subway. A is not on the far left, so A cannot be the person driving the bike. Therefore, A is the person driving the subway.

   From point 8, the coach is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since A is baking, A cannot be the coach. B is not baking, so B cannot be the coach. C is the entrepreneur, so C cannot be the coach. Therefore, A is the coach.

   From point 9, the person drinking cola is the fan of pop. Since B is drinking cola, B is the fan of pop.

   From point 10, the fan of pop is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since B is the fan of pop, B cannot be the owner of the cat. A is not the fan of pop, so A cannot be the owner of the cat. C is the entrepreneur, so C cannot be the owner of the cat. Therefore, C is the owner of the cat.

   From point 11, the person driving the subway is the photographer. Since A is driving the subway, A is the photographer.

   From point 12, the owner of the turtle is the entrepreneur. Since C is the entrepreneur, C is the owner of the turtle.

5. Now we have the final solution table:

|               |       A       |      B      |       C       |
| Beverage      | 7up          |  cola      |  iced-tea     |
| Hobby         | baking       | filmmaking  | woodworking   |
| Job           | coach       | entrepreneur | photographer  |
| Music-Genre   | pop         | reggae      | techno        |
| Pet           | cat         | guinea-pig  | turtle        |
| Sport         | climbing    | sailing     | water-polo    |
| Transport     | bike        | subway      | train         |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |       A       |      B      |       C       |

Lv3-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 people, so we can assign numbers to them (1, 2, 3) for easier reference.

2. Let's start with the people's jobs. Since there are 3 jobs, each person must have a unique job. So, we can place them in the first row as follows:
   - Job: 1 (Lawyer), 2 (Paramedic), 3 (Software-developer)

3. Now let's place the music-genres. Since there are 3 genres, each person must have a unique genre. Since the software-developer is a fan of r&b (from point 9), we can place him in the second row as follows:
   - Music-Genre: 1 (d&b), 2 (house), 3 (r&b)

4. Now let's place the pets. Since there are 3 pets, each person must have a unique pet. Since the owner of the rabbit is the person drinking 7up (from point 12), we can place him in the third row as follows:
   - Pet: 1 (Frog), 2 (Hedgehog), 3 (Rabbit)

5. Now let's place the beverages. Since there are 3 beverages, each person must have a unique beverage. Since the owner of the rabbit is the person drinking 7up (from point 12), we can place 7up in the third column as follows:
   - Beverage: Cola, Lemonade, 7up

6. Now let's place the sports. Since there are 3 sports, each person must have a unique sport. Since the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (from point 11), we can place him in the fourth row as follows:
   - Sport: Handball, Skiing, Tennis

7. Now let's place the hobbies. Since there are 3 hobbies, each person must have a unique hobby. Since the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (from point 11), we can place filmmaking in the fifth row as follows:
   - Hobby: Camping, Drawing, Filmmaking

8. Now let's place the transport. Since there are 3 transports, each person must have a unique transport. Since the person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking lemonade (from point 7), we can place car in the sixth column as follows:
   - Transport: Boat, Car, Skateboard

9. Now we have all the information, let's check the conditions:
   1. The paramedic is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since the paramedic is on the left of the software-developer (who is the fan of r&b), the fan of d&b must be on the right of the software-developer. So, the order of music-genres should be: 1 (d&b), 2 (house), 3 (r&b)
   2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since the person driving the skateboard is the person who's sport is handball (in the fourth row), the person who's sport is skiing must be in the third row. So, the order of sports should be: Handball, Skiing, Tennis
   3. The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the frog. Since the paramedic is on the left of the software-developer (who is the owner of the rabbit), the owner of the frog must be in the middle. So, the order of pets should be: Frog, Hedgehog, Rabbit
   4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in the middle, the person drinking cola can be either to the left or right of him. Let's place cola to the left of the software-developer for now. So, the order of beverages should be: Cola, Lemonade, 7up
   5. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, the person driving the boat must be on the right of the person drinking cola. So, the order of transports should be: Boat, Car, Skateboard
   6. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, the person who's hobby is camping must be in the middle. So, the order of hobbies should be: Camping, Drawing, Filmmaking
   7. The person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. This condition is already satisfied.
   8. The person who's sport is handball is between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the boat. This condition is already satisfied.
   9. The software-developer is the fan of r&b. This condition is already satisfied.
   10. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the owner of the frog is in the middle, the owner of the hedgehog can be either to the left or right of him. Let's place the hedgehog to the right of the frog for now.
   11. The owner of the rabbit is the person drinking 7up. This condition is already satisfied.

10. Now let's check the conditions again:
   1. The paramedic is on the left of the fan of d&b. This condition is already satisfied.
   2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. This condition is already satisfied.
   3. The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the frog. This condition is already satisfied.
   4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the software-developer. This condition is already satisfied.
   5. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the boat. This condition is already satisfied.
   6. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, the person who's hobby is camping must be in the middle. So, the order of hobbies should be: Camping, Drawing, Filmmaking
   7. The person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. This condition is already satisfied.
   8. The person who's sport is handball is between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the boat. This condition is already satisfied.
   9. The software-developer is the fan of r&b. This condition is already satisfied.
   10. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the owner of the frog is in the middle, the owner of the hedgehog must be on the left of the owner of the frog. So, the order of pets should be: Frog, Hedgehog, Rabbit

11. Now the table should be filled correctly:

   |               |     1      |    2     |         3          |
   | Beverage      | Cola      | Lemonade | 7up              |
   | Hobby         | Camping   | Drawing  | Filmmaking       |
   | Job           | Lawyer    | Paramedic| Software-developer|
   | Music-Genre   | d&b       | House    | r&b              |
   | Pet           | Frog      | Hedgehog | Rabbit           |
   | Sport         | Handball  | Skiing   | Tennis           |
   | Transport     | Boat      | Car      | Skateboard       |

And that's the final solution table:

Lv3-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and each person has 6 attributes (hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, transport). We also know that each attribute has 3 unique options.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since there are 3 nationalities, we can assign them to the first three people in the table. Let's say the first person is Chinese, the second person is Egyptian, and the third person is Turkish.

3. Now, let's place the people according to the given conditions:
   - The person driving the boat is on the left of the Chinese. So, the fourth person (since the first three are already assigned) must be driving the boat.
   - The owner of the pony is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since we don't know who is cycling yet, we can't place the pony owner yet.
   - The owner of the hamster is on the far right. So, the sixth person must be the hamster owner.
   - The Chinese is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since we don't know who is watching scientific movies yet, we can't place the Chinese yet.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Since we don't know who is driving the airplane yet, we can't place the quad-bike driver yet.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we don't know who is playing ice-hockey yet, we can't place the hedgehog owner yet.
   - The chinese is the person who's hobby is writing. Since we don't know who is writing yet, we can't place the Chinese yet.
   - The fan of country is the person who's hobby is writing. Since we don't know who is writing yet, we can't place the country fan yet.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since we don't know who is watching fantasy movies yet, we can't place the card-games person yet.
   - The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the turkish. Since we have already placed the Turkish, we can place the fantasy movie watcher to the left of the Turkish.
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since we don't know who is the hedgehog owner yet, we can't place the singer yet.

4. Let's place the hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and transports based on the remaining conditions and the already placed people:
   - The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the turkish. So, the fifth person must be watching fantasy movies.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. So, the sixth person (already placed as the hamster owner) must be playing card-games.
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the fifth person is already placed as the fantasy movie watcher, the singer must be the fourth person.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since we don't know who is playing ice-hockey yet, we can't place the hedgehog owner yet.
   - The person driving the airplane is not yet placed. Let's place the person driving the airplane as the second person.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the airplane. So, the third person must be driving the quad-bike.
   - The chinese is the person who's hobby is writing. Since we have already placed the Chinese, the first person must be writing.
   - The fan of country is the person who's hobby is writing. Since the first person is already placed as the Chinese and the Chinese is not a fan of country, the second person must be a fan of country.
   - The person watching scientific movies is not yet placed. Let's place the person watching scientific movies as the third person.

5. Now, let's place the remaining attributes (pets, sports, and music-genres) based on the given conditions:
   - The owner of the pony is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the second person is driving the airplane and the third person is driving the quad-bike, the fourth person must be cycling. So, the first person must be the pony owner.
   - The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the fifth person is watching fantasy movies, the sixth person (already placed as the hamster owner) must be playing ice-hockey. So, the fifth person must be the hedgehog owner.
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the fifth person is already placed as the hedgehog owner, the fourth person (already placed as the cyclist) must be singing.
   - The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the fourth person is already placed as the cyclist, the second person (already placed as the fan of country) must be the singer.
   - The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the fifth person is already placed as the fantasy movie watcher, the sixth person (already placed as the hamster owner) must be playing card-games.
   - The person who's hobby is writing is the Chinese. Since the first person is already placed as the Chinese, the first person must be writing.
   - The person watching scientific movies is the third person. Since the third person is already placed, the third person must be watching scientific movies.

6. Now, let's place the music-genres, sports, and pets based on the already placed people:
   - The person driving the airplane is the second person. Since the second person is a fan of country, the second person must prefer country music.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is the third person. Since the third person is watching scientific movies, the third person must prefer hip-hop music.
   - The fourth person is cycling and singing. Since the fourth person is a fan of country, the fourth person must prefer folk music.
   - The fifth person is watching fantasy movies and owning the hedgehog. Since the fifth person is a fan of country, the fifth person must prefer folk music.
   - The sixth person is playing card-games and owning the hamster. Since the sixth person is a fan of country, the sixth person must prefer folk music.

7. Here is the final solution table:

   |               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
   | Hobby         | Writing    | Country  | Scientific |

Lv3-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person drinking cola. Let's place them in the first two spots. So, the first row (from left to right) is: Pineapple, Cola.

2. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since we already placed the person drinking cola (which is not milk), the person drinking milk must be in the third position. So, the second row is: Milk.

3. The person watching western movies is the person who's hobby is baking. Since we know the positions of the people watching adventure and milk, the person watching western movies must be in the second position (as the hobbies are different). So, the second row (from left to right) is: Milk, Baking (which is western).

4. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the paramedic. Since we already placed the person drinking milk in the second position, the paramedic must be in the first or third position. Let's place the paramedic in the first position for now. So, the first row is: Paramedic, Pineapple, Cola.

5. The fan of salsa is on the left of the security-guard. Since we already placed the person drinking cola (which is not the security-guard), the security-guard must be in the third position. So, the third row is: Security-guard.

6. The owner of the bird is on the far right. Since we already placed the security-guard in the third position, the bird owner must be in the third position. So, the third row (from left to right) is: Security-guard, Bird.

7. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since we already placed the person drinking milk in the second position, the person traveling can be in either the first or third position. Let's place the person traveling in the first position for now. So, the first row is: Traveling, Paramedic, Pineapple, Cola.

8. The person drinking milk is the person watching comedy movies. Since we already placed the person drinking milk in the second position, the person watching comedy movies is also in the second position. So, the second row is: Milk, Comedy.

9. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat. Since we already placed the bird owner in the third position, the hamster owner must be in the second position. But we already placed the person drinking milk (which is not the hamster owner) in the second position. This is a contradiction, so we need to reconsider the placement of the hamster owner. Let's place the hamster owner in the first position instead of the traveling person. So, the first row is: Hamster, Paramedic, Pineapple, Cola.

10. The person eating pineapple is between the fan of soul and the security-guard. Since we already placed the security-guard in the third position, the person eating pineapple must be in the second position. But we already placed the person drinking milk (which is not the pineapple eater) in the second position. This is another contradiction, so we need to reconsider the placement of the pineapple eater. Let's place the pineapple eater in the third position instead of the paramedic. So, the first row is: Hamster, Paramedic, Pineapple, Cola.

11. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating cucumber. Since we already placed the person drinking milk in the second position, the person eating cucumber must be in the first position. But we already placed the hamster owner in the first position. This is another contradiction, so we need to reconsider the placement of the cucumber eater. Let's place the cucumber eater in the third position instead of the pineapple eater. So, the first row is: Hamster, Paramedic, Cucumber, Pineapple, Cola.

At this point, we have a contradiction in the positions of the hamster owner, pineapple eater, and cucumber eater. It seems that the given conditions are not sufficient to uniquely determine the positions of all people, beverages, foods, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, and pets.

However, if we make an assumption (for example, that the person eating cucumber is the person watching comedy movies), we can continue to fill in the table. But the solution would not be unique due to the assumptions made.

Here is a possible solution based on the assumption that the person eating cucumber is the person watching comedy movies:

|               |     1     |      2      |       3        |
| Beverage      | Hamster   | Paramedic  | Cucumber      |

4. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the cat. Since the fisherman is already placed, we can place the person drinking almond-milk to the left of the cat owner.

   |               |       1       |      2      |       3       |

10. The person who's hobby is fishing is the owner of the chinchilla, which is already placed.

11. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the Dutch, Australian, and the person drinking hot-chocolate are already placed, the person watching fantasy movies must be in the first position.

Lv3-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the dog owner is on the left or right of the motorbike driver. Let's assume the dog owner is on the left (D).
2. The plum eater is on the left of the metal fan (P < M).
3. The tomato eater is on the far right (T).
4. The jet-ski driver is on the left of the horror watcher (J < H).
5. The ice-hockey player is on the left or right of the musical movie watcher (I). Since I is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position yet. Let's assume I is on the left for now (I_L).
6. The jet-ski driver is on the right of the bus driver (J > B).
7. The lacrosse player is on the far right (L).
8. The chess player is on the left of the dog owner (C < D).
9. The turtle owner is on the far left (T_F).
10. The rock-climber is the metal fan (R = M).
11. The rock-climber is on the left of the dubstep fan (R < D).
12. The ice-hockey player is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver (I_L or I_R > J).

Now let's place the elements we know:

|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | T         | P           | L        |
| Hobby         | C         | R           |          |
| Movie-Genre   |          |             | H        |
| Music-Genre   |          | D           | M        |
| Pet           | T_F       |             | D        |
| Sport         |          |             | I_L      |
| Transport     |          |             |          |

We have the following unknowns:
- Middle hobby
- Middle movie-genre
- Middle music-genre
- Middle pet
- Middle sport
- Middle transport

Let's place the middle hobby (let's say cooking, C_M):
- Since the chess player is on the left of the dog owner and the dog owner is on the left, the cooking person must be on the right of the dog owner (C_M > D).

Now let's place the middle movie-genre (let's say drama, D_M):
- Since the horror watcher is on the left of the jet-ski driver and the jet-ski driver is on the right of the bus driver, the drama watcher must be on the left of the bus driver (D_M < B).

Now let's place the middle music-genre (let's say gospel, G):
- Since the metal fan is on the left of the dubstep fan and the rock-climber is on the left of the dubstep fan, the gospel fan must be on the right of the rock-climber (G > R).

Now let's place the middle pet (let's say rabbit, R_M):
- Since the turtle owner is on the far left and the dog owner is on the left of the cooking person, the rabbit owner must be on the right of the cooking person (R_M > C_M).

Now let's place the middle sport (let's say sailing, S):
- Since the ice-hockey player is on the left or right of the jet-ski driver and the jet-ski driver is on the right of the bus driver, the sailing person must be on the left of the bus driver (S < B).

Now let's place the middle transport (let's say bus, B_M):
- Since the bus driver is on the left of the drama watcher and the drama watcher is on the left of the bus driver, the bus driver must be in the middle (B_M).

Now let's place the remaining elements:
- The remaining hobby must be rock-climbing (R).
- The remaining movie-genre must be musical (M_M).
- The remaining music-genre must be dubstep (D).
- The remaining pet must be the dog (D).
- The remaining sport must be lacrosse (L).

So the final solution table is:

Lv3-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 columns.

2. Let's start with the Beverages. Since there are 3 different beverages, we can fill in the first row with the options (coffee, hot-chocolate, milk).

3. Next, let's fill in the Food column. We know that the person eating lemon is on the far right, so we can place lemon in the rightmost column. The person eating apple is the person driving the quad-bike, so we can place apple in the column corresponding to quad-bike. This leaves pineapple for the middle column.

4. Now, let's fill in the Hobby column. The person doing magic-tricks is between the person driving the tram and the person watching disaster movies. Since we know the position of the tram and the disaster movies, we can place magic-tricks in the middle column. The person doing sudoku is between the person watching sports movies and the person drinking milk, so we can place sudoku in the leftmost column. This leaves board-games for the rightmost column.

5. Let's fill in the Job column. The dancer is on the far left or far right, so we can place dancer in either the leftmost or rightmost column. Since the software-developer is on the left of the person watching sports movies, and we know the position of sports movies, we can place software-developer in the middle column. This leaves dressmaker for the other column.

6. Now, let's fill in the Movie-Genre column. The person watching sports movies is between the person doing sudoku and the person drinking milk, so we can place sports in the middle column. The person watching disaster movies is between the person driving the tram and the person doing magic-tricks, so we can place disaster in the middle column. This leaves action for the leftmost column and sports for the rightmost column (since we already have sports in the middle).

7. Let's fill in the Sport column. The person playing handball is on the left of the person playing badminton, so we can place handball in the leftmost column and badminton in the middle column. The person playing ice-hockey is the person eating apple, so we already know its position. This leaves ice-hockey for the rightmost column.

8. Finally, let's fill in the Transport column. The person driving the tram is between the person watching disaster movies and the person doing magic-tricks, so we can place tram in the middle column. The person driving the quad-bike is the person eating apple, so we already know its position. This leaves boat for the leftmost column.

11. From point 8, the person driving the train is on the right of the dressmaker. Since we already placed D, let's place T to the right of D:

    |               |       C      |      Z      |       G      |

    | Transport     |   T        |            |             |

12. From point 9, the designer is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed T, let's place D on the far left:

    |               |       C      |      Z      |       G      |
    | Beverage      |   F        |            |   J         |

Since we didn't use F, we can't determine the job of the person in the first column. However, we have filled all other cells. So, the table for the remaining columns is:

   | Transport     | Helicopter  |            | Train        |

We can't determine the movie genre for the first person, but we have filled all other cells. So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows.

2. We know that each person has 3 different hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transport. So, we can fill in the first hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, and transport for each person.

3. From point 11, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the owner of the lizard. Since there are only 3 people, the person watching mystery movies must be in the first or second row. Let's assume the person watching mystery movies is in the first row. So, the first row is filled as follows:
   - Hobby: Reading (since the person driving the scooter is the person who's hobby is reading)
   - Movie-Genre: Mystery (assumption)
   - Music-Genre: Classical (since the fan of classical is the person who's hobby is dancing and we will assign dancing to the second row)
   - Nationality: Thai (since the thai is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball and we will assign volleyball to the third row)
   - Pet: Lizard (since the person watching mystery movies is the owner of the lizard)
   - Sport: Volleyball (since the thai is the person who's sport is volleyball and we assigned the thai to the first row)
   - Transport: Scooter (since the person who's hobby is reading is the person driving the scooter)

4. Now, we know that the person watching mystery movies is the person driving the scooter. So, the second row cannot be the person driving the scooter. Therefore, the second row must be the person driving the boat or motorbike. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the owner of the pony and the person driving the scooter is not the fan of classical (as we assigned classical to the first row), the second row must be the fan of metal. So, the second row is filled as follows:
   - Hobby: Dancing
   - Movie-Genre: Disaster (since the person watching disaster movies is the person who's hobby is video-games and we will assign video-games to the third row)
   - Music-Genre: Metal
   - Nationality: Spanish (since the spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading and we assigned reading to the first row)
   - Pet: Pony (since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the owner of the pony)
   - Sport: Parkour (since the person who's hobby is dancing is the fan of techno and we assigned techno to the turkish, who is in the third row)
   - Transport: Boat or Motorbike (we don't know yet)

5. Now, we know that the second row is the fan of metal. So, the third row must be the fan of classical. So, the third row is filled as follows:
   - Hobby: Video-games
   - Movie-Genre: Family (since the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the fan of metal and we know the fan of metal is in the second row)
   - Music-Genre: Classical
   - Nationality: Turkish (since the turkish is the fan of techno and we assigned techno to the person who's hobby is dancing, who is in the second row)
   - Pet: Hedgehog or Lizard (we don't know yet)
   - Sport: Weightlifting (since the thai is the person who's sport is weightlifting and we assigned the thai to the first row)
   - Transport: Motorbike or Scooter (we don't know yet)

6. From point 6 in the puzzle, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is in the second row and the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the third row, the person who's hobby is dancing must be on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, the third row must be on the right of the second row. Therefore, the third row is the person driving the motorbike. So, the final table is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |      3      |
   | Hobby         | Reading      | Dancing    | Video-games  |
   | Movie-Genre   | Mystery      | Disaster   | Family       |
   | Music-Genre   | Classical    | Metal      | Techno       |
   | Nationality   | Thai         | Spanish    | Turkish      |
   | Pet           | Lizard       | Pony       | Hedgehog     |
   | Sport         | Volleyball   | Parkour    | Weightlifting|
   | Transport     | Scooter      | Boat       | Motorbike    |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the filmmaker is on the far left or far right, so let's place them in the first or last column. Since the engineer is on the far right, the filmmaker cannot be in the last column. So, the filmmaker is in the first column.

2. The engineer is on the far right, so they are in the third column.

3. The goldfish owner is to the right of the person who draws. Since the filmmaker is in the first column, the goldfish owner cannot be in the first or third column. So, the goldfish owner is in the second column.

4. The person watching western movies is either in the first or third column. Since the goldfish owner is in the second column, the western movie fan cannot be in the second column. So, the western movie fan is in the first or third column. However, since the filmmaker is in the first column, the western movie fan cannot be in the first column. So, the western movie fan is in the third column.

5. Now we know that the filmmaker is in the first column, the goldfish owner is in the second column, and the western movie fan is in the third column. Since the engineer is in the third column, the hobby of the person in the second column must be drawing.

6. The hamster owner is between the fan of reggae and the analyst. Since the filmmaker, goldfish owner, and western movie fan are already placed, the only available spots for the hamster owner are the first and third columns. However, since the hamster owner is between the fan of reggae and the analyst, the hamster owner must be in the third column. The fan of reggae must be in the first column, and the analyst must be in the second column.

7. The person who plays basketball is on the left of the bartender. Since the filmmaker, goldfish owner, western movie fan, hamster owner, and reggae fan are already placed, the only available spots for the basketball player are the first and third rows. However, since the basketball player is on the left of the bartender, the basketball player must be in the first row. So, the bartender is in the second row.

8. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who cycles. Since the filmmaker, goldfish owner, western movie fan, hamster owner, reggae fan, and basketball player are already placed, the only available spots for the subway driver are the first and third rows. However, since the subway driver is on the left of the cyclist, the subway driver must be in the first row. So, the cyclist is in the third row.

9. The person watching epic movies is the person driving the bike. Since the filmmaker, goldfish owner, western movie fan, hamster owner, reggae fan, basketball player, and subway driver are already placed, the only available spot for the person watching epic movies is the second row.

10. The person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching western movies, so the person watching western movies must be in the third row.

11. The fan of funk is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the filmmaker, goldfish owner, western movie fan, hamster owner, reggae fan, basketball player, subway driver, cyclist, and person watching epic movies are already placed, the only available spots for the horse owner are the first and third columns. However, since the horse owner cannot be in the same column as the goldfish owner (because the goldfish owner is between the fan of reggae and the analyst), the horse owner must be in the first column. Since the horse owner is on the left of the person watching western movies, the fan of funk must be in the third column.
