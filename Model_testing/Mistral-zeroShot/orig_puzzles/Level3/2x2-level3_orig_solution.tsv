Lv3-2x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages (juice and tea) and two different foods (kiwi and lemon).

2. The person drinking tea is either on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Let's consider the possibilities:
   - If the person drinking tea is on the left, then the person drinking juice must be on the right. In this case, the table would look like this:
     | Beverage   | Tea   | Juice |
     | Food       | Kiwi  | Lemon |
   - If the person drinking tea is on the right, then the person drinking juice must be on the left. In this case, the table would look like this:
     | Beverage   | Juice | Tea   |
     | Food       | Lemon | Kiwi  |

3. The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea. Let's check both possibilities:
   - For the first table, the person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea, which is correct.
   - For the second table, the person eating lemon is not on the right of the person drinking tea, so this is not a valid arrangement.

So, the final solution is:

#############
| Beverage   | Tea   | Juice |
| Food       | Kiwi  | Lemon |

Lv3-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different sports (golf and surfing) and two different beverages (almond-milk and water).

2. The person who surfs is either to the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is on the far right, the surfer must be on the left.

3. Now, we know the positions of the surfer and the person drinking water. The only remaining positions are for the person playing golf and the person drinking almond-milk.

4. Since there are only two sports and they are different, the person playing golf must be on the other side of the person drinking water, which means they are on the far left.

5. Now we know the positions of the golf player and the person drinking water. The last position is for the person drinking almond-milk.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Golf    | Surfing |
|  Almond-Milk | Water |
#############
```

This table represents the positions of the beverages and sports, with the person drinking water on the far right and the surfer on the left. The person playing golf is on the far left, the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle, and the person drinking water is on the right."
Lv3-2x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different movie genres: sports and western. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. We also know that there are two different nationalities: French and Nigerian. Let's label them as F and N respectively.

3. The first person (row 1) watches a different genre from the second person (row 2), so we can write this as A for the first person and B for the second person.

4. The French is on the left of the person watching western movies. This means the French cannot be in the second row (since the second person watches a different genre). So, the French must be in the first row and watches sports (A).

5. Now, we know that the French is on the left of the person watching western movies. The only remaining position for the French is the leftmost position. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |    A    |     B     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports  | Western   |
   | Nationality   | French  |          |

6. Since the French is on the left of the person watching western movies, the second person (rightmost position) must be watching western movies (B).

7. The nationality of the second person is still unknown. It cannot be French because the French is already taken. The only remaining nationality is Nigerian (N).

8. So, the final table is:

   |               |    A    |     B     |
   | Movie-Genre   | Sports  | Western   |
   | Nationality   | French  | Nigerian |

So, the final solution table is:

#############

Lv3-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two different beverages (Fanta and Sprite) and two different foods (Apricot and Tomato).

2. The person eating Apricot is on the right of the person drinking Sprite. This means that the arrangement of the columns cannot be:

   | Beverage   | Food     |
   |-----------|---------|
   | Fanta     | Apricot |
   | Sprite    | Tomato  |

   because in this arrangement, the person eating Apricot (on the left) is not on the right of the person drinking Sprite.

   The only possible arrangement that satisfies this condition is:

   | Beverage   | Food     |
   |-----------|---------|
   | Sprite    | Apricot |
   | Fanta     | Tomato  |

3. The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed Fanta in the second row, it cannot be on the far left. So, it must be on the far right.

   | Beverage   | Food     |
   |-----------|---------|
   | Sprite    | Apricot |
   | Fanta     | Tomato  |

   Now, if Fanta is on the far right, Sprite must be on the far left.

   | Beverage   | Food     |
   |-----------|---------|
   | Sprite    | Apricot |
   | Fanta     | Tomato  |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different music genres: ambient and salsa. Let's label them as A and S respectively.

2. We also know that there are two different nationalities: American and Australian. Let's label them as A1 and A2 respectively.

3. The first person (row 1) can't be the fan of salsa because the Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa, and the only way to place the Australian on the right of S is if S is in row 2. So, the first person's genre is A (ambient).

4. Now we know that the second person (row 2) must be the fan of salsa, and the nationality of the second person can't be Australian because the Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa, and the only place left for the Australian is the first row, which is already occupied by the fan of ambient. So, the second person's nationality is A1 (American).

5. The nationality of the first person (row 1) is still unknown, but we know it's not Australian. So, it must be A2 (American).

6. Now we know that the first person is the fan of ambient, the second person is the fan of salsa, and their nationalities are A2 (American) and A1 (American) respectively.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
| Music-Genre | Nationality |
|------------|------------|
| Ambient    |   A2        |
| Salsa      |   A1        |

This table represents the solution to the puzzle."
Lv3-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different music genres: ambient and d&b. Let's assign A for ambient and D for d&b.

2. We know there are two different nationalities: Malaysian (M) and Mexican (X).

3. From point 1, we can create two possible initial tables:

   Table 1:
   |               |      A     |     D    |
   | Nationality   |          M |     X    |

   Table 2:
   |               |      D     |     A    |
   | Nationality   |          M |     X    |

4. From point 2, the Mexican is on the right of the Malaysian. This means that in both tables, X must be in the second column (Nationality 2).

5. Now, let's consider point 1 again, that the people prefer 2 different music-genres. Since the Mexican prefers a different genre than the Malaysian (as they are in different columns), the Malaysian must prefer the genre in the first column (either A or D).

6. If the Malaysian prefers A (Table 1), then the Mexican must prefer D (as they are in different columns). However, this violates the rule that the people prefer 2 different music-genres, as the Malaysian and Mexican would both prefer A or D.

7. If the Malaysian prefers D (Table 2), then the Mexican must prefer A. This satisfies the rule that the people prefer 2 different music-genres, as the Malaysian prefers D and the Mexican prefers A.

8. Therefore, the final solution table is:

   |               |      D     |     A    |
   | Nationality   |          M |     X    |

Lv3-2x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two nationalities (Malaysian and Thai) and two pets (Cat and Snake).

2. From point 1, we can create a list of all possible combinations:

   | Nationality   | Pet           |
   |--------------|--------------|
   | Malaysian    | Cat          |
   | Malaysian    | Snake        |
   | Thai         | Cat          |
   | Thai         | Snake        |

3. From point 2, we have four possible combinations. Now let's apply the given conditions:

4. The Thai is on the left or right of the Malaysian. This means that the Malaysian cannot be in the first column, so we can eliminate the first two combinations.

   | Nationality   | Pet           |
   |--------------|--------------|
   | Thai         | Cat          |
   | Thai         | Snake        |

5. The owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai. This means that the Snake must be in the first column.

   | Nationality   | Pet           |
   |--------------|--------------|
   | Thai         | Snake        |
   | Malaysian    | Cat          |

6. Now we have the final solution:

   |--------------|--------------|
   | Thai         | Snake        |
   | Malaysian    | Cat          |

Lv3-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people have 2 different hobbies, which are singing and woodworking. Let's denote the hobbies as H1 (singing) and H2 (woodworking).

2. We also know that the people have 2 different jobs, which are chef and manager. Let's denote the jobs as J1 (chef) and J2 (manager).

3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. This means that H1 cannot be in the first column, so H1 = singing and H2 = woodworking.

4. Now, let's consider the positions of the jobs. The manager is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. If the manager were in the first row, then the person with woodworking would have to be in the second row, which would mean the manager is on the right of the person with woodworking, contradicting the given condition. So, the manager cannot be in the first row.

5. This means the first row must be the chef, and the second row must be the manager. Since the manager is on the right or left of the person with woodworking, the only possible arrangement is:

   | Hobby   | H1 (Singing) | H2 (Woodworking) |
   |--------|--------------|------------------|
   | Job    | J2 (Manager) | J1 (Chef)        |

Lv3-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different beverages (coffee and iced-tea) and two different foods (avocado and papaya).

2. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that avocado cannot be in the first column (since there's no one to its left to drink iced-tea). So, avocado must be in the second column.

3. Now, let's place the iced-tea. Since avocado is in the second column, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the first column.

4. The person drinking coffee can now be placed in the remaining empty cell. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in the first column, the person drinking coffee can be either in the first or second column. However, we know that the person drinking coffee is either to the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in the first column, the person drinking coffee must be in the second column.

5. Finally, we place the food that's left, which is papaya. Since avocado is in the second column, papaya must be in the first column.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Iced-Tea | Avocado |
|   Coffee   |   Papaya|

Lv3-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different movie genres: comedy and musical. Let's denote C for comedy and M for musical.

2. Similarly, there are two different means of transport: quad-bike (Q) and van (V).

3. From the first rule, the people prefer 2 different movie genres, so we can't have both C or both M in the same row. Similarly, for transport, we can't have both Q or both V in the same row.

4. From the second rule, the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. This means that if a row has a C, it must be on the left of Q, and if a row has a Q, it must be on the right of C.

5. Now, let's consider the first row (Movie-Genre). If we place C in the first column, Q must be in the second column because of the second rule. But this would mean that the second column cannot have M because of the first rule. So, we can't have C in the first column.

6. If we place M in the first column, Q can be in the second column. In this case, the second column can have C because the first rule allows it. So, the first row is [M, C].

7. Now, let's consider the second row (Transport). Since the first row has Q, the second row must have V. But the position of the genres doesn't matter for the transport, so the second row is [V, _].

8. Now, we know the first row is [M, C] and the second row is [V, _]. So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Movie-Genre   |     1     |   2    |
| Transport     |           |        |
