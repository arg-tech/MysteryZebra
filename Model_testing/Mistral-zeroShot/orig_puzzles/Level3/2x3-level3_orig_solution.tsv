Lv3-2x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person watching adventure movies is the person driving the subway. So, we can place the subway driver in the Adventure row and the Adventure column. Let's put it in the first row and first column.

   | Adventure   |   |   |
   |------------|--|--|
   | Subway     |   |   |
   |           |   |   |

2. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the subway is in the first row and first column, the taxi driver must be in the second row and either the first or second column.

   | Adventure   |   |   |
   |------------|--|--|
   | Subway     | Taxi|   |
   |           |   |   |

3. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the taxi driver is already placed, we know that the mystery movie watcher must be in the third column.

   | Adventure   |   | Mystery |
   |------------|--|--------|
   | Subway     | Taxi|   |
   |           |   |   |

4. The person driving the subway is on the far left. Since the subway driver is already in the first column, the other two people must be in the second and third columns.

   | Adventure   |   | Mystery |
   |------------|--|--------|
   | Subway     | Taxi| Snowmobile|
   |           |   |   |

5. Now, we know that the person watching scientific movies is the one driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver must be in the third column, and the mystery movie watcher is already there, the scientific movie watcher must be in the second column.

   | Adventure   |   | Mystery |
   |------------|--|--------|
   | Subway     | Taxi| Snowmobile|
   | Scientific |   |   |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
| Adventure   |   | Mystery |
|------------|--|--------|
| Subway     | Taxi| Snowmobile|
| Scientific |   |   |

Lv3-2x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who prefers golf is on the left of the person who prefers handball. Let's place golf on the far left (1st column) and handball in the 2nd column. So, the sports column looks like this: `| Golf | Handball | ______ |`

2. The pilot is on the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman can't be in the first column (because golf is there), the fisherman must be in the 3rd column. The pilot can't be in the 3rd column because of the next condition (the golf player is on the far left or far right), so the pilot must be in the 1st column. So, the jobs column looks like this: `| Pilot | ______ | Fisherman |`

3. Now, the golf player must be on the far right. Since the pilot is in the 1st column, the golf player must be in the 3rd column. So, the sports column looks like this: `| Golf | Handball | Ice-hockey |`

4. The librarian is the person who prefers ice-hockey. Since we already know the jobs and sports of the other two people, the librarian must be in the 3rd column. So, the jobs column looks like this: `| Pilot | Librarian | Fisherman |`

So, the final solution table is:

```
|#############|
| Pilot      | Librarian | Fisherman |
| Golf       | Handball  | Ice-hockey |
#############|
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv3-2x3-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people have 3 different jobs and 3 different music-genres, so we can fill in the jobs and music-genres in the table without repetition. Let's start with the jobs.

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Paramedic | Videographer |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues     | R&B      | Techno     | (We don't know the music-genres yet)

2. The fan of r&b is on the far left or far right. Since the accountant is on the far right, the fan of r&b cannot be on the far right. So, the fan of r&b must be on the far left.

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Paramedic | Videographer |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues     | Techno    | R&B        |

3. The paramedic is the fan of techno, so we have filled in the paramedic's row correctly.

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Paramedic | Videographer |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues     | Techno    | R&B        |

4. The fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of techno. Since the fan of r&b is on the far left, the videographer must be the fan of blues.

   |               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
   | Job           | Accountant | Paramedic | Videographer |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues     | Techno    | R&B        |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of video-games is either to the left or right of the person with the hobby of fishing. Let's assume the video-games person is on the left (VG-L) and the fishing person is on the right (F-R). If the video-games person was on the right, we would have a contradiction with rule 1.

2. Now, the owner of the fish is between the person with the hobby of video-games and the owner of the mouse. Since the fish owner is between VG-L and the mouse owner, the mouse owner must be on the right (M-R).

3. Now we know that the hobbies are arranged as follows: F-R, VG-L, M-R. But we don't know the exact order of the pets. Let's try the following arrangement for the pets: F, M, VG. This arrangement doesn't violate any rules.

4. However, if we try to arrange the pets as VG, F, M, we would have a contradiction with rule 3 because the fish owner would be to the left of the mouse owner, not between them.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |      1      |    2    |   3    |
| Hobby   | baking/fishing/video-games | fish | guinea-pig |
| Pet     | ######## | fish | guinea-pig |

We can't definitively determine the hobbies for each person, but we know the order of the pets is fish, guinea-pig. The hobbies could be any combination of baking, fishing, and video-games as long as they are in the correct order (baking on the left, fishing in the middle, and video-games on the right)."
Lv3-2x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Let's assume the taxi is on the right of action movies for now.

   |   | Action | Disaster | Family |
   |---|---|--------|--------|
   | Transport |   |         |         |

   Since the taxi is on the right of action movies, the action movies person cannot be on the rightmost seat. So, the arrangement must be:

   |   | Disaster | Action | Family |
   |---|---|--------|--------|
   | Transport |   |         |         |

2. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship. This means the subway cannot be on the rightmost seat. So, the arrangement must be:

   |   | Disaster | Action | Subway | Ship |
   |---|---|--------|--------|-------|
   | Transport | Taxi |         |         |         |

3. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching action movies. But we already placed the taxi on the rightmost seat. This contradicts the third rule. So, let's assume the taxi is on the left of action movies instead.

   |   | Disaster | Action | Subway | Ship |
   |---|---|--------|--------|-------|
   | Transport | Taxi |         |         |         |

4. The person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi. This means the arrangement must be:

   |   | Disaster | Taxi | Action | Subway | Ship |
   |---|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
   | Transport |         | Taxi |         |         |         |

5. Now, we need to fill in the transport. Since the subway is on the left of the ship, the subway cannot be on the leftmost seat. So, the arrangement must be:

   |   | Disaster | Taxi | Action | Subway | Ship |
   |---|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
   | Transport |         | Taxi |         | Subway | Ship |

6. Finally, the person watching family movies must be on the leftmost seat.

   |   | Disaster | Taxi | Action | Subway | Ship |
   |---|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
   | Transport | Family | Taxi | Action | Subway | Ship |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the lawyer is on the left of the accountant. Let's assume the lawyer is in the first column (Column 1) and the accountant is in the second column (Column 2).

2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the lawyer and accountant are already placed, the only possible hobby for the first column is baking, and the hobby for the second column must be chess.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since we have already placed baking and chess, traveling can only be in Column 1 or Column 3. However, since the lawyer is in Column 1, traveling cannot be in Column 1 as it would violate the condition that the lawyer is not a traveler. So, traveling must be in Column 3.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the engineer. Since we have already placed baking and traveling, the only possible position for the engineer is in Column 2.

5. Now, we know that the jobs are accountant, engineer, and lawyer. We have already placed the accountant and the lawyer. So, the engineer must be in the third row.

6. Since the hobby of the engineer is not specified yet, it can be any of the three hobbies. However, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking, and the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the engineer. So, the hobby of the engineer cannot be chess or traveling, leaving us with baking as the only possible hobby for the engineer. But this would mean that the engineer is doing the same hobby as the person in the first column, which violates the condition that all hobbies are different.

Therefore, the given conditions lead to a contradiction, and it's impossible to solve this puzzle with the given conditions.

Final solution table:

  |         |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Hobby   | baking   | chess  | traveling  |
| Job     | lawyer   | accountant | engineer  |

However, this solution violates the condition that all hobbies are different, so there is no valid solution for this puzzle with the given conditions."
Lv3-2x3-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three music genres (funk, rock, techno) and three nationalities (Australian, Dutch, Malaysian). We also know that each person prefers a unique genre and each nationality is represented only once.

2. Let's assign the nationalities to the rows and the genres to the columns. Since we don't have any information about the top row yet, let's fill it with any nationality (for example, Dutch).

   |               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk  | Rock     | Techno    |
   | Nationality   | Dutch | Australian| Malaysian |

3. Now let's use the information that the fan of techno is on the right of the Dutch. This means the Malaysian cannot be in the third column (Techno), so the Malaysian must be in the first or second column (Funk or Rock).

   |               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk  | Rock     | Techno    |
   | Nationality   | Dutch | Australian| Malaysian |

4. The Malaysian is on the left of the fan of funk. This means the Malaysian cannot be in the first column (Funk), so the Malaysian must be in the second column (Rock).

   |               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk  | Rock     | Techno    |
   | Nationality   | Dutch | Malaysian| Australian|

5. Now we know the Malaysian is in the second column (Rock), and the fan of techno is on the right of the Dutch. This means the techno fan must be in the third column (Techno).

   |               |   1   |     2     |     3      |
   | Music-Genre   | Funk  | Rock     | Techno    |
   | Nationality   | Dutch | Malaysian| Australian|

6. Finally, the malaysian is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since the Malaysian is already in the second column (Rock), this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-2x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking cola is the person eating grapes. Let's place them in the first row and first column (since the person eating grapes must be on the left or right of the person drinking fanta, we'll place them in the first column for now). So, the first row and first column will be:

   | Beverage   | Food       |
   |-----------|-----------|
   | Cola      | Grapes    |

2. The person eating orange is in the middle. Since the first column is already occupied, the second column must be orange.

   | Beverage   | Food       | Food       |
   |-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Cola      | Grapes    | Orange    |

3. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since we don't know the position of the person drinking fanta yet, we can't place the milk yet.

4. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since we have already placed the person eating grapes in the first column, the person drinking fanta can only be in the second or third column. However, since the person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta, the person drinking fanta cannot be in the third column (as that would place the milk in the second column, violating the rule that the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes). So, the person drinking fanta must be in the second column.

   | Beverage   | Food       | Food       |
   |-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Cola      | Grapes    | Orange    |
   |           |           | Fanta     |

5. Now we know the person drinking fanta is in the second column, so the person drinking milk must be in the first column.

   | Beverage   | Food       | Food       |
   |-----------|-----------|-----------|
   | Cola      | Grapes    | Orange    |
   | Milk      |           | Fanta     |

6. Now we have only one position left (the third row, third column), so the person eating pomegranate must be there.

Lv3-2x3-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are three jobs (fisherman, nurse, teacher) and three music-genres (disco, R&B, techno), we can assign one job to each row and one music-genre to each column.

2. Let's start with the first row (Job 1). Since the fisherman is not on the extreme left or right (from rule 1), he can't be in the first or third column (disco, techno). So, he must be in the second column (R&B). Now we know that Job 1 is a teacher (since the fisherman is left of the teacher, and the teacher can't be in the first column because the fisherman is not on the extreme left).

3. Now let's fill the second row (Job 2). Since the fan of disco is on the left of the teacher (Job 1), Job 2 can't be in the first column (disco). So, Job 2 must be in the third column (techno). Now we know that Job 2 is the nurse (since the nurse is on the right of the fan of techno).

4. Finally, let's fill the third row (Job 3). Since the nurse is in the third column, Job 3 can't be the nurse. So, Job 3 must be the fisherman (since the fisherman is not the nurse and is the only option left). Now we know that Job 3 is the fisherman (in the first column, which means he is a fan of R&B).

5. Since the fisherman is on the left or right of the nurse, the nurse must be in the middle. So, the final solution is:

```
#############
|   Fisherman| Nurse | Teacher |
|   R&B      |       |         |

2. The person drinking water is not in the middle position, so they are either in the first or the third position as well.

3. The person watching scientific movies is on the far right, so they must be in the third position.

4. Now, since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching animation movies, and the person watching animation movies is in the first or third position, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the second position.

5. Since the person drinking water is not in the middle position, they must be in the first position.

6. The genre of the person in the second position is not known yet, but it cannot be animation since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the animation person. It also cannot be scientific since the person watching scientific movies is in the third position. So, it must be a new genre, let's call it 'drama'.
