Lv3-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking coffee is the owner of the pony and is on the far right, we can place coffee in the last column and the pony in the last row. Let's place coffee in row 5 and pony in column 5.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the train driver cannot be in the last column (as the coffee drinker is there), the soy-milk drinker must be in the first or second column. Also, the soy-milk drinker is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the hot-chocolate drinker must be in the second or third column. Let's place hot-chocolate in column 3. Now, the soy-milk drinker can only be in column 1 or 2.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the soy-milk drinker must be in column 2.

4. The person drinking fanta is the person driving the van. Since the van driver cannot be in the last row (as the pony owner is there), the fanta drinker must be in the first, second, or third row. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the guinea-pig owner must be in the second or third row. Let's place the guinea-pig in row 3. Now, the fanta drinker can only be in row 1 or 2. Let's place fanta in row 1.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the mexican. Since the mexican is in column 3, the nationality in column 5 must be either canadian or indian. The person drinking coffee is on the far right, so the nationality in column 4 must be either colombian, french, or indian. The french is on the left or right of the canadian, so the canadian must be in column 1 or 5. Let's place the canadian in column 1. Now, the french can only be in column 5.

6. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is not in the last column (as the pony owner is there), the goat owner must be in column 2, 3, or 4. The french is on the left of the owner of the goat, so the goat owner must be in column 4. Now, the hot-chocolate drinker can only be in column 5.

7. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the indian. Since the indian is in column 4, the coffee drinker must be in column 5.

8. The owner of the goldfish is the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter driver cannot be in the last row (as the pony owner is there), the goldfish owner must be in the first, second, or third row. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the canadian, so the canadian must be in column 1 or 5. Let's place the canadian in column 1. Now, the scooter driver can only be in row 2 or 3. Let's place the scooter driver in row 2.

9. The owner of the fish is the person driving the bike. Since the bike driver cannot be in the last row (as the pony owner is there), the fish owner must be in the first, second, or third row. The person driving the bike is on the left or right of the canadian, so the canadian must be in column 1. Now, the fish owner can only be in row 1 or 2. Let's place the fish owner in row 1.

10. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the goat, so the goat owner must be in column 4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the goldfish, so the goldfish must be in column 3.

11. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the guinea-pig owner must be in column 2. The french is on the left or right of the canadian, so the canadian must be in column 1. Since the french is in column 5, the canadian must be in column 1, and the french is on the right of the canadian, the french must be in column 2.

12. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the goat, so the goat owner must be in column 4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the goldfish, so the goldfish must be in column 3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the soy-milk drinker must be in column 4.

13. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the indian, so the indian must be in column 4. The person drinking coffee is the owner of the pony, so the pony must be in row 5.

14. The french is on the left of the owner of the goat, so the goat owner must be in column 3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the goldfish, so the goldfish must be in column 2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the soy-milk drinker must be in column 3.

Now, let's put everything together:

| Beverage      | coffee   | fanta    | hot-chocolate | soy-milk | mirinda |
| Nationality   | canadian | french   | mexican      | indian   | colombian |
| Pet           | pony    | guinea-pig | goldfish   | fish    | goat    |

Lv3-4x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 items in each category, so we can label them A to E for each category (Food, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Transport).

2. From point 1, the person eating eggplant is in the middle, so Food column is Eggplant, Cabbage, ______, ______, Radish.

3. The person eating artichoke is on the right of the person eating eggplant, so Food column is Eggplant, Cabbage, Artichoke, ______, Radish.

4. The malaysian is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the person eating radish is the person driving the trike (point 6), the malaysian can be either A, C, D, or E. Let's assume the malaysian is A for now. So, Nationality column is Argentine, Dutch, Egyptian, Malaysian, German.

5. The person driving the subway is between the person watching family movies and the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is the person eating artichoke (point 14), the subway driver cannot be A or E. So, the subway driver is either B or C. Let's assume the subway driver is B. So, Movie-Genre column is Crime, Family, ______, Zombie, Martial-arts.

6. The person eating radish is the person driving the trike (point 6), so Transport column is _______, _______, _______, Subway, Trike.

7. The german is between the person driving the skateboard and the egyptian (points 7 and 8). Since the subway driver is B and the malaysian is A, the german cannot be A or B. So, the german is either C, D, or E. Let's assume the german is C. So, Nationality column is Argentine, Dutch, Egyptian, German, Malaysian.

8. Now, the person watching crime movies is between the person driving the scooter and the malaysian (point 10). Since the subway driver is B and the malaysian is A, the person watching crime movies cannot be A or B. So, the person watching crime movies is either C, D, or E. Let's assume the person watching crime movies is D. So, Movie-Genre column is Crime, Family, Martial-arts, Zombie, Crime.

9. The person eating lettuce is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard (point 13). Since the malaysian is A and the german is C, the person driving the skateboard cannot be A or C. So, the person driving the skateboard is either B or D. Let's assume the person driving the skateboard is D. So, Transport column is _______, Scooter, Skateboard, Subway, Trike.

10. The person watching zombie movies is the person eating artichoke (point 14), so Movie-Genre column is Crime, Family, Martial-arts, Artichoke, Crime.

11. The person eating radish is the person driving the trike (point 6), so Food column is Eggplant, Cabbage, Artichoke, Lettuce, Radish.

12. The german is on the left or right of the egyptian (points 7, 8, and 11), so Nationality column is Argentine, Dutch, Egyptian, German, Malaysian.

13. The dutch is on the far right (point 9), so Nationality column is Argentine, Dutch, Egyptian, German, Malaysian.

14. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far right (point 12), so Movie-Genre column is Crime, Family, Martial-arts, Artichoke, Crime.

15. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the argentine (point 15), so Food column is Eggplant, Cabbage, Artichoke, Lettuce, Radish.

Now, we have all the information filled in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |     4     |      5       |
| Food          | Eggplant   | Cabbage | Artichoke| Lettuce   | Radish       |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime      | Family  | Martial-arts| Zombie   | Crime       |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Dutch   | Egyptian  | German   | Malaysian   |
| Transport     | _______   | Scooter | Skateboard| Subway   | Trike       |

However, we still have some empty spots in the Transport column. To fill them, we need to find the person driving the roller and the scooter. Since the person watching crime movies is between the person driving the scooter and the malaysian (point 10), the person driving the scooter cannot be A or B. So, the person driving the scooter is either C, D, or E. Let's assume the person driving the scooter is E. So, Transport column is Roller, Scooter, Skateboard, Subway, Trike.

Finally, the person driving the roller must be the argentine (since the person eating lettuce is on the right of the argentine and there are no more spots to the right), so Transport column is Roller, Scooter, Skateboard, Subway, Trike.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv3-4x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 3, we know that the person driving the bike is on the left of the person driving the car. Let's place the car driver in position 3 and the bike driver in position 2.

2. From point 2, the person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the van. Since the car is in position 3, the van must be in position 1 or 5. If the van were in position 1, the boat would be in position 2, but that would violate point 3. So, the van must be in position 5. Therefore, the boat is in position 4.

3. From point 1, the person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the boat is in position 4, the pumpkin eater must be in position 3 or 5. But if the pumpkin eater were in position 3, it would violate point 12. So, the pumpkin eater must be in position 5.

4. From point 5, the person eating cranberry is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the pumpkin eater is in position 5, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if the iced-tea drinker were in position 1, it would violate point 7. So, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 2. Therefore, the cranberry eater is in position 3.

5. From point 7, the person driving the bike is the person drinking iced-tea. Since the iced-tea drinker is in position 2, the bike driver is also in position 2. This means the car driver is in position 3.

6. From point 6, the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the cranberry eater is in position 3, the apricot eater can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. But if the apricot eater were in position 1, it would violate point 12. If the apricot eater were in position 5, it would violate point 3. So, the apricot eater must be in position 4.

7. From point 8, the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver (woodworking hobby) is in position 5, the woodworking person must be in position 1.

8. From point 9, the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the woodworking person is in position 1, the drawing person must be in position 5.

9. From point 10, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since the drawing person is in position 5, the cola drinker must be in position 3.

10. From point 11, the person drinking cola is the person driving the car. This is a contradiction because we already placed the car driver in position 3. So, the cola drinker cannot be the car driver. This means the cola drinker must be in position 4.

11. From point 13, the person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since the drawing person (mirinda drinker) is in position 5, the kale eater must be in position 1.

12. From point 12, the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person eating kale. Since the kale eater is in position 1, the coffee drinker must be in position 2.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Beverage    | coffee | cola  | fanta | iced-tea | mirinda |
| Food        | kale   |       |        | pumpkin  | apricot |
| Hobby       | chess  | drawing| fishing | woodworking|         |

Lv3-4x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A, B, C, D, E from left to right.

2. We know that each column represents a different category (Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Sport).

3. Let's start with the pets. From rule 5, the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the rat is on the right of the hedgehog (rule 6), the hedgehog must be on the far left (A). So, A has a hedgehog. From rule 12, the owner of the mouse is either A or B. Let's assume A has the mouse for now. This leaves B with the rat (from rule 11).

4. From rule 3, the fan of blues is on the far right. Since A has the hedgehog on the far left, C must have blues (C has the far right spot).

5. From rule 4, the fan of reggae is on the left of the fan of blues. So, B must have reggae.

6. From rule 3, the fan of d&b is to the left of the fan of blues. So, D has d&b.

7. From rule 14, the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since C has d&b, E must have superhero movies.

8. From rule 7, the person watching documentary movies is in the middle. So, E has documentary movies.

9. From rule 9 and 10, the person who's sport is handball is on the left of A (hedgehog owner) and on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since A has the hedgehog and E has superhero movies, B must have martial-arts movies. So, B has martial-arts movies and handball.

10. From rule 8, the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Since B has martial-arts movies, D must have musical movies and volleyball (from rule 2). So, D has musical movies and volleyball.

11. From rule 2, the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. Since D has d&b, C must have volleyball.

12. From rule 6, the owner of the rat is the person who's sport is cricket. Since B has martial-arts and volleyball, A must have cricket.

13. From rule 13, the person who's sport is handball is the person watching western movies. Since B has martial-arts and volleyball, E must have western movies and soccer (since handball and soccer are different sports).

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   A       |   B    |   C    |   D     |   E      |

|  Cricket   |  Martial-Arts | Volleyball |  Musical  |  Superhero  |

|  -        |  -       |  -      |  -       |  Soccer    |
#############
```

The missing values in E's row can be filled once we know the missing movie genre for E. Since we know that E watches superhero movies, we can deduce that E's music genre is house (since the owner of the rat is on the right of the fan of house, and B has reggae and C has blues, so D has musical and A has cricket, leaving E with house). So, the final table is:

```

Lv3-4x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so we can fill in the number of rows in the table.

2. From rule 5, we know that the person eating blueberry is the same as the person drinking hot-chocolate. Let's denote this as B = HC.

3. From rule 2, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right. Since there are 5 people, the person drinking water (W) must be on the far left.

4. From rule 12, we know that the architect (A) is on the left of the person drinking milk (M). Since W is on the far left, A cannot be in the first column. So, A must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

5. From rule 9, we know that A is the person drinking water. But this contradicts rule 4, as A cannot be in the first column. So, there seems to be a contradiction in rules 4 and 9. We'll come back to this.

6. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the bike (Bike) is on the left of the person eating spinach (Spinach). Since W is on the far left, Spinach cannot be in the first column. So, Spinach must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

7. From rule 11, we know that the person driving the car (Car) is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee (Coffee). Since W is on the far left, Coffee cannot be in the first column. So, Coffee must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

8. From rule 13, we know that Car is on the left of the analyst (Analyst). Since W is on the far left, Analyst cannot be in the first column. So, Analyst must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

9. From rule 14, we know that Bike is the scientist (Scientist). Since W is on the far left, Scientist cannot be in the first column. So, Scientist must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

10. Now, let's revisit the contradiction we found in rules 4 and 9. If A is the person drinking water, then A must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. But if A is in the second, third, or fourth column, then the person drinking water must be in the fifth column. However, the person drinking water is the architect, which contradicts rule 4 (A being on the left of M). The only way to resolve this is if A is in the fifth column and M is in the first column.

11. With A in the fifth column, W is in the first column. This means that Coffee, Car, and Scientist (Bike) cannot be in the first column. So, Coffee, Car, and Scientist must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column.

12. Since Coffee is not in the first column, it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. If Coffee is in the second column, then Bike (Scientist) must be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 14. So, Coffee must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

13. If Coffee is in the third column, then Car must be in the fifth column. But this would mean that Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the second column, which contradicts rule 14. So, Coffee cannot be in the third column.

14. If Coffee is in the fourth column, then Car must be in the second column. But this would mean that Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 14. So, Coffee cannot be in the fourth column.

15. Therefore, Coffee must be in the fifth column. This means that Car must be in the second column, and Bike (Scientist) must be in the third column.

16. Now, let's place the food. Since Spinach cannot be in the first column, it must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. If Spinach is in the second column, then Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the fourth column, which contradicts rule 6. So, Spinach must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

17. If Spinach is in the third column, then Car would have to be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 6. So, Spinach cannot be in the third column.

18. If Spinach is in the fourth column, then Car would have to be in the second column, and Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the fifth column. But this would mean that the person eating onion (Onion) would have to be in the third column, drinking coffee (Coffee). However, rule 7 states that Onion is on the left of Coffee, which is not possible in this arrangement. So, Spinach cannot be in the fourth column.

19. Therefore, Spinach must be in the fifth column. This means that Car must be in the second column, and Bike (Scientist) must be in the third column.

20. Now, let's place the remaining food. Since Blueberry (B) is the same as Hot-Chocolate (HC), B must be in the first column.

21. The only remaining food is Onion. Since Onion is not on the left of Coffee (Coffee is in the fifth column), Onion must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. If Onion is in the second column, then Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the fourth column, which contradicts rule 7. So, Onion must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

22. If Onion is in the third column, then Car would have to be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 7. So, Onion cannot be in the third column.

23. If Onion is in the fourth column, then Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the second column, which contradicts rule 6. So, Onion cannot be in the fourth column.

24. Therefore, Onion must be in the fifth column.

25. The only remaining food is Pomegranate. Since Pomegranate is not on the right of the person drinking water (Architect is in the fifth column), Pomegranate must be in the second, third, or fourth column.

26. If Pomegranate is in the second column, then Bike (Scientist) would have to be in the fourth column, which contradicts rule 6. So, Pomegranate cannot be in the second column.

27. If Pomegranate is in the third column, then Car would have to be in the fifth column, which contradicts rule 11. So, Pomegranate cannot be in the third column.

28. Therefore, Pomegranate must be in the fourth column.

Now, the final solution table is:

|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |    4    |       5       |
| Beverage    | Hot-Chocolate | Car | Onion | Pomegranate | Water |
| Food        | Blueberry | Spinach |           |           |           |

| Transport   | Bike | Car |           |           |           |

However, the jobs and the means of transport are not fully determined due to the lack of specific information in the puzzle. The only definitive positions are the beverages and the food. The jobs and means of transport can be arranged in various ways without violating the given rules."
Lv3-4x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them P1 to P5 from left to right.

2. We know the nationalities, jobs, movie-genres, and transport. Let's fill in the nationalities first:
   - P1: Argentine
   - P2: British
   - P3: Dutch
   - P4: German
   - P5: Thai

3. Now let's fill in the jobs:
   - P1: Paramedic (since the paramedic is on the left of the Argentine)
   - P2: Entrepreneur (since the entrepreneur watches adventure movies)
   - P3: Firefighter (since the firefighter watches fantasy movies)
   - P4: Engineer (since the engineer is on the right of the person watching spy movies and on the left of the musician)
   - P5: Musician (since the musician is on the right of the firefighter and on the left of the person watching spy movies)

4. Now let's fill in the movie-genres:
   - P1: Fantasy (since the firefighter watches fantasy movies)
   - P2: Adventure (since the entrepreneur watches adventure movies)
   - P3: Spy (since the person watching spy movies is the German)
   - P4: Not determined yet (since the engineer is on the right of the person watching spy movies, but we don't know what they watch)
   - P5: Not determined yet (since the musician is on the right of the person watching spy movies, but we don't know what they watch)

5. Now let's fill in the transport:
   - P1: Not determined yet (since the paramedic is on the left or right of the engineer and the argentine, but we don't know where they are)
   - P2: Not determined yet (since the entrepreneur's transport is not specified)
   - P3: Not determined yet (since the Dutch is on the right of the person driving the tram, but we don't know who that is)
   - P4: Not determined yet (since the engineer is on the right of the person driving the airplane, but we don't know who that is)
   - P5: Not determined yet (since the musician is on the right of the person driving the airplane, but we don't know who that is)

6. Now let's use the remaining clues to fill in the transport:
   - P2 drives the tram (since the Dutch is on the right of the person driving the tram)
   - P4 drives the airplane (since the engineer is on the right of the person driving the airplane)
   - P5 drives the bus (since the musician is on the right of the person driving the airplane, and the only remaining option is bus)
   - P3 drives the taxi (since the Dutch is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi)
   - P1 drives the ship (since the person driving the ship is on the far left)

7. Now let's fill in the remaining movie-genres:
   - P4 watches animation movies (since the engineer is on the left of the musician, and the only remaining option for the engineer is animation)
   - P5 watches martial-arts movies (since the musician is on the right of the person watching spy movies, and the only remaining option for the musician is martial-arts)

8. Now we have a complete solution:

   |               |      1       |     2     |      3       |     4     |      5      |

Lv3-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the French is not the boat driver (as per point 2), they cannot be in the first two columns. So, the French must be in columns 3, 4, or 5.

2. The boat driver is to the left of the French (point 2), so they can only be in columns 1 or 2. Let's assume the boat driver is in column 1 for now.

3. The person driving the train is to the right of the bartender (point 3), so the bartender must be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume the bartender is in column 1 for now.

4. The person watching scientific movies is to the left of the Argentine (point 4), so they can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume they are in column 1 for now.

5. The mechanic is on the left or right of the security-guard (point 5), and the mechanic is also to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (point 8). Since the mechanic can't be in column 1 (as they are either left or right of the security-guard), they must be in column 2 or 3. Let's assume the mechanic is in column 2 for now.

6. The mexican is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (point 6), so the mexican can be in columns 1, 2, or 3. Since the mexican is also the person watching fantasy movies (point 9), they cannot be in column 1 (as they are to the left of the person watching zombie movies). So, the mexican must be in columns 2 or 3. Let's assume the mexican is in column 2 for now.

7. The chef is on the far left (point 7), so they must be in column 1.

8. The mechanic is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (point 8), so the mechanic must be in column 2.

9. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the chef (point 10), and the chef is in column 1. So, the person driving the bus can be in columns 1 or 2. Let's assume the person driving the bus is in column 2 for now.

10. The mexican is the person watching fantasy movies (point 9), so they are in column 2. This means the person watching zombie movies must be in column 3.

11. The chef is on the left or right of the russian (point 11), and the chef is in column 1. So, the russian can be in columns 2 or 3. Let's assume the russian is in column 3 for now.

12. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat (point 12), and the boat driver is in column 1. So, the person watching time-travel movies can be in columns 2 or 3. Let's assume the person watching time-travel movies is in column 2 for now.

13. The person driving the helicopter is the videographer (point 13), so they must be in column 4 or 5.

14. The only remaining person is the security-guard. Since they are not in column 1 (as they are either left or right of the mechanic), they must be in column 2 or 3. But we already placed the mexican and the person watching time-travel movies in column 2, so the security-guard must be in column 3.

Now, let's arrange the remaining jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, and transport:

|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |       4        |      5       |
| Job           | Chef     | Mexicans  | Security-guard| Time-travel | Videographer |
| Movie-Genre   |         | Fantasy   |               | Time-travel  |              |
| Nationality   | Argentine| Brazilian | Mexican      | French       | Russian      |
| Transport     | Boat     | Bus       | Train        | Helicopter   | Jet-ski      |

However, we don't have the movie genre for the chef and the nationality for the person driving the bus. Since the chef is on the far left (point 7), they must be watching a movie genre that is also on the far left. The only genre left is romance. So, the final table is:

Lv3-4x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the person who has the hobby of woodworking (woodworker) on the far left (position 1) as per condition 4. Since the musician is the woodworker (condition 7), the musician is in position 1.

2. Place the person who drinks juice (juice) next to the musician (condition 5). So, the juice drinker is in position 2. Since the techno fan drinks juice (condition 1), the techno fan is in position 2.

3. Place the person who drinks water (water) on the far left (position 1) as per condition 8. This contradicts condition 4, so water cannot be in position 1. Let's assume water is in position 5 for now.

4. Place the person who drinks iced-tea (iced-tea) to the left of the project-manager (condition 9). Since the project-manager is on the left of the dressmaker (condition 12), the project-manager is in position 3. So, the iced-tea drinker is in position 2.

5. Place the person who drinks milk (milk) to the left or right of the juice drinker (condition 5). Since the milk drinker cannot be in position 1 (as it's already occupied by water), the milk drinker is in position 4.

6. Place the person who drinks mirinda (mirinda) to the right of the person who reads (condition 15). Since the person who reads cannot be in position 1 (as it's occupied by the woodworker), the reader is in position 3. So, the mirinda drinker is in position 4.

7. Place the person who reads (reading) in position 3 as per the previous step.

8. Place the person who has the hobby of collecting (collecting) to the left or right of the punk fan (condition 11). Since the punk fan cannot be in position 1 (as it's occupied by the woodworker), the punk fan is in position 2. So, the collector is in position 4 or 5.

9. Place the person who has the hobby of dancing (dancing) to the left or right of the project-manager (condition 13). Since the project-manager is in position 3, the dancer is in position 2 or 4.

10. Place the person who has the hobby of board-games to the left of the collector (as the collector is in position 4 or 5). Since the collector is in position 4, the board-games person is in position 3.

11. Place the person who has the hobby of salsa to the left of the freelancer (condition 14). Since the freelancer is on the right of the woodworker (condition 10), the freelancer is in position 5. So, the salsa fan is in position 4.

12. Place the person who has the hobby of reading in position 3 as per the previous steps.

13. Place the person who has the hobby of punk in position 2 as per the previous steps.

14. Since the engineer is on the far left or far right (condition 6), the engineer is either in position 1 or 5. However, the engineer cannot be in position 1 (as it's already occupied by the woodworker), so the engineer is in position 5.

15. Since the project-manager is on the left of the iced-tea drinker (condition 9), the project-manager is in position 2.

16. Since the dressmaker is on the left of the project-manager (condition 12), the dressmaker is in position 1.

17. Since the freelancer is on the right of the woodworker (condition 10), the freelancer is in position 5.

18. Since the salsa fan is in position 4, the person who has the hobby of board-games is in position 3.

1. Since the Russian is in the middle, we can fill the Nationality column with the following order: ________, Russian, ________.

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Russian, so the first Nationality is either Colombian or German. Since the German can be on the left or right of the fan of classical, let's assume the first Nationality is Colombian for now: Colombian, Russian, ________.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the Colombian, so the third Nationality is German: Colombian, Russian, German.

4. The fan of classical is on the far left, so the first Music-Genre is Classical: Classical, ________, ________.

Lv3-4x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Chinese drinks tea and is on the left of the American, we can place them in the first two spots. Let's assume the Chinese is in the first spot (1) and the American is in the second spot (2).

2. The Dutch is the person who's hobby is skydiving, so we can place the Dutch in the spot corresponding to skydiving. Since the Dutch is on the far right, the hobby column must be the last column (5). So, the Dutch is in the 5th row.

3. The Australian is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Chinese (tea) is already in the first spot, the Australian must be in the second spot (2), and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the third spot (3).

4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the Australian, so the hobby of the person in the third spot (3) must be on the left of the hobby of the Australian (5). Since the hobbies are board-games, cooking, hiking, photography, skydiving from left to right, the hobby in the third spot must be hiking or cooking. But the hiking person is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (Chinese), so the hobby in the third spot cannot be hiking. Therefore, the hobby in the third spot is cooking.

5. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the American, so the person in the fourth spot (4) must have a hobby that is on the right of cooking (5). The hobbies are board-games, cooking, hiking, photography, skydiving from left to right, so the hobby in the fourth spot must be board-games, hiking, or photography. But the hiking person is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (Chinese), so the hobby in the fourth spot cannot be hiking. Also, the person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket, and the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography, which creates a loop. So, the hobby in the fourth spot cannot be photography either. Therefore, the hobby in the fourth spot is board-games.

6. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far right, so the person in the fifth spot (5) must have a hobby that is on the left of board-games (4). The hobbies are board-games, cooking, hiking, photography, skydiving from left to right, so the hobby in the fifth spot must be hiking or photography. But the hiking person is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (Chinese), so the hobby in the fifth spot cannot be hiking. Therefore, the hobby in the fifth spot is photography.

7. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography, so the person in the second spot (2) must play cricket.

8. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person who's sport is cricket is in the second spot (2), the person drinking fanta cannot be in the second spot. Also, the person who's hobby is photography is in the fifth spot (5), and the person who's hobby is board-games is in the fourth spot (4). So, the person drinking fanta cannot be in the first spot (1) or the third spot (3) because those spots are already filled with the Chinese (tea) and the person who's hobby is cooking, respectively. Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in the sixth spot (6).

9. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in the sixth spot (6), the person who's sport is rowing must be in the fifth spot (5) or the seventh spot (7). But the person who's hobby is photography is in the fifth spot (5), and the person who's hobby is board-games is in the fourth spot (4). So, the person who's sport is rowing must be in the seventh spot (7).

10. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the Dutch, who is in the fifth spot (5).

11. The chinese is the person who's sport is tennis, so the person in the first spot (1) plays tennis.

12. The japanese is between the American and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the American is in the second spot (2) and the person drinking soy-milk is in the first or seventh spot (1 or 7), the japanese must be in the third spot (3).

13. The person who's sport is soccer is in the middle, so the person in the third spot (3) plays soccer.

14. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, so the person in the fourth spot (4) has a hobby that is on the right of skydiving (5). The hobbies are board-games, cooking, hiking, photography, skydiving from left to right, so the hobby in the fourth spot must be hiking or photography. But the hiking person is on the left or right of the person drinking tea (Chinese), so the hobby in the fourth spot cannot be hiking. Therefore, the hobby in the fourth spot is photography.
