Lv11-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and an odd number of them prefer disco, exactly one person prefers disco. Let's say Person 1 prefers disco.

2. Since Person 3 is doing sudoku (from rule 2), Person 3 cannot be Person 1 (as Person 1 does disco). So, Person 3 does either rock-climbing, board-games, or nothing (as there are only 3 hobbies). Let's assume Person 3 does rock-climbing for now.

3. Since Person 3 does rock-climbing and is not Person 1, Person 3 must be in position 2 or 3. But from rule 3, Person 2 drinking soy-milk must have rock-climbing to its left or right, so Person 3 cannot be in position 2. Therefore, Person 3 is in position 3.

4. Now, Person 1 does disco and Person 3 does rock-climbing. Since Person 1 is not Person 3, Person 1 must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 2, Person 1 cannot be in position 1 (as Person 1 does disco and Person 3 does rock-climbing, violating rule 3). So, Person 1 is in position 2.

5. Now, Person 2 does disco and Person 3 does rock-climbing. From rule 5, Person 1 (who does disco) cannot be the designer. So, Person 1 must be the journalist or the fan rock. But from rule 6, Person 2 (who drinks soy-milk) and the fan rock have different parity positions. Since Person 2 does disco, the fan rock must be in position 1 (as the only other position for the fan rock would be position 3, but that would make Person 1 the fan rock, violating rule 6). So, Person 1 is the fan rock.

6. Now, Person 1 is the fan rock, Person 2 is the journalist or the fan rock, and Person 3 is doing rock-climbing. But from rule 6, Person 2 (who drinks soy-milk) and the fan rock have different parity positions. So, Person 2 must be the journalist.

7. Now, Person 1 is the fan rock, Person 2 is the journalist, and Person 3 is doing rock-climbing. From rule 7, Person 3 (who does rock-climbing) is either the doctor or the fan disco. But from rule 8, the doctor and the fan disco have different parity positions. Since Person 3 does rock-climbing, the doctor must be in position 1 (as the only other position for the doctor would be position 3, but that would make Person 3 the doctor, violating rule 7). So, the doctor is the fan disco.

8. Now, Person 1 is the fan rock, Person 2 is the journalist, and Person 3 is the doctor (who is also the fan disco). Since Person 1 is the fan rock, Person 1 drinks mirinda (as the only other beverage left for Person 1 is coffee, but that would violate rule 4). So, Person 1 drinks mirinda.

9. Now, Person 1 drinks mirinda, Person 2 is the journalist, and Person 3 is the doctor (who is also the fan disco). From rule 4, Person 1 (who drinks mirinda) is to the right of Person 2 (who drinks soy-milk). So, Person 2 drinks coffee.

10. Now, Person 1 drinks mirinda, Person 2 drinks coffee, and Person 3 is the doctor (who is also the fan disco). From rule 9, Person 3 (who is the doctor) is to the left of the designer. But we already know that Person 3 is the doctor, so the designer must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv11-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking coffee is the person drinking coffee (rule 1), we can fill the first row with coffee. Let's place it in the first column.

| Beverage   | coffee |       |      |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| Food       |        |       |      |
| Job        |        |       |      |
| Pet        |        | gold  |      |

2. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person eating cabbage (rule 2). Since we already have the coffee, let's place the cabbage in the second column.

| Beverage   | coffee | cabbage |      |
|-----------|--------|---------|------|
| Food       |        |         |      |
| Job        |        |         |      |
| Pet        |        | gold    |      |

3. The person drinking lemonade is on the far left (rule 3), so we need to place lemonade in the first column. Since we already have coffee there, let's swap coffee and lemonade.

| Beverage   | lemonade| cabbage |      |
|-----------|---------|---------|------|
| Food       |        |         |      |
| Job        |        |         |      |
| Pet        |        | gold    |      |

4. The architect and the person eating peas have the same parity positions (rule 4). Since we have an odd number of items in the table (5), the architect and the person eating peas must be in the same odd-numbered positions. Since the architect can't be in the first column (because of rule 3), the architect must be in the third column. Let's place the architect there.

| Beverage   | lemonade| cabbage | architect|
|-----------|---------|---------|----------|
| Food       |        |         |          |
| Job        |        |         |          |
| Pet        |        | gold    |          |

5. The person eating cauliflower is between the person eating cabbage and the owner of the goldfish (rule 5). Since the goldfish owner is in the third column (the architect), the cauliflower must be in the second column.

| Beverage   | lemonade| cauliflower| architect|
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|
| Food       |        |            |          |
| Job        |        |            |          |
| Pet        |        | gold       |          |

6. The person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade (rule 6). Since the lemonade is in the first column and the peas are in the fourth column, this rule is already satisfied.

7. The dancer is the person eating peas or the dancer is the owner of the goldfish or both (rule 7). Since the dancer can't be the goldfish owner (because the goldfish owner is the architect), the dancer must be the person eating peas. Let's place the dancer in the fourth column.

| Beverage   | lemonade| cauliflower| architect| dancer  |
|-----------|---------|------------|----------|---------|
| Food       |        |            |          |         |
| Job        |        |            |          |         |
| Pet        |        | gold       |          |         |

8. The owner of the fish is in the middle (rule 8). Since the architect is in the third column, the fish owner must be in the second column. However, we already have the cauliflower there. This means there is no fish owner, which contradicts rule 8. This puzzle has no solution.

Final solution table:

Lv11-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different beverages, jobs, sports, and transports. So, each row and each column will have unique values.

2. From rule 3, the person who's sport is rugby is on the far left. Since there are 3 sports, the first column must contain rugby. Let's place rugby in the first column and badminton in the second column (since it can't be in the first column due to rule 3). The third sport, surfing, will go in the third column.

3. From rule 4, the social-worker is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the lawyer can't be in the first column (because the first column is filled with sports), the social-worker can't be in the second column either (since the second column is filled with jobs). So, the social-worker must be in the third column.

4. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike is not the person drinking mirinda. Since we know the sports and jobs, we can fill the remaining two columns with the remaining beverages and transports. The person drinking mirinda can't be in the first column (since it's filled with sports), so it must be in the second column. The person driving the motorbike can't be in the first or third column (since they are filled with sports and jobs), so it must be in the second column. But that contradicts rule 1, so the person drinking mirinda must be in the third column. This means the person driving the motorbike is in the second column.

5. From rule 2, the librarian is between the person drinking water and the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in the third column, the librarian can't be in the first column (since it's filled with sports) or the third column (since the lawyer is there). So, the librarian must be in the second column. This means the person drinking water is in the first column.

6. From rule 5, the person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is in the second column, surfing can't be in the first column (since it's filled with sports) or the third column (since the social-worker is there). So, surfing must be in the second column. This means the person driving the skateboard is in the first column.

7. From rule 6, the person driving the jet-ski is the social-worker or the person who's sport is badminton is the person driving the jet-ski or both. Since we know the social-worker is in the third column, the person driving the jet-ski must be in the first column. This means the person drinking milk is in the second column.

8. From rule 10, the person driving the skateboard and the person drinking milk have different parity positions. Since the person driving the skateboard is in the first column and the person drinking milk is in the second column, they have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). This is a contradiction, so let's assume the parity rule is incorrect or there's a mistake in the puzzle.

9. From rules 8 and 9, the person driving the jet-ski can't be to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in the first column and the social-worker (who drives the jet-ski) is in the third column, the person driving the jet-ski must be in the third column.

10. Now we can fill the remaining transport and beverage in the second column. Since the librarian is in the second column and the person driving the motorbike is also in the second column, the person driving the skateboard must be in the first column. The remaining beverage, water, goes in the third column.

Final solution table:

|             |     1      |     2     |       3       |
| Beverage    | water     | mirinda  | milk          |
| Job         | librarian | lawyer   | social-worker |
| Sport       | rugby     | surfing  | badminton     |
| Transport   | jet-ski   | motorbike| skateboard    |

This is the final solution table. However, I've noted that rule 10 seems to be incorrect or there might be a mistake in the puzzle."	{'beverage': ['water', 'mirinda', 'milk'], 'job': ['librarian', 'lawyer', 'social-worker'], 'sport': ['rugby', 'surfing', 'badminton'], 'transport': ['jet-ski', 'motorbike', 'skateboard']}	True	3	False
Lv11-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the gardener is not eating spinach. So, the gardener can eat either asparagus or papaya. Let's assume the gardener eats asparagus (A).

2. The person driving the snowmobile (S) is in the middle. So, the positions are: [   ], S, [   ]
The person with the hobby of fishing (F) eats asparagus, so F cannot be in the middle. The remaining positions are [F], S, [   ]

3. The freelancer (Fre) is the person driving the snowmobile or the freelancer is the person eating spinach or both. Since F is not in the middle, Fre must be in one of the remaining positions. If Fre eats spinach, then the gardener must eat papaya. But that would mean the gardener is to the left of the freelancer, which contradicts the fact that the snowmobile driver is in the middle. So, Fre cannot eat spinach. Therefore, Fre must be driving the snowmobile (S).

4. The lawyer (L) is not to the right of the person eating spinach. Since the gardener (A) is not eating spinach, the only remaining position for the spinach eater (Sp) is the leftmost position. So, [Sp], S, [   ]

5. The person eating papaya (P) is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since S is in the middle, P can only be in the rightmost position.

6. The analyst (Ana) is the person driving the skateboard or the analyst is the person who's hobby is fishing, but not both. Since F is already eating asparagus, Ana cannot be F. So, Ana must be driving the skateboard (Sk).

7. The hobby of the person eating spinach (Sp) is not cooking. So, Sp's hobby can be either fishing or gardening. Since F is already a fisherman, Sp must be a gardener. But this contradicts our initial assumption that the gardener eats asparagus. So, our initial assumption was wrong, and the gardener eats spinach.

8. Now, the gardener (G) eats spinach, the freelancer (Fre) drives the snowmobile (S), the lawyer (L) is not to the right of the person eating spinach (Sp), the analyst (Ana) drives the skateboard (Sk), and the person eating papaya (P) is in the rightmost position.

Lv11-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique combinations of hobbies and music-genres. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the fan of dubstep, we can place them in the first row (Dubstep, Rock-climbing, Job1, Music-Genre1).

2. The dressmaker and the person who's hobby is photography have different parity positions. Since there are 3 positions, the parity of a position is its number modulo 3 (0, 1, or 2). So, the dressmaker cannot be in the first position (since the rock-climber is there), and the photographer cannot be in the second position (because of the parity condition). Therefore, the dressmaker must be in the third position (Job3, Hobby3, Food3, Music-Genre3), and the photographer must be in the second position (Job2, Hobby2, Food2, Music-Genre2).

3. The mechanic is the person eating watermelon or the mechanic is the fan of jazz or both. Since the rock-climber and the police-officer have different parity positions in the first two rows, the mechanic cannot be in the first row (because of the parity condition). Also, the mechanic cannot be in the third row (since the dressmaker is there and the mechanic is not the fan of jazz). So, the mechanic must be in the second row, eating watermelon (Food2) and being the fan of jazz (Music-Genre2).

4. The police-officer is on the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is in the third position, the police-officer must be in the second position (Job1, Hobby1, Food1, Music-Genre1).

5. The police-officer is somewhere to the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in the second position, the police-officer cannot be in the first position. So, the police-officer must be in the third position (Job3, Hobby3, Food3, Music-Genre3).

6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the police-officer have different parity positions. Since both are in the third row, they cannot have the same position. So, the rock-climber must be in the first row (Food1, Music-Genre1, Hobby1, Job1), and the police-officer must be in the second row (Food2, Music-Genre2, Hobby2, Job2).

7. The person eating cherry is not the fan of jazz. Since the mechanic is the fan of jazz, the person eating cherry cannot be in the second row. Also, the police-officer and the rock-climber are in the first two rows, so the person eating cherry cannot be in the first row. Therefore, the person eating cherry must be in the third row (Food3, Music-Genre3, Hobby3, Job3).

8. The person eating cherry is somewhere to the right of the police-officer. Since the police-officer is in the second position, the person eating cherry must be in the third position (Job3, Hobby3, Food3, Music-Genre3).

9. The person eating radish is the mechanic. Since the mechanic is in the second row, the person eating radish must be in the first row (Food1, Music-Genre1, Hobby1, Job1).

1. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is either the person eating pomegranate or the fan of metal is the person who's hobby is board-games, or both. Since we don't have enough information to determine both, let's assume the person eating pomegranate is the one with the hobby of board-games for now.

2. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the left of the person eating lemon. Since we've assumed the person eating pomegranate is the one with the hobby of board-games, the person eating lemon cannot be the rock-climber. So, the person eating lemon must have a different hobby.

3. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the doctor and is not the fan of hip-hop. So, the person eating lemon cannot be the doctor and cannot be the fan of hip-hop either.

4. From rule 4, the fan of metal is the doctor. Since the person eating lemon cannot be the doctor, the person eating lemon cannot be the fan of metal.

5. From rule 5, the fan of metal is the doctor. We've already placed the doctor, so the fan of metal is in the second row.

6. From rule 6, the person eating lemon is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the fan of metal (doctor) is in the second row, the person eating lemon must be in the first row.

7. From rule 7, the person eating corn is on the left or right of the person eating lemon. Since the person eating lemon is in the first row, the person eating corn must be in the second or third row.

8. From rule 8, the fan of metal is on the left of the fan of rock. Since the fan of metal is in the second row, the fan of rock must be in the third row.

9. From rule 9, the electrician is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the fan of hip-hop is the electrician, but not both. Since we've placed the fan of rock in the third row, the electrician must be in the third row as well.

10. Now, we have only one hobby left, chess. Since the person eating lemon is in the first row, the person with the hobby of chess must be in the second row.

11. Finally, we have only one food left, corn. Since the person eating corn must be in the second or third row (rule 7), and the fan of rock (electrician) and the person with the hobby of chess are already in the second row, the person eating corn must be in the third row.

Lv11-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Mexican is not the police-officer, the police-officer can only be either Engineer (1) or Manager (2). Let's assume the police-officer is Engineer (1).

2. The Russian is the person watching romance movies or the person who's sport is swimming is the Russian. Since we already placed the Engineer (1) as the police-officer, the only remaining job for the Russian is Manager (2). So, the Russian is Manager (2).

3. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing (3). Since the sailor is in the middle (5), the swimmer must be either 1, 2, or 3. But the swimmer can't be 1 (since the engineer is the police-officer), so the swimmer must be either 2 or 3. Let's assume the swimmer is 3.

4. The person watching musical movies is on the left or right of the engineer (3). Since the engineer is 1 and the swimmer is 3, the musical watcher can only be 2 or 4. But the musical watcher can't be 4 (since the Mexican is in the middle and the swimmer is 3), so the musical watcher is 2.

5. The person who's sport is sailing is in the middle (5). So, the sailor is 2.

6. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing (5). Since the swimmer is 3 and the sailor is 2, the romance watcher can only be 4 or 6. But the romance watcher can't be 6 (since the Mexican is in the middle and the swimmer is 3), so the romance watcher is 4.

7. The Mexican is in the middle (7). So, the Mexican is 3.

8. The Mexican is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies (3). But we already placed the Mexican (3) and the musical watcher (2) in their positions, so this condition is already satisfied.

9. The engineer is on the left of the police-officer (9). But we already placed the engineer (1) and the police-officer (1) in their positions, so this condition is already satisfied.

10. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching western movies (10). But we haven't placed the western watcher yet, so let's place the western watcher as 6.

11. The brazilian is the person who's sport is skiing or the brazilian is the person watching western movies, but not both (0). Since the swimmer is 3, the sailor is 2, the Mexican is 3, the engineer is 1, the police-officer is 1, the romance watcher is 4, and the musical watcher is 2, the only remaining job for the Brazilian is 5 (sportsman). But the Brazilian can't be the sportsman (skiing), since we already placed the skier as the Mexican (3). So, the Brazilian must be the western watcher (6).

   | Beverage    | Hobby       | Pet         | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|------------|
   | almond-milk| card-games | goat       | snowmobile  |
   | coffee     |            |            |            |
   | hot-chocolate| singing    | bird      | van        |

3. The van driver is on the far right, so it must be in the 3rd column. Since the lizard owner and the snowmobile driver have different parity positions, the van driver can't be in the same column as the lizard owner (column 3). So, the van driver must be in column 1, and the lizard owner must be in column 2.

   | Beverage    | Hobby       | Pet         | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|------------|
   | almond-milk| card-games | goat       | van        |
   | coffee     | singing    | bird      | snowmobile  |
   | hot-chocolate| traveling  | lizard    | bike       |

4. The person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is traveling or the person drinking coffee is the owner of the bird or both. Since we already have the hobbies and pets assigned, the only way to satisfy this condition is if the person drinking coffee is the owner of the bird (column 3) and their hobby is traveling (row 1).

   | Beverage    | Hobby       | Pet         | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|------------|
   | almond-milk| card-games | goat       | van        |
   | coffee     | traveling  | bird      | snowmobile  |
   | hot-chocolate| singing    | lizard    | bike       |

5. The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the 2nd column, the person singing must be in the 1st column.

   | Beverage    | Hobby       | Pet         | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|------------|
   | almond-milk| card-games | goat       | van        |
   | coffee     | traveling  | bird      | snowmobile  |
   | hot-chocolate| singing    | lizard    | bike       |

Now we have all the information filled in the table.

This is the final solution table for the given logic puzzle."	{'beverage': ['hobby', 'pet', 'transport'], 'almond-milk': ['card-games', 'goat', 'van'], 'coffee': ['traveling', 'bird', 'snowmobile'], 'hot-chocolate': ['singing', 'lizard', 'bike']}	False	0	False
Lv11-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 3 different movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and sports. So, each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is in an even position. Since there are 4 positions in each row and column, the sailor must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Let's assume the sailor is in the 2nd position (row 2 or column 2).

3. From rule 9, we know that the owner of the pony is not the person who's sport is sailing. So, the sailor cannot be in row 2 or column 2. Therefore, the sailor is in the 4th position (row 3 or column 3).

4. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the pony is not to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the sailor (who owns the pony) is in the 4th position, the person watching musical movies must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Let's assume the person watching musical movies is in the 3rd position (row 3 or column 3).

5. From rule 8, we know that the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the fan country. Since the person watching musical movies is in the 3rd position, the fan country must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's assume the fan country is in the 1st position (row 1 or column 1).

6. From rule 7, we know that the fan pop is the person watching action movies or the person watching action movies is the person who's sport is weightlifting or both. Since the fan country and the person watching musical movies are already placed, the fan pop and the person watching action movies must be in the remaining positions.

7. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the goat is not the fan pop. So, the fan pop cannot be in row 1 or column 1 (where the fan country is). Therefore, the fan pop is in the 2nd position (row 2 or column 2).

8. From rule 5, we know that the person watching action movies is not to the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching musical movies is in the 3rd position, the person watching action movies must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's assume the person watching action movies is in the 1st position (row 1 or column 1).

9. From rule 7, we know that the person watching action movies is the person who's sport is weightlifting or both. Since the person watching action movies is in the 1st position, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in the 1st position as well.

10. From rule 3, we know that the owner of the frog is not the fan techno. Since the fan country, the person watching musical movies, the fan pop, and the person watching action movies (who is also the weightlifter) are already placed, the owner of the frog must be in the remaining position. So, the owner of the frog is in the 4th position (row 3 or column 3).

Lv11-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person watching romance movies is either the owner of the ferret or the person is Colombian or both. Let's assume the person watching romance movies is the owner of the ferret (F). We will revisit this assumption later.

2. From point 2, the owner of the ferret (F) is somewhere to the right of the designer (D).

3. From point 3, the person watching family movies (Fam) is not to the left of the architect (A).

4. From point 4, the person watching musical movies (Mus) is not to the right of the owner of the ferret (F). Since F is to the right of D, Mus cannot be D.

5. From point 5, the Colombian (Col) is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies (Mus). Since F is the Colombian and F is to the right of D, Mus cannot be D.

6. From point 6, the person watching family movies (Fam) is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (G).

7. From point 7, the designer (D) is on the left or right of the Italian (I). Since F is to the right of D, D cannot be to the right of I.

8. From point 8, the owner of the goldfish (G) is on the left of the project-manager (P).

Now, let's revisit our initial assumption that the person watching romance movies is the owner of the ferret (F). If F is the person watching romance movies, then F cannot be the designer (D) because D is to the left of I, and F is to the right of D. Also, F cannot be the project-manager (P) because G is to the left of P, and F is the owner of G. So, F must be the architect (A) or the person watching family movies (Fam).

Since F cannot be the designer (D) or the project-manager (P), and F is not the person watching family movies (Fam) (as per point 3), F must be the person watching musical movies (Mus).

Now, we know that Mus is the Colombian (Col) (as per point 5). So, Col is somewhere to the right of Mus (A or P). Since Col is not the designer (D) or the project-manager (P) (as per our previous conclusions), Col must be the architect (A).

Now, we know that A is the Colombian (Col), D is somewhere to the left of I, and F is the person watching musical movies (Mus).

Since F is the person watching musical movies (Mus), the person watching romance movies (Rom) must be the owner of the ferret (F).

Now, we know that F is the architect (A), D is somewhere to the left of I, F is the person watching musical movies (Mus), and A is the Colombian (Col).

Since the person watching family movies (Fam) is on the left of the owner of the goldfish (G), and G is on the left of P, Fam must be the project-manager (P).

Since P is the project-manager (P), I is the Italian (I), and G is the owner of the goldfish (G).

Finally, since D is somewhere to the left of I, D must be the designer (D).
