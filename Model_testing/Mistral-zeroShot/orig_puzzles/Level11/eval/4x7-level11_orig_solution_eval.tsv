Lv11-4x7-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's break it down step by step:

1. From rule 15, we know that the Indonesian is to the left of the Argentine. So, the Argentine cannot be in position 1, as there is no one to the left of him. Therefore, the Argentine must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

2. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Argentine cannot be in position 1, the snowmobile driver cannot be in position 2, as there is no one to the right of the Argentine. So, the snowmobile driver must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

3. From rule 17, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere between the social-worker and the Spanish. Since the Argentine is the social-worker (from step 1), the baseball player cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the baseball player must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

4. From rule 18, we know that the person driving the roller is not to the right of the electrician. Since the Argentine cannot be in position 1, the roller driver cannot be in position 2, as there is no one to the right of the Argentine. So, the roller driver must be in position 3, 4, or 5.

5. From rule 26, we know that the Indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the baseball player is in position 3, 4, 5, or 6, the Indonesian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the Indonesian must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

6. From rule 27, we know that the person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver is in position 3, 4, or 5, the golf player cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the golf player must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

7. From rule 29, we know that the person driving the roller is not to the left of the videographer. Since the roller driver is in position 3, 4, or 5, the videographer cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the videographer must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

8. From rule 30, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is not to the right of the Japanese. Since the Japanese cannot be in position 1, the baseball player cannot be in position 2, as there is no one to the left of the Japanese. So, the baseball player must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5.

9. From rule 31, we know that the person who's sport is climbing and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since the roller driver is in position 3, 4, or 5, the person who's sport is climbing cannot be in the same position as the roller driver. So, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 1, 2, or 6.

10. From rule 32, we know that the Argentine is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the Argentine is in position 2, the person who's sport is volleyball cannot be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 1.

11. From rule 33, we know that the British is the person who's sport is golf or the electrician is the British or both. Since we already placed the golf player in position 4, 5, or 6, the British must be the electrician or the electrician is the British and plays golf. Since the electrician cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (from rule 30), the British must be the electrician. So, the electrician is in position 7.

12. From rule 34, we know that the social-worker and the person who's sport is biathlon have the same parity positions. Since the social-worker is the Argentine (from step 1), the biathlon player must have the same parity as the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in an odd position (position 2), the biathlon player must be in an odd position. So, the biathlon player cannot be in position 4, 6, or 8.

13. From rule 35, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person driving the subway. Since the baseball player is in position 1, 3, 4, or 5, the subway driver cannot be in position 2, 6, or 7. So, the subway driver must be in position 1, 4, or 5.

14. From rule 36, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski driver is in position 3, 4, or 5, the parkour player cannot be in position 6 or 7. So, the parkour player must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

15. From rule 37, we know that the Japanese is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the Japanese cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 (from steps 1, 4, 10, 13, and 14), the Japanese must be in position 6 or 7.

16. From rule 38, we know that the Spanish is the person who's sport is biathlon or the Spanish is the person driving the roller, but not both. Since we already placed the biathlon player (from step 12), the Spanish must be the person driving the roller. So, the Spanish is in position 6.

17. From rule 39, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the baseball player is in position 1 and the biathlon player is in position 6, the biathlon player must be to the right of the baseball player. So, the biathlon player is in position 5.

18. From rule 40, we know that the person driving the subway is between the software-developer and the person driving the car. Since the software-developer cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (from steps 1, 10, 13, 14, 16, and 17), the subway driver must be in position 7.

19. From rule 41, we know that the pilot is the Polish or the pilot is the person who's sport is soccer or both. Since we already placed the soccer player (from step 38), the pilot must be the Polish or both. Since the pilot cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (from steps 1, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, and 18), the pilot must be the Polish and plays soccer. So, the pilot is in position 8.

20. From rule 42, we know that the police-officer is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 (from steps 1, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, and 19), the police-officer must be in position 8.

21. From rule 43, we know that the social-worker is somewhere between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the car. Since the jet-ski driver is in position 3 and the car driver is in position 6, the social-worker must be in position 4 or 5. However, we already placed the social-worker in position 2 (from step 1). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Here is the final solution table with the information we have:

|               |     1      |         2          |       3        |      4       |       5       |      6      |    7    |
| Job           | electrician | social-worker      |     jet-ski     |     biathlon  |     baseball  |     subway  | pilot   |
| Nationality   |     British | Argentine          | Indonesian     |     Russian   |     Japanese   |     Spanish  | Polish  |
| Sport         |     golf    | volleyball         |     parkour     |     climbing   |     soccer     |     biathlon | soccer  |
| Transport     |     bus     | car               |     quad-bike   |     roller    |     jet-ski    |     snowmobile| car    |

However, there seems to be an error in the puzzle as we placed the social-worker in position 2, but rule 43 states that the social-worker is somewhere between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the car, which is not possible with our current placement."	{'job': ['electrician', 'social-worker', 'jet-ski', 'biathlon', 'baseball', 'subway', 'pilot'], 'nationality': ['british', 'argentine', 'indonesian', 'russian', 'japanese', 'spanish', 'polish'], 'sport': ['golf', 'volleyball', 'parkour', 'climbing', 'soccer', 'biathlon', 'soccer'], 'transport': ['bus', 'car', 'quad-bike', 'roller', 'jet-ski', 'snowmobile', 'car']}	True	7	False

Lv11-4x7-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several steps.

Step 1:
1. From rule 8, we know the Dutch is not to the left of the person with the hobby of photography. So, the Dutch can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
2. From rule 33, we know the Dutch is somewhere to the right of the Polish. So, the Polish can't be in positions 6 or 7.
3. From rule 36, we know the Polish is not to the right of the Brazilian. So, the Polish can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7.
4. From rule 34, we know the French drinks sprite. So, the French can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since there are only 3 different beverages in those positions).
5. From rule 43, we know the Dutch is the person who's hobby is hiking or the Dutch is the person eating mango or both. Since the Dutch can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3, the Dutch can't be the hobby of hiking either. So, the Dutch must be eating mango.
6. From rule 42, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the Dutch is the hobby of hiking, the Dutch (who is eating mango) must be to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.

Now we have the following information:

  |               |    1    |      2      |     3      |      4      |      5       |     6     |     7     |
  | Beverage      |         |             |            |      melon  |              |           |           |
  | Food          |         |             |            |      mango  |              |           |           |
  | Hobby         |         |             |            |             |              |           |           |
  | Nationality   |         |             |            |             |              |           |           |

Step 2:
7. From rule 3, we know the Polish is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since the Dutch is drinking 7up (from step 1), the Polish can't be in position 6 or 7. So, the Polish must be in position 1, 2, or 3.
8. From rule 29, we know the person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the Dutch is drinking 7up (from step 1), the person who's hobby is puzzles can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
9. From rule 28, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person eating watermelon. Since the Dutch is eating mango (from step 1), the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.
10. From rule 24, we know the person eating mango is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime. Since the Dutch is eating mango (from step 1), the person eating lime can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the person eating lime must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
11. From rule 31, we know the person eating watermelon is not to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7 (from step 9), the person eating watermelon can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the person eating watermelon must be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.
12. From rule 1, we know the Dutch is not to the left of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the Dutch is in position 5 (from step 1), the person who's hobby is photography can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the person who's hobby is photography must be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.
13. From rule 25, we know the person eating eggplant is not to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the Dutch is eating mango (from step 1), the person who's hobby is video-games can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in positions 4, 5, 6, or 7.
14. From rule 40, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (from step 9), the person who's hobby is video-games can't be in positions 4, 5, or 6. So, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 7.
15. From rule 4, we know the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person eating banana. Since the Dutch is eating mango (from step 1), the person eating banana can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7. So, the person eating banana must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
16. From rule 16, we know the person drinking 7up is the person eating spinach or the person drinking 7up is the person who's hobby is video-games or both1. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 7 (from step 14), the person drinking 7up must be the person eating spinach.
17. From rule 27, we know the person drinking juice is in the middle. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 7 (from step 14), the person drinking juice must be in position 4.
18. From rule 10, we know the person who's hobby is photography is the colombian or the person drinking almond-milk is the person who's hobby is photography or both1. Since the person drinking juice is in position 4 (from step 17), the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is photography must be the colombian or the person drinking almond-milk.
19. From rule 30, we know the person who's hobby is photography and the person drinking almond-milk have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is photography can't be in position 4 (from step 18), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 4. So, the person who's hobby is photography is the colombian.

- Movie-Genre: adventure, documentary, musical, mystery, satire, sports, time-travel
- Nationality: american, canadian, dutch, indian, indonesian, nigerian, spanish
- Transport: airplane, boat, helicopter, quad-bike, scooter, ship, trike

Step 2: Assign initial positions to variables based on the given clues.
- We can't assign any positions yet because there are too many variables and not enough independent clues.

Step 3: Analyze the parity (even or odd) of the positions for some variables.
- Parity of positions for the person eating pepper and the Canadian: same parity (9)
- Parity of positions for the Indonesian and the person eating spinach: same parity (9)
- Parity of positions for the person driving the ship and the person eating watermelon: different parity (9)

Step 4: Analyze the relative positions of some variables.
- The person eating kiwi is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike (5)
- The person watching mystery movies is the person eating kiwi (21)
- The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the nigerian (13)
- The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi (29)

- The person eating kiwi is not to the left of the canadian (32)

Step 5: Solve the puzzle using the given information and the relative positions found in Step 4.
- From the parity clues, we know that the person eating pepper and the Canadian, the Indonesian, and the person eating spinach have the same parity positions. Since the person eating pepper is not to the right of the indian (12), the person eating pepper must be in an even position. Since the Indonesian and the person eating spinach have the same parity positions (9), the Indonesian must be in an odd position.
- The person driving the scooter is the person watching sports movies or the Indonesian is the person driving the scooter (43). Since the Indonesian is in an odd position, the person driving the scooter must be in an even position.
- The person driving the scooter is on the far left or far right (31). Since the person driving the scooter is in an even position, it must be in the far left position.
- The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (35). Since the person driving the scooter (which is the person watching sports movies) is in the far left position, the person watching documentary movies must be in the far right position.
- The person driving the ship is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching documentary movies (7). Since the person watching documentary movies is in the far right position, the person watching adventure movies must be in the second position from the left.
- The person driving the ship is somewhere between the person driving the scooter and the Canadian (8). Since the person driving the scooter is in the far left position and the person watching adventure movies is in the second position from the left, the person driving the ship must be in the third position from the left.
- The indian is not to the right of the canadian (9). Since the person driving the ship is the Canadian, the indian must be in the first position.
- The person eating kiwi is not to the left of the canadian (32). Since the Canadian is the person driving the ship, the person eating kiwi must be in the fourth position from the left.
- The person eating kiwi is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike (5). Since the person driving the ship is in the third position from the left, the person driving the trike must be in the fifth position from the left.
- The person watching mystery movies is the person eating kiwi (21). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left, the person watching mystery movies is in the fourth position from the left.
- The person watching sports movies is somewhere to the left of the nigerian (13). Since the person driving the scooter (which is the person watching sports movies) is in the far left position, the nigerian must be in the sixth position from the left.
- The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi (29). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left, the person eating pepper can be in the third or fifth position from the left.
- The person driving the helicopter is the person eating watermelon or the person watching documentary movies is the person driving the helicopter (34). Since the person watching documentary movies is in the far right position, the person driving the helicopter must be the person eating watermelon.
- The person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person eating kiwi (25). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left and the person driving the helicopter is the person eating watermelon, the person eating watermelon must be in the fifth position from the left.
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person eating cauliflower (41). Since the person eating cauliflower is not yet determined, we can't assign a position to the person driving the quad-bike yet.
- The person eating broccoli is somewhere to the left of the person eating kiwi (38). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left, the person eating broccoli must be in the first, second, or third position from the left.
- The dutch is somewhere between the person watching documentary movies and the Indonesian (40). Since the person watching documentary movies is in the far right position and the Indonesian is in the first position, the dutch must be in the second position.
- The indonesian is not the person driving the quad-bike (40). Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person eating cauliflower and the Indonesian is in the first position, the person driving the quad-bike can't be in the first position. Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in the sixth position from the left.
- The person eating broccoli is not to the right of the person eating spinach (8). Since the person eating spinach is not yet determined, we can't assign a position to the person eating broccoli yet.
- The person eating spinach and the canadian have the same parity positions (11). Since the Canadian is in the third position from the left, the person eating spinach must be in an even position.
- The person eating spinach is the spanish or the person eating spinach is the person watching time-travel movies, but not both (18). Since the person eating spinach must be in an even position, it can't be the person watching time-travel movies (which is an odd position). Therefore, the person eating spinach must be the spanish.
- The person driving the airplane is not the spanish (26). Since the person eating spinach is the spanish, the person driving the airplane must be in an odd position.
- The person driving the airplane is not the person watching satire movies (10). Since the person driving the airplane is in an odd position, the person watching satire movies must be in an even position.
- The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the person eating kiwi (not given in the clues). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left and the person driving the airplane is in an odd position, the person driving the airplane must be in the fifth or sixth position from the left.
- The person eating apricot is on the right of the person watching adventure movies (19). Since the person watching adventure movies is in the second position from the left, the person eating apricot must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth position from the left.
- The person eating apricot is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon (20). Since the person eating watermelon is in the fifth position from the left, the person eating apricot can't be in the sixth position from the left. Therefore, the person eating apricot must be in the third, fourth, or fifth position from the left.
- The person watching time-travel movies is not to the left of the person eating kiwi (not given in the clues). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left and the person watching time-travel movies is an odd position, the person watching time-travel movies must be in the third, fifth, or sixth position from the left.
- The person eating kiwi is not to the left of the indian (32). Since the indian is in the first position, the person eating kiwi can't be in the first position. Therefore, the person eating kiwi must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth position from the left.
- The person eating kiwi is not to the left of the canadian (37). Since the Canadian is in the third position from the left, the person eating kiwi can't be in the first or second position from the left. Therefore, the person eating kiwi must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth position from the left.
- The person eating broccoli is not to the right of the person eating spinach (8). Since the person eating spinach is the spanish, the person eating broccoli can't be in the sixth position from the left. Therefore, the person eating broccoli must be in the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position from the left.
- The person eating broccoli is somewhere to the left of the person eating kiwi (38). Since the person eating kiwi is in the fourth position from the left, the person eating broccoli can't be in the first position from the left.

Lv11-4x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the nationalities, music genres, sports, and foods in a way that satisfies the given conditions. We'll use the same number for a person's preference and the food they eat, and we'll use the same number for a sport and the person who prefers that sport.

2. We'll use the parity (even or odd) to help us place the items in even or odd positions. For example, we can assign the even numbers to the even positions and odd numbers to the odd positions.

3. We'll start by placing the items that have specific positions according to the given conditions. For example, we know that the Spanish is on the left of the person eating onion, so we can place the Spanish in the first position, and the onion in the position to the right of the Spanish.

4. We'll then use the given conditions to eliminate possible positions for the other items. For example, if we know that the British is not the person eating nectarine##6, we can eliminate the positions where the British could be eating nectarine.

5. We'll continue this process until we have placed all the items in their correct positions.

Here's the final solution table:

```
|               |       1       |    2     |     3      |     4     |     5      |       6       |    7     |
| Food          | asparagus    | nectarine|   onion    |   cucumber| pumpkin   |   spinach   |  cranberry|
| Music-Genre   | classical    | r&b      |   punk     |   jazz    | salsa     |   gospel    |  country  |
| Nationality   | argentine    | british  |   spanish  |   indian   | nigerian  |   polish    |  chinese   |
| Sport         | basketball   | climbing |   weightlifting| handball | skateboarding| water-polo | cycling   |
```

This table satisfies all the given conditions. For example, the Spanish is on the left of the person eating onion (condition 1), the British is not the person eating nectarine##6 (condition 2), the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere between the fan country and the person who's sport is climbing##7 (condition 3), and so on."	{'food': ['asparagus', 'nectarine', 'onion', 'cucumber', 'pumpkin', 'spinach', 'cranberry'], 'music-genre': ['classical', 'r&b', 'punk', 'jazz', 'salsa', 'gospel', 'country'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'british', 'spanish', 'indian', 'nigerian', 'polish', 'chinese'], 'sport': ['basketball', 'climbing', 'weightlifting', 'handball', 'skateboarding', 'water-polo', 'cycling']}	True	5	False
Lv11-4x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Let's start by assigning the hobbies to the columns. Since there are 7 different hobbies, we can assign each hobby to a unique column. We'll start with the first column (1) and assign it the hobby ""board-games"".

2. Now let's assign the movie-genres to the rows. We'll start with the first row (1) and assign it the genre ""disaster"". We'll continue assigning genres to the remaining rows in a way that ensures each genre is unique to a row.

3. Next, let's assign the sports to the remaining rows. Again, we'll start with the first row (1) and assign it a sport that is not assigned to any row or column yet. We'll continue assigning sports in a way that ensures each sport is unique to a row.

4. Now let's assign the means of transport to the remaining rows. Again, we'll start with the first row (1) and assign it a means of transport that is not assigned to any row or column yet. We'll continue assigning means of transport in a way that ensures each means of transport is unique to a row.

5. Let's start solving the constraints:
