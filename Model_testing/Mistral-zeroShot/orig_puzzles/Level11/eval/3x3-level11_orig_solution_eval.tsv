Lv11-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the mexican is to the left of the engineer, and there are only three positions, the mexican must be in the first position. Let's fill in the Nationality for the first row:

|               | Mexican  |     2     |    3     |
| Job           |         |           |          |
| Nationality   | colombian| japanese  | mexican  |
| Pet           |         |           |          |

2. The colombian is between the japanese and the owner of the snake. Since the japanese is the lawyer (from point 3), the colombian cannot be in the first or third position (as the snake owner must be in the third position). So, the colombian must be in the second position. Let's fill in the Nationality for the second row:

|               | Mexican  | colombian |    3     |
| Job           |         |           |          |
| Nationality   | colombian| japanese  | mexican  |
| Pet           |         |           |          |

3. Now, let's consider point 4. The engineer is the Japanese or the engineer is the owner of the rat or both. Since the Japanese is already the lawyer (in the second row), the engineer cannot be the Japanese. So, the engineer must be the owner of the rat. Let's fill in the Job for the first row:

|               | Mexican  | colombian |    3     |
| Job           | engineer| japanese  | nurse    |
| Nationality   | colombian| japanese  | mexican  |
| Pet           | rat     |           |          |

4. Now, we only have one position left for the snake owner (the third row). Since the mexican and the colombian are already assigned, the snake owner must be the nurse. Let's fill in the Job for the third row:

|               | Mexican  | colombian | nurse    |
| Job           | engineer| japanese  | snake    |
| Nationality   | colombian| japanese  | mexican  |
| Pet           | rat     |           | snake    |

5. Finally, we have filled all the positions with the given conditions. Here is the final solution table:

Lv11-3x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three jobs (Accountant, Security-Guard, Teacher), three music-genres (Gospel, Metal, Techno), and three nationalities (Colombian, Egyptian, Indian).

2. From point 1, we can start filling in the first row (Job) with the three jobs. Let's assume the order is Accountant, Security-Guard, Teacher for now.

3. From point 2, we know the Egyptian is somewhere between the Teacher and the Metal fan (since the Metal fan is the Security-Guard or the Colombian, and the Colombian can't be between the Accountant and the Security-Guard due to point 4 and 5). So, the Egyptian can only be in the second or third position. But since the Egyptian is on the left of the Techno fan (point 3), the Egyptian must be in the second position. This means the Security-Guard is in the first position and the Teacher is in the third position.

4. Now we know the Security-Guard is the fan of Techno. Since the Colombian can't be the Techno fan (point 2), the Colombian must be the fan of Gospel or Metal. Let's assume the Colombian is the fan of Gospel for now.

5. The Indian can't be in the first position (since the Accountant is on the left or right of the Indian, and the Security-Guard is in the first position). So, the Indian must be in the second or third position. But since the Egyptian is in the second position, the Indian must be in the third position.

6. Now we know the Accountant is on the left of the Indian, so the Accountant must be in the first position. But this means the Accountant can't be the Gospel fan (since the Colombian is the Gospel fan and the Colombian is to the right of the Accountant). So, the Accountant must be the Metal fan.

7. Now we have filled all the jobs and nationalities. The last thing to fill is the music-genres. Since the Security-Guard is the Techno fan, the Colombian must be the Gospel fan, and the Indian can't be the Techno fan (since the Security-Guard is to the left of the Indian), the Indian must be the Metal fan.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |       1        |     2      |     3     |

Lv11-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are three people and three jobs, each job is assigned to a unique person. Similarly, each movie-genre and transport method is also assigned to a unique person.

2. Parity positions are determined by the position of the person in the table (1st, 2nd, or 3rd). For example, the nurse is in the middle (3rd position), so the nurse's position has an odd parity (1st and 3rd positions have odd parity, while the 2nd position has even parity).

3. From point 1, we know that the nurse is in the middle. So, the jobs are arranged as follows:
   - Job 1: Nurse
   - Job 2: Scientist or Security-Guard
   - Job 3: Security-Guard or Scientist

4. From point 2, the person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions. Since the nurse is in the middle (odd position), the scientist cannot be in the middle (otherwise, they would have the same parity). So, the scientist must be in either the 1st or 3rd position. If the scientist is in the 1st position, the person watching documentaries must be in the 3rd position. If the scientist is in the 3rd position, the person watching documentaries must be in the 1st position.

5. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the scientist. Since the scientist is in the 1st or 3rd position, the skateboard driver must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

6. The person watching action movies is the person driving the train or the person driving the train is the scientist or both. Since the scientist can be either in the 1st or 3rd position, the train driver could be either the scientist (if the scientist is driving the train) or the person watching action movies (if the person watching action movies is driving the train).

7. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the skateboard driver is in the 2nd or 3rd position, the person watching spy movies must be in the 1st position.

8. The person driving the skateboard and the scientist have different parity positions. Since the scientist is in the 1st or 3rd position, the skateboard driver must be in the 2nd position (odd position).

9. Now we know the positions of the scientist (1st or 3rd), the skateboard driver (2nd), the person watching documentaries (1st or 3rd), and the person watching spy movies (1st). The only position left is for the person watching action movies or the nurse (if the scientist is driving the train). Since the nurse is in the middle, the person watching action movies must be in the 3rd position.

Lv11-3x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the positions of the person watching family movies and the person drinking water have the same parity (either both are odd or both are even). Let's assume the person watching family movies is in position 1 (odd) and the person drinking water is in position 2 (even).

2. From point 2, the Colombian is between the Indonesian and the person drinking water. Since the Colombian can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the person watching family movies), the Colombian must be in position 3. This means the Indonesian is in position 2 and the person drinking water is in position 4.

3. From point 3, the person watching horror movies is not to the right of the Indonesian. So, the person watching horror movies can't be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the person watching horror movies is in position 1. This means the person watching family movies is in position 3 and the person drinking water is in position 4. But this contradicts point 1, as the person watching family movies and the person drinking water have the same parity and both are odd now. So, the person watching horror movies can't be in position 1. Let's try the other positions. If the person watching horror movies is in position 2, the person watching family movies is in position 1 and the person drinking water is in position 3. This satisfies all conditions.

4. From point 4, the person watching family movies is the Italian or the person watching family movies is the person drinking lemonade or both. Since we already know the person watching family movies is the Italian, this condition is satisfied.

5. From point 5, the person watching epic movies is the Indonesian. So, the person watching epic movies is in position 2.

6. From point 6, the Italian is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since we know the Italian is in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk can't be in position 3. Let's assume the person drinking almond-milk is in position 1. This means the person drinking lemonade is in position 4 and the person watching horror movies is in position 5.

7. From point 8, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. This is already satisfied as we placed the person drinking almond-milk in position 1 and the person drinking lemonade in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Lemonade   | Water     |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic       | Family     | Horror    |

Lv11-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their activities in the table. Since the ship driver is to the right of the bike driver, we can place the bike driver in the first column (1) and the ship driver in the third column (3). Let's place the taxi driver in the middle column (2) for now.

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        |          |          |             |
| Sport       |          |          |             |
| Transport   |          |          |             |

2. The person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions (9). Since the ship driver is in the third column (odd), the badminton player must also be in an odd position. The only remaining odd position is the first column (1). So, the badminton player is in the first column, and the sport in the third column is not badminton.

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | avocado  |          | pomegranate |
| Sport       | badminton|          |             |
| Transport   | bike     | taxi     | ship        |

3. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (8). Since climbing is in the first column (1), lacrosse must be in the second or third column. Let's place lacrosse in the third column (3) for now.

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | avocado  | grapes   | pomegranate |
| Sport       | badminton| climbing  | lacrosse    |
| Transport   | bike     | taxi     | ship        |

4. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi (3). Since climbing is in the first column (1), the taxi driver must be in the second column (2).

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | avocado  | grapes   | pomegranate |
| Sport       | badminton| climbing  | lacrosse    |
| Transport   | bike     | taxi     | ship        |

5. The person who's sport is climbing is the person eating grapes (5). So, grapes must be in the first column (1).

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | grapes   | avocado  | pomegranate |
| Sport       | climbing  | badminton| lacrosse    |
| Transport   | bike     | taxi     | ship        |

6. The person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes (5). So, pomegranate must be in the third column (3).

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | grapes   | avocado  | pomegranate |
| Sport       | climbing  | badminton| lacrosse    |
| Transport   | bike     | taxi     | ship        |

7. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (3). Since climbing is in the first column (1), the ship driver must be in the third column (3). But this contradicts our initial placement of the ship driver (2). However, since the ship driver eats pomegranate, and pomegranate is in the third column (3), the ship driver must be in the third column (3). This means the initial placement of the taxi driver (2) was incorrect, and the taxi driver must be in the first column (1).

|             |    1     |    2     |      3      |
| Food        | grapes   | taxi     | pomegranate |
| Sport       | climbing  | badminton| lacrosse    |
| Transport   | bike     |         | ship        |

8. The person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes (5). But this is already satisfied, as grapes are in the first column (1) and pomegranate is in the third column (3).

So, the final solution table is:

Lv11-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 5, we know that the person eating strawberry is the person drinking soy-milk. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Apple  | Peach  |
| Job        |         |        |        |

2. From point 2, the person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry (soy-milk). So, the only possible position for juice is the first column.

| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Apple  | Peach  |
| Job        |         | Coach  |        |

3. From point 3, the person drinking juice is on the right of the coach. So, the only possible position for the coach is the third row.

| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Apple  | Peach  |
| Job        | Coach   |        | Photographer |

4. From point 6, the person eating peach is in an odd position. The only odd position left is the second row.

| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Peach  | Apple  |
| Job        | Coach   | Journalist | Photographer |

5. From point 7 and 8, the journalist and the coach can be on either the left or right of each other. Let's try both possibilities:

Scenario 1:
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Peach  | Apple  |
| Job        | Coach   | Journalist | Photographer |

In this scenario, the journalist is on the left of the coach, which violates point 8 (the journalist is on the left or right of the coach). So, this scenario is not possible.

Scenario 2:
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   | Sprite  |
|-----------|---------|--------|--------|
| Food       | Strawberry | Peach  | Apple  |
| Job        | Coach   | Photographer | Journalist |

In this scenario, the coach is on the right of the journalist, which satisfies point 8.

6. From point 4, the person eating peach is in an odd position. In this scenario, peach is in the second row, which is an odd position. So, this scenario is consistent with all the given conditions.

So, the final solution table is:

#############

   | Nationality   | Argentine| Indian     | Mexican   |

3. From point 1, we know there are 3 different beverages: 7up, cola, milk. Since the Mexican drinks card-games, he can't drink 7up (point 6) or cola (point 5 and 6), so he must drink milk. Let's place milk in the beverage column for the Mexican:

   |               |    1    |     2      |     3     |

   | Nationality   | Argentine| Indian     | Mexican   |

4. From point 2, the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since we already placed the Mexican with milk, the only remaining beverage for the person drinking cola is 7up. Let's place 7up in the beverage column for the person in position 2:

5. From point 4, the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since we already placed the Mexican with milk, the person in position 3 must be drinking 7up. Let's place 7up in the beverage column for the person in position 3:

6. From point 5, the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is writing or the person who's hobby is writing is the indian. Since we already placed the hobby for the Mexican, the person in position 2 must be the indian with the hobby of writing. Let's place writing in the hobby column for the person in position 2:

7. From point 7, the Mexican is somewhere between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the indian. Since we already placed the hobby for the Mexican and the indian, the person in position 1 must have the hobby of puzzles. Let's place puzzles in the hobby column for the person in position 1:

1. The Canadian is in either the first or the third position. Let's assume the Canadian is in the first position (as the third position would violate rule 4).

2. Since the Canadian is in the first position and eating broccoli or spinach (rule 4), let's assume the Canadian is eating broccoli (as the third row is already occupied by broccoli). This means the broccoli is in the first position.

3. The person watching animation movies is to the right of the person watching sports movies (rule 2). Since the Canadian is watching sports movies (in the first position), the animation movies must be in the second or third position. Let's assume the animation movies are in the second position. This means the second row is occupied by animation movies.

4. The person watching sports movies is in an odd position (rule 3). The only odd position left is the third position. So, the sports movies are in the third position.

5. The indian is not to the left of the Indian (rule 5), which means the Indian must be in the second or third position. Since the Indian cannot be in the first position (as the Canadian is there), the Indian must be in the third position. This means the nationality in the third row is Indian.

6. The person eating peas is on the right of the Indian (rule 6). The only position left for peas is the first position. So, the peas are in the first position.

Lv11-3x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla, the iced-tea cannot be in column 3. So, iced-tea can only be in column 1 or 2.

2. The person driving the bike is between the person driving the taxi and the person drinking milk. If the iced-tea is in column 1, then the bike cannot be in column 1 (as there is no one to its right to be the taxi driver). So, the iced-tea must be in column 2, and the bike is in column 3.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since the bike is in column 3, the chinchilla cannot be in column 1. So, the chinchilla is in column 2 or 3.

4. The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. If the chinchilla is in column 2, then the taxi cannot be in column 1 (as there is no one to its left to be the soy-milk drinker). So, the chinchilla must be in column 3, and the taxi is in column 2.

5. The owner of the horse and the person driving the van have the same parity positions. Since the chinchilla is in an odd position (column 3), the horse or the van must also be in an odd position. The only odd position left is column 1. So, the horse is in column 1, and the van is in column 3.

6. The person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the person driving the van or both. Since the horse is the person drinking milk, the condition is satisfied.

Final solution table:

| Beverage    |   1   |    2     |     3      |
|------------|-------|----------|------------|
| Beverage    | milk  | soy-milk | iced-tea   |

Lv11-3x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is camping. So, we can rule out the first row and first column for the hobby ""camping"".

2. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since we already know the position of the ""camping"" hobby, we can place the ""card-games"" hobby to the left of the ""milk"" beverage.

3. The person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is biathlon or the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games or both. Since we already placed the ""card-games"" hobby, we can place the ""biathlon"" sport either in the same row as ""lemonade"" or in the row below ""milk"". Let's place ""biathlon"" in the same row as ""lemonade"" for now.

4. The person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking milk, but not both. Since we already placed ""camping"" and ""card-games"", we can place ""soccer"" in the row below ""milk"" and ""writing"" in the row above ""milk"".

5. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since we already placed ""writing"", we can place ""badminton"" in the row below ""writing"".

6. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since we already placed ""lemonade"", we can place ""soy-milk"" in the column to the left of ""lemonade"".

Now, let's fill in the table:

|            |    1     |     2      |    3     |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Beverage   | soy-    | milk      | lemonade |
| Hobby      | writing | card-games| camping  |
| Sport      | badminton| soccer    | biathlon |

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle statement 3. It states that the person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is biathlon or the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games or both. But in our solution, the person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is card-games. So, the puzzle might have a mistake or it might require a different interpretation."	{'beverage': ['soy-', 'milk', 'lemonade'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'card-games', 'camping'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'soccer', 'biathlon']}	True	4	False
