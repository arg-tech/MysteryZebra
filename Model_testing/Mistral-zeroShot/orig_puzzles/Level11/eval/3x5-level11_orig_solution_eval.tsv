Lv11-3x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the hobbies, movie genres, and sports to the positions based on the given clues.

1. The person watching adventure movies and the person who's hobby is writing have different parity positions. Since there are 5 people, the parity of a position is determined by whether it's an odd or even number. So, we can't have both writing and adventure in the same parity position.

   Let's assign writing to an even position (e.g., position 2) to avoid having it in the same parity position as adventure.

2. The person watching satire movies is on the far left. So, satire goes in position 1.

3. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling is on the far right (clue 16), baseball must be in positions 1, 2, or 3. However, we already assigned satire to position 1 and writing to position 2, so baseball must be in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position. Since we already assigned writing to position 2, no need to change it.

5. The person who's sport is rowing and the person watching time-travel movies have the same parity positions. Since we assigned baseball to position 3 (an odd position), rowing and time-travel movies must be in even positions. Let's assign rowing to position 4 (even) and time-travel movies to position 6 (even, since we know time-travel movies are watched by the person who plays baseball, and baseball is in position 3).

6. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching satire movies. Since cycling is in position 5 and satire is in position 1, time-travel movies must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, we already assigned time-travel movies to position 6. So, this clue is redundant or has an error.

7. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since we already assigned satire to the far left and time-travel movies to the far right, gardening can't be in position 1 or 5. So, gardening must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. However, we already assigned gardening to position 4 (to satisfy clue 5). So, this clue is redundant or has an error.

8. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. Since we assigned adventure to position 6 and rock-climbing can't be in position 2 (since it's in the same parity as writing), rock-climbing must be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already assigned rock-climbing to position 1 (to satisfy clue 2). So, this clue is redundant or has an error.

9. The person watching satire movies is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we assigned satire to position 1 and gardening to position 4, satire is not to the right of gardening.

10. The person who's sport is handball is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since we assigned rock-climbing to position 1, handball can't be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, we already assigned handball to position 5 (to satisfy clue 16). So, this clue is redundant or has an error.

11. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the person watching satire movies. Since we assigned gardening to position 4 and satire to position 1, gardening is not the person watching satire movies.

12. The person who's sport is baseball is the person watching time-travel movies or the person who's sport is baseball is the person who's hobby is woodworking or both. Since we already assigned baseball to position 3 and time-travel movies to position 6, this means that the person who's hobby is woodworking must be the person watching time-travel movies (position 6).

13. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's sport is baseball. Since we assigned rock-climbing to position 1 and baseball to position 3, weightlifting must be in position 2.

14. The person who's sport is rowing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since we assigned rowing to position 4 and hiking is not assigned yet, rowing can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, rowing must be in position 5 or 6. However, we already assigned rowing to position 4. So, this clue is redundant or has an error.

15. The person watching time-travel movies is the person watching time-travel movies. This is already satisfied since we assigned time-travel movies to position 6.

16. The person who's sport is cycling is on the far right. Since we already assigned cycling to position 5, this is already satisfied.

17. The person who's sport is rowing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since we assigned rowing to position 4 and gardening to position 2, rowing is not to the left of gardening.

18. The person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies. Since we assigned rowing to position 4 and adventure to position 6, rowing is on the left or right of adventure. However, we already assigned rowing to position 4, so it's on the left of adventure.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Satire   |   Baseball   |   Rowing   |   Gardening |   Writing   |   Time-travel |
|   Movie    |     Sport    |     Sport   |     Hobby   |     Hobby   |     Movie     |
#############
|   1        |     3        |     4       |     2       |     2       |     6         |
```

This table satisfies all the given clues. However, there are some clues that seem redundant or have errors, such as clues 6, 7, 8, 10, 14, and 18. It's possible that there might be a mistake in the puzzle or some clues are not necessary for the solution."	{'satire': ['baseball', 'rowing', 'gardening', 'writing', 'time-travel'], 'movie': ['sport', 'sport', 'hobby', 'hobby', 'movie']}	False	0	False
Lv11-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all the jobs, beverages, and transports are unique, we can use the positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) to represent them.

2. From rule 1, the teacher and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions. This means their positions can't be the same or a difference of 2 (even-even or odd-odd). So, mirinda can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5, and the teacher can't be in position 2.

3. From rule 2, the person drinking mirinda is not the lawyer. So, mirinda can't be in position 1 (as it would be the lawyer according to rule 9).

4. From rule 3, the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the librarian. This means cola can't be in positions 4 or 5.

5. From rule 4, the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. So, cola can't be in position 1 or 2.

6. From rule 5, the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. So, milk can't be in position 1 or 2.

7. From rule 6, the person drinking cola and the paramedic have the same parity positions. Since cola can't be in position 1 or 2, the paramedic also can't be in position 1 or 2.

8. From rule 7, the librarian is not to the right of the lawyer. So, the lawyer can't be in position 5.

9. From rule 8, the teacher is on the right of the architect. So, the architect can't be in position 5.

10. From rule 10, the paramedic is not to the left of the person drinking 7up. So, 7up can't be in position 1 or 2.

11. From rule 11, the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the tram is the person drinking milk (rule 16), the snowmobile can't be in position 5.

12. From rule 12, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since cola can't be in position 5, the skateboard can't be in position 5 either.

13. From rule 13, the person driving the ship is not the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda can't be in position 1, the ship can't be in position 1 either.

14. From rule 14, the architect is on the left of the teacher. Since the teacher can't be in position 5, the architect can't be in position 5 either.

15. From rule 15, the librarian is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer can't be in position 5, the librarian can't be in position 5 either.

16. From rule 16, the person driving the tram is the person drinking milk. So, milk is in position 5.

17. From rule 17, the teacher is on the right of the architect. Since the architect can't be in position 5, the teacher can't be in position 1 either.

18. From rule 18, the architect is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard can't be in position 5, the architect can't be in position 2 either.

19. From rule 19, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since milk is in position 5, the snowmobile can't be in position 4 or 5.

20. From rule 20, the teacher is the person driving the trike or the person driving the trike is the person drinking milk or both. Since the teacher can't be in position 1 and milk is in position 5, the teacher can't drive the trike. So, the person drinking milk (the tram driver) must be driving the trike. This means the trike is in position 5 (already occupied by milk). So, the teacher can't drive the trike.

Now, let's fill in the positions:

| Beverage    |     1      |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5     |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 7up        |            |            |         |           |          |
| Cola       |            |            |         |           |  milk    |
| Milk       |            |            |         |           |  milk    |
| Mirinda    |            |            |         |           |          |
| Soy-milk   |            |            |         |           |          |
| Architect  |            |            |         |           |          |
| Lawyer     |            |            |         |           |          |
| Librarian  |            |            |         |           |          |
| Paramedic  |            |            |         |           |          |
| Teacher    |            |            |         |           |          |
| Tram       |            |            |         |           |  milk    |
| Trike      |            |            |         |           |  milk    |
| Skateboard |            |            |         |           |          |
| Snowmobile |            |            |         |           |          |
| Ship       | 7up        |            |         |           |          |

From rule 9, the lawyer is on the far right. So, the lawyer is in position 5 (already occupied by milk). Since milk is the tram and the lawyer, the lawyer can't be the lawyer. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the lawyer is in position 1 (which would mean the teacher is driving the trike), we can continue:

| Beverage    |     1      |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5     |
|------------|------------|------------|---------|-----------|----------|
| 7up        | 7up        |            |         |           |          |

| Paramedic  |            |            |         |           |          |
| Teacher    |            |            |         |           | trike    |
| Tram       |            |            |         |           |  milk    |
| Trike      |            |            |         |           |  teacher |
| Skateboard |            |            |         |           |          |

| Ship       |            |            |         |           |          |

From rule 10, the paramedic is not to the left of the person drinking 7up. So, the paramedic can't be in position 1.

From rule 11, the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile can't be in position 5 (already occupied by the teacher driving the trike), the snowmobile can't be in position 4 either (as it would be to the left of the tram). So, the snowmobile can only be in position 3.

From rule 12, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since cola can't be in position 5 (already occupied by the lawyer), the skateboard can't be in position 4 either (as it would be to the right of the cola). So, the skateboard can only be in position 2.

From rule 13, the person driving the ship is not the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the lawyer), the ship can't be in position 2 either (as it would be to the left of the mirinda). So, the ship can only be in position 3.

From rule 14, the architect is on the left of the teacher. Since the teacher is in position 5, the architect can't be in position 5 either. Since the architect can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the lawyer), the architect can only be in position 2.

From rule 15, the librarian is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 1, the librarian can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the librarian can only be in position 4.

From rule 16, the person driving the tram is the person drinking milk. Since the tram is the lawyer (in position 1), the milk is also the lawyer. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the lawyer is in position 2 (which would mean the teacher is driving the trike), we can continue:

| Beverage    |     1      |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5     |

| Ship       |            |            |         |           |          |

From rule 17, the teacher is on the right of the architect. Since the architect is in position 2, the teacher can't be in position 1. So, the teacher can only be in position 3.

From rule 18, the architect is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard is in position 2, the architect can't be in position 1. So, the architect can only be in position 3 or 4. But since the librarian can't be in position 4 (already occupied by the teacher), the architect must be in position 3.

From rule 19, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the milk is the lawyer in position 2, the snowmobile can't be in position 3 or 4. So, the snowmobile can only be in position 1 or 5. But since the skateboard is in position 2, the snowmobile can't be in position 1. So, the snowmobile can only be in position 5.

From rule 20, the teacher is the person driving the trike or the person driving the trike is the person drinking milk or both. Since the teacher is in position 3, the teacher can't be driving the trike. So, the person drinking milk (the lawyer in position 2) must be driving the trike. This means the trike is in position 2 (already occupied by the lawyer). So, the teacher can't drive the trike.

This leads to a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the lawyer is in position 3 (which would mean the teacher is driving the trike), we can continue:

| Ship       |            |            |         |           |          |

From rule 10, the paramedic is not to the left of the person drinking 7up. Since 7up is in position 1, the paramedic can't be in position 1 either.

From rule 11, the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is in position 5, the tram can't be in position 4 or 5. So, the tram can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. But since the lawyer is in position 3, the tram can't be in position 3. So, the tram can only be in position 1 or 2. But since the skateboard is in position 2, the tram can't be in position 2. So, the tram can only be in position 1.

From rule 12, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since cola can't be in position 5 (already occupied by the teacher driving the trike), the skateboard can't be in position 4 either (as it would be to the right of the cola). So, the skateboard can only be in position 2 or 3. But since the tram is in position 1, the skateboard can't be in position 1. So, the skateboard can only be in position 3.

From rule 13, the person driving the ship is not the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda can't be in position 1 (already occupied by the lawyer), the ship can't be in position 2 or 3. So, the ship can only be in position 4 or 5. But since the librarian can't be in position 4 (already occupied by the teacher), the ship can't be in position 4. So, the ship can only be in position 5.

From rule 14, the architect is on the left of the teacher. Since the teacher is in position 3, the architect can't be in position 3 either. So, the architect can only be in position 1 or 2. But since the skateboard is in position 3, the architect can't be in position 3. So, the architect can only be in position 1.

From rule 15, the librarian is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 3, the librarian can't be in position 4 or 5. So, the librarian can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.

From rule 20, the teacher is the person driving the trike or the person driving the trike is the person drinking milk or both. Since the teacher is in position 3, the teacher can't be driving the trike. So, the person drinking milk (the lawyer in position 1) must be driving the trike. This means the trike is in position 1 (already occupied by the lawyer). So, the teacher can't drive the trike.

This leads to a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the lawyer is in position 4 (which would mean the teacher is driving the trike), we can continue:

From rule 20, the teacher is the person driving the trike or the person driving the trike is the person drinking milk or both.

This means the trike is in position 1 (already occupied by the lawyer). So, the teacher can't drive the trike.

This leads to a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Lv11-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the paramedic is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), let's assume the paramedic is in position 1 (as we'll see later, this assumption helps us solve other clues). So, the paramedic is a job in the first column.

2. The Chinese is the fan of country or the analyst. Since the paramedic is the analyst, the Chinese cannot be the analyst (as they can't be in the same position). So, the Chinese must be the fan of country.

3. The German is on the far left or far right. Since the paramedic (analyst) is on the far left, the German cannot be on the far left. So, the German is on the far right.

4. The paramedic is not the Brazilian and not the fan of country. So, the paramedic can't be Brazilian.

5. The Polish is not to the left of the analyst. Since the paramedic (analyst) is in position 1, the Polish is not in position 2.

6. The fan of soul is not to the left of the Brazilian. Since the paramedic (analyst) is the Brazilian's right neighbor, the fan of soul can't be to the left of the Brazilian.

7. The Brazilian is on the left of the librarian. Since the paramedic (Brazilian) is in position 1, the librarian can't be in position 2.

8. The analyst is somewhere between the fan of soul and the Chinese. Since the paramedic (analyst) is in position 1, the fan of soul can't be in position 3 or 5. So, the fan of soul is in position 2.

9. The fan of punk is somewhere between the Polish and the teacher. Since the fan of soul is in position 2, the fan of punk can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the fan of punk is in position 4.

10. The fan of punk is on the left of the German. Since the fan of punk is in position 4, the German must be in position 5.

11. The fan of r&b is not to the right of the teacher. Since the German (fan of punk) is in position 5, the fan of r&b can't be in position 5.

12. The librarian is on the left or right of the Indian. Since the paramedic (Brazilian) is in position 1, the librarian can't be in position 2. So, the librarian is in position 3 or 5. Since the German is in position 5, the librarian must be in position 3.

13. The Indian is not in position 1, 2, or 5 (as these positions are occupied by the paramedic, fan of soul, and German respectively). So, the Indian is in position 4.

14. The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of punk (German). Since the German is in position 5, the fan of funk can't be in position 5 or 6. So, the fan of funk is in position 4.

15. The teacher is not in position 1, 2, or 5 (as these positions are occupied by the paramedic, fan of soul, and German respectively). Since the librarian is in position 3, the teacher can't be in position 4. So, the teacher is in position 2.

Lv11-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people watching crime and western movies. Since they can't be next to each other, let's place the crime movie watcher first (C). Then, we know that the western movie watcher (W) can't be to the right of C, so W must be in the first four positions.

2. The person watching satire movies is the person who's hobby is reading (R). So, R must be in the positions where we haven't placed anyone yet.

3. The person driving the taxi (T) can't be to the right of the person driving the trike (Tr), so T must be in the first four positions. Since T is also the person watching fantasy movies (F) according to rule 9, F must be in the first four positions as well.

4. The person driving the boat (B) is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi (F or W). Since F and W are in the first four positions, B can't be in the first four positions. So, B is in positions 5, 6, or 7.

5. The person driving the airplane (A) can't be to the right of B, so A can't be in positions 5, 6, or 7. A must be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 8-15.

6. The person who's hobby is traveling (Tv) is not to the right of the person watching western movies (W). Since W is in the first four positions, Tv can't be in positions 5-15. So, Tv is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.

7. The person who's hobby is baking (Bk) is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car (Ca). Since Ca can't be in positions 5-15, Bk can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, Bk is in positions 5-15.

8. The person watching fantasy movies (F) is either R or T. Since R is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, F can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, F is in positions 5-15.

9. The person watching scientific movies (Sc) is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies (F). Since F is in positions 5-15, Sc is in positions 6-15.

10. The person driving the car (Ca) can't be to the right of the person who's hobby is baking (Bk). Since Bk is in positions 5-15, Ca can't be in positions 6-15. So, Ca is in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. The person who's hobby is reading (R) and the person watching western movies (W) have the same parity positions. Since R is in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, W must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

12. The person watching satire movies (S) is on the left of the person watching crime movies (C). Since C is in the first four positions, S must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

13. The person who's hobby is video-games (Vg) is on the left of the person watching satire movies (S). Since S is in positions 1, 2, or 3, Vg must be in positions 1 or 2.

14. The person watching scientific movies (Sc) is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies (F). Since F is in positions 5-15, Sc can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, Sc is in positions 5-15.

15. The person driving the trike (Tr) is not to the right of the person watching satire movies (S). Since S is in positions 1, 2, or 3, Tr can't be in positions 4-15. So, Tr is in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Now, let's place the remaining people and activities:

- Position 1: Vg (video-games), S (satire), W (western)
- Position 2: R (reading), S (satire), F (fantasy)
- Position 3: S (satire), C (crime), Tr (trike)
- Position 4: W (western), T (taxi), A (airplane)
- Position 5: B (baking), Sc (scientific), Bk (baking)
- Position 6: Sc (scientific), Tv (traveling), Ca (car)
- Position 7: B (baking), Tv (traveling), # (empty)
- Position 8-15: # (empty)

So, the final solution table is:

Lv11-3x5-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each person based on their sport, with the person playing soccer being number 1. Since the person playing rowing is to the right of the person playing soccer, the person playing rowing is 3, 4, or 5.

2. The person eating mango is in the middle, so they are number 3. Let's assign the sports as follows:
   - Person 1: Soccer
   - Person 2: Rowing (since it's not 1, 3, or 5)
   - Person 3: Mango, Sport 2 (since it's not 1 and it's the middle)
   - Person 4: (Sport 3 or 5, not 1 or 3)
   - Person 5: (Sport 1, 3, or 4, not 2 or 3)

3. The person drinking water is the person eating eggplant or the person eating eggplant is the person who's sport is soccer or both. Since we know the person eating eggplant is on the left of the person eating pumpkin (22), and the person eating pumpkin is the person drinking almond-milk or the person who's sport is rowing is the person eating pumpkin or both (13), we can deduce that the person eating eggplant is 2. So, the person drinking water is 2 (eating eggplant) or 1 (soccer). Let's assume the person drinking water is 1 (soccer).

4. The person drinking cola is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (15). Since the person playing tennis is 6 (from 6, we know the person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is tennis, so 6 must be tennis), the person drinking cola is not 5 or 6.

5. The person eating cucumber is the person who's sport is tennis (6). So, the person drinking cola is 4 or 2 (since it's not 5 or 6).

6. The person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the person eating pumpkin (7). Since the person eating pumpkin is 3 (mango), the person drinking almond-milk is 4, 5, or 2 (since it's not 3).

7. The person who's sport is rowing is not the person drinking 7up (8). Since the person drinking water is 1 (soccer), the person drinking 7up is 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not 1).

8. The person drinking almond-milk is not the person eating cucumber (9). Since the person eating cucumber is 6 (tennis), the person drinking almond-milk is not 6. So, the person drinking almond-milk is 2, 4, or 5 (since it's not 6 or 1).

9. The person who's sport is soccer is the person eating eggplant or the person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is soccer or both (17). Since we already know the person drinking 7up is 2, the person playing soccer is 1 or 2. But we already assigned 1 as the person drinking water, so the person playing soccer is 2.

10. The person eating pumpkin is the person drinking almond-milk or the person who's sport is rowing is the person eating pumpkin or both (13). Since we know the person drinking almond-milk is 2, the person eating pumpkin is 2 or 4 (since it's not 3).

11. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin (11). Since the person eating pumpkin is 2 or 4, the person drinking soy-milk is 1, 3, or 5 (since it's not 2 or 4).

12. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person who's sport is tennis (15). Since the person playing tennis is 6, the person drinking cola is 4, 5, or 2 (since it's not 6). But we already know the person drinking cola is 4, so it's confirmed.

13. The person eating mango and the person drinking cola have different parity positions (20). Since we know the person eating mango is 3, the person drinking cola is 4 or 5 (since 3 has an odd position).

14. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk (14). Since the person drinking almond-milk is 2, the person drinking soy-milk is 4 or 5.

15. The person eating blueberry is not to the left of the person eating blueberry (21), so it must be 4 or 5.

16. The person eating pumpkin and the person who's sport is soccer have different parity positions (16). Since we know the person eating pumpkin is 2 (even position), the person playing soccer is 1 (odd position).

17. The person drinking 7up is the person eating eggplant or the person who's sport is soccer is the person drinking 7up or both (17). Since we know the person playing soccer is 2, the person drinking 7up is 1 (since it's not 2).

18. The person eating cucumber is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person who's sport is surfing (18). Since the person drinking almond-milk is 2 and the person playing surfing is 3 or 5 (since it's not 1, 2, or 4), the person eating cucumber is 3 or 4. But we already know the person eating cucumber is 6 (tennis), so it's a contradiction. This puzzle seems to have an inconsistency.

Final solution table:

|            |    1     |      2      |     3      |    4     |     5     |

| Food       | eggplant | pumpkin    | cucumber  | blueberry| mango     |
| Sport      | soccer   | rowing     | surfing   | tennis   | volleyball|

However, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, as assigning the sports and food according to the given rules leads to the person eating cucumber being both between the person drinking almond-milk and the person playing surfing, and being the person playing tennis, which is not possible."	{'beverage': ['water', 'almond-milk', 'cola', 'soy-milk', '7up'], 'food': ['eggplant', 'pumpkin', 'cucumber', 'blueberry', 'mango'], 'sport': ['soccer', 'rowing', 'surfing', 'tennis', 'volleyball']}	True	6	False
Lv11-3x5-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's place the person drinking iced-tea on the far left (position 1).

2. Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be in position 1 (rule 9 contradicts rule 2 or 3). So, almond-milk is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The person drinking water is not the person watching adventure movies (rule 12), so water cannot be in position 1 (since it would be the only beverage left for position 2, which contradicts rule 9). Therefore, water is either in position 3, 4, or 5.

4. The person drinking water is not the person who's hobby is chess or the person drinking water is the person watching animation movies or both (rule 17). Since water is not in position 1, it cannot be the person watching animation movies (since there's no one left to watch animation in position 2). So, water is not the person watching animation movies, and it's not the person who's hobby is chess. Therefore, water is in position 3, 4, or 5, and it's not the person who's hobby is chess.

5. The person who's hobby is chess is not the person drinking sprite (rule 13), so chess cannot be in position 1 (since it would be the only hobby left for position 2, which contradicts rule 16). Therefore, chess is either in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (rule 16). So, chess is in position 1, 2, or 3.

7. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (rule 6). Since the person drinking water is not the person watching animation movies (rule 4), and water is in position 3, 4, or 5, the person watching animation movies cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the person watching animation movies is in position 4 or 5.

8. The person watching documentary movies is between the person watching animation movies and the person drinking water (rule 10). Since the person watching animation movies is in position 4 or 5, the person watching documentary movies is in position 2 or 3.

9. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person watching animation movies (rule 11). So, the person watching documentary movies is in position 3.

Lv11-3x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, the fan of blues is between rugby and weightlifting. Let's place them as follows:
   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
   | Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting|           |        |
   | Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Blues      |        |
   | Sport         |         |             |             |           |        |

2. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is fishing is not to the left of the fan of d&b. Since d&b is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet.

3. From rule 3, the fan of blues is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. Let's place the fan of hip-hop to the right of the fan of blues:
   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
   | Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting| Hip-hop    | Fishing  |
   | Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Hip-hop    |         |
   | Sport         |         |             |             |           |        |

4. From rule 4, the fan of folk is not to the left of the fan of funk. Since funk is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet.

5. From rule 5, the person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since water-polo is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet. Let's place volleyball in the middle:
   |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
   | Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting| Hip-hop    | Fishing  |
   | Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Hip-hop    |         |

6. From rule 6, the person who's sport is volleyball is in the middle. This is already satisfied.

7. From rule 7, the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk. Since funk is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet.

8. From rule 8, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since board-games is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet.

9. From rule 9, the person who's hobby is fishing is the fan of funk or the person who's sport is water-polo is the person who's hobby is fishing, but not both. Since fishing and funk are not yet placed, we can't determine their positions yet.

10. From rule 10, the fan of hip-hop is not to the right of the fan of folk. Since folk is not yet placed, we can't determine its position yet.

11. From rule 11, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since rugby is already placed, we can place weightlifting to its left:
    |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |

    | Sport         | Rugby    |             | Weightlifting|           | Volleyball|
    |              |         |             |             |           |         |
    |              |         |             |             |           |         |

12. From rule 12, the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. This is already satisfied.

13. From rule 13, the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since weightlifting is already placed, we can place skydiving to its left:
    |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
    | Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting| Hip-hop    | Fishing  |
    | Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Hip-hop    |         |
    | Sport         | Rugby    |             | Weightlifting|           | Volleyball|
    |              | Skydiving |             |             |           |         |
    |              |         |             |             |           |         |

14. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's hobby is board-games. Since board-games is not yet placed, we can place traveling to the right of rugby:
    |               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
    | Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting| Hip-hop    | Fishing  |
    | Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Hip-hop    |         |
    | Sport         | Rugby    |             | Weightlifting|           | Volleyball|
    |              | Skydiving |             |             |           |         |
    |              | Traveling |             |             |           | Board-games|

15. From rule 15, the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person who's hobby is skydiving or the person who's sport is weightlifting is the fan funk or both. Since weightlifting and skydiving are already placed next to each other, they must be the same person. However, this contradicts rule 9, as we can't have both fishing and weightlifting in the same position. This puzzle seems to have an inconsistency.

Final solution table (with the inconsistency):

```
|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |     4      |   5    |
| Hobby         | Rugby    | Blues        | Weightlifting| Hip-hop    | Fishing  |
| Music-Genre   |         |             |             | Hip-hop    |         |
| Sport         | Rugby    |             | Weightlifting|           | Volleyball|
|              | Skydiving |             |             |           |         |
|              | Traveling |             |             |           | Board-games|
```

The inconsistency is that the person who's sport is weightlifting is also the person who's hobby is skydiving, which violates rule 9."	{'hobby': ['rugby', 'blues', 'weightlifting', 'hip-hop', 'fishing'], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', 'hip-hop', ''], 'sport': ['rugby', '', 'weightlifting', '', 'volleyball']}	True	1	False
Lv11-3x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, the Pakistani is on the far left, so we can place them in the first column. Since there are 5 nationalities, the Argentine must be in the second column (rule 13 contradicts placing the Argentine in the last column). The British, being in an even position (rule 6), must be in the fourth column, and the Chinese, not being to the left of the Pakistani (rule 11), must be in the third column.

2. The Colombian cannot be in the first column (rule 5), so they must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth column. Since the Colombian eats kiwi (rule 7), they must be in the third column (as the first and fifth columns are occupied). This means the British must be in the second column, and the Argentine in the fifth column.

3. The person eating banana cannot be to the left of the Colombian (rule 8), so they must be in the fourth or fifth column. Since the British is in the second column (rule 6), the banana eater cannot be in the fourth column (rule 15 contradicts this). Therefore, the banana eater must be in the fifth column.

4. The person eating asparagus cannot be in the first column (rule 3), cannot be in the fifth column (rule 13), and cannot be to the right of the banana eater (rule 18). So, the asparagus eater must be in the second column.

5. The person who plays baseball cannot be the Colombian (rule 2), so they must be in the first, third, or fourth column. Since the Colombian eats kiwi (rule 7), the baseball player cannot be in the third column (rule 7 contradicts this). The baseball player also cannot be in the first column (rule 12 contradicts this). Therefore, the baseball player must be in the fourth column.

6. The person who plays rugby cannot be in the first column (rule 1), cannot be in the second column (rule 13 contradicts this), cannot be in the third column (rule 11 contradicts this), and cannot be in the fifth column (rule 12 contradicts this). So, the rugby player must be in the fourth column.

7. The person who plays skateboarding cannot be in the first column (rule 17 contradicts this), cannot be in the second column (rule 13 contradicts this), and cannot be in the fifth column (rule 12 contradicts this). So, the skateboarder must be in the third column.

8. The person who plays snowboarding cannot be in the first column (rule 14 contradicts this), cannot be in the second column (rule 13 contradicts this), and cannot be in the fourth column (rule 17 contradicts this). So, the snowboarder must be in the fifth column.

9. The person who plays swimming cannot be in the first column (rule 15 contradicts this), cannot be in the second column (rule 13 contradicts this), and cannot be in the third column (rule 17 contradicts this). So, the swimmer must be in the fourth column.

The final solution table is:
