Lv11-5x5-1	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, let's use F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 for the food, J1, J2, J3, J4, J5 for the jobs, M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 for the music-genres, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 for the sports, and T1, T2, T3, T4, T5 for the transport.

2. Let's start with the positions. From rule 15, we know that F5 is in an odd position. From rule 28, we know that T2 is in an odd position. Since positions are unique, T2 must be F5. So, T2 = F5 = Bus.

3. From rule 27, we know that T2 (Bus) is not to the right of F3 (Cranberry). So, F3 cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. Since positions are unique and F5 is already assigned, F3 must be in position 3. So, F3 = Cranberry.

4. From rule 4, we know that the person driving the roller is the person eating cranberry. So, T3 = F3 = Roller.

5. From rule 25, we know that T3 (Roller) and F1 have the same parity positions. Since we know F3 is odd, F1 must be even. So, F1 cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. Since F5 is already assigned, F1 must be in position 2. So, F1 = Lemon.

6. From rule 24, we know that T4 and F2 have the same parity positions. Since we know F3 is odd and F1 is even, T4 must be even. Since T2 and T5 are odd (from rule 28), T4 must be in position 4. So, T4 = F2 = Trike.

7. From rule 23, we know that the mechanic is not to the right of the person driving the roller (T3). So, J3 cannot be in position 4, 5. Since J5 is already assigned, J3 must be in position 1. So, J3 = Mechanic.

8. From rule 29, we know that the coach is on the right of the mechanic (J3). So, J1 = Coach.

9. From rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding (S5) is on the left of the coach (J1). So, S5 cannot be in position 2, 3, 4, 5. Since S1, S2, S3, and S4 are already assigned, S5 must be in position 1. So, S5 = Skateboarding.

10. From rule 13, we know that the person eating plum (F4) is the person who's sport is skateboarding (S5) or the fan d&b (M5) is the person who's sport is skateboarding (S5) or both. Since we already know S5, let's assume F4 = Skateboarding for now.

11. From rule 17, we know that the fan d&b (M5) is the person who's sport is skateboarding (S5). So, M5 = D&B.

12. From rule 19, we know that the videographer (J5) is on the far left or far right. Since we already know J1 (Coach) and J3 (Mechanic) are not on the far left, J5 must be on the far right. So, J5 = Videographer.

13. From rule 18, we know that the person who's sport is tennis (S4) is on the far left. Since we already know J1 (Coach) and J3 (Mechanic) are not on the far left, S4 must be in position 2. So, S4 = Tennis.

14. From rule 14, we know that S5 (Skateboarding) is somewhere to the left of S3 (Snowboarding). Since S4 (Tennis) is in position 2, S3 must be in position 3. So, S3 = Snowboarding.

15. From rule 16, we know that M5 (D&B) is not to the left of J4 (Manager). Since we already know J1 (Coach), J3 (Mechanic), and J5 (Videographer) are not on the far left, J4 must be in position 4. So, J4 = Manager.

16. From rule 10, we know that F4 cannot be Skateboarding. So, F4 = Plum.

17. From rule 30, we know that F4 (Plum) is not to the left of S1 (Biathlon). Since we already know S3 (Snowboarding) is not to the right of S1, S1 must be in position 5. So, S1 = Biathlon.

18. From rule 10, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not to the right of F3 (Cranberry). Since we already know F3 is in position 3, F3 cannot be in position 4 or 5. So, F3 = Cranberry.

19. From rule 10, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not to the right of F4 (Plum). Since we already know F4 is in position 4, F4 cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, F4 = Plum.

20. From rule 10, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not to the right of F5 (Corn). Since we already know F5 is in position 5, F5 cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, F5 = Corn.

21. From rule 10, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not to the right of F2 (Lemon). Since we already know F2 is in position 2, F2 cannot be in position 1, 3, 4, or 5. So, F2 = Lemon.

22. From rule 22, we know that the person eating corn (F5) is the manager (J4) or the person who's sport is snowboarding (S3) is the person eating corn (F5) or both. Since we already know J4 and S3, let's assume F5 = Manager for now.

23. From rule 21, we know that the mechanic (J3) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). So, S1 cannot be the mechanic (J3).

24. From rule 21, we know that the mechanic (J3) is not the person eating corn (F5). So, F5 cannot be the mechanic (J3).

25. Since F5 cannot be the mechanic (J3) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). So, F5 = Manager.

26. From rule 21, we know that the mechanic (J3) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). Since we already know S1, J3 must be the person who's sport is another sport. Let's assume S2 = Ice-Hockey for now.

27. From rule 26, we know that M3 (Jazz) is not to the right of S2 (Ice-Hockey). Since we already know S1 (Biathlon) and S3 (Snowboarding) are not to the right of S2, S2 must be in position 2. So, S2 = Ice-Hockey.

28. From rule 23, we know that the mechanic (J3) is not to the right of the person driving the roller (T3). Since we already know T3 (Roller) is in position 3, J3 cannot be in position 4 or 5. So, J3 = Mechanic.

29. From rule 20, we know that the person eating corn (F5) is not to the right of the fan hip-hop (M4). Since we already know M4 is in position 4, F5 cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, F5 = Manager.

30. From rule 29, we know that the person eating corn (F5) is the manager (J4). So, F5 = Manager.

31. From rule 21, we know that the mechanic (J3) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). Since we already know S1, J3 must be the person who's sport is another sport. Let's assume S4 = Skateboarding for now.

32. From rule 31, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not the person eating corn (F5). So, F5 cannot be the person who's sport is biathlon (S1).

33. From rule 31, we know that S1 (Biathlon) is not the mechanic (J3). So, J3 cannot be the person who's sport is biathlon (S1).

34. Since F5 cannot be the person who's sport is biathlon (S1) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). But we already know F5 = Manager. So, our assumption that S4 = Skateboarding is incorrect. Let's try S4 = Tennis instead.

35. From rule 34, we know that S4 (Tennis) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). Since we already know S1, S2, and S3, S1 must be in position 5. So, S1 = Biathlon.

36. From rule 34, we know that S4 (Tennis) is not the mechanic (J3). So, J3 cannot be the person who's sport is tennis (S4).

37. From rule 34, we know that S4 (Tennis) is not the person eating corn (F5). So, F5 cannot be the person who's sport is tennis (S4).

38. Since F5 cannot be the person who's sport is tennis (S4) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). But we already know F5 = Manager. So, our assumption that S4 = Tennis is incorrect. Let's try S4 = Snowboarding instead.

39. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Snowboarding) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). Since we already know S1, S2, and S3, S1 must be in position 5. So, S1 = Biathlon.

40. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Snowboarding) is not the mechanic (J3). So, J3 cannot be the person who's sport is snowboarding (S4).

41. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Snowboarding) is not the person eating corn (F5). So, F5 cannot be the person who's sport is snowboarding (S4).

42. Since F5 cannot be the person who's sport is snowboarding (S4) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). But we already know F5 = Manager. So, our assumption that S4 = Snowboarding is incorrect. Let's try S4 = Skateboarding again.

43. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Skateboarding) is not the person who's sport is biathlon (S1). Since we already know S1, S2, and S3, S1 must be in position 5. So, S1 = Biathlon.

44. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Skateboarding) is not the mechanic (J3). So, J3 cannot be the person who's sport is skateboarding (S4).

45. From rule 38, we know that S4 (Skateboarding) is not the person eating corn (F5). So, F5 cannot be the person who's sport is skateboarding (S4).

46. Since F5 cannot be the person who's sport is skateboarding (S4) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). But we already know F5 = Manager. So, our assumption that S4 = Skateboarding is incorrect. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that F4 = Plum is incorrect. Let's try F4 = Corn instead.

47. From rule 46, we know that F4 (Corn) is not the person who's sport is skateboarding (S4). Since we already know S1, S2, and S3, S1 must be in position 5. So, S1 = Biathlon.

48. From rule 46, we know that F4 (Corn) is not the mechanic (J3). So, J3 cannot be the person who's sport is corn (F4).

49. From rule 46, we know that F4 (Corn) is not the person eating plum (F5). So, F5 cannot be the person who's sport is corn (F4).

50. Since F5 cannot be the person who's sport is corn (F4) and we already know F5 is not S1, F5 must be the manager (J4). But we already know F5 = Manager. So, our assumption that F4 = Corn is incorrect. This is a contradiction, which means our initial assumption that F4 = Plum is correct.

Now, let's fill in the final solution table:

  |               |      1       |     2      |    3     |       4       |      5       |

This is the final solution table. The table shows the final positions of the food, jobs, music-genres, sports, and transport based on the given rules."	{'food': ['lemon', 'plum', 'cranberry', 'corn', ''], 'job': ['coach', 'manager', 'mechanic', 'videographer', ''], 'music-genre': ['d&b', 'jazz', 'salsa', 'trance', ''], 'sport': ['biathlon', 'ice-hockey', 'snowboarding', 'skateboarding', ''], 'transport': ['bike', 'bus', 'roller', 'trike', 'van']}	True	5	False
Lv11-5x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the positions for the people based on the given clues.

1. Reggae is odd, so it can't be in position 1 or 2 (even positions).
2. Classical is not next to Reggae, so it can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5 (since Reggae is in an odd position).
3. Card-games is not to the left of Boat, so it can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
4. 7up is to the right of Indie, so it can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4.
5. Drawing is not to the left of Camping, so Drawing can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
6. Chef is to the left of Firefighter, so Chef can't be in positions 5 or 6.
7. Milk is Hip-hop or Rock-climbing, but not both. Since Hip-hop and Rock-climbing can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (due to other clues), Milk must be in one of those positions. Let's assume Milk is in position 5 for now.
8. Milk is the person driving the Boat, so Boat can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
9. Drawing is not to the left of Card-games, so Drawing can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
10. Firefighter is not the person drinking 7up, so Firefighter can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.
11. Mirinda and Roller have the same parity positions, so they can't both be in even positions or both be in odd positions. Since Mirinda can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (due to other clues), Roller must be in an even position.
12. Reggae is in an odd position, so it can't be in position 2 (since 2 is even).
13. Drawing is the person drinking Almond-milk or the Engineer, but not both. Since Almond-milk can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (due to other clues), Drawing must be in position 4.
14. Roller is not to the left of Camping, so Roller can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
15. Reggae is to the left of Skateboard, so Reggae can't be in positions 5 or 6.
16. Rock-climbing and Hip-hop have different parity positions, so they can't both be in even positions or both be in odd positions. Since Rock-climbing can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (due to other clues), Hip-hop must be in an even position.
17. Taxi is on the left or right of Chef, so Chef can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5.
18. Ambient is not to the left of Rock-climbing, so Ambient can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
19. Jet-ski is on the far right, so it must be in position 5.
20. Camping is to the left of Firefighter, so Camping can't be in positions 4 or 5.
21. Firefighter is not to the right of Almond-milk, so Firefighter can't be in positions 4 or 5.
22. Rock-climbing is not to the right of Skateboard, so Rock-climbing can't be in positions 4 or 5.
23. Taxi is to the right of Boat, so Boat can't be in position 5.
24. Drawing is to the right of Cola, so Drawing can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
25. Ambient is not to the left of Skateboard, so Ambient can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.
26. Indie is not to the right of Milk, so Indie can't be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.
27. 7up is the person driving the Boat or the person drinking Hip-hop or both (but not both). Since 7up is already assigned to the Boat, Hip-hop must be in position 1.
28. Reggae is not the person driving the Boat, so Reggae can't be in position 5.
29. Roller is to the right of Reading, so Reading can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
30. Nurse is to the left of Reading, so Nurse can't be in positions 4 or 5.

Now let's assign the remaining positions:
- Since Reggae is in an odd position and can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, it must be in position 3.
- Since Hip-hop is in position 1, it can't be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5 for other clues.
- Since Roller is in an even position and can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5, it must be in position 6.
- Since Reading can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, it must be in position 4.
- Since Ambient can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, it must be in position 2.
- Since Indie can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it must be in position 5.
- Since Milk is the person driving the Boat, it must be in position 5.
- Since Almond-milk can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5, it must be in position 4 (since Drawing is already in position 4).
- Since Cola can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, it must be in position 6.
- Since Mirinda and Roller have the same parity positions, Mirinda must be in position 6 (since Roller is in position 6).
- Since the Chef is to the left of the Firefighter and the Firefighter can't be in positions 4 or 5, the Chef must be in position 2.
- Since the Nurse is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading and Reading is in position 4, the Nurse must be in position 3.
- Since the Taxi is to the right of the Boat and the Boat is in position 5, the Taxi must be in position 1.
- Since the person who's hobby is camping is to the left of the Firefighter and the Firefighter can't be in positions 4 or 5, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 3.

Now let's assign the remaining jobs and hobbies:
- Since the Taxi is in position 1, the person driving the Taxi is the Nurse.
- Since the Boat is in position 5, the person driving the Boat is the person drinking Milk, who is a Nurse.
- Since the Chef is in position 2, the Chef's hobby must be one of the remaining hobbies: camping, card-games, drawing, reading, rock-climbing. Since the Chef can't be to the left of the person who's hobby is camping (because the person who's hobby is camping is the Firefighter's left), the Chef's hobby can't be camping. Since the Chef can't be to the left of Reading (because the Nurse is to the left of Reading), the Chef's hobby can't be reading. Since the Chef can't be to the left of Drawing (because the person who's hobby is drawing is the person drinking Almond-milk), the Chef's hobby can't be drawing. Since the Chef can't be to the left of Rock-climbing (because the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person drinking Hip-hop), the Chef's hobby must be card-games.
- Since the Firefighter can't be in positions 4 or 5, the Firefighter must be in position 2 (since the Chef is in position 2 and the Firefighter is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping). Since the Firefighter can't be to the right of Almond-milk (because Almond-milk is in position 4), the Firefighter's hobby can't be drawing. Since the Firefighter can't be to the right of Reading (because Reading is in position 4), the Firefighter's hobby can't be reading. Since the Firefighter can't be to the right of Rock-climbing (because Rock-climbing is in position 5), the Firefighter's hobby can't be rock-climbing. Since the Firefighter can't be to the right of Cola (because Cola is in position 6), the Firefighter's hobby can't be card-games. The only remaining hobby for the Firefighter is camping.
- Since the person who's hobby is camping is the Firefighter, the person who's hobby is reading must be the Engineer (since the Engineer is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading).
- Since the person who's hobby is drawing is the person drinking Almond-milk, the person who's hobby is drawing is the Engineer.
- Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the person driving the skateboard, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the Security-guard (since the Security-guard is in position 6 and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5).

Now let's assign the remaining beverages and music-genres:
- Since the Security-guard is in position 6, the Security-guard is drinking Mirinda.
- Since the Engineer is in position 3, the Engineer is drinking Almond-milk.
- Since the person who's hobby is reading is the Engineer, the person who's hobby is reading is drinking Cola.
- Since the person who's hobby is drawing is the Engineer, the person who's hobby is drawing is drinking Cola.
- Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the Security-guard, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is drinking Hip-hop.
- Since the person who's hobby is camping is the Firefighter, the person who's hobby is camping is drinking 7up.
- Since the Chef is in position 2 and the Chef's hobby is card-games, the Chef is drinking 7up.
- Since the person driving the skateboard is to the left of Reggae (since Reggae is in position 3), the person driving the skateboard is drinking Indie.
- Since the person driving the jet-ski is on the far right, the person driving the jet-ski is drinking Ambient.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv11-5x5-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a number from 1 to 5. We'll use the information that the jobs, music-genres, nationalities, sports, and transport are all unique to each person.

2. From rule 12, we know the person driving the helicopter is in the middle, so let's assign the helicopter driver as person 3.

3. From rule 22, we know the colombian is in the middle, so the colombian must be person 3. Since the colombian is a nationality, we can assign their job, music-genre, sport, and transport to the other four positions.

4. From rule 20, we know the bartender is to the right of the colombian, so the bartender cannot be person 1 or 2. The bartender cannot be person 4 because the colombian is in the middle, and the bartender cannot be person 5 because the colombian is also in the middle. So, the bartender is person 2.

5. From rule 23, we know the bartender is to the right of the thai. Since the colombian is in the middle, the thai must be person 1 or 5. The thai cannot be person 5 because the colombian is in the middle, so the thai is person 1.

6. From rule 28, we know the thai is not the person driving the train. So, the person driving the train is person 4 or 5.

7. From rule 3, we know the person driving the train is in an odd position. So, the person driving the train is person 1, 3, or 5. But the thai is person 1, so the person driving the train is person 5.

8. From rule 2, we know the colombian is not to the right of the colombian, so the colombian must be person 3. This means the thai is person 1, the bartender is person 2, and the person driving the train is person 5.

9. From rule 11, we know the colombian is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the colombian is person 3, the person driving the snowmobile is person 2 or 4. But the bartender is person 2, so the person driving the snowmobile is person 4.

10. From rule 21, we know the person who's sport is surfing is not to the right of the person driving the helicopter (person 3). So, the person who's sport is surfing is person 1, 2, or 5. But the person driving the snowmobile is person 4, so the person who's sport is surfing is person 1.

11. From rule 26, we know the person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the turkish. Since the person who's sport is surfing is person 1, the turkish must be person 2 or 5. But the bartender is person 2, so the turkish is person 5.

12. From rule 27, we know the person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the fan d&b. Since the person who's sport is surfing is person 1, the fan d&b must be person 2 or 4. But the bartender is person 2, so the fan d&b is person 4.

13. From rule 29, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the fan d&b. So, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is person 1, 3, or 5. But the person who's sport is surfing is person 1, so the person who's sport is ice-hockey is person 5.

14. From rule 17, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing (person 1). So, the person who's sport is tennis is person 2 or 3. But the bartender is person 2, so the person who's sport is tennis is person 3.

15. From rule 18, we know the fan folk is between the person driving the skateboard and the thai (person 5). So, the fan folk is person 4.

16. From rule 16, we know the person who's sport is golf and the journalist have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is golf is person 3 (tennis) and the journalist is person 2 (bartender), the journalist must be person 1 or 5. But the fan d&b is person 4, so the journalist is person 5.

17. From rule 7, we know the journalist is the person driving the trike or the journalist is the egyptian or both. Since the journalist is person 5, the journalist is driving the trike or the journalist is the egyptian. But the journalist is not the egyptian (as we'll see later), so the journalist is driving the trike.

18. From rule 14, we know the person who's sport is swimming is not to the right of the fan pop. Since the fan pop is person 4 (folk), the person who's sport is swimming is person 1, 2, or 3. But the person who's sport is surfing is person 1, the person who's sport is tennis is person 3, and the journalist is person 5, so the person who's sport is swimming is person 2.

19. From rule 19, we know the fan funk is not to the right of the fan pop (person 4). So, the fan funk is person 1, 2, or 3. But the fan d&b is person 4, the fan country is not to the right of the fan funk (rule 33), and the fan country is not the turkish (rule 25), so the fan funk is person 2.

20. From rule 7, we know the journalist is the person driving the trike or the journalist is the egyptian or both. But the journalist is driving the trike (as we found earlier), so the journalist is not the egyptian.

21. From rule 31, we know the fan funk is the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the fan funk is the bartender, but not both. Since the fan funk is person 2 and the bartender is person 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is person 5.

22. From rule 24, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the dressmaker. So, the dressmaker is person 1, 3, or 4. But the fan folk is person 4, the fan funk is person 2, and the fan country is not to the right of the fan funk (rule 33), so the dressmaker is person 1.

23. From rule 23, we know the bartender is on the left or right of the thai (person 5). But the bartender is person 2, so the thai is person 3 or 4. But the colombian is person 3, so the thai is person 4.

24. From rule 15, we know the nurse is not to the right of the dressmaker (person 1). So, the nurse is person 2, 3, or 4. But the colombian is person 3, the thai is person 4, and the fan folk is person 4, so the nurse is person 2.

25. From rule 6, we know the nurse is on the left of the fan folk. So, the fan folk is person 3 or 5. But the fan funk is person 2, and the fan country is not to the right of the fan funk (rule 33), so the fan folk is person 3.

26. From rule 34, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the person driving the train or the person who's sport is swimming is the egyptian, but not both. Since the person who's sport is swimming is person 2, the egyptian is person 1, 3, or 5. But the colombian is person 3, the thai is person 4, and the fan folk is person 3, so the egyptian is person 1.

27. From rule 8, we know the thai is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis (person 3). So, the thai is person 4.

28. From rule 1, we know the people have 5 different jobs. We've assigned jobs to all 5 people, so the jobs are: bartender, dressmaker, journalist, nurse, security-guard.

29. From rule 4, we know the music-genres are: country, d&b, folk, funk, pop.

30. From rule 5, we know the nationalities are: colombian, egyptian, indonesian, thai, turkish.

31. From rule 6, we know the sports are: golf, ice-hockey, surfing, swimming, tennis.

32. From rule 9, we know the transport are: helicopter, skateboard, snowmobile, train, trike.

Lv11-5x5-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the variables for each category:

Food: B (banana), E (eggplant), L (lettuce), P (peas), R (radish)
Job: E (electrician), I (engineer), F (fisherman), M (manager), N (nurse)
Nationality: A (argentine), B (british), C (colombian), I (italian), R (russian)
Sport: C (cycling), G (golf), H (ice-hockey), K (skateboarding), W (water-polo)
Transport: H (helicopter), J (jet-ski), Q (quad-bike), S (subway), T (tram)

Now let's solve the clues:

1. The person driving the tram is the fisherman or the person who's sport is skateboarding is the person driving the tram or both (1):
   - If the tram driver is the fisherman, then F = T.
   - If the tram driver is the skateboarder, then K = T.
   - Since both can't be true, let's assume F = T for now.

2. The person driving the helicopter is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike (##8):
   - Since F = T, the helicopter driver can't be to the right of Q.

3. The person eating banana and the colombian have the same parity positions (##9):
   - Let's assume B is even, so the Colombian is also even.

4. The person eating peas is not to the left of the person eating eggplant (##8):
   - Since the Colombian is even, the position of P can't be even and to the left of E.

5. The british is not to the right of the nurse (##8):
   - Let's assume the British is odd, so the nurse is also odd.

6. The person driving the quad-bike is the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the person driving the quad-bike is the person eating peas or both (1):
   - If the quad-bike driver is the ice-hockey player, then H = Q.
   - If the quad-bike driver is the person eating peas, then P = Q.
   - Since both can't be true, let's assume H = Q for now.

7. The person eating eggplant is the british (7):
   - E = B

8. The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person eating peas (##3):
   - Since E = B, P can't be to the left of B.

9. The fisherman is the person driving the quad-bike or the russian is the fisherman or both (1):
   - If the fisherman is the quad-bike driver, then F = Q.
   - If the Russian is the fisherman, then R = F.
   - Since both can't be true, let's assume F = Q for now.

10. The person eating radish is on the left of the engineer (10):
    - Since F = Q, R can't be to the right of I.

11. The person eating peas and the british have different parity positions (##9):
    - Since P is odd and B is odd, the person eating peas can't be B.

12. The person eating lettuce is on the left of the russian (12):
    - Since R is to the left of I, L can't be to the right of I.

13. The person eating radish is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (##8):
    - Since R is to the left of I, R can't be to the right of H.

14. The person driving the jet-ski and the person who's sport is golf have different parity positions (##9):
    - Let's assume G is even, so the jet-ski driver can't be even.

15. The person eating banana is not to the left of the person driving the subway (##8):
    - Since B is even, the position of B can't be even and to the left of S.

16. The colombian is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish (##5):
    - Since R is even, C can't be to the left of R.

17. The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person eating lettuce (##8):
    - Since F = Q, L can't be to the left of Q.

18. The person driving the jet-ski and the person who's sport is ice-hockey have the same parity positions (##9):
    - Since G is even, H can't be even.

19. The person who's sport is cycling is the person eating radish or the person who's sport is cycling is the argentine, but not both (0):
    - If the person eating radish does cycling, then R = C.
    - Since the argentine is odd, the person eating radish can't be the argentine.

20. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (##5):
    - Since G is even, W can't be to the left of G.

21. The person who's sport is golf is not the person eating radish (##6):
    - Since G is even and R can't be the jet-ski driver, G can't be R.

22. The person driving the tram is the person eating eggplant or the italian is the person driving the tram or both (1):
    - If the tram driver is the person eating eggplant, then E = T.
    - If the Italian is the tram driver, then I = T.
    - Since both can't be true, let's assume E = T for now.

23. The person eating peas is somewhere to the right of the british (##5):
    - Since B is odd, P can't be to the left of B.

24. The person driving the helicopter is the nurse or the person eating radish is the person driving the helicopter, but not both (0):
    - If the nurse is the helicopter driver, then N = H.
    - Since R can't be the jet-ski driver and can't be the helicopter driver, R can't be H.

25. The person eating lettuce is not the argentine (##6):
    - Since the argentine is odd, L can't be A.

26. The fisherman is in an even position (##4):
    - Since F = Q, F is even.

27. The argentine is in an odd position (##4):
    - Since A is odd, A can't be L, E, or P.

28. The nurse is on the left of the electrician (28):
    - Since N is odd and E is even, N can't be to the right of E.

29. The british is not to the left of the colombian (##8):
    - Since B is odd and C is even, B can't be to the left of C.

30. The person eating eggplant is not to the left of the person eating radish (##8):
    - Since E = T, E can't be to the left of R.

31. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere between the british and the person eating radish (##7):
    - Since G is even and B is odd, G can't be to the left of B.
    - Since G is even and R is even, G can't be to the right of R.

32. The person driving the quad-bike and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions (##9):
    - Since H = Q, H can't be C.

Lv11-5x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and the corresponding hobbies, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, and sports for each person.

Let's start by assigning variables to each person:

1. A: Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport
2. B: Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport
3. C: Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Sport

2. Hobby: C (card-games), D (drawing), G (gardening), P (photography), R (rock-climbing)
3. Movie-Genre: D (disaster), F (family), S (sports), T (thriller), TT (time-travel)
4. Music-Genre: B (blues), F (folk), G (gospel), J (jazz), P (punk)
5. Transport: R (roller), S (scooter), S (ship), T (taxi), V (van)

Now let's use the clues to deduce the positions and preferences:

1. The fan blues is not the person who's hobby is card-games (C is not B)
2. The fan folk is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the fan folk is the person eating avocado or both (D or K = R or A or both)
3. The person who's hobby is gardening is in an odd position (G is in an odd position)
4. The person driving the roller is not to the left of the person eating plum (R is not to the left of P)
5. The fan gospel and the person who's hobby is gardening have different parity positions (G and G are in different parity positions)
6. The fan punk is the person eating pomegranate or the fan punk is the person who's hobby is drawing or both (G is P or K is P or both)
7. The person eating avocado is the person who's hobby is photography or the person eating avocado is the fan jazz or both (A is P or A is J or both)
8. The fan folk is in an even position (D is in an even position)
9. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (TT is to the left of R)
10. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person eating plum (T is to the left or right of P)
11. The fan blues is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter (B is to the right of S)
12. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the fan gospel have the same parity positions (R and G have the same parity positions)
13. The person watching disaster movies and the person eating avocado have the same parity positions (D and A have the same parity positions)
14. The fan punk is on the far left (P is in the first position)
15. The person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person who's hobby is photography (S is not to the left of P)
16. The person who's hobby is card-games and the fan punk have different parity positions (C and P have different parity positions)
17. The person watching sports movies and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions (S and T have the same parity positions)
18. The person driving the van is the fan punk or the person who's hobby is card-games is the person driving the van, but not both (P or C = V, but not both)
19. The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the right of the fan folk (T is to the right of D)
20. The person watching sports movies is not to the left of the fan jazz (S is not to the left of J)
21. The person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games (R is to the left of C)
22. The person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person watching sports movies (S is not to the left of S)
23. The person eating avocado is somewhere between the person eating plum and the person driving the van (A is between P and V)
24. The person driving the van is not the person eating pomegranate (V is not G)
25. The person eating pomegranate is not the fan folk (G is not D)
26. The fan gospel is on the left of the person eating pomegranate (G is to the left of G)
27. The person eating lime is on the left of the person eating plum (L is to the left of P)

Now we can start filling in the table with the deduced information:

|               |      1      |       2       |      3      |     4      |      5      |

| Transport     | R (roller) | S (scooter) | S (ship) | T (taxi) | V (van) |

Now we can fill in the remaining positions based on the parity positions:

1. Since G (gardening) is in an odd position, 3 must be K (kale) and 5 must be A (avocado)
2. Since D (disaster) is in an even position, 2 must be T (thriller) and 4 must be F (family)
3. Since TT (time-travel) is to the left of R (rock-climbing), 1 must be TT (time-travel)
4. Since S (sports) is to the right of B (blues), 6 must be S (sports)
5. Since S (sports) is to the left or right of P (pomegranate), 3 must be S (ship) and 5 must be P (pomegranate)

Now we can fill in the remaining positions based on the other clues:

1. Since P (punk) is on the far left, 4 must be C (card-games)
2. Since C (card-games) and P (punk) have different parity positions, 2 must be D (drawing)
3. Since A (avocado) is between P (plum) and V (van), 3 must be A (avocado) and 5 must be V (van)
4. Since L (lime) is to the left of P (plum), 1 must be L (lime)

Lv11-5x5-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, F1 for Food 1, H1 for Hobby 1, M1 for Music-Genre 1, N1 for Nationality 1, and S1 for Sport 1. We'll do the same for the other four people.

2. Let's also assign parity (even or odd) to each position. Since we have 5 people, we can use the parity of the number itself (odd for odd positions, even for even positions).

3. Let's start with the given information:

   - The people are in distinct positions (1 to 5).
   - There are 5 different types of food, hobbies, music-genres, nationalities, and sports.

4. Let's use the given clues to fill in the table step by step:

   - From clue 3, we know that the person eating cherry is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. So, let's place Cherry in position 1 and Badminton in position 2 or 5. Let's place Badminton in position 5 for now (since we'll need to place the American on the far left or far right later).

   - From clue 6, we know that the American is on the far left or far right. Since Badminton is in position 5, the American must be in position 1 or 5. Let's place the American in position 1 for now.

   - From clue 19, we know that the American is on the right of the person eating peach. So, the Peach cannot be in position 1. Let's place Peach in position 2 or 4. Let's place Peach in position 2 for now.

   - From clue 18, we know that the Mexican is not to the right of the fan d&b. Since the American is in position 1 and Peach is in position 2, the Mexican cannot be in position 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the Mexican in position 3.

   - From clue 5, we know that the person eating grapefruit is on the right of the Mexican. So, let's place Grapefruit in position 4 or 5. Let's place Grapefruit in position 4 for now.

   - From clue 17, we know that the Thai is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since Badminton is in position 5, Weightlifting cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's place Weightlifting in position 5.

   - From clue 15, we know that the Canadian and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. Since Badminton is in position 5 (odd), the Canadian must also be in an odd position. Since the American is in position 1 (odd), the Canadian cannot be in position 1. So, the Canadian must be in position 3 or 5. But from clue 20, we know that the Canadian is not to the right of the American. So, the Canadian must be in position 3.

   - From clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is not to the right of the Australian. Since the American is in position 1 and the Canadian is in position 3, the Australian cannot be in position 2, 4, or 5. Let's place the Australian in position 2.

   - From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the fan d&b. Since the Australian is in position 2, the fan d&b must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But from clue 21, we know that the fan d&b is the person who's hobby is gardening or the person who's hobby is gardening is the Australian, but not both. Since the Australian is in position 2, the fan d&b cannot be in position 2. So, the fan d&b must be in position 1 or 5. But from clue 10, we know that the fan r&b is not to the left of the Australian. Since the Australian is in position 2, the fan d&b (which is not the fan r&b) cannot be in position 1. So, the fan d&b must be in position 5.

   - From clue 22, we know that the fan salsa is between the person eating avocado and the fan ambient. Since the American is in position 1, the fan salsa cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the fan salsa must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But from clue 23, we know that the person eating cherry is the person who's sport is climbing or the person eating cherry is the fan r&b or both. Since the fan d&b is in position 5 and the fan salsa cannot be in position 1, the person eating cherry must be in position 1 or 5. But from clue 24, we know that the person eating grapefruit is between the person eating cherry and the Thai. Since the Thai is in position 3 and the person eating cherry must be in position 1 or 5, the person eating cherry must be in position 1. So, the person eating cherry is the fan r&b, and the person who's sport is climbing is in position 5.

   - From clue 25, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the fan d&b (gardening) is in position 5, the person who's sport is basketball cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's place Basketball in position 4.

   - From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere between the fan d&b and the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the fan d&b is in position 5 and Basketball is in position 4, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 3.

   - From clue 7, we know that the person eating grapefruit and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 5 (odd), the person eating grapefruit must also be in an odd position. But from clue 5, we know that the person eating grapefruit is on the right of the Mexican (even position). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in clue 7. Let's assume that the person eating grapefruit and the person who's hobby is gardening have the same parity positions, but this might not be the case.

   - From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 5, the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. But from clue 15, we know that the Canadian and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is in position 3 and the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 5. But this contradicts our previous placement of the person who's sport is weightlifting. There seems to be an error in clue 8.

2. The person eating avocado is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the person watching time-travel movies. Since the trike is in position 5, the avocado cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. So, the avocado must be in position 6.

3. The person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since the avocado is in position 6, the strawberry cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the strawberry must be in position 7.

4. The person driving the scooter is somewhere between the person eating spinach and the person eating strawberry. Since the strawberry is in position 7, the scooter cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the scooter must be in position 8.

5. The person watching time-travel movies is not the person driving the bike. Since the trike is in position 5 and the scooter is in position 8, the time-travel movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8. So, the time-travel movies must be in position 9.

6. The owner of the mouse and the person eating lemon have different parity positions. Since the avocado is in an even position (6), the lemon cannot be in an even position. So, the lemon must be in an odd position, which means it cannot be in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. So, the lemon must be in position 2.

7. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the strawberry is in position 7, the spy movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the spy movies must be in position 8.

8. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the car. Since the trike is in position 5, the car cannot be in positions 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. So, the car must be in position 4.

9. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the car is in position 4, the mouse cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the mouse must be in position 5 or 6. The guinea-pig cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So, the guinea-pig must be in position 10.

10. The person who's sport is water-polo is the person eating strawberry or the owner of the snake is the person who's sport is water-polo or both. Since the strawberry is the person in position 7 and we don't have any information about the snake yet, let's assume the snake is the person playing water-polo for now. This means the snake must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.

11. The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position. Since we don't have any information about the scientific movies yet, let's assume it's in position 9 for now.

12. The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the zombie movies cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (due to the trike being in position 5), the zombie movies must be in position 9. Since the zombie movies are on the right of the fantasy movies, the fantasy movies must be in position 8.

13. The person driving the car is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the car is in position 4, the swimming must be in position 5 or 6.

14. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the car is in position 4, the snake cannot be in positions 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. So, the snake must be in position 3. Since the snake is to the left of the ferret, the ferret cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. So, the ferret must be in position 10.

15. The person who's sport is swimming and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the car is in an even position (4), the swimming must be in an odd position, which means it cannot be in positions 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10. So, the swimming must be in position 3.

16. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the snake is in position 3, the water-polo cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the water-polo must be in position 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. However, we already placed the water-polo as the snake in our assumptions, so this clue is contradictory. Let's reconsider our assumption that the snake is playing water-polo.

17. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the swimming is in position 3, the scooter cannot be in positions 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. So, the scooter must be in position 2.

18. The person eating strawberry is the person who's sport is swimming or the owner of the ferret is the person eating strawberry, but not both. Since the strawberry is the person in position 7 and the swimming is the person in position 3, the ferret must be in position 10 (the only remaining position).

19. The person eating avocado is not to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the avocado is in position 6, the ice-hockey cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. So, the ice-hockey must be in position 7, 8, 9, or 10. However, we already placed the ice-hockey as the person in position 7 in our assumptions, so this clue is contradictory. Let's reconsider our assumption that the ice-hockey is the person in position 7.

20. The person driving the car is the person watching fantasy movies or the person driving the car is the person eating spinach or both. Since the car is in position 4 and the fantasy movies are in position 8, the car cannot be the person watching fantasy movies. So, the car must be the person eating spinach. This means the spinach must be in position 4.

21. The person who's sport is golf is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the water-polo cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8 (due to the trike being in position 5, the car being in position 4, the scooter being in position 2, and the swimming being in position 3), the water-polo must be in position 9 or 10. Since the golf cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (due to the trike being in position 5, the car being in position 4, the scooter being in position 2, the swimming being in position 3, the avocado being in position 6, the strawberry being in position 7, and the spinach being in position 4), the golf must be in position 10.

22. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the water-polo cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (due to the trike being in position 5, the car being in position 4, the scooter being in position 2, the swimming being in position 3, the avocado being in position 6, the strawberry being in position 7, the spinach being in position 4, and the golf being in position 10), the water-polo must be in position 1.

23. The person driving the bike is not to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse is in position 5 and the bike cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (due to the trike being in position 5, the car being in position 4, the scooter being in position 2, the swimming being in position 3, the avocado being in position 6, the strawberry being in position 7, the spinach being in position 4, the water-polo being in position 1, and the golf being in position 10), the bike must be in position 10.

24. The person eating lemon is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the lemon is in position 2 and the fantasy movies are in position 8, the lemon cannot be in position 8. So, the lemon must be in position 1.

25. The person eating strawberry is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the strawberry is the person in position 7 and the snake is in position 3, the strawberry is to the right of the snake. This is consistent with our previous placement of the strawberry in position 7.

26. The person driving the bike is not the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the bike is in position 10 and the water-polo is in position 1, this is consistent with our previous placement of the bike in position 10.

Now, let's revisit the contradictory clues:

16. The person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the water-polo is in position 1 and the snake is in position 3, this is consistent with our previous placement of the water-polo in position 1.

19. The person eating avocado is not to the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the avocado is in position 6 and the ice-hockey is in position 10, this is consistent with our previous placement of the avocado in position 6.

So, there are no remaining contradictions, and our final solution table is:

Lv11-5x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's assign variables to each category for each person:

- M: Movie genre (action, epic, family, martial-arts, sports)
- N: Nationality (brazilian, canadian, colombian, egyptian, mexican)
- P: Pet (bird, frog, hedgehog, horse, turtle)
- S: Sport (badminton, cricket, lacrosse, skateboarding, skiing)
- T: Transport (bus, car, helicopter, ship, snowmobile)

Let's start by assigning the nationalities:

1. The Canadian is in the middle, so we can place them in the 3rd position. Since the Colombian and Brazilian must have different parity positions (rule 22), we can place the Brazilian in the 1st position and the Colombian in the 5th position. The Egyptian and Mexican must have different parity positions (rule 28), so we can place the Egyptian in the 2nd position and the Mexican in the 4th position.

Now let's assign the pets:

3. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies (rule 3). Since the Canadian is in the 3rd position, the frog owner cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position. The Egyptian and Mexican must have different parity positions (rule 28), so the Egyptian cannot be in the 2nd position. Therefore, the frog owner must be in the 4th position.

Now let's assign the sports:

18. The person watching family movies is the owner of the horse (rule 5), so the horse owner cannot be in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position (since those positions are already assigned to nationalities). The horse owner must be in an even position (rule 29), so they can be in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the Canadian is in the 3rd position, the horse owner cannot be in the 2nd position. Therefore, the horse owner is in the 4th position, and the person watching family movies is the Mexican.

Now let's assign the remaining sports:

- The person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies (rule 11), so the action movies person cannot be in the 1st or 5th position. The person watching sports movies is the person driving the bus or the owner of the hedgehog or both (rule 14), so the action movies person cannot be in the 2nd or 4th position (since the Mexican is the owner of the hedgehog). Therefore, the action movies person is in the 3rd position.
- The person watching epic movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions (rule 13), so the epic movies person cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position (since the action movies person is in the 3rd position). The person driving the snowmobile and the owner of the horse have different parity positions (rule 15), so the epic movies person cannot be in the 4th position (since the Mexican is the owner of the horse). Therefore, the epic movies person is in the 2nd position.
- The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies (rule 11), so the martial-arts movies person cannot be in the 1st or 5th position. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the Mexican (rule 10), so the martial-arts movies person cannot be in the 2nd position (since the epic movies person is in the 2nd position). Therefore, the martial-arts movies person is in the 4th position.
- The person watching sports movies is the person driving the bus or the owner of the hedgehog or both (rule 14), so the person driving the bus is in an odd position (since the Mexican is the owner of the hedgehog and is in an even position). The person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (rule 12), so the person driving the bus is in the 1st position, and the person who's sport is skiing is in the 5th position.
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person driving the bus or the person who's sport is lacrosse is the owner of the hedgehog or both (rule 14), so the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the 1st position, and the person who's sport is cricket is in the 5th position (since the person who's sport is cricket is not to the left of the Mexican, rule 24).
- The person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the turtle have different parity positions (rule 30), so the person who's sport is skateboarding is in an odd position, and the owner of the turtle is in an even position. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the Mexican (rule 10), so the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the 3rd position, and the owner of the turtle is in the 4th position.
- The person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person driving the car (rule 18), so the person who's sport is badminton is in the 5th position, and the person driving the car is in the 1st position.
- The person who's sport is cricket is not to the left of the mexican (rule 24), so the person who's sport is cricket is in the 5th position.
- The person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (rule 21), so the person who's sport is skiing is in the 1st position.

Now let's assign the remaining movie genres:

- The person watching family movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog (rule 19), so the person watching family movies is in the 4th or 5th position. Since the person who's sport is cricket is in the 5th position, the person watching family movies is in the 4th position.
- The person watching epic movies and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions (rule 20), so the person watching epic movies is in an odd position, and the person driving the snowmobile is in an even position. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the 3rd position, the person driving the snowmobile is in the 4th position. Therefore, the person watching epic movies is in the 2nd position.
- The person watching action movies is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (rule 8), so the person watching action movies is in the 3rd position.
- The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies (rule 11), so the person watching martial-arts movies is in the 1st or 3rd position. Since the person watching action movies is in the 3rd position, the person watching martial-arts movies is in the 1st position.
- The person watching sports movies is the person driving the bus or the owner of the hedgehog or both (rule 14), so the person driving the bus is in the 1st position, and the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the 3rd position.

Now let's assign the remaining transports:

- The person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship (rule 9), so the person driving the car is in the 1st or 2nd position. Since the person who's sport is badminton is in the 5th position, the person driving the car is in the 1st position.
- The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies (rule 16), so the person driving the helicopter is in the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. The person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the turtle have different parity positions (rule 30), so the person driving the helicopter is in an odd position. Since the person driving the snowmobile is in the 4th position, the person driving the helicopter is in the 3rd position.
- The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the Mexican (rule 10), so the person driving the snowmobile is in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. The person driving the helicopter is in the 3rd position, so the person driving the snowmobile is in the 2nd position.
- The person driving the bus is in the 1st position, and the person driving the ship is in the 5th position (since the person who's sport is badminton is in the 5th position).

Here is the final solution table:
