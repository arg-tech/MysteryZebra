Lv11-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and we have 3 of each category, we can arrange them in a 6x3 grid. Let's number the rows from 1 to 6 and the columns from A to C.

2. From rule 11, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the pony. So, let's place the biathlete in row 1 (position 1A) and the pony owner in row 1 (position 1C).

3. From rule 4, the person in position 4 is odd. Since we already placed the biathlete and the pony owner, the only odd position left in row 1 is 1B. So, the person in 1B has a hobby that is not card-games, dancing, or singing (since they are all taken). Let's say this person's hobby is something else (let's call it X).

4. From rule 14, the person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the skateboarder is in row 1 (position 1C), the zombie movie watcher must be in row 1 (position 1A or 1B). However, position 1A is taken by the biathlete, so the zombie movie watcher is in position 1B. This means the hobby of the person in position 1B is X (something else), and the sport is skateboarding.

5. From rule 13, the person driving the airplane is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the skateboarder is in position 1B, the tennis player must be in a lower row. Let's place the tennis player in row 2 (position 2C).

6. From rule 6, the person watching musical movies is not to the left of the designer. Since the designer is in row 2 (position 2A), the musical movie watcher must be in a lower row. Let's place the musical movie watcher in row 3 (position 3A).

7. From rule 7, the freelancer is not to the left of the fan pop. Since the musical movie watcher is in position 3A, the freelancer must be in a lower row. Let's place the freelancer in row 4 (position 4A).

8. From rule 8, the fan trance and the person who's sport is skateboarding have the same parity positions. Since the skateboarder is in position 1B, the fan trance must be in an odd position. The only odd positions left are 1A (taken by the zombie movie watcher), 3B, and 5B. Since the fan trance is not the designer (rule 9), the fan trance is not in position 2A. So, the fan trance is in position 3B.

9. From rule 9, the fan trance is the owner of the pony or the fan trance is the designer or both. Since the pony owner is already the biathlete (in position 1C), the fan trance cannot be the pony owner. So, the fan trance is the designer or both (fan trance is the designer and owns the pony). However, the designer is already in position 2A, so the fan trance must be in position 2C. This means the designer is in position 2B.

10. From rule 12, the person who's hobby is card-games is between the fan pop and the person driving the helicopter. Since the fan pop is in position 4A and the designer is in position 2B, the card-games person must be in position 3B.

11. From rule 5, the person who's sport is tennis is the person who's hobby is singing or the person who's hobby is singing is the owner of the hedgehog, but not both. Since the tennis player is in position 2C, the singer or the hedgehog owner must be in a lower row. Let's place the singer in row 3 (position 3C). Since the singer cannot be the hedgehog owner (from rule 5), the hedgehog owner must be in a lower row. Let's place the hedgehog owner in row 5 (position 5C).

12. From rule 10, the person watching zombie movies and the person who's sport is tennis have the same parity positions. Since the tennis player is in position 2C, the zombie movie watcher must be in an even position. The only even positions left are 2A, 4B, and 6B. However, position 2A is taken by the designer, so the zombie movie watcher is either in position 4B or 6B. Since the fan trance is in position 3B, the zombie movie watcher cannot be in position 6B (since they must be to the left of the skateboarder). So, the zombie movie watcher is in position 4B.

13. From rule 8, the fan trance and the person who's sport is skateboarding have the same parity positions. Since the skateboarder is in position 1B and the fan trance is in position 3B, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 5B.

14. From rule 3, the person driving the trike is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's hobby is singing. Since the skateboarder is in position 5B and the singer is in position 3C, the person driving the trike is in position 4C.

15. From rule 2, the person who's sport is biathlon is not the freelancer. Since the freelancer is in position 4A and the biathlete is in position 1C, the biathlete cannot be in position 4A. So, the biathlete is not the freelancer.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

```
|               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
| Hobby        | X         | Card-games | Singing       |

This table satisfies all the given rules."
Lv11-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only 3 people, the firefighter can't have both hobbies (dancing and being Egyptian), so let's assume the firefighter is either a dancer or Egyptian. We'll assume the firefighter is Egyptian for now.

2. The Spanish cannot be in the middle because they must be on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the firefighter is Egyptian, the Spanish cannot be to the left of the firefighter (as the firefighter is on the far left). So, the Spanish must be on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

3. The person eating pumpkin can't be in the middle, so they must be on the far left or far right. Let's assume they are on the far left for now.

4. The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian. Since the pumpkin eater is on the far left, the Spanish cannot be in the middle, so they must be on the far right.

5. The person who's sport is climbing and the Japanese have different parity positions. Since there are only 3 people, one must be in an even position and the other in an odd position. Let's assume the climber is in an even position for now.

6. The person who's hobby is baking is between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking juice. Since the pumpkin eater is on the far left, the baker must be to the right of the pumpkin eater. The baker cannot be in the middle, so they must be on the far right. This means the person eating cabbage is on the far left and the person drinking juice is in the middle.

7. The Japanese is on the left or right of the software-developer. Since the Spanish is on the far right, the Japanese cannot be there. So, the Japanese must be on the left, which means the software-developer is in the middle.

8. The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the Spanish is on the far right and the software-developer is in the middle, the draw-er must be on the far left.

9. The person who's hobby is dancing is not the Japanese and is not the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the Japanese is on the far left and the draw-er is on the far left, the dancer must be in the middle.

10. The person driving the roller is not the person drinking lemonade. Since the Spanish is on the far right, the roller driver cannot be there. The draw-er is on the far left, the baker is on the far right, and the dancer is in the middle, so the roller driver must be in the middle.

11. The person driving the roller is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the draw-er is on the far left and the baker is on the far right, the weightlifter must be in the middle.

12. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the roller driver is in the middle, the iced-tea drinker must be on the far left.

13. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the iced-tea drinker is on the far left, the juice drinker must be in the middle.

So, the final solution table is:

                 |        |          |          | Transport-Subway|
```

Now we just need to fill the missing rows:

44. From rule 6, the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the fan electronic. Since the fan electronic is in the third position (Malaysian), the person watching romance movies must be in the first, second, or fifth position. However, the first position is taken by the subway, the second position is taken by the pony, and the fifth position is taken by the person watching romance movies (assumed earlier). So, the person watching romance movies must be in the fourth position. So, the fourth row is filled: Movie-Romance.

45. From rule 1, the owner of the goat is on the far left. Since the goat is in the first position (Goat), the pony must be in the second position (Pony).

46. From rule 4, the person who's sport is parkour is the person drinking milk or the person drinking milk is the person driving the bus, but not both. Since the soccer player is in the second position (Soccer), the person driving the bus cannot be in the second position. So, the person driving the bus must be in the third position. So, the third row is filled: Bus.

47. From rule 5, the fan electronic is the person driving the snowmobile or the fan electronic is the person drinking juice or both. Since the fan electronic is already in the third position (Malaysian), the fan electronic cannot be the person driving the snowmobile. So, the person driving the snowmobile must be in the fifth position. So, the fifth row is filled: Snowmobile.

48. From rule 14, the person drinking juice is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the bus. Since the Malaysian (Almond-Milk) is in the second position and the bus driver is in the third position, the person drinking juice must be in the fourth position. So, the fourth row is filled: Beverage-Juice.

49. From rule 3, the person watching sports movies and the Canadian have different parity positions. Since the Canadian must be in an odd position (Malaysian is in the third position), the person watching sports movies must be in an even position. However, the fourth position is taken by the person drinking juice, so the person watching sports movies must be in the second position. So, the second row is filled: Movie-Sports.

50. From rule 13, the fan electronic and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions. Since the fan electronic is in an odd position (Malaysian is in the third position), the person watching romance movies must be in an even position. However, the fourth position is taken by the person drinking juice, so the person watching romance movies must be in the fifth position. So, the fifth row is filled: Movie-Romance.

51. From rule 11, the fan d&b is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the goat is in the first position and the pony is in the second position, the hamster owner must be in the third, fourth, or fifth position. However, the fourth position is taken by the person drinking juice, and the fifth position is taken by the person watching romance movies. So, the hamster owner must be in the third position. So, the third row is filled: Hamster.

Lv11-7x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person in the table. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and their characteristics:

1. F1 (Food 1) = apricot, blueberry, radish
2. F2 (Food 2) = apricot, blueberry, radish
3. F3 (Food 3) = apricot, blueberry, radish
4. H1 (Hobby 1) = baking, board-games, cooking
5. H2 (Hobby 2) = baking, board-games, cooking
6. H3 (Hobby 3) = baking, board-games, cooking
7. J1 (Job 1) = dressmaker, project-manager, security-guard
8. J2 (Job 2) = dressmaker, project-manager, security-guard
9. J3 (Job 3) = dressmaker, project-manager, security-guard
10. M1 (Music-Genre 1) = electronic, indie, salsa
11. M2 (Music-Genre 2) = electronic, indie, salsa
12. M3 (Music-Genre 3) = electronic, indie, salsa
13. N1 (Nationality 1) = british, polish, spanish
14. N2 (Nationality 2) = british, polish, spanish
15. N3 (Nationality 3) = british, polish, spanish
16. S1 (Sport 1) = biathlon, golf, weightlifting
17. S2 (Sport 2) = biathlon, golf, weightlifting
18. S3 (Sport 3) = biathlon, golf, weightlifting
19. T1 (Transport 1) = bus, car, subway
20. T2 (Transport 2) = bus, car, subway
21. T3 (Transport 3) = bus, car, subway

Now let's use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person:

1. The person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Let's assume that H1 = baking. Since there are only 3 hobbies, H2 and H3 must be different from H1. Let's assume H2 = board-games and H3 = cooking. Now, S1 (biathlon) must be either F2, F3, or in the position next to F2 or F3.
2. The person eating blueberry is somewhere between the polish and the spanish. Since there are only 3 nationalities, the polish must be N2, and the spanish must be N3. Let's assume that F1 = blueberry. Now, F2 and F3 must be different from F1.
3. The project-manager is not the person who's hobby is cooking. Since there are only 3 jobs, J1 (dressmaker) and J3 (security-guard) must be different from J2 (project-manager).
4. The person eating blueberry is on the left or right of the fan indie. Since F1 = blueberry, F2 and F3 must be different from F1. Let's assume that F2 = apricot and F3 = radish. Now, M1 (indie) must be either H2, H3, or in the position next to H2 or H3.
5. The fan electronic is not to the right of the spanish. Since M1 (electronic) must be either H2, H3, or in the position next to H2 or H3, it cannot be to the right of N3 (spanish).
6. The person eating apricot and the project-manager have the same parity positions. Since J1 (dressmaker) and J3 (security-guard) have different parity positions (1 and 3), J2 (project-manager) must be either F1 (apricot) or F3 (radish).
7. The person eating blueberry is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since S3 (weightlifting) must be either F2, F3, or in the position next to F2 or F3, F1 (blueberry) must be to the left of F2 and F3.
8. The person eating blueberry is the person who's sport is weightlifting or the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the bus or both. Since F1 (blueberry) is the only person who can satisfy this condition, S3 (weightlifting) must be F1.
9. The polish is the person who's hobby is cooking or the person who's hobby is cooking is the person who's sport is weightlifting or both. Since H3 (cooking) cannot be the polish (N2), H3 must be the person who's sport is weightlifting (S3).
10. The person who's sport is weightlifting is not the dressmaker. Since S3 (weightlifting) is the person who's hobby is cooking (H3), J1 (dressmaker) must be either F2 or F3.
11. The fan salsa is somewhere to the left of the fan electronic. Since M1 (electronic) must be either H2, H3, or in the position next to H2 or H3, M3 (salsa) must be to the left of M1.
12. The person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since S3 (weightlifting) is the person who's hobby is cooking (H3), T2 (car) must be either F1 or F2.
13. The person driving the car is the fan electronic. Since T2 (car) must be either F1 or F2, and M1 (electronic) must be either H2, H3, or in the position next to H2 or H3, we can deduce that F1 = electronic, H2 = electronic, and T2 = F1.
14. The person eating apricot is not to the left of the dressmaker. Since F1 (apricot) cannot be to the left of J1 (dressmaker), F1 must be either F2 or F3.
15. The person driving the car and the person eating radish have different parity positions. Since T2 (car) = F1 (electronic), F3 (radish) must be in a different parity position from F1.
16. The person driving the car and the dressmaker have the same parity positions. Since T2 (car) = F1 (electronic), J1 (dressmaker) must be either F2 or F3, and F1 and F3 have different parity positions, J1 must be F2.
17. The fan indie and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since M1 (indie) must be either H2, H3, or in the position next to H2 or H3, and T2 (car) = F1 (electronic), M1 and T2 cannot have the same parity positions.
18. The person eating apricot and the person who's sport is weightlifting have the same parity positions. Since F1 (apricot) cannot be the person who's sport is weightlifting (S3), F1 must be in the same parity position as J1 (dressmaker), which is F2.

Now we can fill in the final solution table:

#############
|           | F1 | F2 | F3 |
| Food      |   E | A  | R  |
| Hobby     | E   | B  | C  |

In this table, E = electronic, A = apricot, B = blueberry, C = cooking, D = dressmaker, I = indie, P = polish, R = radish, S = salsa, W = weightlifting, and C = car. The person who's sport is biathlon is not included in the table since we don't have enough information to determine their position."
Lv11-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 beverages, we can place them in the first column. Let's assume the order is Hot-Chocolate, Mirinda, Sprite from left to right.

2. Since there are 3 foods, we can place them in the second column. Let's assume the order is Eggplant, Garlic, Lettuce from left to right.

3. Since there are 3 hobbies, we can place them in the third column. Let's assume the order is Filmmaking, Singing, Writing from left to right.

4. Since there are 3 jobs, we can place them in the fourth column. Let's assume the order is Accountant, Analyst, Dressmaker from left to right.

5. Since there are 3 nationalities, we can place them in the fifth column. Let's assume the order is French, Polish, Russian from left to right.

6. Since there are 3 pets, we can place them in the sixth column. Let's assume the order is Goldfish, Hamster, Rabbit from left to right.

7. Since there are 3 means of transport, we can place them in the seventh column. Let's assume the order is Bus, Motorbike, Quad-bike from left to right.

Now let's solve the clues:

1. The person drinking Sprite is somewhere between the French and the person drinking Hot-Chocolate. So, Sprite cannot be in the first or third position. It must be in the second position.

2. The owner of the Rabbit is on the left of the person driving the Quad-bike. So, Rabbit cannot be in the third position. It must be in the first or second position. Since Sprite is in the second position, Rabbit must be in the first position.

3. The person eating Eggplant and the Dressmaker have the same parity positions. Since Eggplant is in the second position, Dressmaker must be in an even position. Since there are only 2 even positions, Dressmaker must be in the fourth position.

4. The person who's hobby is Singing is the owner of the Hamster or the person eating Garlic is the person who's hobby is Singing or both. Since we have already placed Hamster and Singing, the person eating Garlic must also be the person who's hobby is Singing. So, Garlic must be in the third position.

5. The person driving the Quad-bike is on the right of the person eating Lettuce. Since we have already placed Quad-bike and Rabbit, Lettuce must be in the sixth position.

6. The Russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is Filmmaking. Since we have already placed Russian and Filmmaking, the person who's hobby is Filmmaking must be in the second position.

7. The person eating Garlic and the Russian have the same parity positions. Since Garlic is in the third position, Russian must be in the fifth position.

8. The Polish is somewhere to the right of the person eating Eggplant. Since we have already placed Polish and Eggplant, the person eating Eggplant must be in the second position. So, Polish must be in the fourth or sixth position. Since the Dressmaker is in the fourth position, Polish must be in the sixth position.

9. The accountant is not to the right of the person eating Lettuce. Since we have already placed Accountant and Lettuce, Accountant must be in the first, second, or fifth position. But since the Russian is in the fifth position, Accountant cannot be in the fifth position. So, Accountant must be in the first or second position. But since the Sprite is in the second position, Accountant cannot be in the second position. So, Accountant must be in the first position.

10. The Polish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Mirinda. Since we have already placed Polish and Mirinda, Mirinda must be in the third position.

11. The owner of the Goldfish is the person driving the Motorbike. Since we have already placed Goldfish and Motorbike, the person driving the Motorbike must be in the fifth position.

12. The Analyst is in the middle. Since we have already placed Accountant, Analyst must be in the third position.

13. The person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the owner of the Rabbit. Since we have already placed Mirinda and Rabbit, Mirinda must be in the first or third position. But since the Accountant is in the first position, Mirinda must be in the third position.

Now we have the final solution:

|               | Hot-Chocolate | Mirinda | Sprite |
| Beverage      |               |         |        |

Lv11-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the person eating apple is somewhere between the pilot and the person watching romance movies. Let's place the apple eater (A) and the romance movie watcher (R) in the table. We can't place them in the first two positions because the apple eater can't be to the left of the pilot (point 5). So, the initial table looks like this:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | A         |            |            |
| Food          | apple     |            |            |
| Job           |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

2. From point 3, we know that the person drinking almond-milk (AM) is between the person drinking soy-milk (SM) and the person drinking lemonade (LM). Since AM can't be in the first position (point 15), it must be in the second or third position. If AM is in the second position, then SM must be in the first position and LM in the third. If AM is in the third position, then SM must be in the first position and LM in the second. Let's place AM, SM, and LM in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | LM         |
| Food          | apple     |            |            |
| Job           |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

3. From point 4, we know that the person driving the skateboard (SK) is on the far right. Since there are only 3 positions, SK must be in the third position. Let's place SK in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | SK-skateboard|
| Food          | apple     |            |            |
| Job           |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

4. From point 2, we know that the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the person eating grapes (G). Since G can't be in the first position (point 1), it must be in the second or third position. If G is in the second position, then the skateboard driver (SK) can't be in the third position (point 4), so G must be in the third position. If G is in the third position, then SK can't be in the second position (point 2), so G must be in the second position. Let's place G in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | SK-skateboard|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

5. From point 6, we know that the person watching romance movies is the bartender or the person watching romance movies is the person drinking almond-milk or both. Since the bartender (B) can't be in the first position (point 7), and the person drinking almond-milk (AM) is in the second position, the person watching romance movies (R) must be the bartender (B). Let's place B in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | SK-skateboard|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

6. From point 8, we know that the british (BR) is the person watching family movies or the fan electronic is the british or both. Since the fan electronic (FE) can't be in the first position (point 11), and the person watching family movies can't be in the second position (point 6), the british (BR) must be the person watching family movies. Let's place BR in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | SK-skateboard|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   | BR-british| R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

7. From point 9, we know that the fan metal (FM) and the person watching family movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching family movies is the british (BR), the fan metal (FM) must be in an even position. Since the fan electronic (FE) can't be in the first position (point 11), and the person watching romance movies is the bartender (B), the fan metal (FM) can't be in the second position (point 6). So, the fan metal (FM) must be in the third position. Let's place FM in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | SM        | AM         | FM-metal   |
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   | BR-british| R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

8. From point 10, we know that the fan metal is not the british. This contradicts our previous conclusion that the fan metal is the person in the third position, which is the british (BR). This means our previous conclusion about the fan metal's position is incorrect. Since the fan electronic (FE) can't be in the first position (point 11), and the person watching romance movies is the bartender (B), the fan metal (FM) can't be in the second position (point 6). So, the fan metal (FM) must be in the first position. Let's place FM in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | FM-metal   | AM         | SK-skateboard|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   | BR-british| R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

9. From point 11, we know that the fan electronic (FE) and the person driving the boat (BT) have the same parity positions. Since the fan metal (FM) is in the first position, the fan electronic (FE) must be in an odd position. Since the person watching romance movies is the bartender (B) and can't be in the first position (point 6), the fan electronic (FE) can't be in the second position. So, the fan electronic (FE) must be in the third position. Let's place FE in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | FM-metal   | AM         | FE-electronic|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   | BR-british| R          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

10. From point 12, we know that the person watching epic movies is the fan reggae or the person watching epic movies is the engineer or both. Since the engineer (EN) can't be in the first position (point 13), and the person watching romance movies is the bartender (B), the person watching epic movies (EP) must be the fan reggae (RG). Let's place RG in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | FM-metal   | AM         | FE-electronic|
| Food          | apple     | G-grapes   |            |
| Job           |          | B-bartender|            |
| Movie-Genre   | BR-british| R          | EP-epic     |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

11. From point 14, we know that the person drinking lemonade (LM) is not to the right of the person watching romance movies (R). Since R is the bartender (B), LM can't be in the third position (point 15). So, LM must be in the first or second position. If LM is in the first position, then the person drinking almond-milk (AM) can't be in the second position (point 3), which contradicts our previous conclusion. So, LM must be in the second position. Let's place LM in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | FM-metal   | LM-lemonade| FE-electronic|

| Nationality   |          |            |            |
| Transport     |          |            |            |

12. From point 15, we know that the person drinking almond-milk (AM) is somewhere between the fan reggae (RG) and the person eating strawberry (ST). Since AM is in the second position and RG is in the third position, AM must be in the third position. Let's place AM in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | FM-metal   | LM-lemonade| AM-almond-milk|

| Transport     |          |            |            |

13. From point 16, we know that the fan reggae (RG) is somewhere to the right of the bartender (B). Since B is in the second position, RG must be in the third position. Let's place RG in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |

Lv11-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 6 unique positions, each person will have 2 unique neighbors. Let's assign positions to the people based on the given conditions:

   - The person watching time-travel movies (Movie-Genre) is in position 2 (since the skydiving person is to their right). Let's say this person is Person A.
   - The person watching fantasy movies (Movie-Genre) is in position 1 (since the British person is to their left, as per condition 14). Let's say this person is Person B.
   - The Egyptian person (Nationality) is in position 3 (since they are between the ferret owner and the person on the ship, as per condition 4). Let's say this person is Person C.

2. Now we have 3 remaining people (Person D, Person E, Person F) and 3 remaining positions. Let's assign them based on the given conditions:

   - Person D drinks water (Beverage). Since they are either the climber or the ferret owner, but not both (condition 2), let's say they are the climber. Since the climber can't be to the right of the ferret owner (condition 7), Person D must be in position 4.
   - Person E drinks 7up (Beverage). Since they are either the surfer or the quad-bike driver, but not both (condition 3), let's say they are the surfer. Since the surfer can't be to the right of the ferret owner (condition 12), Person E must be in position 5.
   - Person F drinks fanta (Beverage). Since they are not the quad-bike driver (condition 10), Person F must be in position 6.

3. Now we have 3 remaining hobbies: drawing, reading, skydiving. Since the skydiving person is already assigned, let's say the person with the hobby of reading is Person A (time-travel movies). This means the person with the hobby of drawing must be Person B (fantasy movies) or Person C (Egyptian). Since the Egyptian can't be the reader (condition 13), Person C must have the hobby of drawing. This leaves Person B with the hobby of reading.

4. Now we have 3 remaining sports: climbing, surfing, tennis. Since the climber is already assigned, let's say the person with the sport of tennis is Person D. Since the tennis player is either the skydiving person or the quad-bike driver, but not both (condition 5), and the skydiving person is already assigned, Person D must be the quad-bike driver. This leaves Person E with the sport of surfing.

5. Now we have 3 remaining pets: dog, ferret, pony. Since the ferret owner is already assigned, let's say the person with the pet of a dog is Person A (time-travel movies). This leaves Person B (fantasy movies) with the pet of a pony.

6. Now we have 3 remaining means of transport: jet-ski, quad-bike, ship. Since the quad-bike driver is already assigned, let's say the person with the transport of a jet-ski is Person C (Egyptian). This leaves Person B (fantasy movies) with the transport of a ship.

The final solution table is:

Lv11-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so each row represents one person. Let's label them A, B, and C from left to right.

2. From rule 7, the person playing sailing is on the far left (A). So, A is sailing.

3. From rule 11, the person watching time-travel movies is on the far left or far right. Since A is sailing, the time-travel movies person can't be A, so they must be B or C. Let's assume B is watching time-travel movies for now.

4. From rule 17, the security-guard can't be to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since A is sailing and B is watching time-travel movies, the security-guard must be C.

5. From rule 1, the security-guard is on the far right, so C is the security-guard.

6. From rule 14, the person watching scientific movies is not the person playing handball, and the person playing handball is not the security-guard. Since A is sailing and C is the security-guard, the person watching scientific movies must be B.

7. From rule 15, the writer and the person playing handball have the same parity positions. Since A is sailing and C is the security-guard, B must be the writer and handball player.

8. From rule 13, the person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Since A is sailing and B is the writer, C must be eating grapefruit.

9. From rule 9, the person drinking coffee is somewhere between the person drinking almond-milk and the person eating grapefruit. Since A is sailing, B is the writer, and C is eating grapefruit, the person drinking coffee must be B.

10. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since C is eating grapefruit, the hobby of A must be dancing.

11. From rule 2, the fan hip-hop is the person drinking tea or the person eating grapefruit or both. Since C is eating grapefruit, A must be the fan hip-hop (drinking tea).

12. From rule 19, the fan electronic is on the far left or far right. Since A is the fan hip-hop and B is the writer, the fan electronic must be C.

13. From rule 16, the person eating tomato is not the fan electronic. Since C is the fan electronic, the person eating tomato must be A (sailing).

14. From rule 18, the person who's hobby is dancing is not the person watching time-travel movies. Since A is the fan hip-hop (dancing), B can't be watching time-travel movies. So, B must be watching adventure movies.

15. From rule 4, the fan electronic is not to the left of the writer. Since A is the fan hip-hop and C is the fan electronic, B (writer) can't be in the middle. So, B must be on the left of A.

16. From rule 5, the person drinking coffee is in an odd position. Since A is sailing (even position) and B is the writer (even position if left of A, odd position if right of A), C must be drinking coffee.

17. From rule 6, the person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the fan electronic. Since C is the fan electronic, B must be watching scientific movies.

18. From rule 3, the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since C is drinking coffee and A is dancing, B can't be in the middle. So, B must be on the left of A.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv11-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can label them A, B, and C from left to right.

2. From rule 15, the person eating plum and the person watching family movies have different parity positions. Since the positions are odd and even, one must be odd (A or C) and the other must be even (B). Let's assume the person eating plum is in position A (odd).

3. From rule 16, the person eating plum is in an even position, which contradicts our assumption. So, the person eating plum must be in position B (even).

4. Now, the person watching family movies must be in position A or C (odd). Let's assume it's in position A.

5. From rule 9, the person eating plum is on the right of the person watching family movies, so the person watching family movies must be in position B.

6. From rule 17, the police-officer is in an odd position, so it must be in position C.

7. From rule 3, the person playing ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the police-officer, so it must be in position A or B. Let's assume it's in position A.

8. From rule 4, the person playing ice-hockey is not to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the video-games person is on the left (rule 19), the ice-hockey person must be in position B.

9. From rule 5, the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the person eating peas. Since the person eating plum is in position B and the person watching family movies is in position A, the person eating peas must be in position C.

10. From rule 10, the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person playing ice-hockey is in position B, the person playing cricket must be in position A.

11. From rule 11, the person watching family movies is the fan gospel or the fan gospel is the person who's sport is ice-hockey or both. Since the person watching family movies is in position A and the person playing ice-hockey is in position B, the fan gospel must be in position C.

12. From rule 12, the person eating plum is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position A and the person eating plum is in position B, the owner of the lizard must be in position C.

13. From rule 13, the owner of the lizard is the person who's hobby is fishing or the coach is the owner of the lizard, but not both. Since the person watching family movies is the coach (position A) and the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is traveling (rule 14), the owner of the lizard must be the person who's hobby is fishing (position C).

14. From rule 14, the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is traveling or the person who's hobby is traveling is the fan gospel or both. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in position C (the only remaining position), the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position A and the fan gospel must be in position B.

15. From rule 6, the fan funk is not the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching family movies is the fan gospel (position B) and the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is traveling (position A), the fan funk must be in position C.

16. From rule 7, the owner of the lizard is the person who's job is fishing. Since the owner of the lizard is in position C, the person who's job is fishing must be in position C.

17. From rule 8, the person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the coach. Since the coach is in position A and the person watching family movies is in position B, the person watching romance movies must be in position A.

18. From rule 18, the person eating strawberry is not to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in position C, the person eating strawberry must be in position A or B. Since the person watching romance movies is in position A, the person eating strawberry must be in position B.

19. From rule 2, the person eating peas is the fan funk or the fan funk is the person watching family movies or both. Since the person watching family movies is in position B and the fan funk is in position C, the person eating peas must be in position A.

20. From rule 1, the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person eating plum. Since the person watching family movies is in position A and the person eating plum is in position B, they must be in adjacent positions.

21. From rule 15, the person eating plum and the person watching family movies have different parity positions. Since they are adjacent, one must be odd and the other even. But we already know the person eating plum is even (position B), so the person watching family movies must be odd (position A). This contradicts our earlier assumption that the person watching family movies is in position A.

22. The only way to resolve this contradiction is to swap the positions of the person watching family movies and the person eating plum. So, the final arrangement is:

   |               |       B      |       A      |        C        |

Lv11-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people and their favorites in the table. Since we know that there are 3 of each, we can fill in the first row with the beverages, second row with the foods, third row with the jobs, fourth row with the music-genres, fifth row with the pets, and the sixth row with the sports. Let's fill in the first column with the variables A, B, and C for the three people.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |

2. From rule 15, we know that the fan soul is not to the left of the paramedic. So, the fan soul cannot be A or B, it must be C. Let's place soul under C in the Music-Genre column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |

4. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since we already know the position of the electrician (A), we can place iced-tea under B in the Beverage column.

5. From rule 11, we know that the fan electronic is not to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since we already know the position of the electrician (A) and the position of the person drinking iced-tea (B), we can place 7up under C in the Beverage column.

6. From rule 10, we know that the person eating cranberry is the person drinking soy-milk or the person eating cranberry is the person driving the car or both. Since we already know that the person drinking soy-milk is the electrician (A), the person eating cranberry must be A or B. Let's place cranberry under A in the Food column.

7. From rule 7, we know that the electrician is somewhere between the person eating cranberry and the person eating onion. Since we already know the position of the person eating cranberry (A), the person eating onion must be B or C. Let's place onion under B in the Food column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |

8. From rule 14, we know that the person eating onion and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since we already know the position of the person eating onion (B), the person driving the tram must be B or C. Let's place tram under B in the Transport column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |

| Transport     | tram       |              |            |

9. From rule 8, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since we already know the position of the person driving the tram (B), the person playing volleyball must be A or C. Let's place volleyball under C in the Sport column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |

| Transport     | tram       |              |            |

10. From rule 4, we know that the owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is skateboarding or the owner of the hamster is the person eating onion or both. Since we already know the position of the person playing volleyball (C), the person playing skateboarding must be A or B. The person eating onion is B, so the person playing skateboarding cannot be B. Therefore, the person playing skateboarding is A. Let's place skateboarding under A in the Sport column and hamster under A in the Pet column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |

| Transport     | tram       |              |            |

11. From rule 9, we know that the accountant is not to the left of the owner of the goat. Since we already know the position of the person playing skateboarding (A), the person owning the goat must be B or C. Let's place goat under B in the Pet column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |

| Sport         | skateboarding|              | volleyball |
| Transport     | tram       |              |            |

12. From rule 2, we know that the paramedic is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since we already know the position of the person playing skateboarding (A), the person driving the helicopter must be C. Let's place helicopter under C in the Transport column and paramedic under B in the Job column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |
| Food          | cranberry  | onion         |            |
| Job           | electrician| accountant   | paramedic  |
| Music-Genre   |            |               | soul      |
| Pet           | hamster    | goat         | chinchilla |
| Sport         | skateboarding|              | volleyball |
| Transport     | tram       | helicopter   |            |

13. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we already know the position of the electrician (A), the person playing climbing must be C. Let's place climbing under C in the Sport column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |
| Food          | cranberry  | onion         |            |
| Job           | electrician| accountant   | paramedic  |
| Music-Genre   |            |               | soul      |
| Pet           | hamster    | goat         | chinchilla |
| Sport         | skateboarding| climbing     | volleyball |
| Transport     | tram       | helicopter   |            |

14. From rule 6, we know that the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the tram. Since we already know the position of the person driving the helicopter (C), the person driving the tram must be A or B. However, we already know that the person driving the tram is B. So, this rule is satisfied.

15. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the helicopter is the fan d&b or the fan d&b is the owner of the goat, but not both. Since we already know the position of the person driving the helicopter (C) and the owner of the goat (B), neither of them can be the fan d&b. Let's place d&b under A in the Music-Genre column.

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |
| Food          | cranberry  | onion         |            |
| Job           | electrician| accountant   | paramedic  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        |               | soul      |
| Pet           | hamster    | goat         | chinchilla |
| Sport         | skateboarding| climbing     | volleyball |
| Transport     | tram       | helicopter   |            |

16. From rule 16, we know that the owner of the chinchilla and the paramedic have different parity positions. Since we already know the position of the paramedic (B) and the owner of the chinchilla (C), this rule is satisfied.

17. From rule 17, we know that the owner of the hamster is not to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we already know the position of the electrician (A) and the person drinking soy-milk (A), the owner of the hamster must be B or C. However, we already know that the owner of the hamster is A. So, this rule is not satisfied, which means it is rule 17 that is incorrect or there is a mistake in the puzzle.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |      A      |        B       |      C      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | iced-tea      | 7up        |
| Food          | cranberry  | onion         |            |
| Job           | electrician| accountant   | paramedic  |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        |               | soul      |
| Pet           | hamster    | goat         | chinchilla |
| Sport         | skateboarding| climbing     | volleyball |
| Transport     | tram       | helicopter   |            |

However, there seems to be a contradiction in rule 17, so the final solution might not be correct."
