Lv11-5x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a number from 1 to 6, and let's assign each category a letter from A to F.

2. We can start by placing the categories with the least constraints first. Since the scientist is on the far left, we can place them in position 1 (S).

3. The engineer is to the left of the turkish (E, T), and the engineer is in an even position (E, 4 or 6). Since the scientist is already in position 1, the engineer can only be in position 2 or 6. However, the engineer can't be in position 6 because the scientist is on the far left (contradiction). So, the engineer is in position 2 (E, 2).

4. The dancer is between the Egyptian and the fan funk (D, F, E). Since the scientist is in position 1, the Egyptian can't be in position 1 (contradiction with D being to the right of the Egyptian). So, the Egyptian is in position 2 (E, 2), and the fan funk is in position 3 (F, 3).

5. The dancer and the fan funk have different parity positions (D, F, E, odd or even), so the dancer can't be in position 2 (contradiction with D being between E and F). So, the dancer is in position 4 (D, 4).

6. The dancer is not to the left of the person eating apple (D, A), so A can't be in position 1, 2, or 4. A can be in position 3, 5, or 6. However, if A is in position 3, it would mean D is in position 4, which contradicts the dancer being to the right of the Egyptian (E, 2). So, A can't be in position 3. If A is in position 5 or 6, it wouldn't create any contradictions. Let's place A in position 5 (A, 5).

7. The person eating apple and the person who's hobby is writing have the same parity positions (A, W), so W can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. W can be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, if W is in position 2, it would mean A is in position 5, which contradicts the dancer being to the right of the Egyptian (E, 2). So, W can't be in position 2. If W is in position 4 or 6, it wouldn't create any contradictions. Let's place W in position 6 (W, 6).

8. The American and the lawyer have the same parity positions (A, L), so L can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. L can be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, if L is in position 2, it would mean A is in position 4, which contradicts the dancer being to the right of the American (A, L). So, L can't be in position 2. If L is in position 4 or 6, it wouldn't create any contradictions. Let's place L in position 4 (L, 4).

9. The American is on the right of the dancer (A, D), so A can't be in position 4. So, A is in position 6 (A, 6).

10. The lawyer is not to the left of the person eating mango (L, M), so M can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. M can be in position 5 or 6. However, if M is in position 5, it would mean L is in position 4, which contradicts the American being to the right of the lawyer (A, L). So, M can't be in position 5. So, M is in position 6 (M, 6).

11. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating apple (A, V), so V can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. V can be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, if V is in position 4, it would mean A is in position 5, which contradicts the dancer being to the right of the Egyptian (E, 2). So, V can't be in position 4. If V is in position 5 or 6, it wouldn't create any contradictions. Let's place V in position 5 (V, 5).

12. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person eating cabbage (T, C), so T can't be in position 6. So, T is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, if T is in position 1, it would mean C is in position 2, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). If T is in position 2, it would mean C is in position 3, which contradicts the person eating mango being to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (M, G). If T is in position 3, it would mean C is in position 4, which contradicts the person eating nectarine being in an even position (N, 4). If T is in position 4, it would mean C is in position 5, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). So, T can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This is a contradiction, as there should be a person with the hobby of traveling.

13. Since we have a contradiction in the previous step, let's reevaluate the constraints. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person eating cabbage (T, C), but we found that T can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, if we allow T to be in position 6, it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, let's place T in position 6 (T, 6).

14. The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person eating apple (A, C), so C can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. C can be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, if C is in position 4, it would mean A is in position 5, which contradicts the dancer being to the right of the Egyptian (E, 2). If C is in position 5, it would mean A is in position 6, which contradicts the American being to the right of the dancer (A, D). So, C can't be in position 4 or 5. If C is in position 6, it would mean T is in position 1, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). So, C can't be in position 6. So, C is in position 4 (C, 4).

15. The person eating nectarine is the polish (N, P). Since N is in an even position (N, 4), the person eating nectarine can't be the freelancer (contradiction with the freelancer being on the left or right of the person eating nectarine). So, the turkish is the person eating nectarine (T, N).

16. The freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine (F, N), but we found that N is the turkish (T, N). So, the freelancer is the person eating nectarine (F, T).

17. The person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the right of the person eating cherry (S, C), so S can't be in position 4, 5, or 6. S can be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, if S is in position 1, it would mean C is in position 2, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). If S is in position 2, it would mean C is in position 3, which contradicts the person eating mango being to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (M, G). If S is in position 3, it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, S is in position 3 (S, 3).

18. The person who's hobby is hiking is not the American (H, A), so H can't be in position 4 or 6. H can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. However, if H is in position 1, it would mean C is in position 2, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). If H is in position 2, it would mean C is in position 3, which contradicts the person eating mango being to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (M, G). If H is in position 3, it would mean C is in position 4, which contradicts the person eating nectarine being the turkish (T, N). If H is in position 5, it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, H is in position 5 (H, 5).

19. The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person eating cherry (G, C), so G can't be in position 4, 5, or 6. G can be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, if G is in position 1, it would mean C is in position 2, which contradicts the person eating avocado being to the right of the person eating apple (A, V). If G is in position 2, it would mean C is in position 3, which contradicts the person eating mango being to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening (M, G). If G is in position 3, it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, G is in position 3 (G, 3).

20. The person eating mango is the person who's hobby is skydiving or the person eating mango is the fan gospel or both (M, S or M, G or both). Since we found that S is in position 3 (S, 3), M can't be in position 3. If M is in position 1, it would mean S is in position 2, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 2, it would mean S is in position 3, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 4, it would mean S is in position 5, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 5, it would mean S is in position 6, but there's no person with the hobby of skydiving in position 6. If M is in position 6, it would mean S is in position 1, but there's no person with the hobby of skydiving in position 1. This is a contradiction, as there should be a person with the hobby of skydiving.

21. Since we have a contradiction in the previous step, let's reevaluate the constraints. The person eating mango is the person who's hobby is skydiving or the person eating mango is the fan gospel or both (M, S or M, G or both). Since we found that S is in position 3 (S, 3), M can't be in position 3. If M is in position 1, it would mean S is in position 2, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 2, it would mean S is in position 3, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 4, it would mean S is in position 5, which contradicts the person who's hobby is hiking being in position 5 (H, 5). If M is in position 5, it would mean S is in position 6, but there's no person with the hobby of skydiving in position 6. If M is in position 6, it would mean S is in position 1, but there's no person with the hobby of skydiving in position 1. However, if we allow M to be the fan gospel (M, G), it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, let's place M in position 6 as the fan gospel (M, G).

22. The turkish is the person eating cabbage or the turkish is the person who's hobby is traveling or both (T, C or T, T or both). Since we found that T is the person eating nectarine (T, N), T can't be the person eating cabbage (C, F). So, the turkish is the person who's hobby is traveling (T, T).

23. The American is on the right of the freelancer (A, F), but we found that F is the person eating nectarine (F, T). So, A is the person eating cabbage (A, C).

24. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating apple (A, V), but we found that A is the person eating cabbage (A, C). This is a contradiction, as there should be a person eating avocado.

25. Since we have a contradiction in the previous step, let's reevaluate the constraints. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating apple (A, V). However, if we allow A to be the person eating cabbage (A, C), it wouldn't create any contradictions. So, let's place A in position 4 as the person eating cabbage (A, C).

1. First, let's assign the food, jobs, music-genres, sports, and transport to the six positions. We'll use numbers 1-6 for the positions and A-F for the variables representing the six items in each category.

2. We'll use the given clues to eliminate possibilities and gradually fill in the table.

3. I'll list the filled-in table after each step, and I'll use the following abbreviations for the clues:

Lv11-5x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the unique properties of each element (beverage, job, nationality, pet, transport) and the relationships between them.

Step 2: Use the given clues to eliminate impossible combinations. For example, if a clue states that the lawyer is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, we can mark the lawyer as not being in the positions where the person drinking iced-tea is to their left.

Step 3: Use the remaining clues to make deductions about the positions of the elements. For example, if we know that the person drinking 7up is on the far left, we can place the person drinking 7up in the first position, and then use other clues to place the other elements.

Step 4: Continue this process until all elements have been placed in their correct positions.

Here's a summary of the steps we've taken so far:

1. The person drinking 7up is on the far left (Position 1).
2. The person drinking almond-milk is not the owner of the turtle (Position 6).
3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig (Positions 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6).
4. The owner of the guinea-pig is the malaysian or the person driving the snowmobile is the owner of the guinea-pig, or both (Positions 3, 4, or 6).
5. The person driving the subway is not to the left of the malaysian.
6. The lawyer is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
7. The malaysian is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the nigerian (Positions 2, 3, 4, or 5).
8. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the thai.
9. The thai is the lawyer or the thai is the person drinking cola or both (Positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6).
10. The indonesian and the person driving the subway have different parity positions.
11. The thai is not the person drinking tea.
12. The person driving the helicopter and the owner of the guinea-pig have different parity positions.
13. The person drinking tea is the fisherman or the person drinking tea is the owner of the turtle, but not both.
14. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
15. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
16. The person drinking 7up is the musician or the musician is the person driving the helicopter, but not both.
17. The owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the person driving the helicopter.
18. The indonesian is not the owner of the frog.
19. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
20. The person drinking tea is not the lawyer.
21. The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the frog or the electrician is the person drinking almond-milk or both.
22. The thai is somewhere to the right of the indonesian.
23. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
24. The person drinking almond-milk is not the owner of the turtle.

26. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person driving the van.
27. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
28. The person driving the taxi is not to the right of the owner of the horse.
29. The egyptian is not to the right of the person drinking 7up.
30. The person driving the taxi is the person drinking 7up or the owner of the turtle is the person driving the taxi or both.
31. The teacher is not to the right of the indonesian.
32. The person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the british.
33. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere between the thai and the person driving the ship.
34. The person drinking tea is not to the left of the british.
35. The electrician is on the right of the musician.
36. The musician is the owner of the turtle or the musician is the person drinking iced-tea or both.
37. The lawyer is in an even position.
38. The person driving the van is the person drinking juice.
39. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
40. The person driving the taxi is not to the right of the owner of the horse.

Lv11-5x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. From rule 15, we know the librarian is not the scooter driver. So, the scooter driver can only be the Australian (since there are only 6 options). Let's place the Australian as the scooter driver in position 1.

   |               |       1       |        2        |     3      |     4      |     5      |     6      |
   | Food          |               |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Job           |               |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Nationality   | Australian    |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Sport         |               |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Transport     | Scooter       |                 |            |            |            |            |

2. From rule 34, we know the person eating lemon and the person who's sport is water-polo have different parity positions. Since the Australian (who is the scooter driver) is in an odd position (rule 41), the water-polo player must be in an even position. So, let's place the water-polo player in position 2 (even).

   |               |       1       |        2        |     3      |     4      |     5      |     6      |
   | Food          |               | Water-polo      |            |            |            |            |
   | Job           |               |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Nationality   | Australian    |                 |            |            |            |            |
   | Sport         |               |                 |            |            |            |            |

18. From rule 1, we know the Mexican is somewhere to the left of the Indian. Since the project-manager (who is driving the snowmobile) is in position 3, the Indian can't be in position 4 or 5. So, let's place the Indian in position 6 (even).

    |               |       1       |        2        |     3      |     4      |     5      |     6      |

19. From rule 20, we know the journalist and the person who's sport is cricket have the same parity positions. Since the Indian is in position 6 (even), the cricket player must also be in an even position. Let's place the cricket player in position 4 (even).

20. From rule 25, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the cricket player is in position 4, the skateboard driver can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. So, let's place the skateboard driver in position 5 (odd).

22. From rule 13, we know the person driving the taxi is somewhere between the librarian and the project-manager. Since the librarian is in position 5 and the project-manager is in position 3, the taxi driver can be in position 4 or 5. Since the cricket player is already in position 4, let's place the taxi driver in position 5.

23. From rule 28, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the person eating lemon. Since the taxi driver is in position 5, the person eating lemon can't be in position 6. So, let's place the person eating lemon in position 2 (even).

24. From rule 31, we know the person driving the snowmobile is not the person eating onion. Since the person eating onion is the Mexican (in position 3), the project-manager (who is driving the snowmobile) can't be the Mexican. So, the project-manager must be another nationality. Let's assume the project-manager is Indian (since the Indian is still available).

25. From rule 30, we know the Indonesian is not the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the water-polo player can't be in position 4. So, let's place the water-polo player in position 6 (even).

26. From rule 35, we know the Indian is the person who's sport is cricket or the person eating pepper is the Indian, but not both. Since the cricket player is already the Indian, the person eating pepper can't be the Indian. So, let's place the person eating pepper in position 1 (since the journalist is already in position 1).

32. From rule 41, we know the Australian is in an odd position. Since the Australian is already in position 1 (which is odd), no further action is needed for the Australian's position.

33. From rule 44, we know the indonesian and the teacher have the same nationality. Since the Indonesian is in position 5, the teacher must also be Indonesian. Let's place the teacher in position 4 (even).

34. From rule 43, we know the brazilian is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the engineer is not yet placed, let's assume the engineer is the brazilian for now.

35. From rule 37, we know the engineer and the Indonesian have the same parity positions. Since the Indonesian is in position 5 (odd), the engineer must also be in an odd position. Since the Australian is already in position 1 (odd), the engineer can't be the Australian. So, let's place the engineer in position 3 (odd).

36. From rule 42, we know the person eating onion is somewhere between the teacher and the engineer. Since the teacher is in position 4 and the engineer is in position 3, the person eating onion can be in position 2 or 4. Since the person eating lemon is already in position 2, let's place the person eating onion in position 4.

37. From rule 18, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person eating onion is in position 4, the weightlifting person can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 5. So, let's place the weightlifting person in position 6 (even).

39. From rule 22, we know the person driving the taxi is somewhere between the librarian and the project-manager.

45. From rule 15, we know the librarian is not the scooter driver. Since the scooter driver is the Australian (in position 1), the librarian can't be the Australian. So, the librarian must be another nationality. Let's assume the librarian is Indian for now.

The person eating lemon is the Australian (in position 2), so the person playing water-polo must be in position 6 (even).

Lv11-5x6-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Eliminate impossible combinations based on parity (even or odd positions) for certain pairs of people or items.
- Spanish and person drinking fanta have the same parity positions (9)
- Journalist is somewhere to the right of the security-guard (5)
- Photographer is on the far left or far right (3)
- Italian is the chef or the chef is the person drinking lemonade or both (20)
- Security-guard is not to the right of the Italian (8)
- Doctor is not to the right of the photographer (8)
- Owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the photographer (3)
- Doctor and the Malay have the same parity positions (9)
- Person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the ferret have different parity positions (9)
- Person who's sport is sailing and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions (9)
- Spanish is on the left or right of the doctor (3)

From this, we can deduce the parity of certain positions:
- Spanish: even
- Journalist: odd
- Photographer: odd or even (either far left or far right)
- Doctor: even or odd (either left or right)
- Security-guard: odd
- Chef (if Italian): even or odd (either left or right)
- Chef (if not Italian and drinking lemonade): odd

Step 2: Eliminate impossible combinations based on the positions of certain people or items.

Lv11-5x6-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify the parity of each person's position (odd or even). Since the table has 6 positions, the parity of the first and sixth positions will be the same, as well as the second and fifth positions, and the third and fourth positions.

1. The person who's hobby is photography is in an odd position (4).
2. The person who's hobby is reading is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (8). Since the hobby of photography is odd, the hobby of sudoku must be even. Let's say sudoku is in position 2 (even). Then, the hobby of reading must be in position 4 (odd).
3. The social-worker is not to the left of the person watching western movies (8). Since the hobby of reading is in position 4, the social-worker cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's say the social-worker is in position 6 (even).
4. The person who's hobby is photography is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (8). Since the hobby of photography is in position 4, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 6 or 1. But the social-worker is in position 6, so the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1.

Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1, the person driving the bus must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. But the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 2, so the person driving the bus must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Job           | Movie-Genre   | Transport     |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| iced-tea     | software-dev  | software-dev   | martial-arts  | bus          |
| water        | social-worker | social-worker | crime        | airplane     |
| lemonade     | reading       | reading       | mystery      | trike        |
| milk         |               |               |               | subway       |
| hot-chocolate| sudoku        | police-officer |               | helicopter   |
| sprite       | photography   | electrician   | western       | train        |

The table is not complete because we don't have the job for the person drinking milk and the hobby for the person driving the subway. However, we know that the person drinking milk is in position 3 and the person driving the subway is in position 4.

Since the person driving the subway is between the person driving the helicopter and the person who's hobby is baking, the hobby of the person driving the subway must be in position 5 or 6. But the hobby of photography is in position 4, so the hobby of the person driving the subway must be in position 5 or 6.

Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 1 and the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 2, the job of the person drinking milk must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But the electrician is in position 5, so the job of the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 3.

Since the person who's hobby is camping is the police-officer, the job of the person driving the subway must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But the electrician is in position 5, so the job of the person driving the subway must be in position 2 or 6.

Since the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the electrician, the hobby of the person driving the subway must be in position 5 or 6. But the hobby of photography is in position 4, so the hobby of the person driving the subway must be in position 5.

Since the person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, the hobby of the person driving the subway must be in position 5. The only hobby left is dancing, so the hobby of the person driving the subway is dancing.

Since the person who's hobby is dancing is not the police-officer, the job of the person driving the subway is not the police-officer. The only jobs left are lawyer, musician, and software-developer. But the software-developer is already the person drinking iced-tea, so the job of the person driving the subway must be lawyer or musician.

Since the person who's hobby is photography is in position 4, the person driving the subway is in position 5. The person who's hobby is photography is in an odd position, so the person driving the subway is in an even position. But the lawyer is in an even position, so the person driving the subway is the musician.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Job           | Movie-Genre   | Transport     |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| iced-tea     | software-dev  | software-dev   | martial-arts  | bus          |
| water        | social-worker | social-worker | crime        | airplane     |
| lemonade     | reading       | reading       | mystery      | trike        |
| milk         |               | musician      |               | subway       |
| hot-chocolate| sudoku        | police-officer |               | helicopter   |
| sprite       | photography   | electrician   | western       | train        |

The table is complete, and the solution is:

Lv11-5x6-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number from 1 to 6 to each category (Hobby, Job, Nationality, Sport, Transport) for each person. We'll use the same number for each category if they are in the same position.

2. We'll use the parity (even or odd) of the numbers to solve some clues. For example, if two people have the same parity, they are in the same position.

3. Let's start with the clues that give us the most information:

   - Clue 1: The person driving the jet-ski and the person who's sport is weightlifting have the same parity positions. Let's assume the jet-ski driver is odd (1, 3, 5) and the weightlifter is even (2, 4, 6).

   - Clue 2: The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is camping and the doctor. Let's assume the surfer is 3, camping is 2, and the doctor is 4 or 6 (since the surfer is between them).

   - Clue 3: The person driving the helicopter is on the far right. Let's assume this is 6.

   - Clue 4: The person driving the motorbike is in an even position. Since the helicopter is on the far right, the motorbike must be 2, 4, or 6. But the motorbike can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and it can't be 2 because the surfer is there. So, the motorbike is 4.

   - Clue 5: The analyst is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the helicopter is on the far right, the analyst can't be 6. So, the analyst is 1, 3, or 5. But the analyst can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the analyst is 1.

   - Clue 6: The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the helicopter is on the far right, the nigerian (magic-tricks) can't be 6. So, the nigerian is 1, 3, or 5. But the nigerian can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the nigerian is 1. This means the sport of ice-hockey is 2.

   - Clue 7: The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the surfer is to the left of camping, the tennis player can't be to the left of camping. So, the tennis player is 4 or 6.

   - Clue 8: The writer and the person who's sport is tennis have the same parity positions. Since the writer is 1 (from clue 5), the writer can't be 6. So, the writer is 4.

   - Clue 9: The person who's hobby is chess is the person driving the motorbike or the person driving the motorbike is the doctor or both. Since we know the doctor is 2 (from clue 6) and the motorbike is 4, the doctor can't be the motorbike driver. So, the person who's hobby is chess is the motorbike driver (4).

   - Clue 10: The italian is not to the right of the firefighter. Since the helicopter is on the far right, the italian can't be 6. So, the italian is 1, 3, or 5. But the italian can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the italian is 1.

   - Clue 11: The person who's sport is weightlifting is the doctor or the doctor is the person driving the ship or both. Since we know the doctor is 2, the doctor can't be the person driving the ship. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is 3, 5, or 6. But the weightlifter can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is 5.

   - Clue 12: The person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the chess player is 4 and the weightlifter is 5, the chess player can't be to the left of the weightlifter.

   - Clue 13: The analyst is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the analyst is 1 and the baker can't be 6 (because the helicopter is there), the baker is 2 or 4. But the baker can't be 4 because the motorbike is there. So, the baker is 2.

   - Clue 14: The person who's sport is snowboarding and the colombian have the same parity positions. Since the surfer is odd (3) and the doctor is even (2), the snowboarder can't be 2. So, the snowboarder is 1, 3, 5, or 6. But the snowboarder can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the snowboarder is 1, 3, or 5.

   - Clue 15: The person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since the chess player is 4 and the motorbike driver is 4, the boat driver can't be 4. So, the boat driver is 2 or 6.

   - Clue 16: The nigerian is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. We already know this from clue 6.

   - Clue 17: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the left of the australian. Since the ice-hockey player is 2 and the australian is 1 (from clue 21), the australian can't be to the left of the ice-hockey player.

   - Clue 18: The person who's sport is ice-hockey and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the ice-hockey player is 2 and the accountant can't be 2 (because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4), the accountant is 1, 3, 5, or 6. But the accountant can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the accountant is 1, 3, or 5.

   - Clue 19: The person who's sport is surfing is between the colombian and the italian. Since the surfer is 3 and the italian is 1, the colombian must be 2.

   - Clue 20: The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the tennis player is 4 and the hiker can't be 2 (because the surfer is there), the hiker is 6.

   - Clue 21: The australian is the person who's sport is baseball. Since the australian is 1, the baseball player is 6.

   - Clue 22: The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is 2, the snowmobile driver can't be 1, 3, or 5. So, the snowmobile driver is 6.

   - Clue 23: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is baking and the photographer. Since the baker is 2 and the photographer can't be 6 (because the helicopter is there), the photographer is 1, 3, or 5. But the photographer can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the photographer is 1 or 5. If the photographer is 1, the rock-climber is 3. If the photographer is 5, the rock-climber is 2.

   - Clue 24: The doctor is the person driving the motorbike or the doctor is the person who's hobby is baking, but not both. We already know the doctor is the motorbike driver. So, the doctor is not the baker.

   - Clue 25: The italian is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. If the photographer is 1, the rock-climber is 3, and the italian is 1. If the photographer is 5, the rock-climber is 2, and the italian is not 2 because the surfer is there.

   - Clue 26: The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the jet-ski driver is odd and the rock-climber is even, the jet-ski driver can't be the rock-climber. So, the jet-ski driver is 1, 3, or 5. But the jet-ski driver can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the jet-ski driver is 1 or 5. But the jet-ski driver can't be 1 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the jet-ski driver is 5.

   - Clue 27: The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the colombian. Since the surfer is 3 and the colombian is 2, the surfer can't be 3. So, the surfer is 1.

   - Clue 28: The firefighter is somewhere between the accountant and the person who's hobby is camping. Since the accountant can't be 6 (because the helicopter is there), the firefighter can't be 6 either. So, the firefighter is 1, 3, or 5. But the firefighter can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the firefighter is 1. This means the accountant is 6.

   - Clue 29: The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarder is 1, the tennis player can't be 1. So, the tennis player is 3, 5, or 6. But the tennis player can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the tennis player is 3 or 5.

   - Clue 30: The person who's sport is snowboarding is not the accountant. Since the accountant is 6, the snowboarder can't be 6.

   - Clue 31: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the left of the doctor. Since the doctor is 2, the rock-climber can't be 1 or 3. So, the rock-climber is 4, 5, or 6. But the rock-climber can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the rock-climber is 4 or 5.

   - Clue 32: The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who's sport is surfing. We already know this from clue 22 and 26.

   - Clue 33: The german is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the snowboarder is 1, the german can't be 6. So, the german is 2, 4, or 5. But the german can't be 4 because the motorbike is there, and the german can't be 6 because the helicopter is there. So, the german is 2.

   - Clue 34: The italian is on the left or right of the german. Since the german is 2, the italian can't be 1. So, the italian is 3 or 5. But the italian can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the italian is 5.

   - Clue 35: The australian is not the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the weightlifter is 5, the australian can't be 5.

   - Clue 36: The person driving the jet-ski is the australian. We already know this from clue 6.

   - Clue 37: The german is not the person driving the ship. Since the german is 2, the ship driver can't be 2.

   - Clue 38: The german is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the weightlifter is 5, the german can't be 1, 3, or 5. So, the german is 2, 4, or 6. But the german can't be 6 because the helicopter is there, and the german can't be 2 because the german is the german. So, the german is 4.

   - Clue 39: The italian and the person who's sport is surfing have different parity positions. Since the italian is 5 and the surfer is 1, the italian is odd, and the surfer is even.

   - Clue 40: The italian is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the chess player is 4, the italian can't be 6. So, the italian is 1, 3, or 5. But the italian can't be 3 because the surfer is there, and the motorbike is 4. So, the italian is 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |       2       |      3       |      4      |     5      |      6       |

Lv11-5x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the number of each category for each person.
Since there are 6 people and 6 categories, we can assign a number from 1 to 6 to each category for each person.

Step 2: Assign initial values based on the given clues.
1. The British or the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person who's hobby is drawing. Let's assign Drawing to person 1 and Weightlifting to person 6 (since the British is not the first person).
2. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the left of the Russian. Let's assign Volleyball to person 2.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Let's assign Gardening to person 3 and Water-polo to person 5 (since it can't be the first or last position).
4. The person eating apple is in an odd position. Let's assign Apple to person 1, 3, 5, or 6 (since the first position is already taken by Drawing).
5. The person watching superhero movies is the person eating apple. Let's assign Superhero Movies to person 1 (since Apple and Superhero Movies are now assigned to the same person).
6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the person eating apple. Since we already assigned Weightlifting to person 6, it can't be the first or second position. So, let's assign Weightlifting to person 5 (since it can't be the last position).
7. The nigerian is somewhere to the right of the colombian. Let's assign Colombian to person 4 and Nigerian to person 6 (since it can't be the first position).
8. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the nigerian. Let's assign Tennis to person 5 (since it can't be the first position and it's to the right of Nigerian).
9. The person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since we already assigned Puzzles to an odd position, it can't be person 2, 4, or 6. So, let's assign Puzzles to person 3.
10. The person watching superhero movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we already assigned Superhero Movies to person 1, it can't be to the left of any other hobby.
11. The person watching superhero movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we already assigned Superhero Movies to person 1, it can't be to the left of any other hobby.
12. The person watching spy movies is not the person who's sport is tennis. Since we already assigned Spy Movies to an even position, it can't be person 2, 4, or 6. So, let's assign Spy Movies to person 4.
13. The person who's hobby is chess is on the far left. Let's assign Chess to person 1.
14. The person who's sport is water-polo is not the canadian. Since we already assigned Water-polo to person 5, it can't be person 2 (since Volleyball is to the left of the Russian, and the Canadian is to the right of the person who's hobby is collecting). So, let's assign Canadian to person 2.
15. The person who's hobby is drawing is not the indian. Since we already assigned Drawing to person 1, it can't be person 5 (since Weightlifting is on the left or right of the person eating apple, and we already assigned Apple and Weightlifting to person 1 and 5). So, let's assign Indian to person 5.
16. The person who's hobby is puzzles is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since we already assigned Puzzles to person 3, it can't be to the right of any even position.
17. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far left or far right. Since we already assigned Volleyball to the second position, Climbing can't be there. So, let's assign Climbing to person 6 (since it can't be the first position).
18. The person who's sport is baseball and the nigerian have the same parity positions. Since we already assigned Baseball to an even position (person 4), the Nigerian must be even as well (person 6).
19. The person who's sport is volleyball and the person eating strawberry have the same parity positions. Since we already assigned Volleyball to person 2, the person eating Strawberry must be odd (person 1, 3, 5, or 7). However, we already assigned Strawberry to person 1 (since it's an odd position and the person watching superhero movies is the person eating apple). So, let's assign Strawberry to person 3.
20. The person watching martial-arts movies is the person who's hobby is gardening or the person who's hobby is gardening is the person eating grapefruit or both. Since we already assigned Gardening to person 3, let's assign Martial-arts Movies to person 3 as well (since it can't be the first or last position). Since we already assigned Gardening to person 3, the person eating Grapefruit must be even (person 2, 4, or 6). However, we already assigned Grapefruit to person 5 (since it can't be the first position and it's not to the right of the person eating nectarine). So, let's assign Grapefruit to person 4.
21. The nigerian is not to the right of the person eating strawberry. Since we already assigned Nigerian to person 6 and Strawberry to person 3, this condition is satisfied.
22. The canadian is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we already assigned Canadian to person 2 and Collecting to person 6, this condition is satisfied.
23. The british is the person eating cauliflower or the person eating cauliflower is the person who's sport is weightlifting, but not both. Since we already assigned Weightlifting to person 5, the British can't be person 5 (since it's not the first position). So, let's assign Cauliflower to person 1 (since it can't be the last position).
24. The person who's hobby is collecting is not the nigerian. Since we already assigned Collecting to person 6 and Nigerian to person 2, this condition is satisfied.
