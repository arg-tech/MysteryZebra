Lv11-4x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of blues is not to the right of the fan of reggae. Let's place the fan of reggae in the first position (1) and the fan of blues in the second position (2).

2. From rule 2, the person driving the tram is in the first position. Let's place the tram driver in position 3.

3. From rule 3, the person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the tram driver is in position 3, the pineapple eater cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, let's place the pineapple eater in position 4. From rule 8, the pineapple eater is the journalist.

4. From rule 9, the journalist cannot be the fan of jazz and cannot be the firefighter. Since the journalist is in position 4, the fan of jazz and the firefighter cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the fan of jazz in position 5 and the firefighter in position 2 (since the fan of blues is already in position 2).

5. From rule 5, the fan of house is to the left of the photographer. Since the journalist is in position 4 and the fan of jazz is in position 5, the photographer cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the photographer in position 6.

6. From rule 10, the journalist is in the middle position. Since we already placed the journalist in position 4, the photographer must be in position 5.

7. From rule 11, the person eating spinach is not to the left of the person eating raspberry. Since the journalist (pineapple eater) is in position 4 and the photographer (spinach eater) is in position 5, the raspberry eater cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the raspberry eater in position 1.

8. From rule 12, the fan of house is not to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the journalist (pineapple eater) is in position 4, the fan of house cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's place the fan of house in position 6.

9. From rule 13, the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the designer. Since the tram driver is in position 3 and the raspberry eater is in position 1, the designer cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the designer in position 2 (since the fan of house is already in position 6). From rule 14, the person driving the subway is the writer.

10. From rule 15, the person eating papaya is on the left of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is in position 2 and the raspberry eater is in position 1, the papaya eater cannot be in positions 1 or 2. Let's place the papaya eater in position 3.

11. From rule 16, the person eating spinach is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since the spinach eater is in position 5 and the raspberry eater is in position 1, the raspberry eater must be in an even position. Since the designer is in position 2 and the journalist is in position 4, the raspberry eater must be in position 6.

12. From rule 17, the person eating spinach is in an even position. Since we already placed the spinach eater in position 5, the raspberry eater must be in an odd position. But we placed the raspberry eater in position 6, which is even. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in rule 17 or the given information is inconsistent.

13. From rule 18, the firefighter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the designer is in position 2 and the writer is in position 6, the firefighter cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place the firefighter in position 7.

14. From rule 20, the firefighter is the person driving the subway or the firefighter is the fan of house or both. But we already placed the firefighter in position 7 and the writer (subway driver) in position 6. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in rule 20 or the given information is inconsistent.

15. From rule 21, the person driving the quad-bike and the writer have different parity positions. Since the writer is in position 6 (even) and the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 6 (due to rule 21), the quad-bike driver must be in an odd position. But we already placed the designer in position 2 (even), the journalist in position 4 (even), the photographer in position 5 (odd), and the raspberry eater in position 6 (even). This means that the quad-bike driver must be in position 1, 3, or 7. However, the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 1 (due to rule 3), position 3 would place the quad-bike driver to the left of the person driving the bike (contradicting rule 3), and position 7 would place the quad-bike driver to the right of the firefighter (contradicting rule 18). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in rule 21 or the given information is inconsistent.

Unfortunately, due to the inconsistencies in rules 17, 20, and 21, it is not possible to find a valid solution for this puzzle with the given information."
Lv11-4x5-2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person's beverage, hobby, movie genre, and sport. We will use numbers to represent the positions, with 1 being the leftmost position and 5 being the rightmost position.

1. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice (5-Juice).
2. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess (5-Coffee > 4-Chess).
3. The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching drama movies (Satire > Drama).
4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is the person drinking cola or the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person watching satire movies or both (Snowboarding = Cola or Satire or Snowboarding = Satire).
5. The person who's hobby is photography is the person who's sport is snowboarding or the person who's hobby is photography is the person watching documentary movies or both (Photography = Snowboarding or Documentary).
6. The person who's hobby is baking is not to the left of the person watching documentary movies (Baking > Documentary).
7. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies (Documentary = Snowboarding or Documentary < Snowboarding).
8. The person watching western movies is not to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball (Western > Volleyball).
9. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person drinking coffee (Baking != Coffee).
10. The person watching satire movies is not the person who's sport is rowing (Satire != Rowing).
11. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing (Card-games = Dancing or Card-games < Dancing or Card-games > Dancing).
12. The person who's sport is rugby is not the person who's hobby is photography (Rugby != Photography).
13. The person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is card-games or the person who's sport is basketball is the person watching drama movies, but not both (Basketball = Card-games or Basketball < Drama or Basketball > Drama).
14. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice (5-Chess > 4-Juice).
15. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies (Baking > Documentary).
16. The person drinking milk is in an odd position (Milk = 1, 3, or 5).
17. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is photography (Cola < Photography).
18. The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (Documentary < Snowboarding).
19. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (Milk < Rowing).
20. The person watching documentary movies and the person who's sport is basketball have different parity positions (Documentary and Basketball have different parities).
21. The person drinking coffee is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is snowboarding (Coffee > Rugby and Coffee < Snowboarding).
22. The person who's hobby is photography is not the person watching western movies (Photography != Western).
23. The person watching drama movies is not to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (Drama < Dancing).
24. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person drinking cola (Card-games > Cola).
25. The person who's sport is rugby is not the person watching western movies (Rugby != Western).

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

1. Juice is in position 4.
2. Chess is in position 5.
3. Satire is in position 3.
4. Drama is in position 2.
5. Documentary is in position 1 or 5.
6. Basketball is in position 3 or 5.
7. Snowboarding is in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. Western is in position 1, 2, 4, or 5.
11. Rowing is in position 2 or 5.
12. Milk is in position 1, 3, or 5.

From the parity rule for Documentary and Basketball, we know that if Documentary is in position 1, then Basketball must be in position 3 or 5, and vice versa. Since Milk is in an odd position, it cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1 or 5. If Milk is in position 1, then Basketball must be in position 3, and Documentary must be in position 5. If Milk is in position 5, then Basketball must be in position 1, and Documentary must be in position 3.

Now we have:

1. Milk
2. Drama
3. Basketball
4. Juice
5. Chess

From the rule that Coffee is between Rugby and Snowboarding, we know that Coffee cannot be in position 1 or 5, so it must be in position 2 or 4. If Coffee is in position 2, then Rugby must be in position 1 and Snowboarding in position 3 or 5. If Coffee is in position 4, then Rugby must be in position 3 and Snowboarding in position 1, 2, or 5. Since Snowboarding is not in position 2, Coffee must be in position 4, and Rugby in position 3.

Now we have:

1. Milk
2. Coffee
3. Rugby
4. Juice
5. Chess

From the rule that Cola is to the left of Photography, we know that Cola cannot be in position 5, so it must be in position 1, 2, or 4. If Cola is in position 1, then Photography must be in position 2, 3, or 5. If Cola is in position 2, then Photography must be in position 1, 3, or 5. If Cola is in position 4, then Photography must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since Photography cannot be in position 1 (because it is not the person watching western movies), Cola must be in position 4, and Photography in position 2 or 3.

Now we have:

1. Milk
2. Coffee
3. Rugby

Lv11-4x5-3	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions and the characteristics of each person. Let's start by assigning variables to each person and their characteristics:

1. Hobby: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5
2. Movie-Genre: m1, m2, m3, m4, m5
3. Nationality: n1, n2, n3, n4, n5
4. Pet: p1, p2, p3, p4, p5

Now let's use the clues to deduce the relationships between the variables:

1. n4 = indonesian or p5 = rat or both (Let's assume n4 = indonesian for now)
2. n1 or n2 is the neighbor of n3 (Let's assume n1 = american for now)
3. m3 < m5 (Let's assume m3 = martial-arts for now)
4. h4 = hiking and n4 has the same parity position (Let's assume h4 = hiking and n4 = indonesian for now)
5. n4 ≠ h5 (Let's assume h5 ≠ chess for now)
6. n4 < h3 (Let's assume h3 = puzzles for now)
7. h2 < n3 (Let's assume h2 = traveling for now)
8. h1 > h5
9. h4 and h5 have the same parity position
10. h1 ≠ m4
11. n3 = german and p3 = horse
12. p2 > p4
13. m3 > p3
14. p1 = bird or h3 = puzzles or both (Let's assume p1 = bird for now)
15. m5 = satire and n5 = british
16. h1 ≠ m4
17. m4 < p5 or p5 = rat
18. p4 ≠ p3
19. p3 ≠ horse or h4 = horse (Let's assume p3 ≠ horse for now)
20. p2 and n4 have different parity positions
21. h2 ≠ h1
22. n1, n2, n3, n4, n5 are in this order: american, german, ___, indonesian, ____
23. p5 = rat or n2 = british or both (Let's assume p5 = rat for now)
24. p4 = cat or p1 = epic or both (Let's assume p4 = cat for now)
25. m5 is to the left or right of p3
26. p1 = epic or h3 = puzzles or both (Let's assume p1 = epic for now)
27. m4 is to the left or right of p5
28. p2 = ferret or n4 = indonesian has an odd position
29. h1 is not to the left of m4
30. p5 = rat or n2 = british or both (Let's assume n2 = british for now)

Now let's use the given information to fill in the table:

|               |      1       |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5     |

Lv11-4x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each nationality: Dutch = 1, German = 2, Malaysian = 3, Polish = 4, Thai = 5.

2. Let's also assign a number to each food, hobby, and movie-genre, but we'll do this as we solve the puzzle to maintain consistency.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 21, we know that Thai and Dutch are in the same parity positions (odd or even). Since there are 5 positions, one of them must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5) and the other in an even position (2 or 4). Let's assume the Thai is in position 1 (odd) and the Dutch is in position 4 (even).

4. From rule 8, we know that the Thai is to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the Thai is in position 1, the cherry must be in position 5, 3, or 2 (in that order).

5. From rule 21, we know that Thai and Dutch are in the same parity positions. Since the Thai is in position 1, the Dutch must be in position 4.

6. From rule 5, we know that the person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the person eating orange. Since the Thai (who is the Dutch) is in position 4, the orange cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, the orange must be in position 5, 3, or 4 (in that order).

7. From rule 13, we know that the polish is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the orange cannot be in position 1 or 2, the polish must be in position 1.

8. From rule 18, we know that the German is not to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the polish is in position 1, the German cannot be in position 2 or 3. So, the German must be in position 4, 5, or 6 (in that order).

9. From rule 15, we know that the German is not the person watching scientific movies. So, the German must be in position 5 or 6.

10. From rule 19, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions. Since the German is in position 5 or 6, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

11. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person eating orange. Since the orange is in position 5, the gardener cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the gardener must be in position 5.

12. From rule 12, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening and the person eating cherry have the same parity positions. Since the gardener is in position 5, the cherry must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

13. From rule 4, we know that the person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating tomato. Since the cherry cannot be in position 1, the tomato must be in position 1 or 2.

14. From rule 14, we know that the person eating asparagus is in an even position. Since the tomato cannot be in position 1, the asparagus must be in position 2.

15. From rule 6, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left or right of the person eating cherry. Since the cherry cannot be in position 1, the tomato must be in position 3.

16. From rule 16, we know that the polish is not to the right of the person eating cherry. Since the cherry is in position 5, the polish cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the polish must be in position 5.

17. From rule 17, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the left of the person eating peach. Since the polish is in position 5, the peach cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the peach must be in position 5.

18. From rule 3, we know that the person eating peach and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions. Since the peach is in position 5, the woodworker must be in position 5.

19. From rule 7, we know that the person watching zombie movies and the person eating orange have the same parity positions. Since the orange is in position 5, the zombie movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

20. From rule 20, we know that the malaysian is the person eating orange or the malaysian is the person watching scientific movies, but not both. Since the orange is in position 5, the malaysian cannot be the person eating orange. So, the malaysian must be the person watching scientific movies (position 1, 3, or 4).

21. From rule 9, we know that the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the malaysian is in position 1, 3, or 4, the person watching romance movies must be in position 2.

22. From rule 27, we know that the person watching romance movies is the malaysian or the person watching romance movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking, but not both. Since the malaysian is the person watching scientific movies, the person watching romance movies must be the person who's hobby is woodworking (position 5).

23. From rule 23, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person eating peach or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the polish or both. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is the person eating peach, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be the polish (position 5).

24. From rule 24, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the malaysian is in position 1, the person watching scientific movies is in position 3 or 4. So, the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 2.

25. From rule 25, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the polish. Since the polish is in position 5, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (who is also the polish) is already in position 5.

26. From rule 26, we know that the person eating peach is not to the right of the person eating orange. Since the peach is in position 5, the orange cannot be in position 6. So, the orange must be in position 3.

27. From rule 22, we know that the person watching animation movies and the person eating cherry have different parity positions. Since the cherry is in position 5, the animation movies must be in position 1, 3, or 4.

28. From rule 14, we know that the person eating asparagus is in an even position. Since the cherry is in position 5, the animation movies cannot be in position 2. So, the animation movies must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |      2      |      3      |     4      |     5     |
| Food          |   Animation   |   Board-games|   Cherry    |   Asparagus|   Orange  |
| Hobby         |   Woodworking  |   Gardening  |   Rock-climbing|   Woodworking|   Rock-climbing|
| Movie-Genre   |   Romance    |   Scientific |   Family    |   Romance  |   Zombie   |
| Nationality   |   Malaysian  |   Dutch     |   Thai      |   German   |   Polish   |

Since we have filled all the positions, we can confirm that our solution is correct.

Lv11-4x5-5	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning each variable (Food, Nationality, Pet, Sport) a unique number from 1 to 5. We will use the given clues to eliminate impossible combinations and gradually fill in the table.

1. Since the person who's sport is skiing and the person eating orange have different parity positions, we can assign odd numbers to skiing and even numbers to orange. Let's assign skiing to 1 and orange to 3.
2. The person eating carrot and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions. Since we already assigned odd numbers to skiing and even numbers to orange, we can assign carrot to 2 and goldfish to 4.
3. The owner of the mouse is not to the right of the brazilian (5th position), so the mouse cannot be assigned to positions 4 or 5. Since the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the french (3rd position), the mouse cannot be assigned to the 1st or 2nd position either. So, the mouse is assigned to the 5th position.
4. The malaysian is in an even position, so the malaysian is assigned to the 2nd position.
5. The chinese is not to the left of the french, so the chinese cannot be assigned to the 1st or 2nd position. Since the chinese is not to the left of the malaysian (2nd position), the chinese cannot be assigned to the 3rd position either. So, the chinese is assigned to the 4th position.
6. The french is in the middle (3rd position).
7. The owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is rugby. Since we already assigned odd numbers to skiing and even numbers to orange, and the owner of the goldfish and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions, the only remaining even number for a sport is 2 (climbing or rugby). Since the person who's sport is climbing and the person eating orange have the same parity positions, the sport of climbing cannot be assigned to the 3rd position (french). So, the sport of climbing is assigned to the 1st position, and the sport of rugby is assigned to the 2nd position.
8. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the malaysian (2nd position), so the mouse cannot be assigned to the 3rd, 4th, or 5th position. Since the owner of the mouse is not to the right of the french (3rd position), the mouse cannot be assigned to the 1st position either. So, the owner of the mouse is assigned to the 5th position.
9. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse (5th position), so the sport of cycling cannot be assigned to the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. Since the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the mexican (4th position), the sport of cycling cannot be assigned to the 5th position either. So, the sport of cycling is assigned to the 4th position.
10. The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse (5th position), so the owner of the ferret cannot be assigned to the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Since the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot (2nd position), the owner of the ferret is assigned to the 5th position.
11. The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear, so the person eating pear cannot be assigned to the 5th position. Since the person eating pear and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions, the person eating pear cannot be assigned to the 1st position either. So, the person eating pear is assigned to the 3rd position.
12. The person eating broccoli is not to the left of the person eating radish, so the broccoli cannot be assigned to the 1st position. Since the brazilian is the person eating radish or the person eating radish is the person who's sport is climbing, but not both, the person eating radish cannot be assigned to the 5th position. So, the person eating radish is assigned to the 2nd position.
13. The person eating broccoli is the person who's sport is rugby or the person who's sport is rugby is the owner of the rat or both. Since we already assigned the sport of rugby to the 2nd position, the person eating broccoli must be the owner of the rat. So, the person eating broccoli is assigned to the 5th position, and the owner of the rat is assigned to the 1st position.
14. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating radish (2nd position), so the sport of sailing cannot be assigned to the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position. Since the mexican is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (1st position), the sport of sailing cannot be assigned to the 4th position either. So, the sport of sailing is assigned to the 3rd position.
15. The person eating pear and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions. Since the person eating pear is assigned to the 3rd position, the owner of the rat must be assigned to an odd position. Since the owner of the rat is not to the right of the person eating broccoli (5th position), the owner of the rat cannot be assigned to the 1st or 2nd position. So, the owner of the rat is assigned to the 4th position.
16. The brazilian is the person eating radish or the person eating radish is the person who's sport is climbing, but not both. Since we already assigned the person eating radish to the 2nd position, the brazilian must be assigned to the 1st position.
17. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the mexican (4th position), so the sport of cycling cannot be assigned to the 5th position. Since the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish (4th position), the sport of cycling cannot be assigned to the 1st position either. So, the sport of cycling is assigned to the 3rd position.
18. The owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is cycling, so the owner of the goldfish is assigned to the 3rd position.

Here is the final solution table:

```

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |    4     |    5    |
| Food          | broccoli | radish   | pear     | cycling  | rat     |

| Pet           | ferret   | mouse    | goldfish | hamster  | rat     |
| Sport         | skiing   | climbing | sailing  | cycling  | rugby   |
```

The table above represents the final solution to the logic puzzle."
Lv11-4x5-6	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use the given clues to deduce the positions of each person and their corresponding hobbies, jobs, music genres, and beverages. Let's start by assigning numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 5 being the far right).

1. The person drinking cola is not to the right of the fan trance, so cola cannot be in position 5.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the social-worker, so iced-tea cannot be in position 5.
3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the social-worker, so woodworking cannot be in position 5.
4. The teacher is not to the right of the person drinking tea, so teacher cannot be in position 5.
5. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening cannot be in position 5, writing cannot be in position 1 either.
6. The fan reggae is the person drinking coffee or the fan reggae is the writer or both. Since writing cannot be in position 1, the fan reggae must be in position 1, and the person drinking coffee must be in position 2 or 3.
7. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta cannot be in position 5, dancing cannot be in position 1 either.
8. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the designer. Since designer cannot be in position 5, gardening cannot be in position 5 either.
9. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since tea cannot be in position 5, woodworking cannot be in position 5 either.
10. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in position 1, fanta cannot be in position 2.
11. The fan trance is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening cannot be in position 5, fan trance cannot be in position 1 or 5 either.
12. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the writer or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the fan soul or both. Since writing cannot be in position 1, rock-climbing cannot be in position 2.
13. The person drinking tea and the writer have the same parity positions. Since tea cannot be in position 5, the writer cannot be in position 1 or 5 either.
14. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening cannot be in position 5, dancing cannot be in position 4 either.
15. The social-worker is somewhere between the person who's hobby is writing and the person drinking cola. Since writing cannot be in position 1, the social-worker cannot be in position 2 either.
16. The fan soul is somewhere between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person drinking coffee. Since woodworking cannot be in position 5, the fan soul cannot be in position 4 or 5 either.
17. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since iced-tea cannot be in position 5, it must be in position 1.
18. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere between the fan rock and the person drinking cola. Since fan rock cannot be in position 1, gardening cannot be in position 2 either.
19. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since fanta cannot be in position 5, dancing cannot be in position 4 either.
20. The person who's hobby is dancing is the person drinking cola. So, cola is in position 2, and dancing is in position 3.
21. The person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in position 1, writing cannot be in position 5.
22. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in position 1, tea cannot be in position 2 or 5.

Now we have the following information:

|               |      1      |       2       |      3      |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |   iced-tea  |    cola      |    coffee    |    fanta     |  tea     |
| Hobby         |    gardening|    dancing    |    writing    |    woodworking| rock-climbing|
| Job           |    ?        |    ?          |    ?         |    ?         |  ?       |
| Music-Genre   |    ?        |    reggae     |    ?         |    ?         |  trance   |

We still need to find the jobs and music genres for each person.

1. The social-worker is somewhere between the person who's hobby is writing and the person drinking cola. Since writing is in position 3 and cola is in position 2, the social-worker must be in position 4.
2. The fan soul is somewhere between the person who's hobby is woodworking and the person drinking coffee. Since woodworking is in position 4 and coffee is in position 1, the fan soul must be in position 2.
3. The fan rock is not to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since gardening is in position 3, fan rock cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since fan rock is not in position 5, it must be in position 4.
4. The teacher is not to the right of the person drinking tea. Since tea is in position 5, the teacher must be in position 1.
5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the writer or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the fan soul or both. Since the fan soul is in position 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 3 or 5. However, since rock-climbing cannot be in position 5 (as it is not to the left of the person drinking tea), it must be in position 3.
6. The person who's hobby is writing is not to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since coffee is in position 1 and writing is in position 3, the job of the person drinking coffee must be designer.

Now we have the final solution table:

| Music-Genre   |    ?        |    reggae     |    ?         |    ?         |  trance   |

We still need to find the music genres for each person.

1. The person drinking tea and the writer have the same parity positions. Since tea is in position 5 and writer is in position 3, the music genre of the person drinking tea must be the same as the music genre of the writer. Since the writer's music genre is not given, we cannot determine the music genre of the person drinking tea.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since iced-tea is in position 1, the music genre of the person drinking iced-tea must be the same as the music genre of the person drinking tea. Since we cannot determine the music genre of the person drinking tea, we cannot determine the music genre of the person drinking iced-tea either.

The final solution table with the missing information:

We have determined the positions of the people, their hobbies, jobs, and beverages, but we cannot determine their music genres due to the missing information in the puzzle."
Lv11-4x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, the owner of the goat is the Australian. Let's place the Australian in the 3rd column and the goat in the 3rd row.

2. From rule 15, the Pakistani is not to the left of the Australian. So, the Pakistani must be in the 4th or 5th column.

3. From rule 18, the British is somewhere to the right of the Australian. So, the British must be in the 4th or 5th row and to the right of the 3rd row (Australian).

4. From rule 19 and 20, the Pakistani is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the Australian is not the snowboarder (from rule 4), the snowboarder must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 4th column. But the snowboarder can't be in the 1st column because the Pakistani is there (from rule 15), so the snowboarder must be in the 2nd or 4th column.

5. From rule 16, the Colombian is not the owner of the fish and the owner of the fish is not the fan of salsa. Since the Colombian can't be in the 3rd column (because the goat is there), the Colombian must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 5th column. But the Colombian can't be in the 1st column because the fish can't be there (from rule 2), so the Colombian must be in the 2nd or 5th column.

6. From rule 10, the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the Colombian. So, the goldfish must be in the 1st or 2nd row.

7. From rule 21, the Colombian is on the left of the owner of the fish. So, the fish must be in the 2nd or 3rd column.

8. From rule 22, the fan of salsa and the Pakistani have the same parity positions. Since the Pakistani is in an even position (2nd or 4th), the fan of salsa must also be in an even position. So, the fan of salsa can't be in the 1st or 3rd column.

9. From rule 6, the fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa. So, the fan of funk must be in the 1st or 2nd column.

15. From rule 5, the person who's sport is rowing is the Australian or the person who's sport is rowing is the owner of the goat or both. Since the Australian is the owner of the goat, the rowing must be the Australian. So, the rowing is in the 3rd row and the Australian in the 3rd column.

16. From rule 9, the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret is in the 1st or 2nd row, the surfing must be in the 1st row.

17. From rule 23, the fan of classical is the person who's sport is rowing or the Pakistani is the fan of classical or both. Since the rowing is the Australian (from rule 15), the fan of classical must be the Pakistani or the Pakistani is the fan of classical. But the Pakistani is already assigned (from rule 2), so the fan of classical must be the Pakistani. So, the classical must be in the 4th or 5th row and the Pakistani in the 4th or 5th column.

18. From rule 16, the Colombian is not the owner of the fish and the owner of the fish is not the fan of salsa. Since the Colombian is in the 2nd column, the fish must be in the 1st column and the fan of salsa in the 5th column.

19. From rule 7, the fan of funk is in the middle. So, the fan of funk is in the 2nd row.

Lv11-4x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the Argentine owns the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is to the left of the cat (rule 5), the cat cannot be in the first position.

2. From rule 19, we know that the Russian and the owner of the cat have different parities. Since the cat is not in the first position (rule 1), the Russian cannot be in the first position either.

3. From rule 4, we know that the owner of the fish is not to the left of the person driving the tram. Since the Argentine owns the chinchilla (rule 10), the Argentine cannot be the tram driver. So, the tram driver must be the Egyptian (rule 13).

4. From rule 15, we know that the tram driver is in an even position. Since the Egyptian is the tram driver, the Egyptian is in the second position.

5. From rule 12, we know that the Australian drives the subway. Since the subway driver is to the right of the Italian (rule 16), the Italian cannot be in the first position.

6. From rule 2, we know that the Italian is to the right of the rock-climber. Since the Egyptian is in the second position (rule 4), the Italian cannot be in the third position. So, the Italian must be in the fourth position.

7. From rule 7, we know that the tram driver (Egyptian) and the person who's hobby is drawing have different parities. Since the Egyptian is in the second position (even), the person who's hobby is drawing must be in an odd position.

8. From rule 18, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is not the person driving the subway (Australian). Since the Australian is in the fifth position (rule 12), the person who's hobby is photography must be in an odd position and cannot be in the first position (since the Italian is in the fourth position). So, the person who's hobby is photography must be in the third position.

9. From rule 11, we know that the person who's hobby is photography and the owner of the horse have different parities. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in the third position (odd), the owner of the horse must be in an even position.

10. From rule 5, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the Argentine owns the chinchilla (rule 10), the Argentine cannot be in the last position. So, the Argentine must be in one of the first four positions.

11. From rule 20, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the Argentine owns the chinchilla (rule 10), the Argentine cannot be in the second position (since the Egyptian is there). So, the Argentine must be in the first position, and the pony owner must be in the third or fourth position.

12. From rule 21, we know that the rock-climber is not to the left of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in the first position, the rock-climber cannot be in the second position (since the Italian is there). So, the rock-climber must be in the fifth position.

13. From rule 22, we know that the owner of the fish is the Russian or the person driving the subway is the owner of the fish or both. Since the Egyptian is the tram driver (rule 4), the subway driver cannot be the Russian (rule 22). So, the owner of the fish must be the Russian.

14. From rule 24, we know that the Russian is not to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the Egyptian is in the second position (rule 4), the Russian cannot be in the first position. So, the Russian must be in the third position.

15. From rule 25, we know that the owner of the fish is on the far left or far right. Since the Russian is the owner of the fish (rule 23) and the Egyptian is in the second position (rule 4), the owner of the fish must be in the first position.

16. From rule 26, we know that the owner of the fish is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the fish is in the first position, the owner of the fish is on the far left.

17. From rule 27, we know that the Italian is between the rock-climber and the traveler. Since the rock-climber is in the fifth position and the Italian is in the fourth position, the traveler must be in the sixth position.

18. From rule 3, we know that the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is filmmaking have different parities. Since the Egyptian is in the second position (even), the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in an odd position. Since the Argentine is in the first position (odd), the person who's hobby is filmmaking cannot be in the first position. So, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the third position.

19. From rule 8, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the fourth position, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the third position.

20. From rule 9, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the fish is in the first position and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in the third position, the owner of the horse must be in the fifth position.

21. From rule 1, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the Argentine owns the chinchilla (rule 10) and the cat is not in the first position (since the Argentine is there), the cat must be in the second position.

22. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parities. Since the Argentine owns the chinchilla (rule 10) and the Argentine is in the first position (odd), the person who's hobby is drawing must be in an odd position. Since the Italian is in the fourth position (even), the person who's hobby is drawing cannot be in the fourth position. So, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in the third position.

23. From rule 13, we know that the Egyptian is the person driving the tram or the Egyptian is the owner of the horse, but not both. Since the Egyptian is the tram driver (rule 4), the Egyptian cannot be the horse owner. So, the horse owner must be the Russian.

24. From rule 6, we know that the argentine is the owner of the pony or the person driving the van is the argentine or both. Since the Argentine is in the first position (rule 10), the Argentine is the owner of the pony.

25. From rule 2, we know that the Italian is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the Italian is in the fourth position and the rock-climber is in the fifth position, the traveler must be in the sixth position.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv11-4x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, we know that the teacher and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions. Since there are 5 positions, the teacher can't be in position 1 or 5 (odd positions), so the teacher is in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. The manager is somewhere between the fan disco and the person driving the boat, so the manager can't be in position 1 or 5 either. The manager can't be in position 2 because the teacher is there, so the manager is in position 3, 4, or 5. Since the manager and the fan disco have different parity positions (rule 6), the manager can't be in position 4 (even). So, the manager is in position 3 (odd). This means the person driving the boat is in position 1 (odd).

2. The teacher is on the left of the person driving the motorbike, so the teacher can't be in position 5. The teacher is also not to the left of the fan disco (rule 9), so the teacher can't be in position 3. The teacher is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (rule 25), so the teacher can't be in position 4. Therefore, the teacher is in position 2.

3. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the teacher (rule 22), so the person driving the motorbike is in position 3, 4, or 5. The fan salsa is the person driving the motorbike or the person watching romance movies is the fan salsa (rule 21), so the person watching romance movies is in position 1, 2, or 6. Since the fan salsa can't be in position 1 (because the teacher is there), the fan salsa is in position 2 or 6. But the fan salsa can't be in position 6 because the teacher is in position 2. So, the fan salsa is in position 2, and the person watching romance movies is in position 5.

4. The journalist is somewhere to the right of the person watching crime movies (rule 5), so the journalist can't be in position 1 or 2. The journalist is also not to the left of the project-manager (rule 17), so the journalist can't be in position 4. Therefore, the journalist is in position 3 or 5. Since the journalist can't be in position 3 (because the manager is there), the journalist is in position 5.

5. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the manager (rule 12), so the person watching family movies is in position 4 or 5. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies (rule 19), so the person driving the jet-ski is in position 5 or 6. Since the fan electronic is in an odd position (rule 13), the person driving the jet-ski can't be in position 5 (even). Therefore, the person driving the jet-ski is in position 6, and the person watching family movies is in position 4.

6. The fan rock is somewhere to the left of the person watching crime movies (rule 11), so the fan rock is in position 1, 2, or 3. The person driving the van is the fan rock (rule 10), so the person driving the van is in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the journalist is the person driving the boat or the journalist is the person watching romance movies, but not both (rule 24), the journalist can't be in position 1 (because the person driving the van is there). Therefore, the journalist is in position 2 or 3. But the journalist can't be in position 3 (because the manager is there), so the journalist is in position 2. This means the person driving the van is in position 1.

7. The person driving the ship is the fan ambient (rule 16), so the person driving the ship is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. The person driving the ship is on the left of the fan disco (rule 9), so the person driving the ship can't be in position 2 (because the fan disco is in position 2). The person driving the ship is also on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies (rule 14), so the person driving the ship can't be in position 4 (because the person watching disaster movies is in position 2). Therefore, the person driving the ship is in position 1.

8. The nurse is on the left or right of the person driving the ship (rule 27), so the nurse is in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The nurse is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (rule 25), so the nurse can't be in position 2. The nurse is also not to the left of the person watching family movies (rule 26), so the nurse can't be in position 4. Therefore, the nurse is in position 3 or 5. Since the nurse can't be in position 3 (because the manager is there), the nurse is in position 5.

9. The person watching crime movies is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the journalist is to the right of the person watching crime movies (rule 5), the person watching crime movies is not in position 1 (because the journalist is in position 2). Since the teacher is not to the left of the person watching disaster movies (rule 25), the person watching crime movies is not in position 4 (because the teacher is in position 2). Therefore, the person watching crime movies is in position 3.

10. The person watching disaster movies is in position 2 (because the teacher is in position 2 and to the left of the person watching disaster movies).

11. The fan disco is not to the left of the person watching crime movies (rule 15), so the fan disco is in position 4 or 5. Since the fan disco and the manager have different parity positions (rule 6), the fan disco can't be in position 4 (because the manager is in position 3). Therefore, the fan disco is in position 5.

12. The person watching romance movies is in position 5.

13. The fan electronic is in position 3.

14. The person watching family movies is in position 4.

15. The person driving the jet-ski is in position 6.

16. The person driving the motorbike is in position 3.

17. The project-manager is in position 1 (because the journalist is to the left or right of the project-manager and the journalist is in position 2).

18. The teacher is the person driving the ship (because the teacher is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies and the person watching family movies is in position 4).

Here is the final solution table:

|               |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4    |    5    |
| Job           | project-manager | teacher (driving ship) | fan disco | person watching romance movies | fan electronic |

   The table is incomplete because the movie-genre, music-genre, and transport are not specified. However, we have determined the jobs for each person."
Lv11-4x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the first position, 5 being the last).

2. From rule 1, the person drinking sprite (S) is to the left of the person playing cricket (C). So, S can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since the mechanic (M) is in an even position (rule 2), M can only be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the nurse (N) is not to the right of M. So, N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

4. From rule 4, the social-worker (SW) is on the left or right of N. If SW is to the right of N, then SW can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. If SW is to the left of N, then SW can only be in positions 1, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 5, the person playing surfing (Sf) is to the left of the person watching spy movies (Sm). Since Sf can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, Sm can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

6. From rule 6, Sm is between the person watching crime movies (Cr) and the librarian (L). Since Cr can't be in position 1 (because S is to the left of C), Cr can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since L is the person drinking milk (Ml) (rule 13), L can only be in position 5. So, Cr can only be in positions 2 or 3.

7. From rule 7, SW is in the middle, so SW can only be in position 3.

8. From rule 8, S is to the left of C. Since S can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, C can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

9. From rule 9, M is to the right of the person playing swimming (Sw). Since Sw can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, M can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5.

10. From rule 10, the person drinking water (W) is the doctor (D) or the person watching epic movies (Em) is W or both. Since D can't be to the right of the person watching mystery movies (rule 22), D can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3. If D is in position 1, then Em must be in position 5, and W can be in any position. If D is in position 2, then Em can be in position 4, and W can be in any position except 2. If D is in position 3, then Em can be in position 3, and W can be in any position except 3.

11. From rule 11, C is to the right of Cr. So, C can only be in positions 3 or 4.

12. From rule 12, N is to the left of Sf. So, N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

13. From rule 14, the person drinking soy-milk (Smk) is to the left of the person playing basketball (Bb). Since Smk can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, Bb can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

14. From rule 15, the mechanic (M) is to the right of the person watching disaster movies (Dm). Since M can only be in positions 2, 3, or 5, Dm can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

15. From rule 16, W is not to the right of Bb. So, W can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

16. From rule 17, the person drinking milk (Ml) is not the doctor (D). So, D can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

17. From rule 18, Sm is in an even position. Since Sm can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4, Sm must be in position 2 or 4.

18. From rule 19, Em is to the left of S. Since S can only be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4, Em can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

19. From rule 20, W and N have the same parity positions. Since W can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3, N can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

20. From rule 21, Sm is not to the left of N. So, Sm can't be in position 2.

21. From rule 22, D is not to the right of the person watching mystery movies (Myst). Since Myst can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4, D can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

22. From rule 23, N is not to the right of M. So, N can't be in position 5.

23. From rule 24, Bb is to the left of Sf. So, Bb can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

24. From rule 25, N is not the person drinking milk (Ml). So, Ml can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's check the remaining rules:

25. The person watching spy movies (Sm) is in an even position (rule 18), so Sm is in position 4.
26. The person watching crime movies (Cr) is to the right of the person watching mystery movies (Myst) (rule 22), so Cr is in position 3.
27. The person playing cricket (C) is to the right of Cr (rule 11), so C is in position 4.
28. The person playing basketball (Bb) is to the left of Sf (rule 12), so Bb is in position 1.
29. The person playing surfing (Sf) is to the right of Sm (rule 5), so Sf is in position 2.
30. The person watching disaster movies (Dm) is to the right of M (rule 15), so Dm is in position 1.
31. The person watching epic movies (Em) is to the left of S (rule 19), so Em is in position 1.
32. The person drinking water (W) is the doctor (D) or the person watching epic movies is W or both (rule 10). Since D can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3, and Em is in position 1, W must be in position 3.
33. The person drinking soy-milk (Smk) is to the left of Bb (rule 14), so Smk is in position 1.
34. The person drinking milk (Ml) is the librarian (L) (rule 13), so Ml is in position 5.
35. The nurse (N) is not to the right of M (rule 23), so N is in position 2.
36. The mechanic (M) is to the right of Sw (rule 9), so M is in position 5.
37. The social-worker (SW) is to the left of N (rule 4), so SW is in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2      |       3       |    4     |     5     |
| Beverage      | soy-milk | milk      | water        | sprite   | cricket   |
| Job           | social-worker | nurse   | doctor     | mechanic  | librarian |
