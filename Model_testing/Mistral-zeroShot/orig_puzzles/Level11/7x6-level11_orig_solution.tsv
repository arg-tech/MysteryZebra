Lv11-7x6-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires careful analysis of the given clues. Here's a step-by-step solution:

Step 1: Identify the variables
We have 6 variables for each category: Beverage, Food, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, and Pet. We also have 6 positions for each category.

Step 2: Assign initial values
Since we don't have any specific clues about the initial values, we can assign any value to the first variable in each category. For simplicity, let's assign the first beverage as 7up, the first food as artichoke, the first job as bartender, the first movie-genre as drama, the first music-genre as ambient, and the first pet as chinchilla.

Step 3: Analyze the clues
Go through each clue and try to find relationships between the variables. For example, from clue 1, we know that the person eating pomegranate is to the left of the person watching spy movies. This means that pomegranate cannot be in the first position (since artichoke is there), so it must be in the second position or later.

Step 4: Eliminate impossible positions
For each variable, use the clues to eliminate impossible positions. For example, from clue 5, we know that the bartender and the person watching drama movies have different parity positions. Since the bartender is in the first position (assigned in step 2), the person watching drama movies cannot be in the first position.

Step 5: Assign values based on the eliminated positions
Once you've eliminated some positions for a variable, you can assign the remaining possible values to those positions. For example, since pomegranate cannot be in the first position, it must be in the second position. Since it's not the first food, it must be grapes, kiwi, tomato, or watermelon. Since it's not to the right of the person watching epic movies (clue 7), it cannot be watermelon. So, pomegranate is either grapes, kiwi, or tomato.

Step 6: Repeat the process
Continue this process for all variables and clues. You may need to revisit clues as you assign values to variables, as new relationships may become apparent.

Step 7: Check for consistency
Once you've assigned values to all variables, check that there are no contradictions. If there are, go back and recheck your work.

Step 8: Final solution
Once you've confirmed that there are no contradictions, the final solution is the table with the assigned values for each variable.

Here's the final solution:

| Food          | Artichoke   | Pomegranate| Kiwi       | Tomato        | Watermelon   | Grapes       |

Since the hamster owner is in position 5, the car driver cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, or 9 (rules 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 14, 17, 22, 24, 29, 33, 34, 37, 38, 40, 41, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49). The only remaining position for the car driver is position 8.

Step 55:
- From rule 55, we know that the russian is not the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard driver is the dressmaker in position 2, the russian cannot be in position 2.

Step 56:
- From rule 56, we know that the owner of the dog is somewhere between the software-developer and the owner of the pony. Since the software-developer is in position 7 and the pony owner is in position 1, the dog owner cannot be in position 1 or 7. Let's place the dog owner in position 6.

Step 57:
- From rule 57, we know that the freelancer and the person watching mystery movies have different parity positions. Since the freelancer is in position 3 and the mystery watcher is in position 1, the freelancer must be in an odd position and the mystery watcher must be in an even position. Since the only even positions left are 2, 4, 6, and 8, the mystery watcher must be in position 4.

Now that we have placed all the people in their positions, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |         5          |     6      |
| Hobby         | drawing  |   camping   | woodworking |   photography|   martial-arts   |   climbing  |
| Job           | electrician| dressmaker  | software-developer| nurse      |   dancer         |   freelancer|
| Movie-Genre   | mystery  |   romance  |   drama      |   disaster  |   martial-arts   |   zombie    |
| Nationality   | russian  |   pakistani |   american   |   australian|   polish         |   chinese   |
| Pet           | horse    |   pony      |   dog        |   hamster    |   rabbit         |   rat       |

Lv11-7x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. I'll provide the solution in several parts.

First, let's identify some initial conditions based on the given clues:

1. There are 6 people, so each category (Food, Hobby, Job, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport) has 6 unique items.
2. Each person is associated with one item from each category.
3. Each person is assigned a position from 1 to 6, and the clues provide information about the parity (even or odd) of each position.

Now, let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From clue 38, the electrician and the person driving the scooter have different parity positions. Since there are only 6 positions, the electrician must be in an odd position, and the scooter driver must be in an even position.

2. From clue 41, the fan electronic and the dutch have the same parity positions. Since the electrician is in an odd position, the dutch must be in an odd position as well.

3. From clue 40, the entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel. Since the dutch is in an odd position and the fan electronic is in an odd position, the fan gospel must be in an even position.

4. From clue 30, the person eating cherry is in an even position. Since the fan gospel is in an even position, the person eating cherry cannot be the fan gospel.

5. From clue 31, the person driving the ship and the person who's hobby is drawing have different parity positions. Since the scooter driver is in an even position, the person driving the ship must be in an odd position.

6. From clue 24, the owner of the rat is the pilot or the person driving the ship is the owner of the rat or both. Since the pilot is in an odd position (Malaysian is the pilot), the person driving the ship cannot be the owner of the rat. So, the owner of the rat is the pilot.

7. From clue 36, the malaysian is the pilot. So, the pilot is in position 5.

8. From clue 4, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the fisherman. Since the dutch is in an odd position and the fan electronic is in an odd position, the fisherman must be in an even position. Since the lizard is on the left of the fisherman, the lizard cannot be in position 6.

9. From clue 1, there are 6 different pets. Since the owner of the rat is the pilot (position 5), the owner of the lizard cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the owner of the lizard is in position 6.

11. From clue 35, the person driving the tram is not the person eating pepper. Since the fan gospel is in an even position and the pilot is in position 5, the person driving the tram cannot be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6. So, the person driving the tram is in position 5.

12. From clue 19, the owner of the frog is between the person driving the tram and the canadian. Since the tram driver is in position 5 and the canadian is in an odd position, the owner of the frog must be in position 4.

13. From clue 18, the owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the fan blues. Since the fan gospel is in an even position and the fan blues is not the person who's hobby is collecting (clue 15), the fan blues must be in an odd position.

21. From clue 39, the bartender and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since the bartender is in an odd position, the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1. So, the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2.

22. From clue 21, the owner of the bird is on the left of the person eating pepper. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 2, the owner of the bird cannot be in position 1.

Lv11-7x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it step by step can be quite challenging. Here's a simplified approach to solve the puzzle:

1. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the positions. Since the pakistani is not to the right of the electrician and the electrician is in an odd position, the pakistani must be in position 1, 3, or 5. The pakistani is also not to the right of the turkish, so the turkish cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the turkish is in position 6. Now, the pakistani must be in position 1, as the pakistani is also not to the right of the indian, and the indian is in an even position (position 4).

2. The indonesian is not to the right of the mechanic, so the mechanic cannot be in position 6. The mechanic is also not to the right of the fan electronic, so the mechanic cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the mechanic is in position 3. Now, the indonesian must be in position 5.

3. The nigerian is not to the left of the accountant, so the accountant cannot be in position 1. The accountant is also not to the right of the person drinking coffee, so the accountant cannot be in position 6. Let's assume the accountant is in position 2. Now, the nigerian must be in position 4.

4. The colombian is the person drinking hot-chocolate or the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person watching drama movies, but not both. Since the colombian is already assigned to position 6, the colombian cannot be the person drinking hot-chocolate. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, and the colombian is watching drama movies.

5. The person eating onion is not the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the person eating onion cannot be in position 1. The person eating onion is also not to the left of the person eating spinach, so the person eating onion cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the person eating onion is in position 3. Now, the person eating spinach must be in position 5.

6. The person eating cucumber is the person who's hobby is dancing. The person who's hobby is dancing is the accountant or the turkish is the person who's hobby is dancing, but not both. Since the accountant is already assigned to position 2, the turkish must be the person who's hobby is dancing. So, the person eating cucumber is the turkish.

7. The person eating grapefruit is the person who's hobby is hiking. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the fan trance, so the person eating grapefruit cannot be in position 6. Let's assume the person eating grapefruit is in position 4. Now, the fan trance must be in position 5.

8. The person eating peach is not to the left of the colombian, so the person eating peach cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. The person eating peach is also not to the left of the fan folk, so the person eating peach cannot be in position 2. Let's assume the person eating peach is in position 6. Now, the fan folk must be in position 2.

9. The person drinking tea is the turkish. The person drinking tea is in an even position, so the turkish is in position 4.

10. The person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the bartender. Since the bartender cannot be in position 1, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 3. Now, the bartender must be in position 5.

11. The person watching drama movies is in an even position. Since the colombian is already in position 6, the person watching drama movies must be in position 4.

12. The person drinking 7up is the person eating spinach or the person drinking 7up is the person watching adventure movies, but not both. Since the person watching adventure movies is already assigned, the person drinking 7up must be the person eating spinach.

13. The person watching superhero movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the person eating spinach is the person watching superhero movies, but not both. Since the person eating spinach is already assigned, the person watching superhero movies must be the person who's hobby is sudoku.

14. The person watching family movies is in an even position. Since the colombian is already in position 6, the person watching family movies must be in position 4.

15. The person watching horror movies is in an odd position. Since the electrician is already in position 3, the person watching horror movies must be in position 5.

16. The person watching satire movies is not to the left of the fan r&b. Since the fan r&b is already assigned to the nigerian, the person watching satire movies must be in position 6.

17. The person watching action movies is not to the left of the fan metal. Since the designer is already the person who's hobby is traveling, the person watching action movies must be the fan metal.

Now, let's fill in the table with the assigned values:

|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |      4      |      5      |       6       |

Lv11-7x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Let's start by assigning the people to their respective categories. We'll use numbers 1-6 for the people, and we'll assign them to their categories based on the given clues. For example, we know that the person drinking water is on the far left (11), so Person 1 must be drinking water.

2. We can use the parity positions clues (even or odd positions) to help us place people in certain positions. For example, if we know that Person 3 and Person 5 have the same parity positions, and we know that Person 1 is on the far left (11), then Person 3 and Person 5 cannot be the first two people.

3. We can also use the ""not to the left of"" and ""not to the right of"" clues to eliminate certain combinations. For example, if we know that Person 3 (who drinks 7up) is not to the left of Person 5 (who has the hobby of drawing), then Person 3 cannot be the first three people.

4. We can use the ""somewhere to the left of"" and ""somewhere to the right of"" clues to place people in certain positions. For example, if we know that Person 5 (who has the hobby of skydiving) is somewhere to the left of Person 6 (who has the hobby of camping), then Person 5 cannot be the last person.

5. We can use the ""between"" clue to place people in specific positions. For example, if we know that Person 2 (who's sport is volleyball) is between Person 3 (who's hobby is skydiving) and Person 4 (who's hobby is camping), then Person 2 cannot be the first or last person.

6. We can use the ""or"" clues to make multiple assignments. For example, if we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming or the person watching sports movies is the person who's sport is swimming, then we can assign the person who's sport is swimming to either the iced-tea or the sports movies category, and the person watching sports movies can be someone else.

7. We can use the ""not both"" clause to eliminate certain combinations. For example, if we know that the firefighter is the person who's sport is swimming or the firefighter is the person who's hobby is writing, but not both, then the firefighter cannot be the person who's hobby is writing.

8. We can use the ""is the person"" clues to make direct assignments. For example, if we know that the person drinking milk is the person watching comedy movies or the person watching comedy movies is the fan electronic, then we can assign the person watching comedy movies to the milk category or the fan electronic category, and the other category can be filled later.

9. We can use the ""is on the far left or far right"" clue to place people at the extreme ends of the table. For example, if we know that the photographer is on the far left or far right, then the photographer cannot be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

10. We can use the ""is not"" clues to eliminate certain options. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not the freelancer, then the freelancer cannot have the hobby of cooking.

11. We can use the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to further narrow down the possibilities. For example, if we know that the firefighter is somewhere to the left of the fan trance, then the firefighter cannot be in positions 6 or 7.

12. We can use the ""is not to the left of"" and ""is not to the right of"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that Person 3 (who drinks 7up) is not to the left of Person 5 (who has the hobby of drawing), and we also know that Person 3 is not the first person, then Person 3 must be in position 2 or 4.

13. We can use the ""is between"" clue in combination with the ""is not to the left of"" and ""is not to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that Person 2 (who's sport is volleyball) is between Person 3 (who's hobby is skydiving) and Person 4 (who's hobby is camping), and we also know that Person 3 is not to the right of Person 5 (who has the hobby of drawing), then Person 2 must be in position 3.

14. We can use the ""has different parity positions"" clues to place people in positions that have different parity. For example, if we know that the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's hobby is filmmaking have different parity positions, and we also know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming, then the person who's hobby is filmmaking cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

15. We can use the ""is the person who's sport is volleyball is not the person watching sports movies"" clue to eliminate combinations. For example, if we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is not the person watching sports movies, then the person watching sports movies cannot be in positions 2, 3, or 4, because those are the only positions where the person who's sport is volleyball can be.

16. We can use the ""is the person who's hobby is cooking is the person watching disaster movies or the person watching disaster movies is the person drinking coffee or both"" clue to make multiple assignments. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is the person watching disaster movies or the person watching disaster movies is the person drinking coffee, then we can assign the person watching disaster movies to the hobby of cooking or the beverage of coffee, and the other category can be filled later.

17. We can use the ""is not to the right of"" and ""is not to the left of"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that Person 3 (who drinks 7up) is not to the left of Person 5 (who has the hobby of drawing), and we also know that Person 3 is not the first person, and we also know that Person 3 is not to the right of Person 6 (who has the hobby of camping), then Person 3 must be in position 4.

18. We can use the ""is not"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not the freelancer, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the photographer, then the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in positions 5 or 6.

19. We can use the ""is not to the right of"" and ""is not to the left of"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that Person 3 (who drinks 7up) is not to the left of Person 5 (who has the hobby of drawing), and we also know that Person 3 is not the first person, and we also know that Person 3 is not to the right of Person 6 (who has the hobby of camping), and we also know that Person 3 is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking, then Person 3 must be in position 4.

20. We can use the ""is not"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not the freelancer, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the photographer, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball, then the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in positions 5 or 6.

21. We can use the ""is not"" clues in combination with the ""is somewhere to the left of"" and ""is somewhere to the right of"" clues to make more specific assignments. For example, if we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not the freelancer, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the photographer, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball, and we also know that the person who's hobby is cooking is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming, then the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 1.

22. We can use the ""is the person who's sport is volleyball is the person drinking milk or the entrepreneur is the person who's sport is volleyball"" clue to make multiple assignments. For example, if we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is the person drinking milk or the entrepreneur is the person who's sport is volleyball, then we can assign the person who's sport is volleyball to the beverage of milk or the job of entrepreneur, and the other category can be filled later.

Lv11-7x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and solving it requires a systematic approach. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each category and person. For example, we can use B1, B2, B3, ... for beverages, F1, F2, F3, ... for food, H1, H2, H3, ... for hobbies, J1, J2, J3, ... for jobs, M1, M2, M3, ... for movie-genres, N1, N2, N3, ... for nationalities, and T1, T2, T3, ... for transport.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 22 and 29, we know that the French is either F1 or F2. From rule 31, the person who's hobby is drawing is to the right of the French. So, if the French is F1, then H1 must be drawing. If the French is F2, then H2 must be drawing.

3. From rule 37, the person eating tomato (T1) is not to the right of the person watching spy movies (M3). Since M3 is either M1 or M2, T1 must be T2 or T3.

4. From rule 38, the person driving the boat (T4) and the person who's hobby is card-games (H4) have different parity positions. Since H4 is either H1, H2, H3, or H5, T4 must be T1, T3, or T5.

5. From rule 48, the person who's hobby is woodworking (H6) is on the right of the person driving the boat (T4). So, T4 cannot be T1 or T3 (because H1 and H3 are to the left of H6). Therefore, T4 must be T5.

6. From rule 41, the person eating apple (F4) is not the Malaysian (N3). Since N3 is either F2 or F3, F4 must be F1, F5, or F6.

7. From rule 43, the person eating nectarine (F5) is on the left or right of the person driving the train (T6). Since T6 cannot be T1 or T3 (because H4 is to the left of H6), T6 must be T2 or T4. If T6 is T2, then F5 is to the left of F4. If T6 is T4, then F5 is to the right of F4.

8. From rule 44, the person driving the quad-bike (T7) is somewhere to the right of the British (N1). Since N1 is either F1, F2, or F3, T7 must be T5, T6, or T7.

9. From rule 46, the person driving the quad-bike (T7) is not to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (H4). So, T7 cannot be T6. Therefore, T7 must be T5.
