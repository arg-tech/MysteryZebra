Lv6-6x2-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 jobs, 2 movie-genres, 2 music-genres, 2 pets, and 2 sports. Let's assign variables to each category:

   - Beverage: A (7up), B (hot-chocolate)
   - Job: C (fisherman), D (journalist)
   - Movie-Genre: E (comedy), F (documentary)
   - Music-Genre: G (metal), H (pop)
   - Pet: I (ferret), J (horse)
   - Sport: K (basketball), L (sailing)

2. From rule 1, we know that A and B are different, so they can't be in the same row.
3. From rule 2, the person watching documentary movies (F) is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (L). This means F and L must be in different columns and L must be to the right of F. Let's say F is in column 1 and L is in column 2.
4. From rule 3, the owner of the horse (J) is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball (K). Since we already placed L to the right of F, K can't be in column 2. So, K must be in column 1 or column 3. If K is in column 1, J must be in column 2. If K is in column 3, J can be in either column 1 or 2. Let's assume K is in column 1 for now.
5. From rule 4, the fisherman (C) is on the right of the fan of pop (H). Since we already placed F and K in column 1 and L in column 2, C can't be in column 1 or 2. So, C must be in column 3.
6. Now, we know that C (fisherman) is in column 3, K (basketball) is in column 1, and L (sailing) is in column 2. Since C is in column 3, H (pop) must be in either column 1 or 2. Let's say H is in column 1.
7. Now, we have placed 4 categories: Beverage, Job, Movie-Genre, and Sport. The remaining categories are Music-Genre and Pet. Since we know that G (metal) and H (pop) are different, they can't be in the same row. Also, I (ferret) and J (horse) are different, so they can't be in the same row.
8. Let's place G (metal) in row 1 and I (ferret) in row 2. Now, the only remaining combination for row 2 is H (pop) and J (horse).

The final solution table is:

  |               |       1       |     2     |
  | Beverage      |  A (7up)      |  B (hot-chocolate) |
  | Job           |  C (fisherman) |  D (journalist) |
  | Movie-Genre   |  E (comedy)   |  F (documentary) |
  | Music-Genre   |  G (metal)    |  H (pop)        |
  | Pet           |  I (ferret)   |  J (horse)      |
  | Sport         |  K (basketball)|  L (sailing)    |

Lv6-6x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, music-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and means of transport. So, we can fill in the first row of the table with the different options for each category.

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |

2. From rule 1, the person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the fan house##3. Since there are only 2 positions, the skateboard must be on the left, and the fan house##3 must be on the right. So, we can fill in the second row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     |          |

3. From rule 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the fan dubstep##3. Since the fan dubstep##3 is on the right, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be on the left. So, we can fill in the first column:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     |          |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |

4. From rule 4, the fan dubstep is somewhere to the right of the turkish##5. Since the fan dubstep##3 is on the right, and the turkish is in the second column, the fan dubstep must be in the second row. So, we can fill in the third row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     | house     |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |
   | Music        | dubstep      | house     |

5. From rule 3, the person who's sport is soccer is not the owner of the guinea-pig##6. Since the sport is in the second row, the owner of the guinea-pig cannot be in the second row. So, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in the first row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     | house     |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |
   | Music        | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality  | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet          | guinea-pig   |          |

6. From rule 5, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog##5. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in the first row, the person who's sport is cricket must be in the first row as well. So, the person who's sport is soccer must be in the second row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     | house     |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |
   | Music        | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality  | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet          | guinea-pig   |          |
   | Sport        | cricket      | soccer    |

7. Now we have filled in all the categories except for the owner of the hedgehog and the transport. Since there are only 2 positions for the transport, the person using the trike must be on the left, and the person using the skateboard must be on the right. So, the person using the trike is the owner of the hedgehog:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     | house     |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |
   | Music        | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality  | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet          | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport        | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport    | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Owner        |            | hedgehog  |

8. Now we can fill in the last row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport         | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport     | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Fan          | house##3     | house     |
   | Drinks       | hot-chocolate|          |
   | Music        | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality  | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet          | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |
   | Sport        | cricket      | soccer    |
   | Transport    | skateboard   | trike     |
   | Owner        |            | hedgehog  |

So, the final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage      | hot-chocolate | lemonade  |
   | Music-Genre   | dubstep      | house     |
   | Nationality   | argentine    | turkish   |
   | Pet           | guinea-pig   | hedgehog  |

Lv6-6x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 2 people, so we can fill in the table with 2 rows.

2. From rule 3, the person with the hobby of chess drinks lemonade. Let's fill in the hobby and beverage for the first person as chess and almond-milk (since there's only one left).

3. From rule 1, the owner of the frog is to the left of the owner of the fish. Since there are only 2 people, the frog must be with the first person, and the fish with the second person.

Lv6-6x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two types of food, the person eating apricot must be in the first column (Column 1).

2. Similarly, since there are only two movie genres, the person watching documentary movies must be in the second row (Row 1). But we know that the person eating artichoke is not the one watching documentary movies (from clue 1.1), so the person eating apricot must be watching documentary movies.

3. Now, since there are only two music genres, the person listening to rock music must be in the second column (Column 2).

4. Since the fan of house music is on the right of the Argentine (clue 3), the Argentine must be in Column 1. So, the nationality in Column 2 is Malaysian.

5. Now, since the Malaysian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat (clue 4), the goat must be in Row 1 (Column 1) and the person owning the goat must be in Row 2 (Column 2).

6. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter (clue 2). Since we have already placed the person watching documentary movies, the person watching superhero movies must be in Row 1 (Column 2).

7. The only remaining option for the person watching superhero movies is to be driving the bike, as the helicopter is to the right of it (Row 2, Column 1).

8. The only remaining option for the person driving the helicopter is Row 2, Column 1, as it is to the right of the person driving the bike.

9. The only remaining option for the person owning the mouse is Row 1, Column 2, as it is to the left of the person driving the helicopter.

Lv6-6x2-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different types of food, 2 different hobbies, 2 different jobs, 2 different music-genres, 2 different nationalities, and 2 different sports, we can place one of each in each row.

2. From rule 3, we know that the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since there are only 2 positions for each category, the person eating orange cannot be in the first row (as there's no one to the right for the skiing position). So, the person eating orange is in the second row.

3. From rule 1, the first row must contain the other food, lettuce. So, the first row is [________, _______].

4. From rule 4, the Italian is to the left of the firefighter. Since the Italian cannot be in the second row (as there's no one to the left for the nationality position in the second row), the Italian must be in the first row. So, the first row is [Italian, _______].

5. From rule 5, the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the left of the fan of funk. Since the Italian is already in the first row and cannot be the person with the hobby of puzzles (from rule 2), the person with the hobby of puzzles must be in the second row. So, the second row is [_______, Puzzles].

6. From rule 3, the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is in the second row, the person eating orange must be in the first row. But we already placed the Italian in the first row, so the person eating orange must be on the right of the Italian. So, the first row is [Italian, Orange].

7. From rule 6, the person with the hobby of puzzles is not the person who eats lettuce. Since the person eating orange is the Italian, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be the one eating lettuce. So, the second row is [Lettuce, Puzzles].

8. From rule 1, the jobs are Entrepreneur and Firefighter. Since the Italian is in the first row and the person eating lettuce is in the second row, the job of the person in the first row must be Entrepreneur, and the job of the person in the second row must be Firefighter.

9. From rule 4, the Italian is to the left of the firefighter. Since the Italian is in the first row and the firefighter is in the second row, the nationality of the first row must be Egyptian, and the nationality of the second row must be Italian.

10. From rule 2, the person eating lettuce is not the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person eating lettuce is in the second row and the person with the hobby of puzzles is also in the second row, the hobby of the first row must be Skydiving, and the hobby of the second row must be Puzzles.

11. From rule 1, the music-genres are Funk and Techno. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is in the second row, the music-genre of the first row must be Techno, and the music-genre of the second row must be Funk.

12. From rule 3, the person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person with the hobby of puzzles is in the second row, the person eating orange must be in the first row. But we already placed the Italian in the first row, so the person eating orange must be on the right of the Italian. Since the person with the hobby of skydiving is in the first row, the sport of the second row must be Handball, and the sport of the first row must be Skiing.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x2-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, we can place the chinchilla owner in the first column and water-polo in the second column. So, the Sport column is: | -polo | baseball |

2. The person driving the car is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, so the car owner must be in the first column. Let's place the car owner in the first row, so the Transport column is: | car | bike |

3. The musician is in an odd position. Since we have already placed two elements in the first column, the musician must be in the second column. So, the Job column is: | freelancer | musician |

4. The person who's sport is water-polo is not the fan of punk, so the punk fan must be in the first row. Since the musician is in the second row, the Music-Genre column is: | ambient | punk |

5. The musician is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the musician is in the second row and the water drinker must be in the second column (as the chinchilla owner is in the first column), the musician can only be in the first column. However, we already placed the freelancer in the first column, so the musician must be in the second column. This means the Beverage column is: | sprite | water |

Final solution table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | sprite    | water     |

Lv6-6x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different types of food, hobbies, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6 for each category.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person who plays water-polo is either 2 or 5. Let's assume for now that it's 2 (we'll check later if it's 5).

3. From rule 2, the person who plays water-polo is either to the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. If the rabbit is 3, then water-polo can't be 2 (since it's to the right of the rabbit), so the rabbit must be 5.

4. From rule 3, the gospel fan is on the left or right of the person who sings. If the person who sings is 1, then gospel can't be 6 (since it's to the right of the singer), so the singer must be 6.

5. From rule 4, the person who sings is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the singer is 6 and the rabbit is 5, the singer can't be to the right of the rabbit, so the singer must be 1.

6. Now we know that the singer is 1 and the rabbit is 5. From rule 3, gospel must be 3 (since it's to the left of the singer).

7. From rule 4, the person who sings is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the singer is 1 and the rabbit is 5, the singer must be to the left of the rabbit. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Food          |            |            |
   | Hobby         |  Singing   |            |
   | Music-Genre   |  Gospel    |            |
   | Pet           |            |  Rabbit    |
   | Sport         |            |            |
   | Transport     |            |            |

8. From rule 5, the person who plays water-polo is not the person driving the roller. Since we assumed water-polo is 2, the driver can't be 2. Let's assume the driver is 3.

9. From rule 2, the person who plays water-polo is either to the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the driver is 3 and the rabbit is 5, water-polo must be 5.

10. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since water-polo is 5 and the rabbit is 5, this rule is satisfied.

11. We still need to assign the remaining categories: food, hobby, music-genre, pet (sport and transport are already assigned), and the remaining hobby and music-genre must be different from the ones we've already assigned. Let's assign them as follows:

   |               |     1      |     2      |
   | Food          |  Cherry    |  Lime      |
   | Hobby         |  Collecting|  Singing   |
   | Music-Genre   |  Pop      |  Gospel    |
   | Pet           |            |  Rabbit    |
   | Sport         |            |  Water-polo|
   | Transport     |            |  Car       |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that each person has two different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and means of transport. Since there are only six people, we can assign each category to a unique person.

2. From rule 3, the person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, let's assign Puzzles to the person who plays Handball.

3. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the manager. Since we know the person who plays Handball has puzzles as a hobby, we can place the Manager to the right of Handball.

4. From rule 5, the chef is the person watching crime movies. Since we have placed the Manager and Handball (with Puzzles), we can place the Chef watching Crime Movies to the left of Handball (with Puzzles).

5. Now we have three categories assigned: Crime Movies (Chef), Handball (Puzzles), and Manager. We know that the person who watches Crime Movies cannot be the person driving the scooter (from rule 1). So, the person driving the scooter cannot be the Chef.

6. Let's place the person driving the scooter in the remaining empty spot. Since the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the scooter (from rule 2), the only remaining spot for the trike is to the left of the Chef.

7. Now we have four categories assigned: Crime Movies (Chef), Handball (Puzzles), Manager, and the person driving the Trike. The remaining two categories are Movie-Genre (Western) and Music-Genre (Disco).

8. Since the person driving the trike is not the person watching Crime Movies, the person driving the trike cannot be the Chef. So, the person driving the trike must be watching Western movies, and the remaining person (with Disco as Music-Genre) must be watching Crime Movies.

9. The last category is Sport. Since we have already assigned Handball to the person with Puzzles as a hobby, the remaining sport must be Soccer.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |    1     |    2    |
| Hobby         | Crime    | Puzzles |
| Job           | Chef     | Manager  |

Lv6-6x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two people and they have 2 different hobbies, chess and sudoku, we can place them in the first and second columns respectively.

   | Pet           |         |        |
   | Transport     |         |        |

2. Since they have 2 different jobs, architect and teacher, we can place them in the first and second rows respectively.

   |               | Chess   | Sudoku |

   | Transport     |         |        |

3. Since they prefer 2 different movie-genres, documentary and romance, we can place them in the first and second columns respectively.

   |               | Chess   | Sudoku |
   | Hobby         | Architect| Teacher|

4. Since they prefer 2 different music-genres, d&b and jazz, we can place them in the first and second rows respectively.

   |               | Chess   | Sudoku |
   | Hobby         | Architect| Teacher|

5. The person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person watching documentary movies. Since there is only one documentary movie-genre, it must be the person watching romance movies. So, the sudoku hobbyist must be watching documentaries.

   |               | Chess   | Sudoku |

   | Transport     |         |        |

6. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since the only person watching romance movies is the sudoku hobbyist, the boat driver must be the architect (on the far right) or the teacher (on the left of the architect). But the architect prefers D&B music, and we know that the jazz fan is on the right of the turtle owner. So, the teacher must be driving the boat.

   | Transport     | Boat    |        |

7. The fan of jazz is on the right of the owner of the turtle. Since the teacher is driving the boat, the turtle owner must be the architect (on the far right) or the chess hobbyist (on the left of the architect). But the chess hobbyist prefers D&B music, and we know that the jazz fan is on the right of the turtle owner. So, the chess hobbyist must be the owner of the turtle.

   |               | Chess   | Sudoku |

   | Transport     | Boat    |        |

8. Now we have filled all the columns except for the pet and transport for the teacher. Since the teacher is not the owner of the turtle, the teacher must have the chinchilla as a pet. Since the architect is driving the boat, the teacher must be using the scooter.

Lv6-6x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different jobs (chef, librarian), and we know the chef is not the French, the librarian must be the French. So, the chef is Dutch.

2. The chef is on the far left, so the librarian (French) is in the second position.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the French. Since the librarian (French) is in the second position, the skydiving person must be in the first or third position. Let's assume the skydiving person is in the first position for now.

4. The person eating pineapple is on the far right. Since the librarian (French) is in the second position and the skydiving person is in the first position, the pineapple eater must be in the third position.

5. The person drinking tea is on the right of the fan of jazz. Since the librarian (French) likes jazz and is in the second position, the tea drinker must be in the third position (the only available position to the right of the French).

6. Now, we have only one position left (the first position), and we know it can't be the librarian (French) or the skydiving person. So, it must be the person who likes cooking and eats plum.
