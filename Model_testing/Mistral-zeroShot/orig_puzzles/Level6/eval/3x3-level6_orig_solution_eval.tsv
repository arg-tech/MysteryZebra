Lv6-3x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 types of food, 3 music-genres, and 3 nationalities, we can place one of each in the first row. Let's start with food:

   | Food  | Music-Genre | Nationality |
   |-------|------------|------------|
   | Kale  |            |            |
   | Pepper|            |            |
   | Plum  |            |            |

2. Now let's place the music-genres:

   | Food  | Music-Genre | Nationality |
   |-------|------------|------------|
   | Kale  | D&B        |            |
   | Pepper| Disco      |            |
   | Plum  | Techno     |            |

3. Now let's place the nationalities:

   | Food  | Music-Genre | Nationality |
   |-------|------------|------------|
   | Kale  | D&B        | British    |
   | Pepper| Disco      | French     |
   | Plum  | Techno     | Russian    |

4. Now let's apply the given conditions:

   - The person eating pepper is in an even position (4th position is even, so it's correct)
   - The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the British (correct)
   - The Russian is the fan of d&b (correct)
   - The fan of disco is on the far left (correct)
   - The french is not the fan of techno (correct)
   - The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of techno (the only possible arrangement is D&B-Disco-Techno, which is correct)

So the final solution table is:

#############
| Food  | Music-Genre | Nationality |
|-------|------------|------------|
| Kale  | D&B        | British    |
| Pepper| Disco      | French     |

Lv6-3x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the Dutch cannot own the rat. So, let's assign the nationalities first:
   - The British cannot be on the far left (5), so they can't own the goldfish. The Dutch can't own the rat, so the British must own the frog or the rat. Since the British can't be on the far left, they must own the rat. So, the nationalities are:
     - 1: British (Rat)
     - 2: Dutch (Not Rat)
     - 3: Polish (Not Rat)

2. Now, let's assign the sports. The British can't be on the far left (5), so they can't do swimming. The British do baseball (1), so the person who does basketball (2) can't be the Dutch (1). Therefore, the Dutch must do swimming, and the Polish must do basketball or baseball. Since the British are to the right of the Poles (6), the Polish can't do baseball (1). So, the sports are:
   - 1: British (Rat, Baseball)
   - 2: Dutch (Swimming)
   - 3: Poles (Basketball)

3. The goldfish must be on the far left (5), so it belongs to the Dutch (2).
   - 1: British (Rat, Baseball)
   - 2: Dutch (Swimming, Goldfish)
   - 3: Poles (Basketball)

4. The frog must be in an even position (4), so it belongs to the Poles (3).
   - 1: British (Rat, Baseball)
   - 2: Dutch (Swimming, Goldfish)
   - 3: Poles (Frog, Basketball)

So, the final solution table is:

```

|   British  | Dutch | Poles |
|   (Rat, Baseball) | (Swimming, Goldfish) | (Frog, Basketball) |

Lv6-3x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the jobs, music-genres, and sports are different for each person. So, we can fill in the first row (Job) with unique jobs (let's say B for bartender, F for firefighter, and V for videographer from left to right).

2. From point 1, we know that the videographer is on the right of the fan of blues. So, the music-genres can be filled as follows: B_ (blues), _D (dubstep), _P (punk) from left to right.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the firefighter and the bartender. Since the bartender is to the left of the firefighter, the weightlifter must be to the right of the firefighter. So, the sports can be filled as follows: B_W (weightlifting), _F (firefighter), _C (climbing) or _WB_ (weightlifting, bartender, firefighter), F_ (firefighter, climbing) or _WFB_ (weightlifting, firefighter, bartender), _C (climbing).

4. The fan of dubstep is not the videographer. From our current possibilities, the only place for dubstep that doesn't match this condition is _D. So, the music-genres should be B_D_, _P.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the videographer. Since the sports possibilities are B_W_, _F_, _C or _WB_, _F_, _C, and the videographer is on the right of the fan of blues (B_D_P), the only possible position for snowboarding is to the right of the videographer in all cases. So, the sports should be B_W_, _F_, _CS or B_W_, _FS, _C.

6. Now, we have only one possible arrangement for sports: B_W_, _F_, _CS. Since the bartender is to the left of the firefighter, the arrangement for jobs should be B, F, V.

7. Finally, since the fan of blues is to the left of the videographer, the arrangement for music-genres should be B (blues), D (dubstep), P (punk).

The final solution table is:

Lv6-3x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the fan of blues is either to the left or right of the person eating cabbage (C) and the person eating cabbage is the fan of R&B. So, the fan of blues cannot be R&B, which means it must be either cauliflower (F1) or watermelon (F3).

2. Since the lawyer (J2) is not the fan of blues (F1 or F3), the lawyer must be either eating cabbage (F2) or cauliflower (F1) or watermelon (F3).

3. The lawyer (J2) is to the right of the librarian (J3). This means the librarian cannot be in position 1 (since the lawyer can't be there), so the librarian must be either in position 2 (J2) or position 3 (J3).

4. If the librarian (J3) was in position 2, the lawyer (J2) would have to be the fan of blues (F1 or F3), which we know is not the case. So, the librarian (J3) must be in position 3.

5. Now we know the librarian (J3) is eating watermelon (F3) and the lawyer (J2) is not the fan of blues (F1 or F3), so the lawyer (J2) must be eating cauliflower (F1).

6. The fan of blues (F1) is to the left or right of the librarian (J3), but we already know the fan of blues is not the lawyer (J2), so the fan of blues must be in position 1.

7. The librarian (J3) is to the right of the social-worker (J1). Since the librarian (J3) is in position 3, the social-worker (J1) must be in position 1.

8. The fan of R&B (F2) is the person eating cabbage. Since we know the lawyer (J2) is eating cauliflower (F1) and the social-worker (J1) is eating cabbage (F2), the fan of R&B must be the person in position 3, which is the librarian (J3).

Lv6-3x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The hobby of rock-climbing is in an odd position, so it can't be in the middle (position 2). So, it must be either 1 or 3. Since the fan of folk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, and the hobby of rock-climbing is odd, the fan of folk can't be in position 1 (as it would make the hobby of rock-climbing even). So, the hobby of rock-climbing is in position 3.

2. The project-manager is not the fan of gospel, so the project-manager can't be in position 3 (as it would make the hobby of rock-climbing the project-manager, which we just determined is not possible). So, the project-manager is either 1 or 2.

3. The fan of gospel is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so the fan of gospel is in position 3.

4. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the hobby of rock-climbing (which we know is in position 3) is not reading, the only remaining hobby for the person in position 1 is reading. So, the hobby of the person in position 1 is reading. This also means the videographer must be in position 2.

5. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. Since we already know the hobbies of positions 1 and 3, the hobby of board-games must be in position 1.

6. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position, so it's in position 3. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer, so it's not in position 1 (as the hobby of board-games is already in position 1). So, the hobby of reading must be in position 2.

7. The only remaining hobby is for the person in position 3, which is folk.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |        1        |     2     |       3       |

| Music-Genre   |               | Gospel    | Rock          |

Now, let's fill in the jobs:

8. The project-manager is not the fan of gospel (which we know is in position 3), so the project-manager must be in position 1.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is not the project-manager (which we know is in position 1), so the person who's hobby is reading must be in position 2.

10. The only remaining job for the person in position 3 is videographer.

So, the final solution table with jobs is:

|               |        1        |     2     |       3       |

Lv6-3x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating onion is on the left of the person eating grapefruit, we can place the onion eater on the first column and the grapefruit eater on the second column. Let's place the onion eater in the first row and the grapefruit eater in the second row.

   | Food | 1   | 2   |
   |------|-----|-----|
   | Pet  |    |    |
   | Trans |    |    |

2. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion. Since the onion eater is in the first row, the jet-ski driver must be in the first row as well. Let's place the jet-ski driver in the first column.

   | Food | 1 (Onion) | 2 (Grapefruit) |
   |------|-----------|---------------|
   | Pet  |          |              |
   | Trans| 1 (Jet-ski)|             |

3. Now, the owner of the pony is in the middle. Since the onion eater and the jet-ski driver are already placed, the pony owner must be in the third row. The pony owner cannot eat lime (as the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime), so the pony owner can eat either grapefruit or onion. Let's place the pony owner eating onion in the third row and second column to maintain the left-to-right order from the chinchilla owner.

   | Food | 1 (Onion) | 2 (Grapefruit) | 3 (Onion) |
   |------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
   | Pet  |          |              |          |
   | Trans| 1 (Jet-ski)|             |          |

4. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the pony owner. The only available spot on the right of the pony owner is the third column in the second row. The chinchilla owner cannot eat lime (as the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime), so the chinchilla owner can eat either grapefruit or onion. Let's place the chinchilla owner eating grapefruit in the second row and third column.

   | Food | 1 (Onion) | 2 (Grapefruit) | 3 (Onion) |
   |------|-----------|---------------|-----------|
   | Pet  |          | 2 (Chinchilla) |          |
   | Trans| 1 (Jet-ski)|             |          |

5. The person driving the ship is not the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is in the third row, the ship driver cannot be in the third row. The only available spot for the ship driver is the first row. The ship driver cannot eat lime (as the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime), so the ship driver can eat either grapefruit or onion. Let's place the ship driver eating onion in the first row and first column.

6. The last pet, the goat, is left. The goat cannot eat lime (as the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime), so the goat can eat either grapefruit or onion. Let's place the goat eating grapefruit in the third row and first column.

   | Food | 1 (Onion) | 2 (Grapefruit) | 3 (Onion) |

Lv6-3x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the sport of swimming is in an odd position, it can only be in the 1st or 3rd position. Let's assume it's in the 1st position.

2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the librarian, so the goldfish can't be in the 1st position (as the librarian would be in the 3rd position, and we already have the swimming in the 1st position). So, the goldfish must be in the 3rd position.

3. The coach is on the right of the pilot. Since the swimming is in the 1st position, the coach can't be in the 1st position. If the coach were in the 3rd position, the pilot would have to be in the 2nd position, but then the goldfish (which is the owner of the swimming) would be in the 1st position, contradicting our first assumption. So, the coach must be in the 2nd position.

4. The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the goldfish is in the 3rd position, the rat must be in the 1st or 2nd position. If the rat were in the 1st position, the librarian (who is to the left of the goldfish) would have to be in the 3rd position, but then the coach (who is to the right of the pilot) would have to be in the 1st position, contradicting our third point. So, the rat must be in the 2nd position.

5. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the swimming is in the 1st position, the skateboarding can't be in the 1st position. If the skateboarding were in the 3rd position, the rabbit would have to be in the 2nd position, but then the rat (which is to the left of the rabbit) would be in the 1st position, contradicting our fourth point. So, the skateboarding must be in the 2nd position.

6. The owner of the rabbit is not the person who's sport is swimming. Since the swimming is in the 1st position, the rabbit can't be in the 1st or 3rd position. If the rabbit were in the 2nd position, the skateboarding (which is to the left of the rabbit) would be in the 1st position, contradicting our fifth point. So, the rabbit must be in the 3rd position.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv6-3x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right, they cannot be in the middle. So, the motorbike can only be in the first or third column.

2. This information doesn't provide any new constraints, as we don't know which food the person driving the motorbike is eating.

3. The person drinking cola is to the left of the person driving the motorbike. If the motorbike is in the first column, then cola must be in the second or third row. If the motorbike is in the third column, then cola must be in the first or second row.

4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking water. Since we don't know the position of water yet, this information doesn't provide any new constraints.

5. The person eating onion is not the person drinking cola. We already know the possible positions for cola from the previous step. So, onion cannot be in the same row as cola.

6. The person eating onion is not the person drinking fanta. This is similar to the previous rule, so onion cannot be in the same row as fanta.

7. The person eating onion is the person eating onion. This means that the onion must be in one of the three cells.

8. Since onion cannot be in the same row as cola or fanta, and it cannot be in the middle column (because the motorbike is not there), the only possible position for onion is in the first row.

9. Now we know that onion is in the first row, so the person driving the motorbike cannot be in the first row (because of rule 3). Therefore, the motorbike must be in the third row.

10. The person drinking cola is to the left of the person driving the motorbike, so cola must be in the second row.

11. The person drinking water cannot be in the first row (because onion is there), cannot be in the second row (because cola is there), and cannot be in the third row (because the person driving the quad-bike must be there, and water cannot be to the left of the person driving the quad-bike). So, water must be in the first row.

12. The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking water, so the quad-bike must be in the third column.

13. The person drinking fanta must be in the remaining cell, which is in the second column of the second row.

1. We know that the baking hobby cannot be in the first position (as it can't be the person watching adventure movies) and the sixth position (as it can't be the owner of the ferret). So, the baking hobby can only be in the second or third position.

2. Since the person watching action movies is in an even position, it can only be the second or fourth position. As the baking hobby can't be in the second position, the action movie-genre must be in the second position.

3. Now, we know that the board-games hobby is to the right of the hamster owner. As the hamster can't be in the first position (since the action movie-genre is in the second position), the hamster must be in the third position. So, the board-games hobby can only be in the fourth or sixth position.

4. The person watching disaster movies can't be the owner of the hamster, so the disaster movies can't be in the third position.

5. The owner of the ferret is in an even position, so the ferret can only be in the second or fourth position. But we already know that the action movie-genre is in the second position, so the ferret can't be there. Therefore, the ferret must be in the fourth position.

6. Now, the only remaining hobby for the fourth position is board-games. So, the board-games hobby is in the fourth position, and the hamster is in the third position.

7. The person watching disaster movies can't be the owner of the hamster, so it must be in the first position.

3. Now, the videographer is watching a movie genre to the right of the person eating watermelon (rule 1). Since there are only 3 genres, the person eating watermelon (person B) must be watching a genre to the left of the videographer (person A). So, person B is watching Adventure movies.

   | Job           | Videographer | Architect  | Doctor   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  | Crime      | Mystery  |

4. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (rule 3). Since person B is watching Adventure and person A is watching Crime, person B must be the architect and person A must be the doctor (since the doctor is not the person eating zucchini, rule 5).

   | Job           | Videographer | Doctor     | Architect |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure  | Crime      | Mystery  |

5. Now, the architect is on the left of the videographer (rule 4). So, person B (Architect) must be in the first position and person A (Videographer) in the second position.

   | Job           | Architect | Videographer | Doctor   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime     | Adventure  | Mystery  |

6. Finally, the person eating zucchini is not the videographer (rule 2), so person C must be eating Zucchini.

   | Job           | Architect | Videographer | Doctor   |
   | Movie-Genre   | Crime     | Adventure  | Mystery  |

So, the final solution table is:
