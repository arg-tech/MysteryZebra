Lv6-2x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the security-guard is in an odd position and the owner of the dog is in position 5 (which is an odd position), the security-guard cannot be the owner of the dog.

2. The owner of the frog is in the middle (position 3).

3. The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog, so it can't be in position 5. Also, the security-guard is to the left of the owner of the dog, so the owner of the pony can't be the security-guard. So, the owner of the pony is either in position 1 or 2.

4. The videographer is on the far left (position 1), and is not the owner of the turtle.

5. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony, so the owner of the turtle can't be in position 1 or 2.

6. The manager is on the left of the owner of the rabbit, so the manager can't be in position 5. Also, the manager is to the left of the owner of the pony, so the manager can't be in position 3. So, the manager can only be in position 2 or 4.

7. Since the security-guard is to the left of the designer and the manager is to the left of the owner of the rabbit, the security-guard can't be in position 2. So, the security-guard is in position 4.

8. The owner of the pony is either in position 1 or 2, but we know the videographer is in position 1. So, the owner of the pony is in position 2.

9. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony, so the owner of the turtle can't be in position 2. So, the owner of the turtle is in position 3.

10. The manager is in position 2, and the owner of the rabbit must be to the right of the manager. The only remaining positions are 4 and 5. Since the security-guard is to the left of the designer, the designer can't be in position 5. So, the owner of the rabbit is in position 4.

11. The only remaining job for position 5 is the designer.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, the person drinking cola is in an odd position. So, cola cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

2. From rule 6, the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking 7up. So, cola cannot be in position 5.

3. From rules 3 and 4, the person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is rugby. Since cola is not in position 5, 7up cannot be in position 1 either (as it would violate rule 6). So, 7up must be in position 3.

4. From rule 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk. So, hot-chocolate cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

5. From rule 1, the person who's sport is rowing is not the person drinking fanta. So, rowing cannot be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

6. From rule 7, the person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. So, rugby cannot be in positions 4 or 5.

7. From rule 9, the person who's sport is lacrosse is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is tennis. Since rugby is not in positions 4 or 5, lacrosse cannot be in position 5 either.

8. From rule 11, the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. So, lacrosse cannot be in position 1.

9. From rule 8, the person who's sport is tennis is not the person drinking cola. Since cola is not in positions 2, 4, or 6, tennis cannot be in position 2, 4, or 6 either.

10. From rule 10, the person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking milk. So, tennis is in position 1, and milk is in position 5.

11. Now we know that tennis is in position 1 and milk is in position 5. From rule 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk. So, hot-chocolate must be in position 4.

12. From rule 1, the person who's sport is rowing is not the person drinking fanta. Since rowing is not in positions 1, 3, or 5, and hot-chocolate is in position 4, fanta must be in position 2.

13. Finally, the only sport left is baseball. Since all other sports have been placed, baseball must be in position 3.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-2x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 1, we know that the fan of soul music is between the fan of rock and the fan of reggae. Let's assume the order is Rock-Soul-Reggae.
2. From point 2, the fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of classical music. Since the fan of soul is between rock and reggae, and we placed rock to the left of soul, the only possible position for classical music is to the left of rock. So, the order becomes Classical-Rock-Soul-Reggae.
3. From point 3, the fan of disco is the analyst. So, the analyst is in the 3rd position (since we have 5 jobs and 5 music genres).
4. From point 4, the project-manager is in an even position. Since we have 5 jobs, the project-manager can be either the 2nd or 4th job. But from point 8, the project-manager is not the fan of rock, so the project-manager cannot be in the 2nd position (Rock-Soul-Reggae). Therefore, the project-manager is in the 4th position.
5. From point 11, the fan of classical music is in an odd position. Since we have 5 jobs, the fan of classical music can be either the 1st or 3rd job. But from point 2, the fan of rock is to the left of classical music, so the fan of classical music cannot be in the 3rd position (Classical-Rock-Soul-Reggae). Therefore, the fan of classical music is in the 1st position.
6. From point 10, the fan of rock is the manager. So, the manager is in the 2nd position.
7. From point 5, the manager is on the left of the chef. Since the manager is in the 2nd position, the chef must be in the 5th position.
8. From point 6, the manager is on the left of the fan of soul. Since the manager is in the 2nd position, the fan of soul must be in the 4th position.
9. From point 9, the analyst is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the analyst is in the 3rd position, the fan of reggae must be in the 4th or 5th position. But from point 4, the project-manager is in the 4th position, so the fan of reggae must be in the 5th position.

Lv6-2x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The Italian is on the far left, so we can place the Italian in the first column. Let's assume the Italian prefers Handball (H). So, the first row will be:
   | Nationality   | Italian (H) |

2. The Argentine is between the Handball and Ice-Hockey players. Since the Italian is Handball, the Argentine can't be in the first row, so it must be in the second row. The Argentine can't prefer Handball (already taken), so the Argentine prefers Ice-Hockey (I). So, the second row will be:
   | Nationality   | Italian (H) | Argentine (I) |

3. The Mexican is in the middle, so it must be in the third row. The Mexican can't prefer Handball (already taken) or Ice-Hockey (taken by the Argentine), so the Mexican prefers Basketball (B). So, the third row will be:
   | Nationality   | Italian (H) | Argentine (I) | Mexican (B) |

4. The person who's sport is parkour is the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani can't be in the first three positions (taken by the Italian, Argentine, and Mexican), the Pakistani must be in the fourth row. The only sport left for the Pakistani is Sailing (S). So, the fourth row will be:
   | Nationality   | Italian (H) | Argentine (I) | Mexican (B) | Pakistani (S) |

5. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. This means the Argentine and the Mexican can't switch places, so the current arrangement is correct.

6. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. This condition is already satisfied.

7. The Italian is in an odd position. In our current arrangement, the Italian is in the first position, which is an odd position.

8. The person who's sport is handball is not the Italian. This condition is already satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 beverages and 5 nationalities, so each row and each column should have unique values.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking cola. Let's place them in columns 2 and 3, respectively, for now.

3. Rule 2 tells us the argentine is not the person drinking cola, so the argentine cannot be in column 1.

4. Rule 3 tells us the person drinking soy-milk is the turkish, and the turkish is to the right of the polish (rule 6). Since the lemonade is to the left of the turkish (rule 4), the turkish must be in column 4 or 5. However, rule 8 tells us the hot-chocolate is in an odd position, and the only odd positions left are columns 1 and 3. But if the hot-chocolate were in column 1, it would violate rule 7 (being to the left or right of the sprite). So, the hot-chocolate must be in column 3.

5. Now, the sprite must be in column 2, as it cannot be in column 3 (rule 7).

6. The person drinking cola cannot be in column 1 (rule 3), so it must be in column 4 or 5. But if it were in column 5, it would violate rule 9 (being to the left or right of the french). So, the person drinking cola is in column 4.

7. The french cannot be in column 1 (rule 3), so they must be in column 2 or 3. But if they were in column 2, it would violate rule 9. So, the french is in column 3.

8. The only remaining nationality is the polish, and the only remaining beverage is the lemonade (which we placed in column 2). So, the polish must be in column 1.

Here is the final solution table:

```

Lv6-2x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the lawyer has the guinea-pig, so we can place the lawyer in the fourth position (since the pet owner positions correspond to the job positions).

2. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in the fourth position, the chinchilla owner can be in the first or third position. Let's try the third position for now.

3. The designer is the designer, so we've filled that position.

4. The owner of the rat is not the musician, so the musician can't be in the first, third, or fifth positions. Let's try the second position for now.

5. The musician is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the bird will be in the middle (according to rule 6), the musician can't be in the first or third positions. So, the musician must be in the fifth position.

9. The owner of the horse is on the far left or far right. Since the pilot is in the first position, the horse can't be in the first position. So, the horse must be in the fifth position.

Lv6-2x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person eating pepper is not in the last position (5) because the person eating peach is in the first position (1). So, the possible positions for pepper are 1, 2, 3, or 4.

2. From rule 2, the person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating broccoli. Since broccoli can't be in position 5 (rule 10), the possible positions for broccoli are 1, 2, 3, or 4. If broccoli is in position 1, carrot can't be in position 5 (rule 10), so broccoli can't be in position 1. If broccoli is in position 2, carrot can be in position 5. If broccoli is in position 3, carrot can be in positions 4 or 5. If broccoli is in position 4, carrot can be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 3, the person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating peach. So, if broccoli is in position 2, carrot can't be in position 1. If broccoli is in position 3, carrot can't be in position 2. If broccoli is in position 4, carrot can't be in position 3. So, the only possible position for carrot is 5.

4. From rule 4, the russian is on the left or right of the argentine. Since the argentine is in an odd position (rule 8), the argentine can be in position 1, 3, or 5. If the argentine is in position 1, the russian can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. If the argentine is in position 3, the russian can be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. If the argentine is in position 5, the russian can be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.

5. From rule 5, the person eating banana is between the japanese and the person eating carrot. Since carrot is in position 5, the banana can't be in position 1 or 5. So, the banana can be in position 2 or 4. If the banana is in position 2, the japanese can't be in position 1 (rule 6) or position 5 (rule 10), so the japanese can be in position 3 or 4. If the banana is in position 4, the japanese can't be in position 1 (rule 6) or position 2 (rule 5), so the japanese can be in position 3 or 5.

6. From rule 6, the person eating banana is to the right of the person eating pepper. Since pepper can't be in position 5 (rule 1), the only possible position for pepper is 1.

7. From rule 7, the japanese is not the person eating peach. Since peach is in position 1 (rule 10), the japanese can't be in position 1. So, the japanese can be in position 3 or 5.

8. From rule 9, the polish is on the far right. Since the only food left is broccoli, and it can't be in position 5 (rule 10), the polish must be in position 5.

9. Now we know the nationalities: Argentine (position 3), Dutch (left of Russian, so position 2), Japanese (position 4), Polish (position 5), and Russian (right of Argentine, so position 1).

10. Finally, we know the foods: Banana (between Japanese and Carrot, so position 2), Broccoli (left of Dutch and Russian, so position 1), Carrot (position 5), Peach (position 1), and Pepper (position 3).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-2x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's hobby is baking is not the person who's sport is sailing (1). So, we can rule out the combination of baking and sailing in any position.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing (2). This means skateboarding must be in the first or second position, and drawing must be in the third, fourth, or fifth position.

3. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (3). Since sailing can't be in the first position (due to point 2), gardening must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position, and sailing must be in the position to its left.

4. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding (4). This means soccer can't be in the first, second, or third position.

5. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's sport is skateboarding (5). So, skateboarding must be in the first or second position.

6. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (6). This means ice-hockey can't be in the fifth position.

7. The person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is snowboarding and the person who's sport is soccer (7). Since soccer can't be in the first, second, or third position, and sailing can't be in the first position (due to point 2), sailing must be in the fourth position.

8. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking (8). This means drawing must be in the second, third, or fourth position, and baking must be in the first, fourth, or fifth position.

9. The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing (9). This means baking must be in the first position.

Now we have the following information:
- Skateboarding is in the first position.
- Baking is in the first position.
- Drawing is in the second, third, or fourth position.
- Gardening is in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position.
- Sailing is in the fourth position.
- Soccer is not in the first, second, or third position.
- Ice-hockey is not in the fifth position.

Since skateboarding is in the first position, drawing can't be in the second position (due to point 2). So, drawing must be in the third or fourth position. If drawing is in the third position, gardening must be in the second position (due to point 3). But this would mean gardening is to the left of sailing (due to point 9), which is not possible. So, drawing must be in the fourth position.

Now we know that gardening must be in the fifth position.

Since soccer can't be in the first, second, or third position, it must be in the fourth position.

This leaves the second position for sailing.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |       1       |     2      |      3       |      4       |     5     |

Lv6-2x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 movie genres and 5 pets, so each row and each column represents a unique combination of a movie genre and a pet.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching musical movies is not the owner of the turtle. This means the musical row cannot be the last row (since the last row represents the turtle).

3. From rule 2, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the right of the person watching action movies. This means the zombie row cannot be the first row (since the first row represents the bird, and we'll see why in a moment).

4. From rule 7, we know that the owner of the bird is watching spy movies. So, the bird row is the spy row. Since the musical row can't be the last row, the bird row must be the second row.

5. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the bird is between the owner of the rabbit and the owner of the pony. Since the bird row is the second row, the rabbit and pony rows must be the first and third rows, respectively.

6. From rule 5, we know that the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the pony row is the third row, the rabbit row must be the first row.

7. From rule 12, we know that the owner of the pony is to the right of the owner of the bird. So, the pony row is the third row and the rabbit row is the first row.

8. From rule 11, we know that the person watching action movies is in an even position. Since the rabbit and pony rows are already filled, the action movies must be in the fifth row.

9. From rule 9, we know that the owner of the horse is to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the rabbit is in the first row, the horse must be in the fourth row.

10. From rule 8, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the owner of the horse. So, the zombie row is the second row.

11. From rule 10, we know that the owner of the rabbit is to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the rabbit is in the first row, the romance movies must be in the fifth row.

12. Finally, the musical movies must be in the third row, as it's the only remaining row.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-2x5-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, we know that the person eating plum is between asparagus and cricket. Since asparagus is in an even position (rule 4), and the person eating plum cannot be the person who's sport is weightlifting (rule 3), the possible positions for plum are 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume plum is in position 2 for now.

2. From rule 1, the person eating orange is between snowboarding and kiwi. Since snowboarding is to the left of skiing (rule 2), and skiing is not on the left of nectarine (rule 6), the possible positions for orange are 1, 3, or 4. Let's assume orange is in position 1 for now.

3. From rule 5, cricket is on the right of weightlifting. Since plum is in position 2 and cannot be weightlifting (rule 3), cricket must be in position 5.

4. From rule 8, skateboarding is on the far right. Since cricket is in position 5, skateboarding must be in position 5. This contradicts rule 5, as cricket is on the right of weightlifting, and weightlifting cannot be in position 5 (since plum is not in position 5).

5. Let's reconsider the position of plum. If plum is in position 3, then the person eating kiwi must be in position 4, and the person eating orange must be in position 1. This satisfies all the rules except rule 6, which requires skiing to be on the left or right of nectarine. However, if we swap the positions of skiing and snowboarding (making skiing position 2 and snowboarding position 4), then rule 6 is satisfied, and all other rules are still satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |       1       |    2    |      3       |     4     |       5       |
| Food    | asparagus   | orange  | nectarine | kiwi      | plum        |
| Sport   | skateboarding| skiing  | snowboarding| cricket    | weightlifting|
