Lv6-6x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and 6 positions, the person drinking coffee must be in position 4. Let's denote the positions as A, B, C, D, E, F from left to right. So, Coffee is in position D.

2. Since the entrepreneur is on the left or right of the security-guard, they can be in positions A, B, C, or E. Let's assume the entrepreneur is in position A (left of security-guard).

Lv6-6x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Assign initial positions (1-6) to each category. We'll use numbers to represent the positions, and we'll use the given information to eliminate impossible positions for each item.

Step 2: Use the given information to eliminate impossible positions for each item. For example, if we know that the person watching superhero movies is not in position 1, then we can mark position 1 as impossible for that person.

Step 3: Use the given information about the relationships between items (e.g., person A is to the left/right of person B) to further eliminate impossible positions. For example, if we know that person A is to the right of person B, and person B is in position 3, then person A cannot be in position 1 or 2.

1. We know that there are 6 different types of food, so we can assign each food to a column. Let's start with the first column (Column 1) and assign it to cabbage.

2. Now we have 5 remaining food items for the other columns. Let's assign the second column to carrot, the third column to kale, the fourth column to mango, the fifth column to papaya, and the sixth column to watermelon.

3. Similarly, we know that there are 6 different hobbies, so we can assign each hobby to a row. Let's start with the first row (Row 1) and assign it to collecting.

4. Now we have 5 remaining hobbies for the other rows. Let's assign the second row to cooking, the third row to gardening, the fourth row to reading, the fifth row to skydiving, and the sixth row to woodworking.

5. We know that there are 6 different music-genres, so we can assign each genre to a row. Let's assign the first row to ambient, the second row to classical, the third row to dubstep, the fourth row to house, the fifth row to punk, and the sixth row to salsa.

6. We know that there are 6 different nationalities, so we can assign each nationality to a row. Let's assign the first row to american, the second row to brazilian, the third row to dutch, the fourth row to french, the fifth row to indian, and the sixth row to pakistani.

7. We know that there are 6 different pets, so we can assign each pet to a row. Let's assign the first row to chinchilla, the second row to fish, the third row to guinea-pig, the fourth row to hamster, the fifth row to lizard, and the sixth row to rabbit.

8. We know that there are 6 different means of transport, so we can assign each transport to a row. Let's assign the first row to airplane, the second row to car, the third row to roller, the fourth row to skateboard, the fifth row to taxi, and the sixth row to van.

Now let's solve the clues:

1. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard (#5). Since we know the row for dubstep and the row for lizard, we can deduce that the fan of dubstep is in Row 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in Row 3 (since it's the first available row). This means the lizard is in Column 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in Column 4 (since it's the first available column). Now we know that the fan of dubstep is in Row 3 and the lizard is in Column 4.

2. The person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (#5). Since we know the row for collecting and the row for guinea-pig, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is collecting is in Row 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume it's in Row 1 (since it's the first available row). This means the guinea-pig is in Column 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in Column 5 (since it's the first available column). Now we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is in Row 1 and the guinea-pig is in Column 5.

3. The brazilian is the person eating cabbage. Since we know the row for brazilian and the food for cabbage, we can deduce that the brazilian is in Row 2.

4. The pakistani is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since we know the row for the person who's hobby is collecting (Row 1) and the pakistani can't be in Row 1 (because the brazilian is there), the pakistani must be in Row 3, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in Row 3 (since it's the first available row).

5. The brazilian is on the right of the person driving the car. Since we know the row for brazilian (Row 2) and the row for car, we can deduce that the person driving the car is in Row 1, 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume it's in Row 4 (since it's the first available row).

Lv6-6x6-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. Assign each nationality to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Egyptian
   - 2: Indonesian
   - 3: Malaysian
   - 4: Polish
   - 5: Russian
   - 6: Pakistani

2. Assign each sport to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Handball
   - 2: Sailing
   - 3: Skateboarding
   - 4: Skiing
   - 5: Swimming
   - 6: Weightlifting

3. Assign each job to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Coach
   - 2: Dressmaker
   - 3: Lawyer
   - 4: Project-Manager
   - 5: Teacher
   - 6: Writer

4. Assign each movie-genre to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Drama
   - 2: Epic
   - 3: Martial-Arts
   - 4: Satire
   - 5: Scientific
   - 6: Superhero

5. Assign each music-genre to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Classical
   - 2: Dubstep
   - 3: Jazz
   - 4: Pop
   - 5: R&B
   - 6: Trance

6. Assign each transport to a position (1-6) without any specific order. Let's say we have:
   - 1: Bus
   - 2: Quad-bike
   - 3: Roller
   - 4: Scooter
   - 5: Subway
   - 6: Train

Now, let's solve the clues:

1. The fan of pop is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. If the sport of sailing is in position 2, then the fan of pop must be in an even position (4 or 6), and since the fan of pop is the coach (1), the sport of sailing is in position 4.

2. The person who's sport is sailing is in an even position. This is already satisfied since we placed sailing in position 4.

3. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the fan of classical (3). If the sport of skateboarding is in position 3, then the fan of classical must be in position 1 or 5. However, the fan of classical is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's sport is skiing (4), so the sport of skateboarding cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the sport of skateboarding must be in position 5 or 6. If it's in position 6, then the fan of classical must be in position 1, but then the fan of classical is not between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's sport is skiing (4), so the sport of skateboarding must be in position 5.

4-5. The fan of classical is between the person who's sport is skateboarding (5) and the person who's sport is skiing (4). Since the fan of classical (3) must be to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (5), the person who's sport is skiing (4) must be to the right of the fan of classical (3).

6. The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the russian (5). If the person watching scientific movies is in position 1, then the russian must be in position 6, but then the russian is not to the right of the polish (4), so the person watching scientific movies cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 6.

7. The person driving the train is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. If the person watching satire movies is in position 2, then the person driving the train must be in position 4 or 6. However, the person driving the train is not the polish (4), so the person driving the train must be in position 6.

8-10. The Egyptian is not the person driving the roller (3). The teacher is in an even position (4) and on the far left or far right (1 or 6). Since the teacher cannot be the Egyptian (1), the teacher must be in position 6.

11-13. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming (6). The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies (2). The person driving the train is on the right of the writer (6).

14-16. The person driving the roller is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding (5). The indonesian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball (1). The malaysian is the dressmaker (2). The pakistani is on the far left (1).

17-19. The writer is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical (3).

20-22. The project-manager is the person watching epic movies (2). The teacher is the person in position 6. The dressmaker is the malaysian (2).

23-25. The lawyer is not the person watching epic movies (2). The fan of pop is the coach (1). The fan of classical is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (3).

26-28. The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the project-manager (2). The fan of jazz is on the far left or far right (1 or 6). The person who's sport is sailing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter (4).

29-31. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the fan of dubstep (2). The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (6).

32-34. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller (3). The russian is somewhere to the right of the polish (4).

35. The person watching epic movies is not the malaysian (6).

36-38. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the egyptian (1). The writer is on the right of the person driving the train (6). The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller (3).

39. The coach is on the left of the fan of dubstep (2).

40. The writer is not the fan of trance.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1     |        2        |       3       |      4       |     5     |       6       |

| Transport     |          | Bus           | Roller      | Scooter       | Subway      | Train        |

We still don't have the exact positions for the movie genres, music genres, and sports, but we know their relative positions. To find the exact positions, we can use the information about the fans of pop, classical, and dubstep, as well as the sport of sailing.

Since the fan of pop (1) is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing (4), and the fan of classical (3) is between the person who's sport is skateboarding (5) and the person who's sport is skiing (4), we can deduce that the fan of pop (1) is in position 5, the fan of classical (3) is in position 2, and the fan of dubstep (2) is in position 4.

Now, we can fill in the table with the exact positions:

Lv6-6x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

1. Let's start by placing the nationalities. Since the Indian is the person eating cranberry (10), the Australian is the owner of the ferret (16), and the Japanese is the owner of the turtle (17), we can place them in the first three positions (1, 2, 6) based on the given clues.

2. The Russian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog (23), so the Russian must be in position 5.

3. The Indonesian is between the person watching family movies and the person watching superhero movies (8), so the Indonesian must be in position 4.

4. The person driving the snowmobile is the person watching martial-arts movies (7), so the snowmobile must be in an odd position (3 or 5). Since the Indonesian is in position 4, the snowmobile must be in position 3.

5. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person driving the bike (9), so the western movies person must be in position 6.
