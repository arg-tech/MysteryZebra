Lv6-5x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people and 5 categories, so each category has one unique item.

2. Let's assign the unique items to the categories:
   - Beverage 1: Almond-milk
   - Beverage 2: Cola (Indian drinks this)
   - Beverage 3: Hot-chocolate
   - Movie-Genre 1: Disaster
   - Movie-Genre 2: Romance (Not biathlon)
   - Movie-Genre 3: Spy (Not on the far left or far right)
   - Nationality 1: Chinese (Not on the far left or far right)
   - Nationality 2: Indian (Drinks cola)
   - Nationality 3: Pakistani
   - Sport 1: Biathlon (Right of cola)
   - Sport 2: Climbing
   - Sport 3: Volleyball (Middle position)
   - Transport 1: Car
   - Transport 2: Ship
   - Transport 3: Van

3. Now let's place them according to the given conditions:

   - The person driving the car is not next to the person drinking cola (Car cannot be in position 2).
   - The person driving the ship is in an odd position (Ship cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5).
   - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person driving the ship (Hot-chocolate cannot be in position 5).

4. Let's place the Transport and Nationality first:
   - Since the ship is in an odd position and cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5, it must be in position 4. So, the person driving the ship is Pakistani (Nationality 3).
   - Since the hot-chocolate is on the left of the person driving the ship, it must be in position 3. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is Chinese (Nationality 1).
   - Since the car cannot be next to the person drinking cola, it must be in position 1 or 5. But since the ship is in position 4, the car cannot be in position 5. So, the car is in position 1.
   - The van can be in any position except position 4 (since the ship is there). Let's place it in position 2 for now.

5. Now let's place the Sports:
   - The person doing biathlon is right of the person drinking cola. Since cola is in position 2, biathlon can be in position 3 or 5. But since the van is in position 2, biathlon cannot be in position 3. So, biathlon is in position 5.
   - The person doing volleyball is in the middle. Since we already placed biathlon in position 5, volleyball must be in position 4.
   - The remaining sport, climbing, must be in position 1 or 3. But since the car is in position 1, climbing cannot be there. So, climbing is in position 3.

6. Now let's place the Movies:
   - The person watching romance movies is not the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is in position 5, the romance movies cannot be in position 5. So, romance movies are in position 1 or 3. But since the Chinese is in position 3, romance movies cannot be there. So, romance movies are in position 1.
   - The person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is in position 4, disaster movies can be in position 1, 2, or 3. But since the car is in position 1 and the romance movies are in position 1, disaster movies cannot be there. So, disaster movies are in position 2.
   - The remaining genre, spy, must be in position 4 or 5. But since the ship is in position 4, spy cannot be there. So, spy is in position 5.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-5x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person watching time-travel movies is to the right of the person drinking mirinda, we can place the mirinda drinker in the first or second position. Let's place it in the first position (1).

2. The person who's sport is baseball is between the person drinking tea and the person watching romance movies. Since mirinda is in the first position, the tea drinker must be in the second position (2). The baseball player can't be in the first position (1) because it's occupied by mirinda, so it must be in the third position (3).

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the baseball player is in the third position (3), the ice-hockey player must be in the second position (2).

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the ice-hockey player is in the second position (2), the skydiving person can't be in the first position (1) because it's occupied by mirinda, so it must be in the third position (3).

5. The owner of the hamster is not the person watching romance movies. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, and skydiving are filled, the hamster owner must be in the fourth position (4).

6. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person who's hobby is drawing (8). Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, and the hamster owner are filled, the soy-milk drinker must be in the fifth position (5).

7. The person watching time-travel movies is to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, and soy-milk drinker are filled, the time-travel movie watcher must be in the sixth position (6).

8. The person who's sport is cycling is to the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, soy-milk drinker, and time-travel movie watcher are filled, the cyclist must be in the seventh position (7).

9. The person drinking tea is in an odd position. Since the positions for mirinda, baseball, ice-hockey, skydiving, the hamster owner, soy-milk drinker, time-travel movie watcher, and cyclist are filled, the tea drinker must be in the fifth position (5).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Beverage      | mirinda | soy-milk | tea   |
| Hobby         |        |         | cooking|
| Movie-Genre   |        |         | time-travel|
| Pet           |        |         | hamster |
| Sport         | baseball| cycling | ice-hockey|

Since the hobby, movie-genre, pet, and sport are not specified, we can't fill those columns. However, we know the order of the people for the given conditions.

Final solution:

Lv6-5x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the country fan is not in the first position (as it's an even position and the first position is odd), the country fan cannot be in the second position (as it would violate rule 6). So, the country fan must be in the third position.

2. Since the bartender is not in the third position (as the country fan is there), the bartender must be in the first position.

3. Now, the bartender is to the left of the subway driver (rule 2), so the subway driver must be in the second position.

4. The photographer is to the right of the owner of the frog (rule 5), so the owner of the frog must be in the first position (as there are only three positions). So, the frog is owned by the bartender.

5. The person driving the taxi is to the left of the freelancer (rule 3), so the freelancer must be in the third position.

6. The fan gospel is not in the third position (as the freelancer is there), and it's not in the first position (as the bartender is the country fan and the frog owner). So, the fan gospel must be in the second position.

7. The person drinking almond-milk cannot be the country fan (rule 4), so the almond-milk drinker must be in the third position.

8. The owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the frog (rule 10), so the owner of the hamster must be in the second position.

9. The person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person driving the trike (rule 9), so the person driving the trike must be in the third position.

10. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the trike (rule 11), so the person drinking milk must be in the second position.

Final solution table:

Lv6-5x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We have 3 food options, 3 movie-genres, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 sports. Let's assign each of them a number from 1 to 3 for now.

2. From point 1, we know that the cyclist is on the left of the watermelon eater, so we can write down the positions of cyclist and watermelon eater as (1, 2) or (2, 3). Let's assume (2, 3) for now.

3. Point 2 tells us that the fan of funk is not the Indian, so the Indian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's assume the Indian is in position 4.

4. Point 3 tells us that the Pakistani is on the left of the handball player, so the Pakistani cannot be in position 3. The Indian is in position 4, so the Pakistani cannot be in position 1 or 2 either. Let's assume the Pakistani is in position 5.

5. Point 4 tells us that the Chinese is in an odd position. Since we already placed the Indian and Pakistani, the Chinese must be in position 1, 3, or 5. However, position 5 is already taken by the Pakistani, so the Chinese must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the Chinese is in position 1.

6. Point 5 tells us that the person watching disaster movies is in an odd position. Since we already placed the Chinese, the disaster movie fan must be in position 3.

7. Point 6 tells us that the fan of country music is on the right of the western movie fan. Since the Chinese is in position 1 and watches disaster movies, the western movie fan must be in position 2. So, the fan of country music is in position 3.

8. Point 7 tells us that the fan of superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the handball player. Since the Pakistani is in position 5 and the Chinese and Indian are already placed, the superhero movie fan must be in position 4.

9. Point 9 tells us that the fan of country music is the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since we already placed the fan of country music in position 3, the person playing lacrosse must be in position 6.

10. Point 10 tells us that the fan of country music is the person eating pear. Since we already placed the fan of country music in position 3 and the pear eater must be to the right of the western movie fan (position 2), the pear eater must be in position 4.

Now we have all the positions filled:

|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |
| Food          | Chinese  | Western   | Country  | Pear     | Pakistani| Lacrosse |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster| Western   | Country  | Superhero|         |         |
| Music-Genre   |         |           | Blues    |         |         | Funk     |
| Nationality   | Chinese |         |         |         | Indian   | Pakistani|
| Sport         | Cycling |         |         | Handball |         | Lacrosse |

However, we still need to find the music-genre and sport for positions 1, 2, and 5. Since we know the nationality and movie-genre for positions 1 and 3, we can deduce the music-genre for position 1 (it must be blues since the Chinese watches disaster movies and the Indian does not watch superhero movies). Since the Pakistani is in position 5 and the Indian is in position 4, the person in position 2 must be the Indian. The Indian watches a superhero movie, so the person in position 2 is watching a superhero movie. The sport for position 2 is not specified, so we can't determine it.

For position 1, the Chinese watches a disaster movie, so the music-genre for position 1 must be blues. The sport for position 1 is not specified, so we can't determine it.

For position 5, the Pakistani is in position 5, but we don't know their sport or movie-genre yet. We can't determine them without more information.

So, the final solution table is:

2. Since the owner of the fish is the Pakistani (from rule 4), the fish can't be in the first or third row. So, the fish must be in the second row.

3. Since the person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani (from rule 3), and the Pakistani is in the second column (from step 1), the documentary can't be in the third column. So, the documentary must be in the first or second column and the second row (since the fish is there).

4. Since the person who's hobby is chess is the person eating zucchini (from rule 7), the zucchini can't be in the first row (since the kale is there). So, the zucchini must be in the second or third row. But the person who's hobby is chess is also to the left of the person who's hobby is reading (from rule 6), and the person who's hobby is reading can't be in the second column (since the Pakistani is there). So, the zucchini must be in the third row, and the chess and reading must be in the first row.

5. Since the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the Turkish (from rule 8), and the Turkish can't be in the first column (since the Pakistani is there), the Turkish must be in the second or third column. But the person watching thriller movies can't be in the third column (since the Pakistani is there), so the Turkish must be in the second column.

6. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in the first row (from step 4), and the person who's hobby is singing can't be in the second column (since the Pakistani is there), the person who's hobby is singing must be in the third column.

7. Since the person eating kale can't be the Pakistani (from rule 2), the person eating kale must be in the first row. So, the kale must be in the first column.

8. Since the person watching drama movies can't be in the second column (since the Pakistani is there), the person watching drama movies must be in the first or third column. But the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the Turkish (from rule 8), so the drama can't be in the third column. So, the drama must be in the first column.

9. Since the person watching documentary movies is in the first or second column and the second row (from step 3), and the person watching drama movies is in the first column (from step 7), the documentary must be in the second column.

10. Since the person eating zucchini is in the third row (from step 4), and the person eating onion can't be in the second column (since the documentary is there), the person eating onion must be in the third column. So, the onion must be in the third row.

11. Since the person eating kale is in the first row (from step 7), and the person eating zucchini is in the third row (from step 10), the person eating onion must be in the second row. So, the onion must be in the second row.

5. From point 7, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since B bakes, B must be eating watermelon.

6. From point 8, the french is in an even position. Since A and B are occupied, C must be the french.

Lv6-5x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 rows.

2. Let's start with the Beverages. Since there are 3 different beverages, each person must have a unique favorite beverage. Let's assign them as follows:
   - Row 1: Soy-milk
   - Row 2: Sprite
   - Row 3: Water

3. Now let's fill in the Sports. We know that the person who plays baseball is on the left of the fan of house music. Since the fan of house music is not on the leftmost position (from rule 9), the baseball player cannot be in the first row. Also, the skateboarder is in the middle, so the baseball player cannot be in the middle row either. Therefore, the baseball player must be in the third row.
   - Row 1: Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Baseball
   - Row 3: Skateboarding or Skiing (we don't know yet)

4. The skateboarder is in the middle, so we can fill in the second row with baseball and the third row with skateboarding.
   - Row 1: Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Baseball
   - Row 3: Skateboarding

5. The skateboarder is not the fan of jazz (rule 7), so the fan of jazz must be in the first or third row. Since the fan of house is to the right of the person drinking sprite (rule 9), the fan of jazz cannot be in the second row. Therefore, the fan of jazz must be in the first row.
   - Row 1: Jazz (fan of jazz), Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Baseball
   - Row 3: Skateboarding

6. The person who plays skiing is the one driving the bike (rule 3), so the skiing player must be in the third row. Since the fan of indie is to the right of the person driving the trike (rule 4), the skiing player cannot be in the first row. Therefore, the skiing player must be in the third row.
   - Row 1: Jazz (fan of jazz), Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Baseball
   - Row 3: Skiing (player), Skateboarding

7. The musician is on the right of the person drinking water (rule 5), so the musician cannot be in the first row. Therefore, the musician must be in the second or third row. Since the skateboarder is in the middle (rule 6), the musician cannot be in the third row. Therefore, the musician must be in the second row.
   - Row 1: Jazz (fan of jazz), Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Musician
   - Row 3: Skiing (player), Skateboarding

8. The accountant is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk (rule 8). Since the skateboarder is in the middle and the musician is in the second row, the accountant must be in the first row.
   - Row 1: Accountant (left of soy-milk), Jazz (fan of jazz), Skateboarding
   - Row 2: Musician
   - Row 3: Skiing (player), Skateboarding

9. Now we know the positions of all people and their sports, music-genres, and beverages. The final solution table is:

   |               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
   | Beverage      | Soy-milk   |   Sprite     |  Water   |
   | Job           | Accountant |   Musician   |  Pilot   |
   | Music-Genre   | Jazz      |   Indie      |  House   |
   | Sport         | Skateboarding | Baseball | Skiing   |
   | Transport     |          |   Bike      | Trike    |

So the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   |   Sprite     |  Water   |

Lv6-5x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different nationalities, so the Nationality column will have one 'british', one 'chinese', and one 'turkish'. Let's fill in the Nationality column first:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |               |            |               |
   | Hobby         |               |            |               |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |               |
   | Sport         |               |            |               |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

2. We know that the fan of reggae is Turkish, so the Turkish must be in the row with Reggae in the Music-Genre column. Let's fill in the Music-Genre column:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |               |            |               |
   | Hobby         |               |            |               |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         |               |            |               |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

3. The person who's sport is cricket is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so the cricket cannot be in the row with Rock-climbing in the Hobby column. Let's fill in the Sport column for the other two rows:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |               |            |               |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Skydiving  | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

4. The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the chinese. Since the Chinese is in the second row, the Soy-milk must be in the third row:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      |               |            | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Skydiving  | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the Basketball is in the first row, the Hot-chocolate can be either in the first or second row. Let's try both possibilities:

   Case 1: Hot-chocolate in the first row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing | Skydiving  | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Case 2: Hot-chocolate in the second row:

   |               |       1       | Skydiving  | Soy-milk     |
   | Beverage      |               | Rock-climbing|            |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   The second case doesn't satisfy the condition that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the first case is correct:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      |       3       |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing | Skydiving  | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

6. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the fan blues. Since the Blues is in the first row, the Skydiving must be in the third row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing |               | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               | Skydiving    | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

7. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the Hot-chocolate is in the first row, the Sprite must be in the second or third row:

   Case 1: Sprite in the second row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing | Sprite      | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Case 2: Sprite in the third row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing |               | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Sprite       |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   The second case doesn't satisfy the condition that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the first case is correct:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Rock-climbing | Sprite      | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         |               |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

8. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the fan r&b. Since the R&B is in the second row, the Rock-climbing must be in the third row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate|       2      | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      |               | R&B         | Sprite       |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            | Woodworking   |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

9. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the fan r&b. Since the R&B is in the second row, the Woodworking must be in the first row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate| Woodworking | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      |               |            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

We have filled all the columns except for the Beverage column. Let's fill it in:

   |               | Hot-chocolate| Woodworking | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Sprite       |            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

Now, let's fill in the Beverage column based on the given information:

   |               | Hot-chocolate| Woodworking | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Sprite       |            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the chinese, the Soy-milk must be in the third row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate| Woodworking | Skydiving    |
   | Beverage      | Sprite       |            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball, the Hot-chocolate can be either in the first or second row. Let's try both possibilities:

   Case 1: Hot-chocolate in the first row:

   |               | Hot-chocolate| Woodworking | Soy-milk     |
   | Beverage      | Sprite       |            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Case 2: Hot-chocolate in the second row:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Soy-milk     |
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   The first case doesn't satisfy the condition that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the second case is correct:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Now, let's fill in the Beverage column for the other two rows:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the chinese, the Soy-milk must be in the third row:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | R&B         |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Since the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the Sprite must be in the second or third row:

   Case 1: Sprite in the second row:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   Case 2: Sprite in the third row:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            |            |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   The first case doesn't satisfy the condition that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the second case is incorrect. The correct answer is:

   |               | Sprite       | Woodworking | Hot-chocolate|
   | Beverage      | Hot-chocolate|            | Soy-milk     |
   | Hobby         | Rock-climbing |            |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Blues         | R&B        | Reggae       |
   | Sport         | Basketball    | Skateboarding| Cricket      |
   | Nationality   | British       | Chinese    | Turkish       |

   However, this table doesn't satisfy the condition that the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This is a contradiction, which means that the given puzzle has no solution.

   This table represents one possible solution, but it doesn't satisfy all the given conditions, so there might be other solutions as well. However, due to the contradiction, it's not guaranteed that a valid solution exists."	{}	False	0	False
Lv6-5x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 people, so we can fill in the table with 3 different symbols (let's use A, B, and C).

|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | A         | B          | C           |
| Hobby         |           |            |             |
| Job           |           |            |             |
| Nationality   |           |            |             |
| Transport     |           |            |             |

2. We know the favorite beverages, hobbies, jobs, nationalities, and transport, so we can fill in the corresponding columns with the given information.

|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee     | juice       |
| Hobby         |           | skydiving  | board-games  |
| Job           | bartender  | journalist  | freelancer   |
| Nationality   | american   | french     | turkish     |
| Transport     |           | train      | tram         |

3. Now let's solve the constraints:

   a. From constraint 1, the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the hobby of the person driving the train is skydiving (from the previous step), the person driving the train must be in position 1, and the person driving the tram must be in position 3.

   b. From constraint 2, the turkish is not the person who's hobby is baking. Since the hobby of the person drinking coffee is baking (from the previous step), the turkish cannot be in position 1 (since it would mean the person drinking coffee is turkish, which contradicts the hobby information). So, the turkish must be in position 2 or 3. But since the freelancer is on the left of the turkish (from constraint 9), the turkish must be in position 3.

   c. From constraint 3, the journalist is between the french and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the nationalities are already filled in, the journalist must be in position 2.

   d. From constraint 4, the person driving the roller is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train is in position 1, the person driving the roller must be in position 2.

   e. From constraint 5, the person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the roller (who is also drinking coffee) is in position 2, the person drinking juice must be in position 1 or 3 (to satisfy the far left or far right condition). But since the person driving the tram (who is also drinking coffee) is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 1.

   f. From constraint 6, the person who's hobby is baking is the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking coffee is in position 2 (the journalist), the person who's hobby is baking is also the journalist.

   g. From constraint 7, the person who's hobby is board-games is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person drinking coffee. Since the person driving the tram (who is also skydiving) is in position 3, and the journalist (who is also drinking coffee) is in position 2, the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 1.

   h. From constraint 8, the person who's drinking juice is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 1 (to satisfy the left or right condition).

   i. From constraint 9, the freelancer is on the left of the turkish. Since the turkish is in position 3, the freelancer must be in position 2.

   j. From constraint 10, the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in position 3, the person who's hobby is skydiving is also in position 3.

Now the table is filled with the correct information:

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-5x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the fan of trance is not in the first position (as it's to the right of the person eating garlic), so it can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the hobby of the person who likes trance is chess (from clue 10), and there's only one chess fan, the trance fan must be in position 2 (as the woodworker is between the helicopter driver and the electronic fan, so the helicopter driver must be in position 1).

2. Now we know the helicopter driver is in position 1. The hobby of the person in position 1 is woodworking (from clue 2).

3. The person watching fantasy movies is not the person driving the helicopter (clue 3), so it can't be in position 1. Since the position of the fantasy fan is odd (clue 7), it must be in position 3.

4. The person watching adventure movies is also not the person driving the helicopter (clue 4), so it can't be in position 1. Since the position of the adventure fan is not odd (as the position of the fantasy fan is odd and they are different), it must be in position 2.

5. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop (clue 5). Since the hobby of the person in position 1 is woodworking, the hobby of the person in position 2 is drawing (as the fan of hip-hop is in position 3).

6. The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person eating lime (clue 9). Since the trance fan is in position 2 and the hobby of the person in position 1 is woodworking, the person eating lime must be in position 3.

7. The person eating garlic must be in position 4 (as the trance fan is in position 2 and the hobby of the person in position 1 is woodworking, and the position of the garlic eater can't be to the left of the trance fan).

8. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the car (clue 6). Since the helicopter driver is in position 1 and the car driver can't be in position 1 (as the helicopter driver is to the left of the car driver), the car driver must be in position 5. The only remaining position for the trike is position 6.

9. The only food left is zucchini, so the person eating zucchini must be in position 5.

10. The only music genre left is electronic, so the fan of electronic music must be in position 4.

11. The only hobby left is chess (as the hobby of the person in position 1 is woodworking, the hobby of the person in position 2 is drawing, and the hobby of the person in position 3 is eating lime), so the person who likes chess must be in position 6.

Here is the final solution table:
