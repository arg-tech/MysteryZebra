2. Similarly, we can assign the music-genres, pets, sports, and transport to the rows.

Now let's start solving the clues:

1. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person driving the tram. This means the chinchilla owner must be in a column to the left of the tram driver. Since the tram driver is in row 6, the chinchilla owner must be in column 1, 2, or 3.

2. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since rowing is in an odd position (3, 5, or 7), the scooter driver must be in a column to the left or right of column 3, 5, or 7. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the scooter driver cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the scooter driver must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is between the fan house and the person driving the tram. Since the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, and the tram driver is in row 6, the fan house must be in a row above row 6 and a column to the right of the chinchilla owner. The only possible position for the fan house is in row 5, column 4, as the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, and the other columns in row 5 are already occupied.

4. The person driving the train is on the left or right of the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa is not the tram driver (clue 22), the train driver cannot be in row 6. So, the train driver must be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the fan house is in row 5, the train driver cannot be in row 5. Also, the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, so the train driver cannot be in row 1, 2, or 3 either. So, the train driver must be in row 4.

5. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since ice-hockey is in an odd position (3, 5, or 7), the turtle owner must be in a column to the left or right of column 3, 5, or 7. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the turtle owner cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the turtle owner must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

6. The owner of the chinchilla is not the person driving the scooter. Since the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, and the scooter driver is in column 4, 5, or 6, the chinchilla owner cannot be the scooter driver.

7. The owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating cauliflower. Since the cauliflower eater is in a column to the right of the chinchilla owner (clue 3), the dog owner must be in a column to the left of the chinchilla owner. However, the first column is already occupied by apricot, so the dog owner must be in column 2.

8. The person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver is in row 6, the van driver must be in a row above row 6. However, since the train driver is in row 4, the van driver cannot be in row 5. So, the van driver must be in row 1, 2, or 3. Also, the dog owner is in column 2, so the van driver cannot be in row 1, as the first column is already occupied. So, the van driver must be in row 2 or 3.

9. The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since rowing is in an odd position (3, 5, or 7), the cabbage eater must be in a column to the left or right of column 3, 5, or 7. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the cabbage eater cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the cabbage eater must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

10. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person eating corn. Since the corn eater is in a column to the right of the chinchilla owner (clue 3), the hamster owner must be in a column to the right of the chinchilla owner. However, the last column is already occupied by onion, so the hamster owner must be in column 5 or 6.

11. The owner of the horse is not the person driving the van. Since the van driver is in row 2 or 3, the horse owner cannot be in row 2 or 3.

12. The fan trance is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse owner is not in row 2 or 3, the fan trance must be in row 4, 5, or 6. However, since the fan house is in row 5, the fan trance cannot be in row 5. So, the fan trance must be in row 4 or 6.

13. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the volleyball player must be in a column to the right of the motorbike driver. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the volleyball player cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the volleyball player must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

14. The person driving the motorbike is in an odd position. Since the motorbike driver is in an odd position, the motorbike driver must be in row 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, since the fan house is in row 5, the motorbike driver cannot be in row 5. So, the motorbike driver must be in row 1, 3, or 7.

15. The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the apricot eater must be in a column to the left or right of the motorbike driver. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the apricot eater cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the apricot eater must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

16. The person eating cabbage is not the person who's sport is handball. Since the handball player is the person driving the van (clue 14), the cabbage eater cannot be in column 2 or 3.

17. The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the apricot eater must be in a column to the left or right of the motorbike driver. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the apricot eater cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the apricot eater must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

18. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the van driver is in row 2 or 3, and the turtle owner is in column 4, 5, or 6, the van driver cannot be in row 2 or 3, column 4, or column 6. So, the van driver must be in row 2 or 3, column 5. However, since the motorbike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the van driver cannot be in row 3, as the third row is already occupied by the motorbike driver. So, the van driver must be in row 2, column 5.

19. The person driving the boat is not the owner of the dog. Since the dog owner is in column 2, the boat driver cannot be in row 2.

20. The fan country is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train. Since the train driver is in row 4, the fan country must be in row 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6. However, since the fan house is in row 5, the fan country cannot be in row 5. So, the fan country must be in row 1, 2, 3, or 6.

21. The fan country is the person driving the van. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the fan country must be in row 1, 2, 3, or 6, as the van driver is in row 2.

22. The fan metal is the person driving the tram. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the fan metal must be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, as the tram driver is in row 6.

23. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since the handball player is the person driving the van (clue 14), the avocado eater must be in a column to the left of column 2. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the avocado eater cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the avocado eater must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

24. The person eating apricot is on the far left or far right. Since the apricot eater is in column 4, 5, or 6, the apricot eater cannot be in the far left or far right.

25. The person driving the train is not the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa must be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, and the train driver is in row 4, the fan salsa cannot be the train driver.

26. The fan trance is not the person eating apricot. Since the apricot eater is in column 4, 5, or 6, the fan trance cannot be in column 4, 5, or 6.

27. The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, or 7), the apricot eater must be in a column to the left or right of the motorbike driver. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the apricot eater cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the apricot eater must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

28. The person eating avocado is not the fan country. Since the fan country must be in row 1, 2, 3, or 6, and the avocado eater is in column 4, 5, or 6, the fan country cannot be the avocado eater.

29. The person who's sport is soccer is the person eating cabbage. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the person eating cabbage is not the person who's sport is handball (clue 16).

30. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, and the tram driver is in row 6, the chinchilla owner must be in column 1, 2, or 3. However, since the dog owner is in column 2, the chinchilla owner cannot be in column 2. So, the chinchilla owner must be in column 1 or 3.

31. The owner of the chinchilla is not the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter driver is in column 4, 5, or 6, the chinchilla owner cannot be in column 4, 5, or 6.

32. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the chinchilla owner is in column 1, 2, or 3, and the tram driver is in row 6, the chinchilla owner must be in column 1, 2, or 3. However, since the dog owner is in column 2, the chinchilla owner cannot be in column 2. So, the chinchilla owner must be in column 1 or 3.

33. The owner of the ferret is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver is not in row 2 (clue 19), the ferret owner must be in a column to the left of the boat driver. However, since the chinchilla owner is already in column 1, 2, or 3, the ferret owner cannot be in column 1, 2, or 3. So, the ferret owner must be in column 4, 5, or 6.

34. The owner of the ferret is the person eating cauliflower. This contradicts the previous conclusion that the ferret owner must be in column 4, 5, or 6, as the cauliflower eater is in a column to the right of the chinchilla owner (clue 3).

35. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is not in column 4, 5, or 6, the volleyball player cannot be in column 4, 5, or 6.

At this point, we have a contradiction in the puzzle, as the conclusions from clues 33 and 34 contradict each other. The puzzle may have an error or be unsolvable with the given information.

This is as far as we can deduce with the given information and the contradiction in the puzzle."	{'music-genre': ['blues', 'country', 'metal', 'salsa', 'trance', ''], 'pet': ['', '', '', '', '', ''], 'sport': ['', '', '', '', '', ''], 'transport': ['boat', 'motorbike', 'scooter', 'train', 'tram', 'van']}	False	0	False
Lv6-5x6-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the positions from left to right (1 being the far left and 6 being the far right).

2. From rule 21, the person watching sports movies is in an odd position. So, let's place the sports movies person in position 1, 3, or 5.

3. From rule 25, the person who's sport is soccer is in an even position. So, soccer can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's place soccer in position 2, 4, or 6.

4. From rule 1, the person who's sport is cricket is between the person watching superhero movies and the person who's sport is soccer. If cricket is in position 1, then superhero movies must be in position 2 and soccer in position 3. But this violates rule 25 (soccer is in an even position). So, cricket can't be in position 1. If cricket is in position 3, then superhero movies must be in position 4 and soccer in position 5. But this violates rule 21 (sports movies is in an odd position). So, cricket can't be in position 3 either. If cricket is in position 5, then superhero movies must be in position 6 and soccer in position 4. This satisfies all rules.

5. From rule 20, the coach is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. So, the coach can't be in position 6 (since skiing is in position 5). The coach can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 27). So, the coach must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But if the coach is in position 2, it violates rule 5 (the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the coach). So, the coach can't be in position 2. If the coach is in position 3, it violates rule 27 (the coach is to the right of the dancer, but the dancer is in position 1 according to rule 33). So, the coach can't be in position 3. If the coach is in position 4, it violates rule 27 (the coach is to the right of the dancer). So, the coach can't be in position 4. If the coach is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

6. From rule 27, the dancer is on the far left or far right. Since the coach is in position 5, the dancer must be in position 1 or 6. But if the dancer is in position 1, it violates rule 33 (the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies, but fantasy movies is in position 7 according to rule 35). So, the dancer must be in position 6.

7. From rule 28, the architect is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies. So, the architect can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. The architect can't be in position 6 (since it violates rule 6, the person driving the jet-ski is the person watching fantasy movies, and the jet-ski is in position 7). So, the architect must be in position 2, 4, or 5. But if the architect is in position 2, it violates rule 6 (the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi, but the taxi is in position 3). So, the architect can't be in position 2. If the architect is in position 4, it violates rule 29 (the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike, but the motorbike is in position 5). So, the architect can't be in position 4. If the architect is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

8. From rule 29, the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike. So, skiing can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. The only remaining position is 6.

9. From rule 30, the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. So, fantasy movies must be in position 5.

10. From rule 35, the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. So, juice can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. The only remaining positions are 2, 4, and 6. But if juice is in position 2, it violates rule 9 (the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda, but mirinda is in position 6). So, juice can't be in position 2. If juice is in position 4, it violates rule 22 (the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking coffee, but coffee is in position 5). So, juice can't be in position 4. If juice is in position 6, it satisfies all rules.

11. From rule 3, the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies. Since sports movies is in position 1, the taxi can't be in position 6. So, the taxi must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But if the taxi is in position 2, it violates rule 5 (the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the coach, but the coach is in position 5). So, the taxi can't be in position 2. If the taxi is in position 3, it violates rule 34 (the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi, but the jet-ski is in position 5). So, the taxi can't be in position 3. If the taxi is in position 4, it violates rule 34 (the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi). So, the taxi can't be in position 4. If the taxi is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

12. From rule 31, the project-manager is not the person drinking mirinda. So, the project-manager can't be in position 6 (since mirinda is in position 6). The project-manager can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 18). So, the project-manager must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. But if the project-manager is in position 2, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager). So, the project-manager can't be in position 2. If the project-manager is in position 3, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager). So, the project-manager can't be in position 3. If the project-manager is in position 4, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager). So, the project-manager can't be in position 4. If the project-manager is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

13. From rule 19, the person driving the van is on the left or right of the person who's sport is swimming. Since swimming is the librarian according to rule 15, the van can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 3, the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies, and sports movies is in position 1). So, the van must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But if the van is in position 2, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager, but the project-manager is in position 5). So, the van can't be in position 2. If the van is in position 3, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager). So, the van can't be in position 3. If the van is in position 4, it violates rule 18 (the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager). So, the van can't be in position 4. If the van is in position 6, it satisfies all rules.

14. From rule 14, the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since we don't know the position of romance movies yet, let's assign it to position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. If romance movies is in position 1, the car can't be in position 6 (since it violates rule 19). If romance movies is in position 2, the car can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 14). If romance movies is in position 3, the car can't be in position 6 (since it violates rule 19). If romance movies is in position 4, the car can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 14). If romance movies is in position 5, the car can't be in position 6 (since it violates rule 19). If romance movies is in position 6, the car can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 14). So, we can't determine the position of the car yet.

15. From rule 33, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since fantasy movies is in position 5, martial-arts movies can be in position 4 or 6. But if martial-arts movies is in position 4, it violates rule 34 (the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi, but the taxi is in position 3). So, martial-arts movies must be in position 6.

16. From rule 36, the architect is on the right of the person watching sports movies. Since sports movies is in position 1, the architect can't be in position 1, 3, or 5. The architect can't be in position 6 (since it violates rule 6, the person driving the jet-ski is the person watching fantasy movies, and the jet-ski is in position 5). So, the architect must be in position 2, 4, or 5. But if the architect is in position 2, it violates rule 6 (the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi, but the taxi is in position 3). So, the architect can't be in position 2. If the architect is in position 4, it violates rule 29 (the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person driving the motorbike, but the motorbike is in position 5). So, the architect can't be in position 4. If the architect is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

17. From rule 17, the person driving the bus is on the left of the project-manager. But we already determined that the project-manager is in position 5, so the bus can't be in position 5. The bus can't be in position 1 (since it violates rule 4, the person driving the bus is on the right of the person drinking coffee, but coffee is in position 5). So, the bus must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But if the bus is in position 2, it violates rule 11 (the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies, but we don't know the position of romance movies yet). So, the bus can't be in position 2. If the bus is in position 3, it violates rule 11 (the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies). So, the bus can't be in position 3. If the bus is in position 4, it violates rule 11 (the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies). So, the bus can't be in position 4. If the bus is in position 6, it satisfies all rules.

But if the person drinking juice is in position 2, it violates rule 9 (the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda, but mirinda is in position 6). So, the person drinking juice can't be in position 2. If the person drinking juice is in position 3, it violates rule 35 (the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies, but fantasy movies is in position 5). So, the person drinking juice can't be in position 3. If the person drinking juice is in position 4, it violates rule 22 (the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking coffee, but coffee is in position 5). So, the person drinking juice can't be in position 4. If the person drinking juice is in position 5, it satisfies all rules.

20. From rule 18, the person driving the bus is in position 6.

21. From rule 12, the person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since soccer is in position 4, climbing can't be in position 5 or 6. The only remaining position is 1, 2, 3, or 4. But if climbing is in position 1, it violates rule 6 (the person driving the jet-ski is the person watching fantasy movies, and the jet-ski is in position 5). So, climbing can't be in position 1. If climbing is in position 2, it violates rule 24 (the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, but we don't know the position of iced-tea yet). So, climbing can't be in position 2. If climbing is in position 3, it satisfies all rules.

Lv6-5x6-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each person a unique identifier (1-6) to keep track of them.

2. We know there are 6 different jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and sports. So, each row and each column should have a unique value.

3. Let's start with the nationalities. From rule 26, we know the Malaysian (M) is between the fan electronic (E) and the French (F). Since the French is the fan electronic (from rule 18), the Malaysian must be to the right of the French. From rule 32, we know the French is not the person who's sport is parkour, so parkour (P) cannot be to the right of the French. Therefore, parkour must be to the left of the French, and the Malaysian must be to the right of the French and to the left of parkour.

4. From rule 22, we know the Australian (A) is on the left of the doctor (D). Since the Malaysian is to the right of the French, and the French is not the Australian (from rule 2), the Australian must be to the left of the French.

5. From rule 33, we know the person who's sport is volleyball (V) is between the person watching zombie movies (Z) and the person who's sport is baseball (B). Since the Malaysian is to the right of the French and to the left of parkour, and the Australian is to the left of the French, the only remaining position for volleyball is between zombie and baseball.

Since the Malaysian is to the right of the French and to the left of parkour, the social-worker must be to the left of the Malaysian and to the right of the French. Since the chef is the person watching action movies, the social-worker cannot be the person watching sports movies (from rule 28), so the social-worker must be watching a different movie genre.

Lv6-5x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the bartender (tea drinker) in position 4, as he/she also watches zombie movies (rule 9 and 11).

2. Since the bartender can't be the fan of metal (rule 1), we can place the metal fan in position 6.

3. The fan of funk is to the left of the western movie watcher (rule 2), so the western movie watcher can't be in position 6 (since the metal fan is there). Let's place the western movie watcher in position 1.

4. The manager can't be the fan of funk (rule 3), so the fan of funk must be in one of the remaining positions (2, 3, or 5). Since the funk fan is to the left of the western movie watcher (rule 2), the funk fan can't be in position 3 or 5. So, the funk fan is in position 2.

5. The photographer can't be the almond-milk drinker (rule 4), so the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there). The almond-milk drinker can't be in position 6 (since the metal fan is there). So, the almond-milk drinker is in position 5.

6. The fan of indie is to the right of the fan of metal (rule 6), so the fan of indie can't be in position 2 (since the funk fan is there). The fan of indie is also to the right of the almond-milk drinker (rule 20), so the fan of indie can't be in position 5 (since the almond-milk drinker is there). So, the fan of indie is in position 3.

7. The fan of house is on the far right (rule 7), so it must be in position 6.

8. The fan of classical is the photographer (rule 13), so the photographer is in position 2.

9. The owner of the snake can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there), position 2 (since the photographer is there), position 3 (since the indie fan is there), position 4 (since the bartender is there), or position 6 (since the house fan is there). So, the owner of the snake is in position 5.

10. The owner of the bird is to the right of the classical fan (rule 8), so the owner of the bird can't be in position 2 (since the classical fan is there). The owner of the bird can't be in position 6 (since the house fan is there). So, the owner of the bird is in position 3.

11. The owner of the ferret can't be the western movie watcher (rule 18), so the owner of the ferret is in one of the remaining positions (1, 4, 5). Since the owner of the ferret is the fan of salsa (rule 28), the owner of the ferret can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there). So, the owner of the ferret is in position 5.

12. The owner of the guinea-pig is the architect (rule 32), so the architect is in position 6.

13. The owner of the rabbit can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there), position 2 (since the photographer is there), position 3 (since the owner of the bird is there), position 4 (since the bartender is there), position 5 (since the owner of the ferret is there), or position 6 (since the architect is there). So, the owner of the rabbit is in position 4.

The teacher can't be the hot-chocolate drinker (rule 26), so the hot-chocolate drinker can't be in position 6 (since the manager is there). So, the teacher is in position 1, the coffee drinker is in position 2, and the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 3.

16. The person watching family movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret (rule 21), so the person watching family movies can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there), position 2 (since the coffee drinker is there), position 3 (since the hot-chocolate drinker is there), position 4 (since the owner of the rabbit is there), or position 5 (since the owner of the ferret is there). So, the person watching family movies is in position 6.

17. The person watching mystery movies is to the left or right of the person watching comedy movies (rule 29), so the person watching mystery movies can't be in position 1 (since the western movie watcher is there), position 2 (since the coffee drinker is there), position 3 (since the hot-chocolate drinker is there), position 4 (since the owner of the rabbit is there), or position 5 (since the owner of the ferret is there).

The owner of the snake can't be in position 6 (since the architect is there), so the owner of the snake is in position 4. The person drinking milk can't be in position 6 (since the architect is there), so the person drinking milk is in position 1.

20. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position (rule 16), so the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1, 3, or 5. The person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 30), so the person drinking iced-tea can't be in position 5 (since the owner of the rabbit is there). So, the person drinking iced-tea is in position 1.

21. The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of metal (rule 1), so the person drinking almond-milk can't be in position 6 (since the metal fan is there). The person drinking almond-milk is also not the photographer (rule 4), so the person drinking almond-milk can't be in position 2 (since the photographer is there).

Lv6-5x6-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. From rule 30, we know that the mechanic eats mango. So, let's place the mango in the first position (1).

2. From rule 26, we know that the security-guard is not the person eating carrot. So, let's place the carrot in the second position (2).

3. From rule 13, we know that the person eating broccoli is not the person drinking sprite. Since the mechanic (mango) is in position 1 and the carrot is in position 2, the sprite must be in position 3.

4. From rule 12, we know that the person drinking fanta is the person eating carrot. So, the carrot (and thus the mechanic) must be in position 6. This means the fanta is in position 5.

5. From rule 27, we know that the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. So, the lemonade must be in position 2.

6. From rule 8, we know that the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking sprite and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since fanta is in position 5 and sprite is in position 3, the sudoku person must be in position 4.

7. From rule 6, we know that the journalist is the person who's hobby is camping. Since the sudoku person is in position 4, the camping person (journalist) must be in position 3.

8. From rule 18, we know that the journalist is on the right of the social-worker. So, the social-worker must be in position 2.

9. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the owner of the hamster. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the hamster owner (and thus the skydiving person) must be in position 6.

10. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who owns the fish. Since the fanta is in position 5, the fish owner must be in position 4.

11. From rule 11, we know that the person drinking water is the owner of the turtle. Since the fish is in position 4, the turtle owner (and thus the water drinker) must be in position 5.

12. From rule 9, we know that the chinchilla owner is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hamster owner is in position 6, the chinchilla owner (and thus the hot-chocolate drinker) must be in position 1.
