Lv6-5x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 rows.

2. We know the hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and pets are all different for each person. Let's label the people A, B, C, and D from left to right.

3. From point 11, we know the Canadian (C) is on the right of the French, so C cannot be the first person (A). Therefore, A must be either British, Brazilian, Canadian, or French. Let's assume A is British for now.

4. From point 8, the British (A) is on the left or right of the fan of blues. If A is on the left, the fan of blues must be C or D. If A is on the right, the fan of blues can be any of A, C, or D. Let's assume A is on the left for now, so the fan of blues is C or D.

5. From point 5, the person who sings (collecting) watches disaster movies. Since the fan of blues (C or D) cannot watch disaster movies (point 6), the person who sings must be A, B, or C. Let's assume the person who sings is B for now.

6. From point 7, the fan of salsa is to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the British (A) cannot own the mouse (point 16), the fan of salsa must be C or D.

7. From point 13, the fan of country is to the right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is C or D, the fan of country must be A or B.

8. From point 9, the fan of country is not the person who collects. Since the person who sings is B, the fan of country cannot be B. Therefore, the fan of country is A.

9. From point 10, the person who watches zombie movies is on the right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is C or D, the person who watches zombie movies must be A, C, or D. Let's assume the person who watches zombie movies is C for now.

10. From point 15, the person who does woodworking is on the right of the person who watches zombie movies. Since the person who watches zombie movies is C, the person who does woodworking must be D.

11. From point 14, the British (A) is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the person who does woodworking (D) cannot own the mouse (point 16), the owner of the mouse must be B.

12. From point 3, the owner of the dog is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the person who does woodworking (D) cannot own the dog (point 16), the owner of the dog must be A or C. However, the owner of the dog cannot be A because the British (A) is on the left of the Brazilian, and the Brazilian is not the first person (A is British). Therefore, the owner of the dog is C.

13. From point 12, the Brazilian (B) must be the person on the far right.

14. From point 11, the Canadian (C) is on the right of the French. Since the Brazilian (B) is on the far right, the Canadian (C) must be the second person from the right (D).

15. From point 2, the owner of the dog is on the left of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian (B) is the last person, the owner of the dog (C) must be the first person.

16. From point 4, the person who watches horror movies is somewhere to the right of the person who fishes. Since the person who watches zombie movies (C) is the first person, the person who watches horror movies cannot be the second person (B) because B watches disaster movies. Therefore, the person who watches horror movies is D.

17. From point 15, the person who does woodworking is on the right of the person who watches zombie movies. Since the person who watches zombie movies is the first person (C), the person who does woodworking (D) must be the last person (B).

18. From point 10, the person who watches zombie movies is on the right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is the second person (C), the person who watches zombie movies (C) must be the third person.

19. From point 6, the fan of salsa is to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is the second person (B), the fan of salsa must be the fourth person (A).

20. From point 9, the fan of country is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is the fourth person (A), the fan of country must be the third person (C).

21. From point 1, we know the hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, nationalities, and pets are all different for each person. We have filled in all the nationalities and pets, so we can now fill in the hobbies, movie-genres, and music-genres.

3. From rule 13, the fan of reggae is driving the bus. Let's place them in the fourth row, first column (4,1).
4. From rule 5, the owner of the goldfish is not the person driving the jet-ski. Since the fan of reggae is driving the bus, the goldfish cannot be in the fourth row. So, the goldfish must be in the second or third row.
5. From rule 3, the goldfish is in an even position. So, the goldfish must be in the second row. Let's place them in the second row, fourth column (2,4).

Lv6-5x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the cola drinker is to the right of the pumpkin eater, we can place them in positions 2 and 3 or 3 and 4. Let's place cola in position 3 and pumpkin in position 2.

2. The subway driver is to the right of the hot-chocolate drinker, so hot-chocolate can't be in position 1. Let's place hot-chocolate in position 4.

3. The hedgehog owner is in an even position, so they can't be in position 1 or 3. Let's place hedgehog in position 2 (since pumpkin is already there). This means the pet in position 1 is a cat.

4. The bike driver is to the right of the subway driver, so the subway driver can't be in position 1. The subway driver is in position 4, so the bike driver is in position 3.

5. The electronic music fan is in an even position, so they can't be in position 1 or 3. Since the bike driver is in position 3, the electronic music fan can't be in position 4. So, the electronic music fan is in position 2. This means the music fan in position 1 is a country fan.

6. The electronic music fan is to the left of the cat owner, so the cat owner can't be in position 4. The cat owner is in position 1, so the electronic music fan is in position 2. This means the cat is in position 3.

7. The reggae fan is to the left of the zucchini eater, so the zucchini eater can't be in position 1. Let's place zucchini in position 4. This means the food in position 1 is raspberry.

8. The goldfish owner is in an even position, so they can't be in position 1 or 3. Since the cat is in position 3, the goldfish can't be in position 4. So, the goldfish is in position 2. This means the food in position 1 is raspberry, and the pet in position 3 is a cat.

9. The zucchini eater is to the right of the raspberry eater, so the raspberry eater can't be in position 4. Let's place raspberry in position 1. This means the food in position 4 is papaya.

10. The car driver is the electronic music fan, so the car is in position 2.

11. The goldfish owner is on the far right, so the pet in position 1 must be a mouse.

12. The fan of country music is not the owner of the mouse, so the fan of country music is in position 3.

13. The goldfish owner is to the right of the mouse owner, so the mouse owner is in position 2.

14. The hot-chocolate drinker is to the right of the papaya eater, so the papaya eater can't be in position 4. Let's place papaya in position 2. This means the hot-chocolate drinker is in position 4.

15. The cat owner is to the left or right of the goldfish owner, so the goldfish owner is in position 2. This means the cat owner is in position 3.

16. The electronic music fan is to the left of the cat owner, so the cat owner is in position 3 and the electronic music fan is in position 2. This is a contradiction, as we already placed the electronic music fan in position 2. So, the electronic music fan must be in position 3, and the cat owner is in position 4.

17. The zucchini eater is to the right of the raspberry eater, so the raspberry eater can't be in position 4. Let's place raspberry in position 1. This means the zucchini eater is in position 4.

18. The tea drinker is to the right of the cola drinker, so the cola drinker can't be in position 3. Let's place cola in position 1. This means the tea drinker is in position 2.

Lv6-5x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the firefighter in a position where he is not the person who's sport is cricket or skiing. Let's place him in the second position (row 2). Since the firefighter can't be the person who's sport is skiing, the sport in row 3 must be skiing. So, the sport in row 2 is cricket.

2. The fan d&b is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the firefighter (cricket) is in the second position, the rabbit can't be in the first position (row 1). So, the rabbit is in row 4. The fan d&b can't be in the fourth position (row 4) because of rule 11. So, the fan d&b is in the first position (row 1).

3. The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. So, the hedgehog is in row 3. Since the fan d&b is in row 1, the music-genre in row 3 must be d&b.

4. The software-developer is on the left or right of the doctor. Since the firefighter (cricket) is in the second position, the doctor can't be in the first position (row 1). So, the doctor is in row 2. Since the fan d&b is in row 1 and the fan electronic is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog (row 3), the software-developer (electronic) must be in row 4.

5. The person who's sport is sailing is the fan d&b. So, the sport in row 1 is sailing.

6. The writer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. So, the writer is in row 2.

7. The person eating radish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat. Since the rabbit is in row 4, the goat can't be in row 4. So, the goat is in row 3. Since the fan d&b (sailing) is in row 1, the radish can't be in row 1. So, the radish is in row 2.

8. The person eating orange is not the fan r&b. Since the fan r&b is in the first position (row 1), the orange can't be in row 1. So, the orange is in row 2 or 4. Since the software-developer (electronic) is in row 4, the orange can't be in row 4. So, the orange is in row 2.

9. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the cricket is in row 2, the lacrosse is in row 3 or 4. Since the fan d&b (sailing) is in row 1, the radish (row 2) and the goat (row 3) are already placed, so the lacrosse must be in row 4.

10. The person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog is in row 3, the apricot can't be in row 1, 2, or 3. So, the apricot is in row 4.

11. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the cricket is in row 2 and the lacrosse is in row 4, the sport in row 3 must be sailing (since the fan d&b is the sailor).

12. The person eating orange is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the lacrosse is in row 4, the orange can't be in row 1. So, the orange is in row 2 or 3. Since the software-developer (electronic) is in row 4, the orange can't be in row 4. So, the orange is in row 3.

13. The person eating apricot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the hedgehog is in row 3, the apricot can't be in row 1 or 2. So, the apricot is in row 4.

14. The fan r&b is on the far left. Since the fan d&b (sailing) is in the first position (row 1), the fan r&b must be in the first position (row 1). But this contradicts rule 11. There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

Here is the table up to the point where the contradiction occurs:

|               |    1    |      2      |         3          |   4    |

| Sport         | Sailing | Cricket    | Sailing           | Lacrosse|

The puzzle seems to have a contradiction, as placing the fan r&b in the first position (row 1) contradicts rule 11. I'm unable to solve the puzzle beyond this point due to the contradiction."	{'food': ['apricot', 'orange', 'radish', 'plum'], 'job': ['writer', 'firefighter', 'software-developer', 'doctor'], 'music-genre': ['r&b', 'd&b', 'electronic', ''], 'pet': ['dog', 'goat', 'hedgehog', 'rabbit'], 'sport': ['sailing', 'cricket', 'sailing', 'lacrosse']}	True	8	False
Lv6-5x4-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 jobs, 4 music-genres, 4 nationalities, 4 sports, and 4 types of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From the clues, we know that the paramedic drives the train, so let's assign the paramedic to job 3 and the train to transport 3.

3. The Indonesian is on the left of the fan ambient, so the Indonesian can't be in the first column. Since there are 4 nationalities, the Indonesian must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Let's assume the Indonesian is in the second column (nationality 2). This means the fan ambient is in the first column (nationality 1).

4. The fan techno is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the Indonesian is not the skateboarder (as per clue 9), the skateboarder must be in the second, third, or fourth row. Let's assume the skateboarder is in the third row (sport 3). This means the fan techno is in the second or fourth row.

5. The person driving the jet-ski is not the fan techno, so the fan techno can't be in the fourth row. Therefore, the fan techno is in the second row. This means the sport 2 is techno.

6. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the fan gospel. Since the skateboarder is in the third row, gospel must be in the third row as well.

7. The person driving the bus is on the far left. Since the Indonesian is not the bus driver (as per clue 7), the bus driver must be in the first column.

8. The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the volleyball player is in the first column (as per clue 11), the car driver must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Let's assume the car driver is in the fourth column.

9. The fisherman is the American. Since the American can't be in the first column (as per clue 9), the fisherman must be in the second, third, or fourth row. Let's assume the fisherman is in the fourth row (job 4). This means the American is job 4 and the sport 4 is cycling (as per clue 10).

10. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left. Since the volleyball player is in the first column, the sport 1 must be volleyball.

11. The security-guard is the French. Since the French can't be in the first column (as per clue 17), the security-guard must be in the second, third, or fourth row. Let's assume the security-guard is in the second row (job 2).

12. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the bus driver is in the first column and the car driver is in the fourth column, they must be in the second and third columns respectively. This means the sport 2 is cycling (as per clue 8), and the sport 3 is skateboarding (as per our previous assumption).

13. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the jet-ski driver can't be in the first column (as per clue 5), the jet-ski driver must be in the second, third, or fourth column. Since the train driver is in the first column, the jet-ski driver must be in the second column. This means the transport 2 is jet-ski.

14. The person driving the train is not the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in the fourth row, the train driver must be in the first, second, or third row. Let's assume the train driver is in the third row (job 3). This means the sport 3 is lacrosse (as per clue 1).

15. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the paramedic. Since the volleyball player is in the first column and the paramedic is the person driving the train (in the third row), the paramedic must be in the second row (job 2).

16. The person driving the bus is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since the bus driver is in the second column and the car driver is in the fourth column, they must be in the first and third columns respectively. This means the sport 1 is cycling (as per our previous assumption), and the sport 2 is volleyball (as per our previous assumption).

So, the final solution table is:

2. Since the Egyptian is not the Chinese (point 6), the Chinese cannot be in the fourth column. Let's place the Chinese in the first column.

6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the Chinese (point 5), so the Chinese cannot be in the third column. Since the Chinese is already in the first column, the third column must be the Egyptian.

   |               | Chinese   | Egyptian   | Woodworking | Car       |
   | Food          | Grapes   | Radish     | Basket     |          |

8. The person driving the airplane is not the person eating grapes (point 16), so the grapes cannot be in the first column. Since the grapes are already in the second column, the first column must be the lime.

   |               | Lime      | Egyptian   | Pomegranate  | Car       |

9. The person who's sport is surfing is not the person who's hobby is dancing (point 15), so the surfer cannot be in the second column. Since the surfer is not in the first or second column, it must be in the third or fourth column. However, since the surfer is not the person driving the airplane (point 15), it must be in the fourth column.

10. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person eating lime (point 11), so the parkour must be in the first or second column. Since the parkour is not the person driving the airplane (point 15), it must be in the first column.

   |               | Lime      | Parkour    | Pomegranate  | Surfing   |

11. The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing (point 12), so the baker must be in the first or second column. Since the baker is not the person eating lime (point 4), it must be in the second column.

12. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (point 9), so the rower must be in the third or fourth column. Since the rower is not the person driving the car (point 14), it must be in the fourth column.

15. The person who's hobby is dancing is not the person who's sport is surfing (point 15), so the dancer cannot be in the fourth column. Since the dancer is not the person driving the airplane (point 16), it must be in the first, second, or third column. However, since the dancer is not the person eating lime (point 4) or the person eating pomegranate (point 13), it must be in the third column.

Lv6-5x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the number of rows.

2. We know the favorite beverages, food, jobs, movie-genres, and nationalities. Let's fill in these categories with the given options.

3. Let's start with the nationalities since we have a clue about their positions. Since the brazilian is in an even position, we can place them in the 2nd or 4th position. Let's place them in the 2nd position (as we'll see later, this placement works).

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |
   | Beverage      |            | brazilian     |              |                |
   | Food          |            |               |              |                |
   | Job           |            |               |              |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |            |               |              |                |
   | Nationality   |            | brazilian     |              |                |

4. The german is to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the brazilian is in the 2nd position and we know the nationalities are in even positions, the german must be in the 1st position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Movie-Genre   |            |               |              |                |
   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     |              |                |

5. The police-officer is the person drinking sprite. Since the german is in the 1st position, the police-officer must be in the 3rd position (as there are only 4 options left).

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer|                |

6. The security-guard is to the right of the person eating corn (which we know is the french). Since the french is in the 1st position and the police-officer is in the 3rd position, the security-guard must be in the 4th position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

7. The analyst is the person drinking water. Since there is only one position left (the 2nd), the analyst must be in the 2nd position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Movie-Genre   |            |               |              |              |
   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

8. The person eating peas is between the person watching mystery movies and the police-officer. Since the police-officer is in the 3rd position and we know the nationalities are in even positions, the person eating peas must be in the 2nd position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

9. The person watching musical movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is in an even position (3rd) and we know the movie-genres are in the same order as their nationalities (even-odd-even-odd), the person watching musical movies must be in the 2nd position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

10. The person watching zombie movies is in an even position. Since the person watching musical movies is in the 2nd position, the person watching zombie movies must be in the 4th position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

11. The person watching mystery movies is to the right of the indonesian. Since the indonesian is in an even position (2nd) and the person watching mystery movies is in an odd position (4th), the person watching mystery movies must be in the 3rd position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

12. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the videographer. Since the videographer is not listed yet, we can't place the 7up yet.

13. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the brazilian. Since the brazilian is in the 2nd position, the person drinking coffee must be in the 1st position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

   | Nationality   | german     | brazilian     | police-officer| security-guard|

14. The person eating corn is the french. Since the french is already in the 1st position (eating food), this clue is redundant.

15. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the videographer. Since the person drinking coffee is in the 1st position, the person drinking 7up must be in the 2nd position.

   |               |     1      |       2        |      3       |       4        |

Lv6-5x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the numbers 1 to 4 in the first row of the table.

2. We know there are 4 different beverages, so we can fill in the columns with 7up, cola, juice, and milk.

3. Similarly, we know there are 4 movie-genres, 4 nationalities, 4 pets, and 4 means of transport, so we can fill in the remaining columns with family, fantasy, mystery, western, colombian, spanish, thai, turkish, chinchilla, goldfish, hedgehog, turtle, snowmobile, subway, tram, and van.

4. From rule 1, we know the person driving the tram is person 1, so we can place the tram in the first row under Transport. Since the person drinking juice is to the left of the person driving the tram (rule 1), we can place juice in the first column under Beverage.

5. From rule 2, we know the Turkish is not the person driving the van, so the van cannot be in the first row. Let's place the van in the second row.

6. From rule 3, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the tram is in the first row, the turtle cannot be in the first row. Let's place the turtle in the second row. This means 7up must be in the second column.

7. From rule 4, we know the Thai is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the tram is in the first row, the Thai cannot be in the first row either. Let's place the Thai in the second row. This means the goldfish (owned by the Thai, rule 9) must be in the second column.

8. From rule 5, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since the turtle and the Thai are in the second row, the milk must be in the second row as well. This means the chinchilla must be in the third column.

9. From rule 6, we know the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram. Since the tram is in the first row and 7up is in the second row, the person driving the snowmobile (which is the snowmobile, rule 14) must be in the second row. This means the snowmobile is to the right of the person drinking 7up and the hedgehog (owned by the snowmobile driver, rule 14) must be in the fourth column.

10. From rule 7, we know the person drinking juice is the person drinking juice. This means the first row and first column are filled.

11. From rule 8, we know the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile is in the second row, the mystery movies must be in the third column.

12. From rule 12, we know the person watching western movies is not the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is in the second row, the western movies must be in a row other than the second row. Let's place the western movies in the fourth row.

13. From rule 13, we know the person drinking cola is in an even position. Since the first and third positions are filled, the cola must be in the second or fourth position. Since the cola is not the Turkish (rule 10), it cannot be in the fourth position. So, the cola is in the second position.

14. From rule 15, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the goldfish is in the second column, the hedgehog must be in the third or fourth column. Since the hedgehog is not the Turkish (rule 10), it cannot be in the fourth column. So, the hedgehog is in the third column.

15. From rule 16, we know the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the milk is in the second row and the mystery movies are in the third column, the person drinking milk must be in the fourth column.

16. From rule 17, we know the Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the fantasy movies are not in the first row (they are in the fourth row), the Spanish must be in the first, second, or fourth column. Since the Spanish is not the Turkish (rule 10) or the Colombian (rule 11), the Spanish cannot be in the fourth column. So, the Spanish is in the first column.

17. From rule 18, we know the Spanish is somewhere to the left of the Colombian. Since the Spanish is in the first column, the Colombian must be in the second column.

18. From rule 16, we know the person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is in the second row, the fantasy movies must be in a row other than the second row. Let's place the fantasy movies in the third row.

19. From rule 11, we know the Colombian is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the Spanish is in the first column and the Colombian is not in the first row (it's in the second column), the subway must be in the second row.

20. From rule 13, we know the person drinking cola is in an even position. Since the cola is in the second position, the person driving the subway (which is the Colombian, rule 11) must be in the fourth position.

21. From rule 16, we know the person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is in the second row, the fantasy movies must be in a row other than the second row. Let's place the fantasy movies in the third row.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```

| Beverage   | Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet           | Transport |

This is the final solution table."	{'juice': ['juice', 'colombian', 'chinchilla', 'tram'], '7up': ['mystery', 'spanish', 'hedgehog', 'snowmobile'], 'cola': ['fantasy', 'thai', 'goldfish', 'subway'], 'milk': ['western', 'turkish', 'turtle', 'van']}	False	0	False
Lv6-5x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, each with a unique preference for a movie genre, music genre, pet, sport, and transport. Let's assign numbers to each category for easier reference.

   |               |      1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           |           |          |           |            |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |            |
   | Transport     |           |          |           |            |

2. From rule 3, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left. So, let's assign the chinchilla to person 1.

   |               |      1 (Chinchilla)      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |           |           |            |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |            |
   | Transport     |           |          |           |            |

3. From rule 8, the person driving the snowmobile is the owner of the chinchilla. So, let's assign snowmobile to person 1.

   |               |      1 (Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |           |           |            |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |            |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile|           |           |            |

4. From rule 9, the person with the chinchilla is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the chinchilla on the far left, the chinchilla owner must be on the far right for the other options. So, let's swap the positions of people 1 and 4.

   |               |      4 (Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    1     |     3     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |           |           |            |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |            |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile|           |           |            |

5. From rule 1, the people prefer 4 different movie-genres. We have already assigned a genre to the chinchilla owner (no movie genre yet). Let's assign adventure to person 4 (since it's the first genre mentioned in the puzzle).

   |               |      4 (Chinchilla, Snowmobile, Adventure)      |    1     |     3     |     2      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Adventure |           |           |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla |           |           |            |
   | Sport         |           |          |           |            |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile|           |           |            |

6. From rule 11, the person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the chinchilla owner on the far right, the documentary movie must be on the far left. So, let's assign documentary to person 1.

   |               |      1 (Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    4     |     3     |     2      |

7. From rule 13, the owner of the lizard is on the right of the fan country. Since we have already placed the chinchilla owner on the far right, the lizard owner must be on the far left. So, let's swap the positions of people 1 and 4 again.

   |               |      4 (Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    1     |     3     |     2      |

8. From rule 14, the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since we have already placed the lizard owner on the far left, the golf sport must be on the right. So, let's assign golf to person 3.

   |               |      4 (Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    1     |     3 (Golf)     |     2      |

   | Transport     | Snowmobile|           |           |            |

9. From rule 15, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since we have already placed the lizard owner on the far left, the mouse owner must be on the far right. So, let's swap the positions of people 2 and 4.

   |               |      4 (Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    2 (Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     1      |

   | Sport         |           | Golf      |           |            |
   | Transport     | Snowmobile|           |           |            |

10. From rule 16, the person driving the tram is on the far left or far right. Since we have already placed the chinchilla owner on the far right, the tram driver must be on the far left. So, let's assign tram to person 1.

   |               |      1 (Tram, Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    2 (Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary |           | Adventure |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      |           |           |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

11. From rule 2, the person who's sport is tennis is the person driving the boat. Since we have already assigned the tram to person 1, let's assign tennis to person 2 (since it's the next sport mentioned in the puzzle).

   |               |      1 (Tram, Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    2 (Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4      |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary |           | Adventure |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    |           |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

12. From rule 12, the person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the lizard. Since we have already assigned golf to person 3, the lizard cannot be their pet. Let's assign the lizard to person 4.

   |               |      1 (Tram, Documentary, Chinchilla, Snowmobile)      |    2 (Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4 (Lizard) |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary |           | Adventure |            |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    |           |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

13. From rule 5, the person watching disaster movies is the owner of the chinchilla. Since we have already assigned the chinchilla to person 4, let's assign disaster to person 4.

   |               |      1 (Tram, Documentary)      |    2 (Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4 (Disaster, Chinchilla, Lizard) |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary |           | Adventure | Disaster      |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    |           |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

14. From rule 6, the person who's sport is handball is in an even position. Since we have already placed tennis (position 2) and golf (position 3), handball must be in position 4 or 6. However, position 6 is already occupied by the chinchilla owner (who is also the snowmobile driver and disaster movie watcher). So, let's assign handball to person 2.

   |               |      1 (Tram, Documentary)      |    2 (Handball, Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4 (Disaster, Chinchilla, Lizard) |
   | Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Handball | Adventure | Disaster      |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    | Handball   |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

15. From rule 4, the fan ambient is not the person who's sport is golf. Since we have already assigned golf to person 3, let's assign ambient to person 1.

   |               |      1 (Ambient, Tram, Documentary)      |    2 (Handball, Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4 (Disaster, Chinchilla, Lizard) |
   | Movie-Genre   | Ambient | Handball | Adventure | Disaster      |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
   | Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
   | Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    | Handball   |            |
   | Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |

16. From rule 10, the person who's sport is handball is not the owner of the chinchilla. Since we have already assigned the chinchilla to person 4, handball cannot be their sport. However, we have already assigned handball to person 2. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle as it cannot be solved with the given rules.

The final solution table would be:

#############
|               |      1 (Ambient, Tram, Documentary)      |    2 (Handball, Tennis, Mouse)     |     3 (Golf)     |     4 (Disaster, Chinchilla, Lizard) |
| Movie-Genre   | Ambient | Handball | Adventure | Disaster      |
| Music-Genre   |           |          |           |            |
| Pet           | Chinchilla | Lizard    |            | Mouse      |
| Sport         | Golf      | Tennis    | Handball   |            |
| Transport     | Tram      |           | Snowmobile|            |
