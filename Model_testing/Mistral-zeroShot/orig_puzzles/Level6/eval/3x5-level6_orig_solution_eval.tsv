Lv6-3x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3, we know that the fan disco and fan hip-hop are not adjacent. Let's place the fan hip-hop in the middle (position 3). Now, the fan disco can be either on the left (position 1) or the right (position 5).

2. From rule 2, the fan disco is to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 3, the ferret cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the ferret must be in position 2 or 4. If the ferret is in position 2, the fan disco must be in position 5. If the ferret is in position 4, the fan disco must be in position 1.

3. From rule 4, the owner of the frog is on the far left or far right. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 3 and the ferret cannot be in position 1, the frog must be in position 1.

4. From rule 6, the owner of the ferret is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. So, the hedgehog cannot be in position 2 or 3. If the hedgehog is in position 4, the ferret must be in position 5. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the ferret must be in position 2.

5. From rule 9, the owner of the hedgehog is to the right of the freelancer. So, the freelancer cannot be in position 5. If the hedgehog is in position 4, the freelancer must be in position 1. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the freelancer must be in position 2.

6. From rule 12, the owner of the goldfish is to the left of the freelancer. So, the goldfish must be in position 1 if the freelancer is in position 2, and the goldfish must be in position 2 if the freelancer is in position 1.

7. From rule 10, the paramedic is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. So, the paramedic cannot be in position 1 or 2. If the hedgehog is in position 4, the paramedic must be in position 3. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the paramedic must be in position 4.

8. From rule 7, the videographer is to the left of the paramedic. So, the videographer cannot be in position 3 or 4. If the paramedic is in position 4, the videographer must be in position 5. If the paramedic is in position 3, the videographer must be in position 1.

9. From rule 14, the videographer is not the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 3, the videographer cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the videographer must be in position 2 or 4.

10. From rule 15, the fan rock is the doctor. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 3, the doctor cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the doctor must be in position 2 or 4. If the doctor is in position 2, the fan rock must be in position 5 (since the fan rock is the doctor and the fan hip-hop is in position 3). If the doctor is in position 4, the fan rock must be in position 1.

11. From rule 11, the fan pop is on the left or right of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in position 3, the fan pop can be in position 1 or 5. If the fan pop is in position 1, the fan rock must be in position 2 (since the fan rock is the doctor and the fan hip-hop is in position 3). If the fan pop is in position 5, the fan rock must be in position 4.

12. From rule 8, the fan metal is on the left or right of the fan rock. Since the fan rock is in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1), the fan metal can be in position 2 or 3. If the fan rock is in position 4 (if the fan pop is in position 5), the fan metal can be in position 3 or 5.

13. From rule 5, the fan rock is the doctor. So, the doctor is in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 4 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

14. From rule 6, the owner of the ferret is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. So, the ferret cannot be in position 2 (if the doctor is in position 1) or position 5 (if the doctor is in position 4).

15. From rule 4, the owner of the frog is on the far left or far right. Since the doctor is in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 4 (if the fan pop is in position 5), the frog must be in position 5 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

16. From rule 9, the owner of the hedgehog is to the right of the freelancer. So, the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 5 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

17. From rule 10, the paramedic is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. So, the paramedic cannot be in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 5 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

18. From rule 1, the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the frog is in position 5 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 5), the ferret must be in position 2 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 4 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

19. From rule 6, the owner of the ferret is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. So, the ferret cannot be in position 1 (if the fan pop is in position 1) or position 4 (if the fan pop is in position 5).

20. Therefore, the fan pop must be in position 5 (since the fan pop can only be in position 1 or 5, and it cannot be in position 1 due to the position of the ferret).

Now, let's place the remaining jobs and pets:

- The doctor is in position 1 (since the fan pop is in position 5).
- The fan rock is the doctor, so it is also in position 1.
- The fan metal can be in position 3 or 5 (since the fan rock is in position 1).
- The fan hip-hop is in position 3 (since the fan metal is not in position 3, and the fan hip-hop must be on the left or right of the fan metal).
- The videographer can be in position 2 or 4 (since the fan hip-hop is in position 3).
- The paramedic cannot be in position 1 or 5 (since the owner of the hedgehog is to the right of the paramedic and the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 or 5). So, the paramedic must be in position 4.
- The owner of the hedgehog is to the right of the freelancer, so the hedgehog cannot be in position 1 or 5. If the paramedic is in position 4, the hedgehog must be in position 2. If the paramedic is in position 3, the hedgehog must be in position 5.
- The owner of the ferret is to the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so the ferret cannot be in position 1 or 5. If the hedgehog is in position 2, the ferret must be in position 4. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the ferret must be in position 2.
- The owner of the frog is on the far left or far right. Since the doctor and the fan hip-hop are in positions 1 and 3, the frog must be in position 5 (since the frog cannot be in position 1 due to rule 4).
- The goldfish is to the left of the freelancer, so the goldfish cannot be in position 5. If the hedgehog is in position 2, the goldfish must be in position 1. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the goldfish must be in position 4.
- The snake is not the paramedic, so the snake cannot be in position 4. If the hedgehog is in position 2, the snake must be in position 3. If the hedgehog is in position 5, the snake must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv6-3x5-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 3 and 4, we know that the person playing lacrosse is between cycling and blueberry (either left or right). Since the person playing lacrosse also does rock-climbing (rule 5), we can place them in the table as follows:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse | Cycling | ? | ? | ? |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

   Now, we know that the person playing lacrosse is eating blueberry or zucchini (rule 1). Since the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating blueberry (rule 13), the person playing lacrosse must be eating blueberry.

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Cycling | ? | ? | ? |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

2. From rule 2, the person doing filmmaking is on the left of the person playing cycling. So, we can place filmmaking in the second position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Filmmaking | Cycling | ? | ? |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

3. From rule 8, the person doing photography is on the left or right of the person doing filmmaking. Since we already placed filmmaking in the second position, photography can be in the first or third position. Let's place it in the third position for now:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Filmmaking | Photography | Cycling | ? |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

4. From rule 7, the person doing rock-climbing is on the left of the person doing reading. Since we already placed rock-climbing in the second position, reading must be in the fourth position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Filmmaking | Photography | Reading | Cycling |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

5. From rule 11, the person eating mango is on the left or right of the person playing cricket. Since we already placed blueberry, filmmaking, photography, and reading, the only available positions for cricket are the first and fifth. Let's place cricket in the fifth position for now:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Filmmaking | Photography | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

6. From rule 12, the person playing cricket is on the left of the person eating mango. Since we already placed cricket in the fifth position, the person eating mango must be in the third position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Filmmaking | Mango | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

7. From rule 6, the person playing soccer is on the right of the person eating lemon. Since we already placed blueberry, filmmaking, photography, mango, and cricket, the only available positions for soccer are the second and fourth. Let's place soccer in the fourth position for now:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Soccer | Mango | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | ? | ? | ? | ? |

8. From rule 10, the person eating lemon is not the person playing soccer. Since we already placed soccer in the fourth position, the person eating lemon must be in the first, second, or fifth position. Let's place lemon in the first position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Soccer | Mango | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Lemon | ? | ? | ? |

9. From rule 9, the person eating cucumber is in an even position. Since we already placed lemon, mango, and soccer, the only available even positions for cucumber are the second and fourth. However, the fourth position is occupied by soccer, so cucumber must be in the second position:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Cucumber | Mango | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Lemon | ? | ? | ? |

10. From rule 15, the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person doing woodworking. Since we already placed cucumber in the second position, woodworking can be in the first or third position. Let's place woodworking in the third position:

    |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Cucumber | Woodworking | Reading | Cricket |
    | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Lemon | ? | ? | ? |

11. From rule 8, the person doing photography is on the left or right of the person doing filmmaking. Since we already placed filmmaking in the second position, photography can only be in the first position:

    |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Photography | Cucumber | Woodworking | Cricket |
    | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Filmmaking | Lemon | Reading | ? |

12. From rule 7, the person doing rock-climbing is on the left of the person doing reading. Since we already placed rock-climbing in the second position, reading must be in the fourth position:

    |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Photography | Cucumber | Reading | Cricket |
    | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Filmmaking | Lemon | ? | ? |

13. From rule 14, the person eating mango is not the person playing cricket. Since we already placed cricket in the fifth position, the person eating mango must be in the first, second, third, or fourth position. However, we already placed photography, rock-climbing, filmaking, and reading in the first, second, third, and fourth positions, respectively. This contradicts rule 11, which states that mango is on the left or right of cricket. Therefore, there seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle.

The final solution table, considering the contradiction, is:

   |   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Sport | Lacrosse (Blueberry) | Photography | Cucumber | Reading | Cricket |
   | Hobby | Rock-climbing | Filmmaking | Lemon | ? | ? |

However, the puzzle contains a contradiction, and it is not possible to solve it with the given rules."	{}	False	0	False
Lv6-3x5-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person driving the boat owns the lizard. Let's place the lizard owner (L) and the boat driver (B) in the table. Since there are 5 nationalities, the lizard owner can't be Argentine (A) or Australian (Au) because they can't own the rabbit (R). So, L can be Indian (I), Brazilian (Br), or Pakistani (P). Let's place L as I for now.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | I  |   |   |   |   |
   | Pet | L  |   |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

2. The Argentine (A) can't be the owner of the rabbit (R), so A can't be in column 4. Also, A can't be the person driving the quad-bike (Q), so A can't be in column 2. So, A can be in columns 1, 3, or 5. Let's place A in column 1 for now.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | I  |   |   |   |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

3. The Australian (Au) can't be the person driving the quad-bike (Q), so Au can't be in column 2. Since Au is not in column 1 (because A is there), Au can be in columns 3, 4, or 5. Let's place Au in column 3 for now.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | I  | Au |   |   |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

4. The person driving the train (T) is on the left of the person driving the boat (B), so T can't be in column 5. Since T can't be in column 1 (because A is there), T can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. Let's place T in column 2 for now.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | T  | Au |   |   |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

5. The owner of the goat (G) is the person driving the roller (R), so G and R are the same. Since G can't be in column 1 (because A is there), G can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's place G in column 4 for now.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | T  | Au | G  |   |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

6. The Brazilian (Br) is between the Australian (Au) and the person driving the roller (G). Since Br can't be in column 1 (because A is there), Br can be in columns 2, 3, or 4. Br can't be in column 2 (because T is there), and Br can't be in column 4 (because G is there). So, Br can only be in column 3.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | T  | Br | G  |   |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

7. The Pakistani (P) is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit (R). Since P can't be in column 1 (because A is there), P can be in columns 2, 3, 4, or 5. P can't be in column 2 (because T is there), P can't be in column 3 (because Br is there), and P can't be in column 4 (because G is there). So, P can only be in column 5.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | T  | Br | G  | P  |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

8. The owner of the ferret (F) is in the middle. Since F can't be in column 1 (because A is there), F can't be in column 5 (because P is there), so F must be in column 3.

   |   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
   |---|---|---|---|---|---|
   | Nat | A  | T  | F  | G  | P  |
   | Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
   | Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

9. The person driving the quad-bike (Q) is in an odd position. Since Q can't be in column 1 (because A is there), Q can't be in column 2 (because T is there), and Q can't be in column 4 (because G is there). So, Q can only be in column 3. But we already placed F there, so Q can't be the quad-bike driver. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

|   | 1  | 2  | 3  | 4  | 5  |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| Nat | A  | T  | F  | G  | P  |
| Pet |   | L  |   |   |   |
| Tran | B  |   |   |   |   |

Without the contradiction, the solution would be different. However, the given puzzle seems to have an inconsistency."	{'nat': ['a', 't', 'f', 'g', 'p'], 'pet': ['', 'l', '', '', ''], 'tran': ['b', '', '', '', '']}	False	0	False
Lv6-3x5-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The owner of the rat is on the far left (row 4), so we can fill the first column with the pets. Let's put Rat in the first column, and the other pets will be placed accordingly.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |
   |--------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
   | Pet    | Rat      | Cat      | Dog     | Pony      | Frogs     |

2. The scientist is on the left of the owner of the frog (row 2), so the scientist must be in the second column. Since the musician can be on the far left or far right (row 10), the scientist cannot be in the first or last column. So, the scientist is in the third column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

   | Pet    | Rat      | Cat      | Scientist| Pony      | Frogs     |

3. The person eating apple is on the right of the owner of the rat (row 1), so the apple eater must be in the second, third, or fifth column. Since the pear eater is somewhere to the left of the scientist (row 3), the apple eater cannot be in the third column. So, the apple eater is either in the second or fifth column.

   Let's assume the apple eater is in the second column for now. This means the food in the first column must be either eggplant, pear, or raspberry. If it were pear, the pear eater would be on the left of the scientist (row 3), which contradicts our assumption that the apple eater is in the second column. So, the food in the first column cannot be pear. If it were raspberry, the owner of the rat would be the person eating raspberry (row 8), which contradicts our initial placement of the rat owner. So, the food in the first column must be eggplant.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

4. Now, the person eating pear is somewhere to the left of the scientist (row 3), so the pear eater must be in the first or second column. Since the pear eater is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony (row 7), the pear eater cannot be in the first column. So, the pear eater is in the second column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

   | Pet    | Rat      | Pear     | Scientist| Pony      | Frogs     |

5. The person eating pear is on the left or right of the engineer (row 6), but we already know the pear eater is in the second column, so the engineer must be in the first or third column. Since the musician can be on the far left or far right (row 10), the engineer cannot be in the first column. So, the engineer is in the third column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

6. The person eating pear is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony (row 7), so the pony owner must be in the fourth column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

7. The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the cat (row 9), so the dog owner must be in the first column, and the cat owner must be in the second column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |
   |--------|----------|----------|---------|-----------|-----------|
   | Pet    | Dog      | Cat      | Engineer | Pony      | Scientist |

8. The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the musician (row 10), but we already know the engineer is in the third column, so the musician must be in the first or fifth column. Since the musician can be on the far left or far right (row 10), the musician can be in either the first or fifth column. If the musician were in the first column, the person eating eggplant would have to be in the second column, but the only food left for the second column is pear, which contradicts our placement of the pear eater. So, the musician must be in the fifth column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

   | Pet    | Dog      | Cat      | Engineer | Pony      | Musician  |

9. The only food left is plum and raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry cannot be the owner of the rat (row 8), the plum eater must be in the first column, and the raspberry eater must be in the fifth column.

   |        |     1     |    2     |    3    |     4     |     5     |

Lv6-3x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is in position 4, which means row 4.

2. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle (position 3), it can't be soccer (position 4). So, let's assume the hobby of position 1, 2, or 5 is collecting.

3. The person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, so the sport of position 3 can't be soccer (position 4).

4. Let's place the hobby of position 1, 2, or 5 as collecting. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's sport is soccer, video-games can't be in position 1 (left of soccer). So, let's place video-games in position 5.

5. Now, the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 5, and the person who's sport is soccer is in position 4. Since video-games is on the left or right of soccer, soccer must be in position 3.

6. The person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, so the sport of position 3 is soccer. The person who's sport is soccer is in position 4, so the sport of position 1, 2, or 5 can't be soccer.

7. The person watching superhero movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is the hobby of position 10 (soccer is in position 3), the person watching superhero movies is in position 10.

8. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (position 3), adventure movies can't be in position 4 (right of position 3). So, let's place adventure movies in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since video-games is in position 5, reading can't be in position 5. So, let's place reading in position 1.

10. The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since superhero movies are in position 10, horror movies can't be in position 10. So, let's place horror movies in position 9.

11. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since action movies haven't been placed yet, let's place action movies in position 8 (left of horror movies).

12. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since adventure movies are in position 2, western movies can't be in position 1 (left of position 2). So, let's place western movies in position 6.

13. The person who's sport is cycling is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is the hobby of position 10, the person who's sport is cycling is in position 10.

14. The person who's sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since video-games is in position 5, the person who's sport is rugby is in position 5.

15. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting (position 3). So, let's place snowboarding in position 6 (right of position 3).

16. The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since action movies are in position 8, horror movies are in position 9 (right of position 8).

17. The person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since superhero movies are in position 10, action movies are in position 8 (left of position 10).

18. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in position 6, adventure movies are in position 2 (left of position 6).

Now, let's put the final solution table:

Lv6-3x5-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the people with unique jobs. Since the security-guard can't own the ferret, we'll place the other jobs in the first four spots, leaving the last spot for the security-guard. Let's place the dancer in the first spot, the architect in the second spot, the lawyer in the third spot, and the paramedic in the fourth spot. This leaves the fifth spot for the security-guard.

2. The owner of the rat eats blueberry, so we'll place the blueberry in the second column, which means the rat owner is the person in the first spot (dancer).

3. The ferret owner is to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is in the fourth spot, the ferret owner must be in the third spot (architect).

4. The grapefruit eater is to the right of the dancer and the blueberry eater. Since the dancer is in the first spot and the blueberry eater is in the second spot, the grapefruit eater must be in the fifth spot (security-guard).

5. The grapefruit eater is between the orange eater and the architect. Since the architect is in the second spot and the grapefruit eater is in the fifth spot, the orange eater must be in the fourth spot (paramedic).

6. The hamster owner is to the right of the bird owner. Since we know the positions of the dancer, rat owner (dancer), ferret owner (architect), and grapefruit eater (security-guard), the bird owner must be in the third spot. This means the hamster owner is in the fifth spot (security-guard).

7. The bird owner is between the peach eater and the blueberry eater. Since the blueberry eater is in the second spot and the bird owner is in the third spot, the peach eater must be in the first spot (dancer).

8. The owner of the bird is not the security-guard, so it must be the lawyer. This means the lawyer is the bird owner.

9. The owner of the bird is to the left of the blueberry eater. Since the blueberry eater is in the second spot, the lawyer (bird owner) must be in the first spot. This means the dancer (peach eater) is in the third spot.

10. The paramedic is not the bird owner, so the paramedic must be the hamster owner.

11. The architect is to the right of the dancer, so the architect is in the fourth spot.

12. The orange eater is to the right of the architect, so the orange eater is in the fifth spot (security-guard).

13. The grapefruit eater is to the left of the orange eater, so the grapefruit eater is in the fourth spot (paramedic).

14. The person eating peach is the dancer.

15. The lawyer is the bird owner, so the lawyer is eating neither peach nor blueberry. The only remaining food for the lawyer is the grapefruit.

16. The only food left for the architect is the orange.

17. The only food left for the paramedic is the blueberry.

18. The only pet left for the security-guard is the hamster.

Here is the final solution table:

2. From rule 2, the weightlifting person is between the pony owner and the cat owner. Since the rat owner is in the first column, the pony owner must be in the third column, and the cat owner in the fourth column. The weightlifting person can be in the second or fifth column. Let's place the weightlifting person in the fifth column for now.

3. From rule 3, the chess person is between the traveling person and the cat owner. Since the rat owner is in the first column, the traveling person must be in the second column. The cat owner is in the fourth column, so the chess person can be in the third column.

| Hobby   | Rat   | Chess   |    5     |     3     |       4       |     |

4. From rule 4, the climbing person is to the left of the biathlon person. Since the rat owner is in the first column, the climbing person can be in the first column. The biathlon person cannot be in the first or second column, so it must be in the third, fourth, or fifth column.

5. From rule 5, the lacrosse person is not the cat owner. Since the cat owner is in the fourth column, the lacrosse person cannot be in the fourth column.

6. From rule 6, the cricket person is to the right of the dog owner. Since the rat owner is in the first column, the dog owner cannot be in the first column. The dog owner must be in the second, third, or fifth column.

7. From rule 7, the singing person is to the right of the cricket person. The cricket person cannot be in the first column, so the singing person cannot be in the second column.

8. From rule 8, the singing person is to the right of the cooking person. The cooking person cannot be in the first column, so the singing person cannot be in the second column either.

9. From rule 9, the pony owner is to the right of the horse owner. The pony owner is in the third column, so the horse owner must be in the first or second column.

10. From rule 10, the biathlon person is not the dog owner. The dog owner cannot be in the first column, so the biathlon person cannot be in the second column.

11. From rule 11, the biathlon person is not the cat owner. The cat owner is in the fourth column, so the biathlon person cannot be in the fourth column.

12. From rule 12, the dog owner is on the left or right of the gardening person. The dog owner cannot be in the first column, so the gardening person must be in the second, third, or fifth column.

13. From rule 13, the lacrosse person is on the left or right of the climbing person. The climbing person is in the first column, so the lacrosse person can be in the first or second column.

14. From rule 14, the horse owner is to the right of the chess person. The chess person is in the third column, so the horse owner must be in the fourth or fifth column.

Now, let's place the remaining people and pets:

- The gardening person can be in the second, third, or fifth column. Let's place the gardening person in the second column.
- The biathlon person cannot be in the first, second, or fourth columns, so it must be in the fifth column.
- The horse owner cannot be in the first column, so it must be in the fourth column.

- The singing person cannot be in the first or second column, so it must be in the fourth column.

Lv6-3x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the frog is on the right of the person eating lemon, and the person eating lemon can't be in position 1 (because of rule 11), the frog owner must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. The person eating lemon can't be in position 1 (rule 11), so it must be in position 2, 3, or 5. Let's assume the person eating lemon is in position 2. This means the frog owner is in position 1.

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is in an even position, which can be 2, 4, or 6. Since the person eating lemon is in position 2, the guinea-pig owner can't be in position 2 (rule 5). So, the guinea-pig owner is either in position 4 or 6. Let's assume the guinea-pig owner is in position 4.

3. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the frog is there), the fisherman can be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the fisherman is in position 3. This means the social-worker is in position 2.

4. The librarian is in an even position and is to the right of the social-worker. So, the librarian can be in position 4 or 6. Since the guinea-pig owner is in position 4, the librarian can't be in position 4. So, the librarian is in position 6.

5. The analyst is somewhere to the right of the librarian. So, the analyst can be in position 5 or 6. Since the librarian is in position 6, the analyst is in position 5.

6. The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the person eating garlic can be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the person eating garlic is in position 1.

7. The person eating garlic is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig owner is in position 4, the person eating garlic can't be in position 2 (because the social-worker is there). So, the person eating garlic is in position 1, and the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 3.

8. The accountant is not the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the accountant can't be in position 1, 2, or 3 (because the social-worker, the person eating garlic, and the person eating lemon are already assigned). So, the accountant can be in position 4 or 5. Let's assume the accountant is in position 4.

9. The person eating kale is on the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the person eating kale can't be in position 1 or 2 (because the social-worker and the person eating lemon are already assigned). So, the person eating kale can be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume the person eating kale is in position 3.

10. The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the social-worker is in position 2, the owner of the pony can't be in position 1 (because the owner of the frog is there). So, the owner of the pony can be in position 2, 3, or 4. Since the librarian is in position 6, the owner of the pony can't be in position 6 (because the owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the cat, and the owner of the cat can't be in position 6). So, the owner of the pony is in position 2, and the owner of the cat is in position 5.

11. The person eating zucchini is the only one left. Since the person eating kale is in position 3, the person eating zucchini must be in position 5.

3. Now, we know that the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking coffee (rule 13), so the coffee drinker must be in position 4.

4. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea (rule 5), and the person drinking cola is the swimmer (rule 2), so the iced-tea drinker must be in position 2.

5. The person drinking cola is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person drinking iced-tea (rule 8), so the cricket player must be in position 3.

6. The person who's sport is biathlon is the fan of hip-hop (rule 3), and the biathlon player must be on the far right (rule 12), so the hip-hop fan must be in position 1.

7. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola (rule 1), but not the fan of funk (rule 7), so the badminton player must be in position 4 (since the cola drinker is in position 5).

8. The fan of rock is in an odd position (rule 9), and all positions are taken, so the fan of rock must be in position 3.

9. The person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk (rule 4), but we already placed the badminton player in position 4, so the fan of funk must be in position 1.

10. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee (rule 10), and we already placed the iced-tea drinker in position 2 and the coffee drinker in position 4, so the coffee drinker must be in position 3.

172. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling (7). Since the traveler is in column 5, romance movies must be in column 3.

173. The owner of the hamster is to the right of the owner of the animation movies (11). Since animation is in column 4, hamster is in column 5.

174. The person watching animation movies is not the person who's hobby is traveling (12). This contradicts our assumption that traveler is in column 5. So, the traveler must be in column 1.

175. Now, the gardener is on the far right (column 5), the traveler is on the far left (column 1), and the cook is in the middle (column 3).
