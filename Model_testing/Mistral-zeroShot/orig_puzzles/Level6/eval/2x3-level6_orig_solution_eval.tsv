Lv6-2x3-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person driving the tram, and there are only three options, the hot-chocolate must be in the first column. Let's place it in the first row (Beverage 1).

2. Now, the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the hot-chocolate is already in the first column, the sprite must be in the second column. But we know that the person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite, so the sprite cannot be in the first row (Beverage 1). Therefore, the sprite must be in the second row (Beverage 2).

3. This leaves the third row (Beverage 3) for the juice. Since the person driving the scooter is to the right of the person drinking sprite, the scooter must be in the third row.

4. Now, we know that the person driving the tram is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate is in the first row, the tram must be in the third row.

So, the final solution table is:

  | Beverage    |       1       |   2    |    3    |

| Tram          |               |        | Juice   |

Now, let's fill in the Transport column:

1. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person driving the tram, the tram must be in the third column.

2. The person driving the scooter is to the right of the person drinking sprite, so the scooter must be in the first column.

3. The person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite, so the train cannot be in the second column (where the sprite is). Since the scooter is in the first column, the train must be in the third column.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x3-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are three people, each preferring a different food and a different movie genre. So, we can list all possible combinations of food and genres for the first person:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  |
   | Corn             | Fantasy                 |
   | Corn             | Thriller                |
   | Lime             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Fantasy                 |
   | Lime             | Thriller                |
   | Mango            | Family                  |
   | Mango            | Fantasy                 |
   | Mango            | Thriller                |

2. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching family movies. This means that the Fantasy-Family combinations are invalid. So, we can cross them out:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  |
   | Corn             | Thriller                |
   | Lime             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Thriller                |
   | Mango            | Family                  |
   | Mango            | Thriller                |

3. The person eating corn is not the person watching thriller movies. This means that the Corn-Thriller combinations are invalid. So, we can cross them out:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Thriller                |
   | Mango            | Family                  |
   | Mango            | Thriller                |

4. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango. This means that the Thriller-Mango combination is invalid. So, we can cross it out:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Family                  |
   | Lime             | Thriller                |
   | Mango            | Family                  |

5. Now, we are left with only one possible combination for Person 1: Corn and Family. We can fill that in and move on to Person 2:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) | Food 2 (Person 2) | Movie-Genre 2 (Person 2) | Food 3 (Person 3) | Movie-Genre 3 (Person 3) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  |                |                         |                |                         |

6. Since there are only two movie genres left (Fantasy and Thriller), and Person 1 is watching Family, Person 2 must watch either Fantasy or Thriller. If Person 2 watches Fantasy, then Person 3 must watch Thriller, but that's not possible because Person 3 is to the right of Person 2 (who is eating mango). So, Person 2 must watch Thriller.

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) | Food 2 (Person 2) | Movie-Genre 2 (Person 2) | Food 3 (Person 3) | Movie-Genre 3 (Person 3) |
   |------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
   | Corn             | Family                  | Lime             | Thriller                | Mango            | Fantasy                |

7. Now, the only food left for Person 3 is Mango. So, the final solution is:

   | Food 1 (Person 1) | Movie-Genre 1 (Person 1) | Food 2 (Person 2) | Movie-Genre 2 (Person 2) | Food 3 (Person 3) | Movie-Genre 3 (Person 3) |

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know that there are three people, each preferring a different movie genre (disaster, epic, mystery) and a different music genre (blues, hip-hop, soul).

2. From rule 1, we know that the person watching epic movies is not a fan of blues. So, we can rule out the first row for the epic movie genre.

3. From rule 2, the person watching mystery movies is between the person watching epic movies and the fan of soul. Since the epic movie fan is not in the first row, the mystery movie fan must be in the second or third row. Also, the fan of soul is to the right of the epic movie fan (rule 3), so the mystery movie fan must be in the first column.

4. Now we know that the mystery movie fan is in the first column and the second row. This means the epic movie fan is in the second column and the third row (since the mystery movie fan is between the epic movie fan and the fan of soul).

5. From rule 4, the fan of soul is on the far left or far right. Since the epic movie fan is in the second column, the fan of soul must be in the first or third column. However, since the fan of soul is to the right of the epic movie fan (rule 3), the fan of soul must be in the third column.

6. Now we know that the fan of soul is in the third column and the third row. The only remaining movie genre for the first row is disaster. The only remaining music genre for the first column is blues.

7. Finally, the only remaining options for the second row and column are hip-hop for the movie genre and soul for the music genre, as the fan of soul is in the third row and column.

The final solution table is:

Lv6-2x3-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are three music genres (dubstep, reggae, rock) and three nationalities (argentine, mexican, polish).

2. From rule 2, the fan of dubstep is to the right of the fan of reggae. So, we can place reggae in the first column and dubstep in the second column. Rock can then be placed in the third column.

   | Music-Genre | Reggae | Dubstep | Rock   |
   |------------|--------|---------|--------|
   | Nationality |       |         |        |

3. From rule 3, the argentine is to the right of the fan of dubstep. Since we already placed dubstep in the second column, the argentine must be in the third column.

   | Music-Genre | Reggae | Dubstep | Rock   |
   |------------|--------|---------|--------|
   | Nationality |       |         | Argentine|

4. Now, from rule 1, the fan of reggae is not the polish. Since we have already placed the argentine in the third column, the polish must be in the first column.

   | Music-Genre | Reggae | Dubstep | Rock   |
   |------------|--------|---------|--------|
   | Nationality | Polish| Argentine|       |

5. Finally, we have the mexican left. Since all the nationalities are placed, the mexican must be the fan of the remaining music genre, rock.

Lv6-2x3-5	"Let's break down the information given and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different beverages and 3 different foods. So, we can arrange them in a 3x3 grid.

2. From rule 1, the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that either 7up is in the first or second column, and iced-tea is in the third column.

3. From rule 2, the person drinking 7up is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person eating asparagus. Since 7up is to the left of iced-tea, and asparagus can't be in the first column (because of rule 3), asparagus must be in the third column.

4. Now we know that 7up is in the first or second column, and asparagus is in the third column. Also, iced-tea is in the third column. So, 7up can't be in the third column. Therefore, 7up must be in the first column.

5. Now we know that 7up is in the first column, asparagus is in the third column, and iced-tea is in the third column as well. Since there are only 3 columns, the only remaining beverage for the second column is almond-milk.

6. The last beverage, iced-tea, must be in the third row because it's to the right of the person drinking 7up (who is in the first row) and the person eating asparagus (who is in the third row).

7. Now we know that the third row contains iced-tea and asparagus. Since banana and raspberry are the only remaining foods, banana must be in the first row, and raspberry must be in the second row.

8. Finally, we know that the person drinking almond-milk can't be the person eating raspberry (rule 4). So, almond-milk must be in the second row, and raspberry must be in the second column.

The final solution table is:

1. We know that the person with the hobby of traveling is not the fan of disco (from point 3). So, the person with the hobby of traveling can be either 1 or 3. Let's assume for now that the person with the hobby of traveling is in position 1.

2. The fan of punk is in position 2 (from point 1).

3. The person with the hobby of traveling cannot be in position 2 because the fan of punk is there (from point 1). So, the person with the hobby of traveling must be in position 3.

4. The person with the hobby of video-games is between the fan of indie and the fan of disco (from point 4). Since the fan of punk is in position 2, the fan of indie must be in position 1. So, the person with the hobby of video-games is in position 2.

5. Now, the only hobby left is photography. Since the fan of indie is in position 1, the fan of disco must be in position 3. So, the person with the hobby of photography is in position 2.

6. To find the music genres, we know that the fan of indie is in position 1, so the music genre of the person with the hobby of photography is indie. The fan of punk is in position 2, so the music genre of the person with the hobby of video-games is punk. Since the fan of disco is in position 3, the music genre of the person with the hobby of traveling is disco.

1. Since the nationalities are different, we can write them down in any order. Let's assume the order is French, Nigerian, Thai from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the Nigerian cannot be eating eggplant. So, the possible foods for the Nigerian are cauliflower and strawberry. Let's place the Nigerian with cauliflower for now (since we don't have any information that favors strawberry). So, the table looks like this:

   | Food          | Cauliflower|   |             |
   | Nationality   | French   | Nigerian  | Thai        |

3. From rule 2, the person eating cauliflower is to the right of the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is already eating cauliflower, the only remaining spot for cauliflower is the rightmost one. So, the table looks like this:

   |               |    1     |     2      |      3      |
   | Food          |   | Cauliflower|   |
   | Nationality   | French   | Nigerian  | Thai        |

4. From rule 3, the person eating strawberry is to the right of the French. Since the French is already in the leftmost position, the only remaining spot for strawberry is the rightmost one. So, the table looks like this:

   | Movie-Genre   | Family  | Action  | Musical |

5. Now, we know that the person watching family movies is to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since family is in the first row and sprite is in the second row, we can't place sprite to the left of family. So, sprite must be in the third row.

Since there are only three people, and one of them is watching scientific movies, the other two must be on the same side. Let's assume for now that the person watching scientific movies is in the middle. This means the person with the hobby of collecting is either on the left or the right.

2. The person with the hobby of singing is not the person watching adventure movies. Since we've placed the person watching scientific movies in the middle, the person watching adventure movies must be on the other side. So, the person with the hobby of singing is also on the same side as the person watching scientific movies.

3. The person with the hobby of collecting is the person watching romance movies. Since we've placed the person watching scientific movies in the middle, the person watching romance movies must be on the opposite side. This means the person with the hobby of collecting cannot be on the left, so it must be on the right.

4. The person with the hobby of collecting is on the far right. Since we've already placed the person with the hobby of collecting, we know it's on the right.

Now, let's place the hobbies and movie genres:

2. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since we don't know the sport of the third person yet, we can't place the snowboarder yet. But we know that the second person (lemonade) is not the snowboarder because the soy-milk person is to the right of the snowboarder.

   | Beverage   | Soy-milk    | Lemonade | Snowboarding |
   | Sport      |            |          |          |

3. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the second person is already the lemonade drinker, the cyclist must be the first person.

   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage   | Cycling    | Lemonade | Snowboarding |
   | Sport      | Cycling    |          |          |

4. The person drinking coffee is not the person who's sport is cycling. Since we already placed the cyclist, the coffee drinker must be the third person.

   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage   | Cycling    | Lemonade | Coffee    |
   | Sport      | Cycling    |          |          |

5. Now we know the sports. The person who's sport is snowboarding must be in the second spot because the soy-milk person is to the right of the snowboarder.

   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage   | Cycling    | Soy-milk | Coffee    |
   | Sport      | Cycling    | Snowboarding |          |

6. Finally, we need to fill in the sports for the first and third person. Since the soy-milk person is to the right of the snowboarder, and the cyclist is to the left of the lemonade person, the only remaining sport for the first person is badminton, and the third person must have badminton as well.

   |            |      1       |    2     |     3     |
   | Beverage   | Cycling    | Soy-milk | Badminton |
   | Sport      | Cycling    | Snowboarding | Badminton |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |      1       |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage   | Cycling    | Soy-milk | Badminton |
| Sport      | Cycling    | Snowboarding | Badminton |
