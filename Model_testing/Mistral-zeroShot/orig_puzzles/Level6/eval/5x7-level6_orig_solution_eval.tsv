Lv6-5x7-2	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the positions of the nationalities
1. The Argentine is in an even position (4, 6, or 8). Let's assume the Argentine is in position 4.
2. The American is to the left of the Argentine (position 3).
3. The Italian is eating grapes, so they are in position 6.
4. The Polish is to the right of the person eating radish (position 5, 7, or 9). Let's assume the Polish is in position 7.
5. The Dutch is not the person eating radish (position 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 10). Let's assume the Dutch is in position 2.
6. The Nigerian is between the person eating tomato and the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the Italian is eating tomato (position 6), the Nigerian can't be in position 5 or 7 (as those are occupied by the American and the Polish). So, the Nigerian is in position 8.
7. The remaining nationality, Argentinean, is on the right of the American (position 5).

Step 2: Identify the positions of the sports
8. The person who's sport is parkour is eating papaya (position 3).
9. The person eating potato is playing ice-hockey (position 4).
10. The person who's sport is biathlon is not the Dutch (position 2), so it can't be the person drinking lemonade (position 1, 5, 7, or 9), so it must be the person drinking fanta (position 6).
11. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the fan indie (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the basketball player can't be in position 1 or 11. Let's assume the basketball player is in position 5.
12. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the skateboarder can't be in position 1 or 11. Let's assume the skateboarder is in position 9.
13. The person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person drinking milk (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11), so it must be the person eating zucchini (position 10).
14. The remaining sport, swimming, is on the left or right of the person drinking milk (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the swimmer can't be in position 1 or 11. Let's assume the swimmer is in position 3.

Step 3: Identify the positions of the music genres
15. The fan techno is in an even position (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the techno fan can't be in position 11. Let's assume the techno fan is in position 6.
16. The fan house is not the Polish (position 7), so it can't be the person drinking fanta (position 6), so it must be the person drinking tea (position 12).
17. The fan ambient is somewhere to the left of the Polish (position 7), so it can't be the person drinking tea (position 12). Let's assume the fan ambient is in position 1.
18. The fan pop is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 13). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the pop fan can't be in position 11. Let's assume the fan pop is in position 13.
19. The fan gospel is on the left or right of the person drinking juice (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the gospel fan can't be in position 11. Let's assume the fan gospel is in position 5.
20. The fan reggae is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 13).

Step 4: Identify the positions of the beverages
21. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Since the American is the fan indie (position 11), the 7up drinker can't be in position 11. Let's assume the 7up drinker is in position 3.

23. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball (position 5), so it can't be the person drinking lemonade (position 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, or 11). Let's assume the person drinking tea is in position 1.

Lv6-5x7-3	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Place the Nationalities
1. From rule 17, we know the Australian is to the left of the Brazilian. Let's place the Australian in position 1 and the Brazilian in position 2.
2. From rule 18, the Australian is to the right of the Russian. So, the Russian must be in position 3.
3. From rule 20, the Polish is to the left of the Australian. So, the Polish is in position 5.
4. From rule 17, the Argentine must be to the left of the Brazilian, so it's either in position 1 or 2. However, the Argentine is the documentary watcher (rule 37), and the documentary watcher can't be the person drinking tea (rule 29). So, the Argentine can't be in position 1 (since the only drink left there is tea). Therefore, the Argentine is in position 2.
5. The remaining nationalities are Italian, Japanese, and Russian. Since the Russian is already placed, the Italian must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker (rule 6), and the Japanese is to the right of the Brazilian (rule 2). So, the Italian is in position 4 and the Japanese is in position 6.

Step 2: Place the Beverages
1. From rule 33, the cola drinker is to the left of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is in position 6, the cola drinker is in position 5. The only food left for the cola drinker is kale (rule 32).
2. From rule 1, the 7up drinker is to the left of the soy-milk drinker. Since the Italian is in position 4, the 7up drinker must be in position 3. The only food left for the 7up drinker is artichoke (rule 7).
3. From rule 34, the juice drinker is to the left of the Russian. Since the Russian is in position 3, the juice drinker is in position 1. The only food left for the juice drinker is kale (rule 35). However, this contradicts rule 32, as there are two people eating kale. So, the juice drinker can't be in position 1. Let's place the juice drinker in position 2 for now.
4. From rule 41, the sprite drinker is in an even position. Since the 7up drinker is in position 3, the sprite drinker must be in position 4. The only food left for the sprite drinker is artichoke (rule 27).
5. From rule 40, the iced-tea drinker is to the left of the spy movie watcher. Since the spy movie watcher can't be in position 1 (since the Argentine is there), the iced-tea drinker must be in position 1. The only food left for the iced-tea drinker is cabbage (rule 40).
6. From rule 31, the horror movie watcher is to the right of the 7up drinker. Since the 7up drinker is in position 3, the horror movie watcher is in position 4. The only drink left for the horror movie watcher is soy-milk (rule 7).
7. From rule 36, the crime movie watcher is to the right of the skydiving hobbyist. Since we don't know who the skydiving hobbyist is yet, let's place the crime movie watcher in position 6. The only drink left for the crime movie watcher is tea (rule 21).
8. From rule 38, the cooking hobbyist is to the right of the person eating eggplant. Since we don't know who the eggplant eater is yet, let's place the cooking hobbyist in position 7. The only drink left for the cooking hobbyist is iced-tea (rule 40).

Step 3: Place the Remaining Beverages and Foods
1. From rule 5, the camping hobbyist is to the right of the Russian. Since the Russian is in position 3, the camping hobbyist is in position 5. The only food left for the camping hobbyist is zucchini (rule 3).
2. From rule 11, the zombie movie watcher is the person eating zucchini.
3. From rule 13, the sports movie watcher is to the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the only person left eating a vegetable is the camping hobbyist (who eats zucchini), the sports movie watcher must be in position 6. The only food left for the sports movie watcher is carrot (rule 19).
4. From rule 9, the horror movie watcher is to the left of the juice drinker. Since the juice drinker is in position 2, the horror movie watcher is in position 1.
5. From rule 8, the cooking hobbyist watches horror movies. This contradicts rule 38, as the cooking hobbyist can't be to the right of the person eating eggplant. So, the cooking hobbyist can't be in position 7. Let's place the cooking hobbyist in position 3 instead. The only drink left for the cooking hobbyist is soy-milk (rule 8).
6. From rule 14, the cooking hobbyist is to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in position 4, the cooking hobbyist is in position 3. This contradicts our previous placement of the cooking hobbyist. So, the cooking hobbyist can't be in position 3. Let's place the cooking hobbyist in position 5. The only drink left for the cooking hobbyist is iced-tea (rule 40).
7. From rule 16, the family movie watcher is to the left of the kale eater. Since the kale eater is the cola drinker (rule 32), the family movie watcher is to the left of the cola drinker. Since the only person left to the left of the cola drinker is the Argentine (who watches documentaries), the family movie watcher can't be the Argentine. So, the family movie watcher is in position 6. The only food left for the family movie watcher is eggplant (rule 16).
8. From rule 12, the garlic eater is to the right of the artichoke eater. Since the 7up drinker eats artichoke (rule 3), the garlic eater is to the right of the 7up drinker. Since the only person to the right of the 7up drinker is the horror movie watcher (who eats garlic, rule 7), the garlic eater is the horror movie watcher.
9. From rule 10, the sports movie watcher is not the garlic eater. Since the garlic eater is the horror movie watcher, the sports movie watcher is not the horror movie watcher. So, the sports movie watcher is in position 6.
10. From rule 22, the drawing hobbyist is to the right of the cooking hobbyist. Since the cooking hobbyist is in position 5, the drawing hobbyist is in position 7. The only drink left for the drawing hobbyist is tea (rule 40).
11. From rule 24, the rock-climbing hobbyist is to the left or right of the dancing hobbyist. Since the only hobby left is skydiving, the rock-climbing hobbyist must be in position 4. The only drink left for the rock-climbing hobbyist is sprite (rule 25).
12. From rule 26, the dancing hobbyist is to the right of the person eating cabbage. Since the only person left eating a vegetable is the sports movie watcher (who eats carrot), the dancing hobbyist can't be the sports movie watcher. So, the dancing hobbyist is in position 7. The only drink left for the dancing hobbyist is juice (rule 9).
13. From rule 23, the crime movie watcher is to the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the only person left drinking is the crime movie watcher (who drinks tea), the crime movie watcher is in position 6.
14. From rule 15, the skydiving hobbyist is to the left of the soy-milk drinker. Since the Italian is in position 4 and can't be the soy-milk drinker (since the garlic eater is the soy-milk drinker, rule 7), the skydiving hobbyist is in position 2. The only drink left for the skydiving hobbyist is cola (rule 33).
15. From rule 28, the russian is not the kale eater. Since the kale eater is the cola drinker (rule 32), the russian can't be in position 5. So, the russian is in position 3.

Step 4: Check the Solution
1. All nationalities are placed: Argentine, Australian, Brazilian, Italian, Japanese, Polish, Russian.
2. All beverages are placed: 7up, cola, iced-tea, juice, soy-milk, sprite, tea.

Lv6-5x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. Let's start by placing the people with unique characteristics.
   - The person drinking mirinda is the scientist (clue 14). Let's place them in position 4.
   - The french is the person who's sport is golf (clue 3). Since the scientist is already in position 4, the french must be in position 3.
   - The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the french (clue 11), so they must be in position 2.
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person drinking cola (clue 12), and the french is the person who's sport is golf, so water-polo must be in position 1.
   - The person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the french (clue 26), so they must be in position 5.
   - The indonesian is in the middle (clue 27), so they must be in position 3. However, we already placed the french there. This means the indonesian must be in position 6.

2. Now let's place the people with unique sports:
   - The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person drinking sprite (clue 23), so sprite must be in position 2. Since the scientist is in position 4 and the french is in position 3, sprite must be the person driving the roller (clue 13).
   - The person who's sport is rowing is on the far left or far right (clue 34), so they must be in position 1 or 7. However, water-polo is already in position 1, so rowing must be in position 7.
   - The person who's sport is skateboarding is the turkish (clue 16), so they must be in position 5.
   - The person who's sport is lacrosse is not the french (clue 24), so they must be in one of the remaining positions (2, 4, 6). However, we already placed the french, scientist, and sprite in those positions. This means lacrosse must be in position 1 or 7. Since water-polo is already in position 1, lacrosse must be in position 7.
   - The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the designer (clue 32), so designer must be in position 2 or 6. However, we already placed the french, scientist, and sprite in those positions. This means cricket must be in position 1 or 7. Since water-polo is already in position 1, cricket must be in position 7.
   - The person who's sport is snowboarding is not the french (clue 30), so they must be in one of the remaining positions (2, 4, 5, 6). However, we already placed the french, scientist, sprite, water-polo, and lacrosse in those positions. This means snowboarding must be in position 3.

3. Now let's place the people with unique jobs:
   - The librarian is on the right of the designer (clue 6), so designer must be in position 2 and librarian must be in position 3.
   - The architect is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike (clue 37), so they must be in position 6.
   - The doctor is on the far left or far right (clue 18), so they must be in position 1 or 7. However, we already placed water-polo in position 1 and cricket in position 7. This means the doctor must be in position 6.
   - The freelancer is the person drinking sprite (clue 9), so they are already in position 2.
   - The coach is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (clue 8), so they must be in position 4 or 5. However, we already placed the scientist, french, indonesian, water-polo, and sprite in those positions. This means the coach must be in position 1 or 7. Since the doctor is already in position 6, the coach must be in position 1.
   - The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the pakistani (clue 10), so the pakistani must be in position 6.

4. Now let's place the people with unique nationalities:
   - The spanish is on the left of the french (clue 20), so they must be in position 5.
   - The italian is somewhere to the left of the pakistani (clue 40), so they must be in position 5 or 6. However, we already placed the spanish in position 5. This means the italian must be in position 6.
   - The pakistani is in position 6.
   - The indian is somewhere to the right of the italian (clue 40), so they must be in position 7.
   - The turkish is the person who's sport is skateboarding (clue 16), so they are already in position 5.

5. Finally, let's place the people with unique beverages:
   - The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the designer (clue 35), so they must be in position 3 or 4. However, we already placed the scientist, french, indonesian, water-polo, sprite, and coach in those positions. This means the person drinking tea must be in position 1 or 7. Since the doctor is already in position 6, the person drinking tea must be in position 1.
   - The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike (clue 38), so they must be in position 6 or 7. However, we already placed the pakistani in position 6. This means the person drinking lemonade must be in position 7.
   - The person drinking cola is already in position 5.
   - The person drinking mirinda is the scientist (clue 14), so they are already in position 4.
   - The person drinking water is on the left or right of the turkish (clue 22), so they must be in position 4 or 5. However, we already placed the scientist, french, indonesian, water-polo, sprite, coach, and person drinking tea in those positions. This means the person drinking water must be in position 1 or 7. Since the doctor is already in position 6, the person drinking water must be in position 7.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-5x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the photographer is in an odd position and there are 7 positions, the photographer must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. Let's assume the photographer is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The Turkish is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4, the Turkish can't be in position 1. So, the Turkish is in position 2, 4, 6, or 7.

3. The Chinese is on the left or right of the American. Since the American can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5, the Chinese can't be in position 1. So, the Chinese is in position 2, 4, or 6.

4. The British is on the left or right of the American. Since the American can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5, the British can't be in position 1. So, the British is in position 2, 4, or 6.

5. The Journalist is the Indonesian. Since the Indonesian can only be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7, the Journalist can't be in position 1. So, the Journalist is in position 2, 4, 6, or 7.

6. The Photographer is somewhere to the right of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5, the Photographer can't be in position 1. So, the Photographer is in position 3, 5, or 7.

7. The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position 2, 4, 6, or 7, the person watching adventure movies is in position 3, 5, or 7. But we already placed the Photographer in position 1, so the person watching adventure movies can't be in position 7. So, the person watching adventure movies is in position 3 or 5.

8. The person watching time-travel movies is in an even position. Since the person watching adventure movies is in an odd position, the person watching time-travel movies is in position 2, 4, or 6.

9. The person watching adventure movies is in an odd position. Since we placed the person watching adventure movies in position 3, the person watching adventure movies is in position 3.

10-24. We can't determine the positions of the remaining people and items based on the given information.

25-46. We can use these clues to eliminate some possibilities, but we still can't determine the positions of the remaining people and items.

Now, let's check our assumption about the Photographer being in position 1. If the Photographer is in position 1, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 3. But the person watching adventure movies can't be the Journalist (since the Journalist is the Indonesian and the Indonesian can't be in position 1), and the person watching adventure movies can't be the British (since the British is on the left or right of the American, and the American can't be in position 1).

The person driving the jet-ski can't be the American (since the American can't be in an even position), so the person driving the jet-ski must be the British (since the British is in position 4, and the only remaining person who can drive the jet-ski is the British).

The person watching thriller movies can't"	{}	False	0	False
Lv6-5x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into steps:

Step 1: Assign initial positions
Since we have 7 categories and 7 people, we can assign each person a position from 1 to 7. Let's start by assigning the nationalities:

1. Argentine
2. Brazilian
3. Canadian
4. Dutch
5. Egyptian (on the right of Zombie movies)
6. Mexican (left or right of Argentine)
7. Malaysian (left or right of Disaster movies)

Step 2: Assign Movie-Genres
Since the Argentine is in an even position, let's place them in position 2 (Adventure). The Mexican is to the left of the Argentine, so they are in position 1 (Sports). The Egyptian is eating onion, so they are in position 6 (Onion).

Step 3: Assign Food
Since the Egyptian is eating onion, we know that onion is in position 6. Since the person eating eggplant is to the left of the Canadian, and the Canadian is in position 3, eggplant must be in position 2 or 1. However, since the fan country is on the right of the fan folk, and the fan folk is not the Argentine, the fan folk cannot be in position 1, so eggplant must be in position 2 (Eggplant). This means carrot is in position 1 (Carrot).

Step 4: Assign Beverages
Since the person drinking tea is to the left of the Dutch, and the Dutch is in position 4, tea must be in position 3 (Tea). Since the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person drinking juice, and tea is in position 3, iced-tea must be in position 2 (Iced-Tea). Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the fan pop, and the fan pop is not the Brazilian, the fan pop cannot be in position 1 or 7, so it must be in position 2 (Soy-Milk). This means juice is in position 1 (Juice).

Step 5: Assign Music-Genres
Since the fan country is on the right of the fan folk, and the fan folk is not the Argentine, the fan country cannot be in position 1 or 7. Since the fan country is not the brazilian, it cannot be in position 2 (Soy-Milk). So, the fan country must be in position 3 (Country). Since the fan soul is not the person drinking iced-tea, it cannot be in position 2 (Iced-Tea). Since the fan soul is not the person drinking tea, it cannot be in position 3 (Tea). So, the fan soul must be in position 1 (Soul).

Step 6: Assign the remaining categories
We can now assign the remaining categories based on the given clues. Here is the final solution table:

```

| Beverage      |  Juice    |  Soy-Milk |  Tea     |  Iced-Tea |  Water     |  Sprite    |  7up       |
| Food          |  Carrot   |  Eggplant  |  Onion   |  Kale     |  Spinach   |  Papaya    |  Watermelon |

Lv6-5x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each person, starting from the left. We'll use the number of the sport they prefer. If a person doesn't have a specific sport, we'll use the number of their pet. If they don't have a pet either, we'll use the number of their nationality.

2. Next, let's fill in the music genre based on the given clues. For example, if we know someone is the fan of d&b (clue 7), we can fill in the music genre for that person.

3. Now, let's fill in the nationality, pet, sport, and transport based on the given clues. For example, if we know someone is the owner of a lizard (clue 1 and 20), we can fill in the pet for that person. If we know someone prefers cricket (clue 4), we can fill in the sport for that person.
