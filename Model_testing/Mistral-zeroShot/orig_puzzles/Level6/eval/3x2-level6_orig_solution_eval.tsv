Lv6-3x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different jobs (project-manager and teacher) and two different movie genres (crime and musical). Let's assign the jobs to the rows and the movie genres to the columns.

   |               | Crime   | Musical |
   | Job           |        |         |
   | Project-Manager|       |         |
   | Teacher       |       |         |

2. From the first condition, we know that the project-manager is not watching musical movies. So, the project-manager must be in the left column.

   |               | Crime   | Musical |
   | Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |

3. From the second condition, the person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since we know the project-manager is not watching musical movies, the only person left to watch musical movies is the teacher. Also, since the teacher is on the right of the ferret owner, the ferret must be owned by the project-manager.

   |               | Crime   | Musical |
   | Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
   | Pet           | Ferret |         |

4. Now, we have filled in the Job and Pet columns. The Movie-Genre column is already filled, so we don't need to fill it again.

   Here is the final solution:

   |               | Crime   | Musical |
   | Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
   | Pet           | Ferret |         |

   So, the final table is:

   |               | Crime   | Musical |
   | Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
   | Pet           | Ferret |         |

Lv6-3x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food (pepper, pumpkin), 2 hobbies (baking, card-games), and 2 movie genres (disaster, musical).

2. From the second rule, the person who bakes is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means that the person watching disaster movies cannot be the one baking. So, the possible combinations for hobbies and movie genres for the rightmost person are:
   - Rightmost person: Card-games, Disaster
   - Leftmost person: Baking, _______

3. From the first rule, the person who bakes is not the one eating pumpkin. Since we already know the rightmost person is not baking, the leftmost person must be eating pumpkin. So, the possible combinations for food for the leftmost person are:
   - Leftmost person: Pumpkin, _______
   - Rightmost person: _______, Disaster

4. Now, we have only one remaining food (pepper) and one remaining hobby (card-games). So, the final solution is:

   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Food          | Pumpkin |  Pepper   |
   | Hobby         | Baking  | Card-games |
   | Movie-Genre   | _______ | Disaster  |

   However, we don't have enough information to fill in the last row. But we can be sure that the leftmost person is eating pumpkin, the rightmost person is watching disaster movies, and the person in the middle is doing card-games and eating pepper.

   So, the final solution table is:

   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Food          | Pumpkin |  _#########|

Lv6-3x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different jobs (journalist and social-worker) and two different means of transport (motorbike and van), we can fill in the first row of the table as follows:

   |             |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage    | journalist   | social-worker |
   | Job         | motorbike   | van         |
   | Transport   |             |            |

2. Now, let's use the information from the second clue: the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since there are only two jobs, the social-worker must be in the first column (column 1). So, we can fill in the second row as follows:

   |             |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage    | journalist   | social-worker |
   | Job         | motorbike   | van         |
   | Transport   | cola        | water       |

3. Finally, let's use the information from the first clue: the person driving the van is not the person drinking water. Since we already know the person driving the van is the social-worker (from the second clue), the social-worker cannot be drinking water. So, the journalist must be drinking water. We can fill in the second row as follows:

   |             |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage    | journalist   | social-worker |
   | Job         | motorbike   | van         |
   | Transport   | cola        | water       |

4. Now, we can check if the table satisfies all the clues. The table does indeed satisfy all the clues, so the final solution table is:

   |             |       1       |     2      |
   | Beverage    | journalist   | social-worker |

Lv6-3x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people have 2 different hobbies (board-games and gardening) and 2 different jobs (dressmaker and scientist). Let's assign these to the columns and rows as follows:

   |     | Board-games | Gardening |
   |----|------------|----------|
   | Dressmaker |       |          |
   | Scientist  |       |          |

   |----|-----------|---------|
   | Person 1 |       |          |
   | Person 2 |       |          |

   (We don't know the pets yet, but we know they are different.)

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the hamster. This means that the gardener cannot be in the first column (Hamster column). So, the gardener must be in the second column (Mouse column).

   |     | Board-games | Gardening |
   |----|------------|----------|
   | Dressmaker |       |          |
   | Scientist  |       | Gardening |

   |     | Hamster    | Mouse    |
   |----|-----------|---------|
   | Person 1 |       |  Mouse  |
   | Person 2 | Hamster |        |

3. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist. This means that Person 2, who owns the hamster, must be on the right of the Scientist row. Since the gardener (Person 1) is already in the second column, the only possible position for the scientist is in the first row.

   |     | Board-games | Gardening |
   |----|------------|----------|
   | Dressmaker |       |          |

   |----|-----------|---------|
   | Person 1 |        |  Mouse  |
   | Person 2 | Hamster |        |

Now, we still don't know the board-games hobby or the pet of Person 1. However, we have satisfied all the given conditions, so the final solution table is:

Lv6-3x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food (pomegranate and pumpkin), 2 movie genres (horror and superhero), and 2 sports (basketball and rowing).

2. From the first rule, we know that the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. This means that the arrangement of the columns (Food, Movie-Genre, Sport) cannot be:
   - Pomegranate, Horror, Basketball
   - Pumpkin, Superhero, Rowing
   - Pomegranate, Superhero, Basketball
   - Pumpkin, Horror, Rowing (this is the correct arrangement)

3. From the second rule, we know that the person eating pomegranate is not the person who's sport is rowing. This means that the arrangement cannot be:
   - Pomegranate, Horror, Rowing
   - Pumpkin, Superhero, Basketball (this is the correct arrangement)

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-3x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different music-genres (funk, indie) and 2 different nationalities (brazilian, nigerian). Since there are only 2 slots in the table, each person can only have one genre and one nationality.

2. We also know that there are 2 different means of transport (ship, trike). Again, since there are only 2 slots, each person can only use one type of transport.

3. From the first condition, the brazilian and the person driving the ship cannot be in the same row because the brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship. So, the brazilian must be in the second row.

4. Let's assume the brazilian is listening to indie music (since funk is already taken). This means the person in the first row must be listening to funk.

5. Now, let's assume the first row is nigerian. This means the second row must be brazilian. But this contradicts our first condition that the brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship. So, the first row cannot be nigerian.

6. Therefore, the first row must be brazilian and the second row must be nigerian. Since the brazilian is listening to indie, the first row must be driving the trike (since funk is taken by the person in the second row).

7. Now, the person in the second row must be driving the ship and listening to funk.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |    1     |     2     |

Lv6-3x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 types of food (broccoli, lemon), 2 nationalities (Australian, Polish), and 2 means of transport (jet-ski, scooter).

2. From the first condition, we know that the person driving the scooter is not the one eating broccoli. So, the person eating broccoli must be either the Australian or the Polish, and the scooter driver must be the other one or one of the remaining options (lemon, jet-ski).

3. From the second condition, the scooter driver is somewhere to the left of the Australian. This means the scooter driver cannot be the Australian (because the Australian is on the right side). So, the scooter driver must be the Polish, and the Australian is either eating broccoli or driving the jet-ski.

4. Now, let's place the information we have so far in the table:

   |               |    1    |     2      |
   | Food          | Broccoli | Lemon     |
   | Nationality   | Australian| Polish    |
   | Transport     | Jet-ski  | Scooter   |

5. Since the scooter driver is the Polish, the Australian must be driving the jet-ski. So, the final table is:

Lv6-3x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different music genres (electronic and rock), and they cannot be in the same row (as stated in the puzzle), we can fill one row with one genre and the other row with the other genre. Let's assume the first row has Rock and the second row has Electronic.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      |          |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock     | Electronic  |
   | Sport         |          |            |

2. Similarly, since there are two different sports (baseball and lacrosse), and they cannot be in the same column (as stated in the puzzle), we can fill one column with one sport and the other column with the other sport. Let's assume the first column has Baseball and the second column has Lacrosse.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      |          |            |
   | Music-Genre   | Rock     | Electronic  |
   | Sport         | Baseball | Lacrosse   |

3. Now, let's consider the beverages. Since there are two different beverages (cola and iced-tea), and they cannot be in the same row or column (as stated in the puzzle), we can place one beverage in each cell that doesn't contain a repeated genre or sport.

   - The person drinking iced-tea is not the fan of rock (row 1), so the beverage in row 1 can be Cola.
   - The fan of rock is to the left of the person who's sport is Lacrosse (column 2), so the beverage in column 1 can be Iced-Tea.

   |               |    1     |     2      |
   | Beverage      | Cola     | Iced-Tea   |

Lv6-3x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have 2 different beverages (Fanta and Water), 2 different foods (Avocado and Zucchini), and 2 different means of transport (Motorbike and Roller).

2. The person eating Zucchini is on the right of the person drinking Water. This means that Zucchini cannot be in the first column and Water cannot be in the second column. So, the possible arrangements for the first column are [Avocado, Zucchini] and the possible arrangements for the second column are [Water, Fanta].

3. The person eating Zucchini is not the person driving the Roller. This means that Zucchini cannot be in the same row as Roller. So, the possible arrangements for the rows are [Motorbike, Roller] for both rows or [Roller, Motorbike] for both rows.

4. Combining all the conditions, we have the following possibilities:

   | Beverage    | Food        | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|
   | Fanta      | Avocado    | Motorbike   |
   | Fanta      | Avocado    | Roller      |
   | Water      | Avocado    | Motorbike   |
   | Water      | Avocado    | Roller      |
   | Fanta      | Zucchini    | Motorbike   |

   | Water      | Zucchini    | Motorbike   |
   | Water      | Zucchini    | Roller      |

5. Now, we need to find the arrangement that satisfies the condition that Zucchini is not in the same row as Roller. This means we can eliminate the following possibilities:

   | Beverage    | Food        | Transport   |
   |------------|------------|------------|
   | Fanta      | Zucchini    | Roller      |

Lv6-3x2-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the owner of the rabbit doesn't prefer R&B, we can rule out R&B for the first row and the second column (as both cells need to be different). So, the first row can be either Rock or another music genre, and the second column can be R&B or another music genre.

2. The second person prefers R&B, so the first row must be Rock.

3. Now, let's consider the pets. Since the owner of the rabbit doesn't prefer R&B, the rabbit can't be with the R&B fan. So, the rabbit must be in the first column, and the snake in the second column.

4. Lastly, let's consider the sports. The person who prefers cricket is to the right of the rabbit owner. Since the rabbit is in the first column, the cricket fan must be in the second row. Therefore, the sport in the first row must be Climbing.

Here is the final solution table:
