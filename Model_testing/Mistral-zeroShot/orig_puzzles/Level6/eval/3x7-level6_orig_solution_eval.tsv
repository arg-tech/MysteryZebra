Lv6-3x7-1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the hobbies, movie-genres, and transport to the columns and rows.

1. We know there are 7 different hobbies, so we can assign them to the columns (1-7). Let's assign them in the order: camping, collecting, filmmaking, fishing, gardening, hiking, and sudoku.

2. Similarly, we know there are 7 different movie-genres, so we can assign them to the rows (1-7). Let's assign them in the order: crime, epic, fantasy, horror, musical, satire, and thriller.

3. Now let's assign the transport. Since we know that the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person in column 5 (camping), we can assign the transport to the rows as follows: boat, bus, car, motorbike, quad-bike, ship, and snowmobile.

4. Now let's start solving the clues:

   - From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. So, the person driving the snowmobile must be in row 6 or 7, and the person who's hobby is camping must be in column 5 or 6.

   - From clue 2, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in column 2, the person watching horror movies must be in column 1.

   - From clue 3, we know that the person watching crime movies is not the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in column 2, the person watching crime movies cannot be in row 2.

   - From clue 4, we know that the person driving the bus is the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in an odd position (clue 13), the person driving the bus must be in row 3 or 5.

   - From clue 5, we know that the person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in row 11 (clue 11), the person watching epic movies must be in row 12 or 13.

   - From clue 6, we know that the person driving the motorbike is the person driving the motorbike. So, the person driving the motorbike must be in row 4.

   - From clue 7, we know that the person driving the boat is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the bus is in row 3 or 5, the person driving the boat cannot be in row 3 or 5. So, the person driving the boat must be in row 1 or 7.

   - From clue 8, we know that the person watching crime movies is not the person driving the boat. So, the person driving the boat must be in row 1.

   - From clue 9, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since the person driving the bus is in row 1, the person driving the snowmobile must be in row 2 or 3 or 5 or 6 or 7.

   - From clue 10, we know that the person watching horror movies is the person who's hobby is camping. So, the person who's hobby is camping must be in column 1.

   - From clue 11, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship must be in an even position (not in row 1 or 7, as the person driving the boat is in row 1), the person watching fantasy movies must be in row 2, 4, or 6.

   - From clue 12, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the quad-bike must be in an odd position (not in row 1 or 7), the person watching fantasy movies must be in row 3, 5, or 7.

   - From clue 13, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is in an odd position. Since the person driving the bus is in row 3, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in row 1, 5, or 7.

   - From clue 14, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is not the person driving the boat. So, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in row 5 or 7.

   - From clue 15, we know that the person watching horror movies is in an odd position. Since the person watching horror movies is in column 1, the person watching horror movies must be in row 1, 3, 5, or 7.

   - From clue 16, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is in row 6, the person who's hobby is gardening must be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, or 7.

   - From clue 17, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in row 5 or 7, the person watching crime movies can be in row 1, 2, 4, 6, or 7.

   - From clue 18, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in row 3, 5, or 7, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in row 1, 2, 4, or 6.

   - From clue 19, we know that the person watching musical movies is not the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in row 1, 2, 4, or 6, the person watching musical movies cannot be in row 1, 2, 4, or 6. So, the person watching musical movies must be in row 3, 5, or 7.

   - From clue 20, we know that the person watching thriller movies is the person driving the bus. Since the person driving the bus is in row 3, the person watching thriller movies is in row 3.

   - From clue 21, we know that the person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is in row 4, the person watching satire movies must be in row 5 or 7.

   - From clue 22, we know that the person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching epic movies is in row 12 or 13, the person watching epic movies must be in column 1 or 7.

   - From clue 23, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in row 5 and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in row 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in row 4.

   - From clue 24, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is in row 4, the person watching horror movies can be in row 1, 2, 5, 6, or 7.

   - From clue 25, we know that the person watching satire movies is the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person watching satire movies is in row 5 or 7, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in row 5 or 7.

   - From clue 26, we know that the person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching musical movies is in row 7, the person watching thriller movies is in row 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6.

   - From clue 27, we know that the person watching epic movies is in row 1 or 7. Since the person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right (clue 22), the person watching epic movies must be in column 1 or 7.

   - From clue 28, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is in row 5 and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in row 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in row 4.

Now let's put the final solution table:

Lv6-3x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the ship driver is in an even position and there are 7 jobs, the ship driver cannot be in position 1 or 7 (as they are odd). So, the ship driver can be in positions 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.

2. The argentine is in an odd position, so they cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6 (as they are even). So, the argentine can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.

3. The person driving the car is the architect, so the architect must be in an odd position (since there are 7 jobs and the car is used). The architect cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the architect can be in positions 3, 5, or 7.

4. The doctor is in an even position. Since the architect is the car driver and is in an odd position, the doctor cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as they are odd). So, the doctor can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6.

5. The coach is to the right of the scientist. Since the architect is the car driver and is in an odd position, the coach cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as they are odd). The scientist cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the coach and scientist can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6. The coach cannot be in position 6 (as the doctor cannot be in position 6), so the coach and scientist can be in positions 2, 4, or 5.

6. The photographer is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the architect is the car driver and is in an odd position, the photographer cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as they are odd). The quad-bike driver cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the photographer and quad-bike driver can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6. The photographer cannot be in position 6 (as the doctor cannot be in position 6), so the photographer and quad-bike driver can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. The photographer is the argentine, so the argentine cannot be in position 4 (as the quad-bike driver cannot be in position 4). So, the photographer is in position 2 and the quad-bike driver is in position 5.

7. The entrepreneur is between the photographer and the german. Since the photographer is in position 2 and the german cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), the entrepreneur must be in position 3.

8. The software-developer is the person driving the snowmobile. Since the architect is the car driver and is in an odd position, the software-developer cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as they are odd). The snowmobile driver cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the software-developer can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6. The software-developer cannot be in position 6 (as the doctor cannot be in position 6), so the software-developer can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. The software-developer is not the person driving the skateboard, so the software-developer cannot be in position 2 (as the skateboard driver cannot be in position 2). So, the software-developer is in position 4.

9. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the australian. Since the architect is the car driver and is in an odd position, the jet-ski driver cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as they are odd). The australian cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the jet-ski driver and the australian can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6. The jet-ski driver cannot be in position 6 (as the doctor cannot be in position 6), so the jet-ski driver and the australian can be in positions 2, 4, or 5. The jet-ski driver is on the left of the australian, so the jet-ski driver is in position 2 and the australian is in position 4.

10. The colombian is on the left or right of the architect. Since the architect is in position 3, the colombian can be in positions 2, 4, 5, or 6. The colombian is on the left or right of the photographer (who is the argentine in position 2), so the colombian cannot be in position 2. The colombian is also on the left or right of the architect, so the colombian cannot be in position 4 (as the architect is in position 3). So, the colombian is in position 5 or 6. The colombian is on the left or right of the architect, so the colombian is in position 6.

11. The person driving the skateboard is not the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in position 4, the skateboard driver cannot be in position 4. The skateboard driver cannot be in position 1 (as it's already taken by the ship driver), so the skateboard driver can be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6. The skateboard driver cannot be in position 2 (as the photographer is in position 2), so the skateboard driver can be in positions 3, 5, or 6. The skateboard driver cannot be in position 6 (as the colombian is in position 6), so the skateboard driver is in position 3.

12. The russian is in an odd position. Since the ship driver, the architect, the photographer, the software-developer, and the colombian are all in even positions, the russian must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. The russian is to the right of the australian, so the russian cannot be in position 1 (as the ship driver is in position 1). The russian is also to the right of the person driving the jet-ski (who is in position 2), so the russian cannot be in position 3. So, the russian is in position 5 or 7. The russian is not the person driving the ship (as stated in puzzle 21), so the russian is in position 7.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |     1     |         2          |     3     |     4     |      5       |      6       |     7      |

Lv6-3x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. The British is on the far left, so they must be in the first column. Since the British can't be the person drinking water (11), they must be drinking either 7up, cola, fanta, tea, or juice. Let's assume they are drinking 7up (we'll come back to this).

2. The fan trance is not the British (3), so it must be in another column. Since the fan trance can't be in the first column (18), it must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

3. The fan electronic is not the person drinking tea (4), so it must be in another column. Since the fan electronic can't be in the first column (18), it must be in the second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

4. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the fan electronic (5), so it can't be in the first column. It also can't be in the second column because the fan electronic is there (from point 3). So, it must be in the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth column.

5. The person drinking iced-tea is the Thai (6), so they must be in the seventh column.

6. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the fan classical (7), so they must be in the first, second, or third column. But we assumed the British was drinking 7up, and the British is in the first column. So, the person drinking 7up must be in the second column.

7. The fan classical is between the fan trance and the fan electronic (18), so it must be in the fourth or fifth column.

8. The person drinking juice is in the middle (17), so they must be in the third column.

9. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the British (14), so they must be in the second or third column. But we already placed the British and the person drinking 7up in the second column. So, the person drinking cola must be in the third column.

10. The fan disco is on the right of the fan classical (10), so it must be in the fifth or sixth column.

11. The fan disco is the Colombian (20), so the Colombian is in the fifth column.

12. The fan d&b is not the Japanese (21), so it must be in another column. Since the fan d&b is on the far left (22), it must be in the first column.

13. The pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Colombian (23), so they must be in the sixth or seventh column.

14. The fan trance is on the right of the Thai (19), so it must be in the sixth column.

15. The fan salsa is somewhere to the left or right of the person drinking water (12), so it must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth column. But we already placed the fan electronic, fan disco, and fan trance in the fifth column. So, the fan salsa must be in the fourth column.

16. The person drinking tea is in an empty column because we already placed all the beverages. Since the fan electronic is in the third column, the person drinking tea must be in the fourth column.

17. The nationality of the person drinking tea is not given, so it can be any of the remaining nationalities: Chinese, Chinese, Nigerian, Japanese, or Thai. But the Japanese and Thai are already placed, so the person drinking tea must be either Chinese, Nigerian, or Chinese. Since the person drinking juice is already in the third column, the person drinking tea must be Chinese.

18. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the fan classical (not yet placed), so it must be in the sixth or seventh column. But we already placed the fan trance, fan disco, fan salsa, and the person drinking tea in the sixth column. So, the person drinking fanta must be in the seventh column.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

| Beverage      |    1    |    2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |    6     |     7     |

| Nationality   | British | Cola     | Juice     | Tea (Chinese) | Disco (Colombian) | Trance | Iced-Tea (Thai) |

The table is not complete because the remaining music-genres and nationalities are not specified for the person drinking fanta and the person drinking water. However, we have placed all the given beverages and nationalities according to the given clues."	{'beverage': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7'], 'music-genre': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'nationality': ['british', 'cola', 'juice', 'tea (chinese)', 'disco (colombian)', 'trance', 'iced-tea (thai)']}	True	1	False
Lv6-3x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 15, we know that the French owns the cat. Let's place the French and the cat in the 5th position.

3. From rule 16, the owner of the fish is to the left of the action movie watcher. Since we don't know the position of the action movie watcher yet, we can't place the fish yet.

4. From rule 25, the Japanese is to the left of the American. Since we placed the French (who is not American) in the 5th position, the Japanese cannot be in the 5th position. Let's place the Japanese in the 4th position.

|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |    4    |   5    |    6    |    7     |

5. From rule 24, the Japanese is in an even position. Since we placed the Japanese in the 4th position, the American must be in the 6th position.

6. From rule 19, the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the action movie watcher. Since we placed the American (who is not watching action movies) in the 6th position, the action movie watcher cannot be in the 6th position. Let's place the action movie watcher in the 2nd position.

|               |     1     |     2    |     3     |    4    |   5    |    6    |    7     |

7. From rule 18, the Chinese is not watching fantasy movies. Since we don't have the Chinese yet, let's place the Chinese in the 7th position for now.

Lv6-3x7-5	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign numbers to the sports, pets, and foods in a way that satisfies as many conditions as possible. We'll use the numbers 1-7 for sports, 8-14 for pets, and 15-21 for foods.

   - We know that cricket is sport 5, so we can assign it to the position 5. Since the person eating tomato is the person who's sport is cricket, we can assign tomato to position 5 as well.
   - Since the person who's sport is climbing is the person eating peach, we can assign peach to position 6 and climbing to position 6 as well.
   - Since the owner of the cat is not the person eating tomato, the owner of the cat cannot be in position 5. So, let's assign cat to position 1 (since it's an odd position and not position 3, which is forbidden by rule 13).
   - Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog, and the owner of the cat is not the person who's sport is snowboarding, the owner of the hedgehog cannot be to the left of the owner of the cat. So, let's assign hedgehog to position 2.

Lv6-3x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the nationalities to the columns and the music genres to the rows.

1. Since the chinese cannot be the fan of basketball (rule 5), they can only be in columns 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, the chinese cannot be in column 7 (rule 19), so they must be in columns 1, 3, or 5. The chinese cannot be in column 1 (rule 10 and 11), so they must be in column 3.

2. The fan of ambient music is the person who does rowing (rule 7). Since the chinese cannot be the fan of ambient (rule 24), the fan of ambient must be in column 1, 5, or 7. However, the fan of ambient cannot be in column 7 (rule 17), so they must be in columns 1 or 5. Since the chinese is in column 3, the fan of ambient must be in column 1.

3. The fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the person who does parkour (rule 2). Since the fan of ambient is in column 1, the fan of trance must be in column 0.

However, the fan of gospel cannot be in column 7 (rule 16), so they must be in columns 4 or 5. The fan of gospel cannot be in column 5 (rule 20), so they must be in column 4.

7. The fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the person who does water-polo (rule 13). Since the fan of trance is in row 0, the fan of salsa must be in row 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, the fan of salsa cannot be in row 0 (rule 2), row 2 (rule 25), or row 3 (rule 17), so they must be in rows 1, 4, or 5. Since the fan of gospel is in column 4, the fan of salsa cannot be in row 4 (rule 20). Therefore, the fan of salsa must be in row 1.

8. The fan of techno is on the left or right of the person who does weightlifting (rule 18). Since the fan of trance is in row 0, the fan of techno cannot be in row 0. Since the fan of salsa is in row 1, the fan of techno must be in row 2.

However, the fan of soul cannot be in row 1 (rule 7), row 3 (rule 13), or column 0 (rule 3), so the fan of soul must be in row 4 and column 2.

11. The person who does basketball is not the chinese (rule 5), not the Italian (rule 26), and is on the left or right of the fan of ambient (rule 12). Since the fan of ambient is in column 1, the person who does basketball can only be in columns 0 or 2. However, the person who does basketball cannot be in column 0 (rule 1), so they must be in column 2.

12. The person who does parkour is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian (rule 23). Since the Indonesian is in column 0, the person who does parkour must be in column 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 7.

"	{}	False	0	False
Lv6-3x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is the same person throughout the table (from rule 1), we can fill that position with 'water'.

2. Now we know that water is between thriller and fanta (from rule 2). So, let's place 'thriller' to the right of water and 'fanta' to the left of water.

3. Mirinda is on the left or right of almond-milk (from rule 3). Since almond-milk is in an odd position (from rule 4), it can't be in the middle. So, let's place 'almond-milk' in the third position (odd) and 'mirinda' in the fourth position (either side of almond-milk).

4. Mirinda is watching superhero movies (from rule 16). So, let's place 'superhero' in the fourth position.

5. Hot-chocolate is on the left or right of family movies (from rule 7). Since family movies are on the far left (from rule 13), hot-chocolate can't be in the first position. So, let's place 'family' in the first position and 'hot-chocolate' in the second position.

6. Fanta is somewhere to the left of almond-milk (from rule 6). So, 'fanta' should be before 'almond-milk'.

7. Now we know that almond-milk is on the right of family movies (from rule 14). So, 'almond-milk' should be in the third position.

8. 7up is not the person drinking almond-milk (from rule 15), not the person drinking mirinda (from rule 16), and not the person watching adventure movies (from rule 22). So, it can't be in the first, second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's place '7up' in the fifth position.

9. Soy-milk is left with water, fanta, and water. Since water is already placed, soy-milk can't be in the first or seventh position. Let's place 'soy-milk' in the sixth position.

10. Now we know that the person drinking fanta is to the left of the owner of the ferret (from rule 10). So, 'ferret' should be to the right of 'fanta'.

11. The owner of the ferret is in an odd position (from rule 23). So, 'ferret' should be in the third, fifth, or seventh position. Since 'ferret' is to the right of 'fanta', it can't be in the third position. So, 'ferret' should be in the seventh position.

12. The owner of the goat is to the left of the person watching thriller movies (from rule 19). So, 'goat' should be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Since 'goat' can't be in the third position (because of the ferret), it should be in the second position.

13. Now we know that the goat is watching time-travel movies (from rule 26). So, 'time-travel' should be in the second position.

14. The owner of the mouse is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (from rule 27). So, 'mouse' should be in the first position.

15. The owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the mouse (from rule 29). So, 'turtle' should be in the seventh position.

16. The person watching adventure movies is not the person drinking 7up (from rule 22). Since 'adventure' is already placed in the second position, it can't be '7up'. So, 'adventure' should be in the fifth position.

17. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching drama movies (from rule 17). Since 'time-travel' is already placed in the second position, 'drama' should be in the first position.

18. The person watching family movies is on the far left (from rule 13). So, 'family' is already placed in the first position.

19. The person watching thriller movies is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies (from rule 28). So, 'thriller' should be in the third position.

Now, let's put the beverages, movie-genres, and pets in their respective positions:

| Beverage      | Movie-Genre   | Pet           |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| water        | drama         | bird          |
| thriller     | time-travel   | ferret        |
| fanta        | adventure     | goat          |
| almond-milk  | family        | mouse         |
| 7up          | superhero     | turtle        |
| soy-milk     |               |               |
| hot-chocolate|               |               |

Since we don't have all 7 beverages, let's fill the remaining positions with the remaining beverages:

| Beverage      | Movie-Genre   | Pet           |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| water        | drama         | bird          |
| thriller     | time-travel   | ferret        |
| fanta        | adventure     | goat          |
| almond-milk  | family        | mouse         |
| 7up          | superhero     | turtle        |
| soy-milk     |               |               |
| hot-chocolate|               |               |
| mirinda      |               |               |
| fanta        |               |               |
| water        |               |               |

Since we have repeated 'fanta' and 'water', let's replace 'fanta' with 'mirinda' and 'water' with 'soy-milk' in the first row:

| Beverage      | Movie-Genre   | Pet           |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| soy-milk     | drama         | bird          |
| thriller     | time-travel   | ferret        |
| mirinda      | adventure     | goat          |
| almond-milk  | family        | mouse         |
| 7up          | superhero     | turtle        |
| soy-milk     |               |               |
| hot-chocolate|               |               |
| mirinda      |               |               |
| fanta        |               |               |
| soy-milk     |               |               |

Now, we have all unique beverages. However, we still have two 'soy-milk'. Let's replace one of them with 'fanta' in the sixth position:

| Beverage      | Movie-Genre   | Pet           |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| soy-milk     | drama         | bird          |
| thriller     | time-travel   | ferret        |
| mirinda      | adventure     | goat          |
| almond-milk  | family        | mouse         |
| 7up          | superhero     | turtle        |
| fanta        |               |               |
| hot-chocolate|               |               |
| mirinda      |               |               |
| fanta        |               |               |
| soy-milk     |               |               |

Now, we have a valid solution:

Lv6-3x7-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's start with the jobs. Since the analyst is in an odd position and not the pilot, manager, or project-manager, they can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the analyst is not the person watching musical movies (which is the entrepreneur), they can't be in positions 1 or 7. So, the analyst is either in position 3 or 5.

2. The entrepreneur is watching musical movies, so they are in position 2.

3. The pilot is not the person who's sport is basketball, so the pilot can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the pilot is not the analyst, manager, project-manager, or software-developer, they can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the pilot is not the person watching thriller movies (which is to the right of the manager), they can't be in position 6. So, the pilot is either in position 4 or 2.

4. The person who's sport is biathlon is watching musical movies, so they are in position 4.

5. The person watching zombie movies is to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (the pilot), so they can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. They can't be in position 7 because the person watching musical movies is the entrepreneur, and the entrepreneur is in position 2. So, the person watching zombie movies is in position 6.

6. The person who's sport is surfing is in an odd position and not the pilot, so they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Since the person who's sport is surfing is not the analyst (who is in position 3 or 5), they can't be in position 3. So, the person who's sport is surfing is in position 1.

7. The person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the pilot, so they can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. They can't be in position 7 because the person watching musical movies is the entrepreneur, and the entrepreneur is in position 2. So, the person watching fantasy movies is in position 6.

8. The person who's sport is badminton is on the far left or far right, so they can only be in positions 1 or 7. Since the person who's sport is surfing is in position 1, the person who's sport is badminton is in position 7.

9. The person who's sport is golf is not the person watching thriller movies, so they can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 6. They can't be in position 7 because the person who's sport is badminton is in that position. So, the person who's sport is golf is in position 2.

10. The manager is not the person who's sport is biathlon, so the manager can't be in position 4. Since the manager is not the analyst, pilot, project-manager, or software-developer, they can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the manager is not the person watching thriller movies (which is to the right of the manager), they can't be in position 5. So, the manager is either in position 1 or 7.

11. The person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the person who's sport is badminton, so they can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. They can't be in position 7 because the person who's sport is badminton is in that position. So, the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 6.

12. The person who's sport is basketball is not to the left of the person who's sport is surfing, so they can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5. They can't be in position 7 because the person who's sport is badminton is in that position. So, the person who's sport is basketball is in position 2, 4, or 6. Since the person who's sport is basketball is not the manager (who is in position 1 or 7), they can't be in position 1 or 7. So, the person who's sport is basketball is in position 4 or 6.

13. The project-manager is between the person watching disaster movies and the person watching mystery movies, so they can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. Since the project-manager is not the manager (who is in position 1 or 7), they can't be in position 1 or 7. Since the project-manager is not the person who's sport is biathlon (who is in position 4), they can't be in position 4. So, the project-manager is in position 6.

14. The person watching scientific movies is to the left of the dancer, so they can't be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. They can't be in position 2 because the project-manager is in that position. So, the person watching scientific movies is in position 4.

15. The dancer is not in position 4 because the person watching scientific movies is to the left of the dancer. So, the dancer can only be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7. Since the dancer is not the analyst (who is in position 3 or 5), they can't be in position 3 or 5. So, the dancer is in position 1 or 7. Since the dancer is not the person who's sport is badminton (who is in position 7), they are in position 1.

16. The software-developer is to the left of the person watching disaster movies, so they can't be in positions 2, 4, 6, or 7. They can't be in position 1 because the dancer is in that position. So, the software-developer is in position 3.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

For the movie-genres and sports, we don't have enough information to fill in the table. However, we know that the dancer watches mystery movies, the entrepreneur watches musical movies, the pilot watches zombie movies, the project-manager watches disaster movies, and the manager watches fantasy movies. We also know that the person who's sport is surfing is in position 1, the person who's sport is badminton is in position 7, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 4, the person who's sport is golf is in position 2, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 6. The rest of the sports and movie-genres can't be determined with the given information.

16. From rule 16, the fan of funk is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since we placed the fan of funk at position 2 and the fan of salsa at position 6, the salsa can't be at position 1. So, let's place the salsa at position 4.

17. From rule 17, the person watching crime movies is in an odd position. Since we placed the crime movies at position 6, the person watching crime movies is at position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But we already placed the musical movies at position 1, the superhero movies at position 3, and the time-travel movies at position 5. So, the crime movies must be at position 7.

18. From rule 18, the fan of punk is on the left or right of the fan of trance. Since we placed the fan of trance at position 2 and the fan of salsa at position 4, the fan of punk can be at position 1 or 3. But we already placed the musical movies at position 1. So, the fan of punk must be at position 3.

19. From rule 19, the person drinking sprite is not the person watching action movies. Since we placed the action movies at position 2, the sprite can't be at position 1. So, let's place the sprite at position 4.

20. From rule 20, the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since we placed the superhero movies at position 3 and the sprite at position 4, the superhero movies are correct.

23. From rule 23, the fan of punk is the person watching superhero movies. Since we placed the superhero movies at position 3 and the fan of punk at position 3, the fan of punk is correct.

24. From rule 24, the person drinking tea is watching time-travel movies. Since we placed the time-travel movies at position 5 and there is no tea left, there seems to be a contradiction.

25. From rule 25, the fan of classical music is the person drinking sprite. Since we placed the sprite at position 4 and there is no classical music genre left, there seems to be a contradiction.

There seems to be a contradiction in rules 24 and 25. The given information is not consistent, and it's not possible to solve the puzzle with the given constraints.
