Lv6-4x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are 2 different beverages, 2 different foods, 2 different hobbies, and 2 different jobs. So, each row in the table represents a unique item from each category.

2. From point 1.1, the beverages are soy-milk and sprite. Let's assign them to the first and second columns respectively.

3. From point 1.2, the foods are broccoli and mango. We know that the person eating mango is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. So, mango must be in the first column and broccoli in the second column.

4. From point 1.3, the hobbies are board-games and writing. We know that the person with the hobby of writing is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since we already placed mango and broccoli, the only remaining option for writing is the first column, and board-games must be in the second column.

5. From point 1.4, the manager is not the person eating mango, so the manager cannot be in the first column. Since we already placed the hobbies, the manager must be in the second column, and the job in the first column must be electrician.

6. Now, we have only one job left, which is manager. So, it must be in the second row.

The final solution table is:

  |            |      1      |      2      |

Lv6-4x2-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 2 different beverages, 2 movie-genres, 2 sports, and 2 types of transport, we can fill the first row with any of the four options for each category. Let's assume the initial table as follows:

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Almond-milk |

| Sport         | Skiing      | Volleyball   |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Boat        |

2. From point 1, the person watching comedy movies is in an odd position. Since the positions are numbered 1 and 2, the person watching comedy must be in position 1. So, the updated table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Almond-milk |

| Sport         | Skiing      | Volleyball   |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Boat        |

3. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the person watching comedy (which is the same as the person drinking 7up) is in position 1, the person skiing must be in position 2. So, the updated table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Almond-milk |

| Sport         | Skiing      | Volleyball   |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Boat        |

4. The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 1 (as we already know the person watching comedy is in position 1), the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2. So, the updated table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Almond-milk |

Lv6-4x2-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 movie genres, and 2 means of transport.

2. Let's assign variables to each category:
   - Beverage: A (7up) and B (soy-milk)
   - Hobby: X (filmmaking) and Y (woodworking)
   - Movie-Genre: Z (scientific) and W (zombie)
   - Transport: P (airplane) and Q (skateboard)

3. From the puzzle, we have the following clues:
   - W is on the far left, so W is in the first column (Column 1)
   - Y is not the person drinking 7up, so Y is not A
   - P is on the left of X, so P is in the first row (Row 1)

4. Now we have some possible arrangements:

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | W       | Z        |
   | P       | A        |
   | X       | Y        |
   | Q       | B        |

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | W       | Z        |
   | P       | B        |
   | X       | A        |
   | Q       | Y        |

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | W       | Z        |
   | P       | Y        |
   | X       | A        |
   | Q       | B        |

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |

   | W       | Z        |
   | P       | B        |
   | X       | Y        |
   | Q       | A        |

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | W       | Z        |
   | P       | A        |
   | X       | B        |
   | Q       | Y        |

5. Since we know that there are 2 different beverages, 2 hobbies, 2 movie genres, and 2 means of transport, the only possible solution is:

   | Column 1 | Column 2 |
   |----------|----------|
   | W       | Z        |

   | X       | B        |
   | Q       | Y        |

So the final solution table is:

Lv6-4x2-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are two different music-genres (electronic and punk), two different nationalities (brazilian and dutch), two different sports (swimming and tennis), and two different means of transport (airplane and roller).

2. Since there are only two of each, we can start filling in the table with one of each in each row. Let's start with the Music-Genre row:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |
   | Nationality   |           |          |
   | Sport         |           |          |
   | Transport     |           |          |

3. Now let's fill in the Nationality row. We know that the brazilian is the fan of punk, so we can place the brazilian in the Punk column:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   |           | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   | Dutch     |          |
   | Sport         |           |          |
   | Transport     |           |          |

4. Since the brazilian is the fan of punk, and there are only two music-genres, the Dutch must be a fan of electronic music. So we can fill in the Nationality row:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   |           |          |
   | Sport         |           |          |
   | Transport     |           |          |

5. Now let's fill in the Sport row. We know that the person who's sport is tennis is not the fan of punk, so the brazilian cannot be a tennis player. The only remaining sport for the Dutch is tennis, so we can fill in the Sport row:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   |           |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis    |          |
   | Transport     |           |          |

6. Finally, let's fill in the Transport row. We know that the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller. Since there are only two means of transport, the person driving the roller must be the Dutch, who is in the Electronic row. So we can place the brazilian in the Airplane row:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   |           |          |
   | Sport         | Tennis    |          |
   | Transport     | Airplane  | Roller  |

7. Now we can fill in the Nationality row to complete the table:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Sport         | Tennis    |          |
   | Transport     | Airplane  | Roller  |

8. The final solution table is:

   |               | Electronic | Punk     |
   | Music-Genre   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Nationality   | Dutch     | Brazil   |
   | Sport         | Tennis    |          |
   | Transport     | Airplane  | Roller  |

   We can put '#############' around the final solution table:

Lv6-4x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different hobbies, two different jobs, two different movie-genres, and two different pets, we can fill in the first row of the table with the unique options for each category:

   |               |     1      |    2    |
   | Hobby         | Gardening  | Singing |
   | Job           | Dancer    | Journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Scientific |
   | Pet           | Cat      | Rabbit  |

2. From rule 1, the person who sings is somewhere to the right of the journalist. So, the hobby of the journalist must be Gardening, and the hobby of the person who sings must be Singing. Let's mark this in the table:

   |               |     1      |    2    |
   | Hobby         | Gardening  | Singing |
   | Job           | Dancer    | Journalist |
   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Scientific |
   | Pet           | Cat      | Rabbit  |

3. From rule 2, the person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit. Since we already know the hobbies and jobs, this means the person watching Fantasy cannot be the owner of the Cat either. So, the person watching Fantasy must be the owner of the Rabbit. Let's mark this in the table:

   |               |     1      |    2    |
   | Hobby         | Gardening  | Singing |

   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Scientific |
   | Pet           | Cat      | Rabbit (2) |

4. From rule 3, the person who sings is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we already know the owner of the rabbit is watching Fantasy, the person who sings cannot be the owner of the Rabbit. So, the person who sings must be the owner of the Cat. Let's mark this in the table:

   |               |     1      |    2    |
   | Hobby         | Gardening  | Singing (1) |

   | Movie-Genre   | Fantasy   | Scientific |
   | Pet           | Cat (1)   | Rabbit (2) |

5. Now we have filled all the unique options for each category, and all the rules are satisfied. So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-4x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since there are two different movie genres (horror and romance), and they are preferred by different people, we can place them in the first and second rows of the 'Movie-Genre' column, respectively. Let's assume Horror in the first row and Romance in the second row.

2. Similarly, since there are two different types of food (asparagus and tomato), and they are eaten by different people, we can place them in the first and second rows of the 'Food' column, respectively. Let's assume Asparagus in the first row and Tomato in the second row.

3. Since there are two different pets (cat and pony), and the cat owner is to the right of the person eating asparagus, the cat must be in the second row of the 'Pet' column. So, we place the pony in the first row.

4. The person who's sport is sailing is not the person eating asparagus, so the sailing sport cannot be in the first row. Since there are two different sports (golf and sailing), the sailing must be in the second row. This means golf must be in the first row.

5. Now, the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since we have already placed the movie genres, this means the person watching romance is in the second column (column 2), and the person watching horror is in the first column (column 1).

6. The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the person eating asparagus. Since we have already placed the cat owner and the asparagus eater, this means the asparagus eater is in the first row (row 1) and the cat owner is in the second row (row 2).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-4x2-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are two different jobs, two different music-genres, two different nationalities, and two different means of transport, we can fill in the first row of the table with one job, one music-genre, one nationality, and one transport. Let's fill the first row as follows:

   |               |        1        |    2    |
   | Job           | Lawyer         | Project-Manager |
   | Music-Genre   | Pop            | R&B          |
   | Nationality   | Argentine      | Chinese      |
   | Transport     | Roller         | Ship         |

2. From the third rule, the project-manager is on the left of the person driving the ship. So, the first row is correct.

3. From the second rule, the argentine is on the left of the chinese. In our table, the argentine is in the first column, so the chinese must be in the second column.

4. Now, let's look at the first condition: ""the fan pop is not the chinese."" In our table, the fan of pop is the argentine (since the argentine prefers pop). The chinese prefers R&B, so the chinese is not a fan of pop. This condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-4x2-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are two people, so we can fill one cell in each row with a unique value. Let's start by filling the top row with the unique values for food:

2. From rule 1, we know that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of pop music. Since there are only two hobbies, the person with the hobby of puzzles must be on the right. So, we can fill the hobby column:

3. From rule 2, we know that the person eating onion is not the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the person eating onion must be on the left, and the person eating watermelon must be on the right.

Lv6-4x2-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are only two types of beverages, the person on the left drinks either coffee or water, and the person on the right drinks the other. Let's assume the person on the left drinks coffee (C).

2. Now, the person on the right drinks water (W).

3. Since the person drinking coffee is to the right of the person eating artichoke (A), the person eating artichoke must be on the left. So, the table looks like this:

   |            |      C     |       W      |
   | Beverage   | Coffee    | Water       |

4. The person eating corn (Corn) cannot be on the far left (as per rule 1), so they must be on the right. Since the person eating artichoke is on the left, the table now looks like this:

   |            |      C     |       W      |

5. The person with the hobby of board-games (BG) is not the person eating artichoke (as per rule 2), so BG must be on the right. Since the person eating corn is on the right, the table now looks like this:

   |            |      C     |       W      |
   | Beverage   | Coffee    | Water       |
   | Food       | Artichoke| Corn        |
   | Hobby      | BG        |             |
   | Sport      |           |             |

6. The person playing soccer (Soccer) is on the right of the person drinking water (as per rule 4). Since the person with the hobby of board-games is on the right, the person drinking water must be on the left. The table now looks like this:

   |            |      C     |       W      |
   | Beverage   | Coffee    | Water       |
   | Food       | Artichoke| Corn        |
   | Hobby      | BG        |             |
   | Sport      |           | Soccer      |

7. The only remaining sport is tennis (Tennis). Since the person playing soccer is on the right, the person playing tennis must be on the left. The final table is:

   |            |      C     |       W      |
   | Beverage   | Coffee    | Water       |
   | Food       | Artichoke| Corn        |
   | Hobby      | BG        | Tennis      |
   | Sport      | Soccer    | Tennis      |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|            |      Coffee     |       Water      |
| Beverage   | Coffee         | Water            |

Lv6-4x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food, two hobbies, two jobs, and two means of transport. So, we can fill the first row with the two types of food, the second row with the two hobbies, the third row with the two jobs, and the fourth row with the two means of transport.

2. From point 1.6, we know that the person driving the train is not the project-manager. So, the project-manager cannot be in the second row (Train).

3. Let's assume the project-manager is in the first row (Food). Since there are two types of food, the other person must be eating pomegranate. So, the first row becomes:

   | Food       | Lemon      | Pomegranate |
   |-----------|------------|-------------|

4. Now, the person driving the train cannot be the project-manager, so it must be the security-guard. The only remaining option for the second row is the Transport row, so the second row becomes:

   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks| Rock-climbing |
   |-----------|------------|--------------|

5. From point 2.2, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. So, the order of the hobbies must be Magic-tricks, Rock-climbing.

6. Now, the only remaining row is the Job row. Since the project-manager is eating lemon, the security-guard must be eating pomegranate. So, the Job row becomes:

   | Job        | Project-manager| Security-guard |
   |-----------|---------------|----------------|

7. From point 2.1, we know that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the project-manager is eating lemon and cannot drive the scooter, the only remaining option for the Transport row is the scooter. So, the Transport row becomes:

   | Transport  | Scooter      | Train          |
   |-----------|--------------|----------------|

8. Now, we have only one position left for the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate, and the project-manager is eating lemon and cannot drive the scooter, the only remaining option is the first row (Food). So, the first row becomes:

   | Food       | Lemon (Scooter driver) | Pomegranate (Project-manager) |
   |-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|

9. Finally, we have filled all the rows with the given conditions. The final solution table is:

   | Food       | Lemon (Scooter driver) | Pomegranate (Project-manager) |
   |-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
   | Hobby      | Magic-tricks           | Rock-climbing                |
   | Job        | Project-manager        | Security-guard               |
   | Transport  | Scooter               | Train                        |

#############
| Food       | Lemon (Scooter driver) | Pomegranate (Project-manager) |
|-----------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Hobby      | Magic-tricks           | Rock-climbing                |
| Job        | Project-manager        | Security-guard               |
| Transport  | Scooter               | Train                        |
