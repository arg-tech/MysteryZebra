Lv6-6x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the journalist is in an odd position (position 1, 3, or 5), let's assume the journalist is in position 1 (as we'll see later, this assumption helps us solve other clues). So, the Job in position 1 is Journalist.

2. The person drinking juice is in the middle, so it must be in position 2. Let's assume the Beverage in position 2 is Juice.

3. The Spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is Sudoku. Since the journalist is in position 1 and we assumed the hobby of the person in position 2 is Juice (which is not Sudoku), the Spanish cannot be in position 2. So, the Spanish must be in position 3 or 5. But since the journalist is in position 1, the Spanish cannot be in position 5 because it would violate rule 3 (the Spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is Sudoku). So, the Spanish must be in position 3. Therefore, the Nationality in position 3 is Spanish.

4. Now, we know the hobby of the person in position 3 is not Sudoku (because the Spanish is in position 3), and the hobby of the person in position 2 is Juice. So, the hobby in position 1 must be Sudoku.

5. The person watching family movies is not the person drinking lemonade. Since we know the person in position 2 drinks Juice and the person in position 1 does Sudoku, the person in position 4 or 5 must watch family movies. But since the entrepreneur is between the fan funk and the Spanish (in position 3), the person in position 4 cannot watch family movies (because the only remaining option for the Movie-Genre in position 4 is family, and it would violate rule 5). So, the person in position 5 watches family movies. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in position 5 is Family.

6. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right. Since the Spanish is in position 3 and the person watching family movies is in position 5, the person in position 6 must have Hobby as Hiking.

7. The person watching scientific movies is in an even position. Since we know the person in position 5 watches family movies and the person in position 6 has Hobby as Hiking, the person in position 4 must watch scientific movies. Therefore, the Movie-Genre in position 4 is Scientific.

8. The entrepreneur is between the fan funk and the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in position 3 and the person watching scientific movies is in position 4, the entrepreneur must be in position 2. Therefore, the Job in position 2 is Entrepreneur.

9. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the entrepreneur is in position 2 and the person watching scientific movies is in position 4, the person in position 5 must drink Lemonade. Therefore, the Beverage in position 5 is Lemonade.

10. The chinese is on the left of the electrician. Since the entrepreneur is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 4 or 6. But since the person watching scientific movies is in position 4, the electrician must be in position 6. Therefore, the Nationality in position 6 is Chinese.

11. The only remaining position is position 1, which is the journalist. So, the Job in position 1 is Journalist.

12. The only remaining items are the Music-Genres. Since the person in position 2 is an entrepreneur and the person in position 5 is drinking Lemonade, the person in position 3 must be the fan of Funk. Since the Spanish is in position 3, the Music-Genre in position 3 is Funk. The person in position 4 is watching scientific movies, so the Music-Genre in position 4 is not important. The person in position 6 is Chinese, so the Music-Genre in position 6 is not important either. So, the Music-Genre in position 1 (the journalist) can be any of the remaining genres (Gospel or Hip-Hop).

So, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |      2       |      3      |
| Beverage      | Journalist | Entrepreneur | Spanish     |

The exact Music-Genre for the journalist (position 1) is not specified due to the ambiguity in the given clues."	{'beverage': ['journalist', 'entrepreneur', 'spanish'], 'hobby': ['sudoku', 'cooking', 'hiking'], 'job': ['journalist', 'entrepreneur', 'electrician'], 'movie-genre': ['', 'family', 'scientific'], 'music-genre': ['', '', 'funk'], 'nationality': ['chinese', 'canadian', 'spanish']}	True	5	False
Lv6-6x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and the Malaysian must be in an odd position, they can only be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the Malaysian is in position 1 for now.

2. The bird owner is to the left of the lawyer. So, the lawyer can't be in position 1 (because the Malaysian is there), so the lawyer must be in position 2 or 4. If the lawyer is in position 2, the bird owner must be in position 1, which contradicts our assumption. So, the lawyer is in position 4. This means the bird owner is in position 3.

3. The Japanese is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the lawyer (who is in position 4) doesn't have a hobby of board-games, the Japanese can't be in position 4. So, the Japanese must be in position 2 or 5. But if the Japanese is in position 2, the Malaysian can't be in position 1 (because the Japanese is to the right of the board-games person), which contradicts our initial assumption. So, the Japanese must be in position 5.

4. The person who's sport is skateboarding is the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian can't be in position 1 (because the Malaysian is there), the Egyptian must be in position 2, 3, or 5. But if the Egyptian is in position 2, the Japanese can't be in position 5 (because the Egyptian is the skateboarder and the Japanese is to the right of the board-games person), which contradicts our assumption. So, the Egyptian must be in position 3.

5. The person who's sport is surfing is on the far left. Since the Malaysian is in position 1 and the Egyptian is in position 3, the surfer must be in position 1.

6. The person drinking 7up is in the middle. Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the 7up drinker can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the 7up drinker must be in position 5.

7. The person drinking tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the Malaysian is in position 1, the tea drinker can't be in position 1 or 3. The Egyptian is in position 3 and the Japanese is in position 5, so the tea drinker must be in position 1.

8. The nurse is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the tea drinker (who is the drawer) is in position 1, the nurse must be in position 3.

9. The electrician is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since the Egyptian is the skateboarder and the surfer is the Malaysian, the electrician can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, the electrician must be in position 4.

10. The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the Malaysian is the cat owner (in position 1) and the nurse is in position 3, the chinchilla owner must be in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 6 people and they have 3 different hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and means of transport, each category will have 2 repetitions.

2. Let's assign the hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, sports, and means of transport to the numbers 1 to 6. We'll use the same number for the repetition of each category.

3. From rule 1.4, the person who's hobby is drawing is in an odd position. So, Drawing can be either 1 or 3. Let's assume Drawing = 1 for now.

4. From rule 2.2, the fan of house is not the person who's sport is handball. Since there are only 2 repetitions for each category, House cannot be paired with Handball. So, House can be either 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume House = 2 for now.

5. From rule 3.3, the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball. Since Drawing = 1 and House = 2, Cycling cannot be 1 or 2. So, Cycling can be either 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume Cycling = 3 for now.

6. From rule 4.4, the person who's sport is volleyball is not the fan of House. Since House = 2, Volleyball cannot be 2. So, Volleyball can be either 4 or 6. Let's assume Volleyball = 4 for now.

7. From rule 5.5, the police-officer is not the fan of Soul. Since we haven't assigned Soul yet, let's assume Soul = 5 for now.

8. From rule 6.6, the person watching disaster movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since Cycling = 3, Disaster cannot be 1 or 2. So, Disaster can be either 4 or 6. Let's assume Disaster = 6 for now.

9. From rule 8.8, the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies. Since we haven't assigned Epic yet, let's assume Epic = 1 for now.

10. From rule 9, the person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since Filmmaking is not assigned yet, let's assume Filmmaking = 3 for now.

11. From rule 10.10, the dancer is between the person driving the quad-bike and the bartender. Since we haven't assigned Quad-bike or Bartender yet, let's assume Quad-bike = 5 and Bartender = 2 for now.

12. From rule 11.11, the person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since Thriller is not assigned yet, let's assume Thriller = 4 for now.

13. From rule 7.7, the person driving the tram is between the person watching thriller movies and the person driving the quad-bike. Since Thriller = 4 and Quad-bike = 5, Tram can only be 3.

14. Now we have all the assignments: Drawing = 1, House = 2, Cycling = 3, Volleyball = 4, Soul = 5, Disaster = 6, Epic = 1, Filmmaking = 3, Thriller = 4, Tram = 3, Dancer = 2, Bartender = 2.

15. The final solution table is:

Lv6-6x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Pet, Sport). Since there are 3 options for each category, we can fill in the first row with the 3 different beverages, the second row with the 3 different foods, the third row with the 3 different hobbies, the fourth row with the 3 different movie-genres, the fifth row with the 3 different pets, and the sixth row with the 3 different sports.

2. From rule 1, we know that the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Let's assume the hobby reader is in position 6. Then, the artichoke eater must be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the hobby reader cannot be in position 1 (because of rule 5), the artichoke eater must be in position 2. So, we have:

   | Beverage      | coffee | mirinda | soy-milk |
   | Food          | artichoke | grapes | mango |
   | Hobby         | hiking | reading | sudoku |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure | animation | musical |
   | Pet           | fish | gold | hamster |
   | Sport         | baseball | cycling | surfing |

3. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is in position 2, the person drinking coffee must be in position 3 or 6. However, if the person drinking coffee was in position 6, the person drinking soy-milk would have to be in position 1 (because of rule 3), which contradicts rule 6 (the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk). So, the person drinking coffee must be in position 3.

4. From rule 6, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the person owning the hamster must be in position 2.

5. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the hobby reader is in position 6, the person doing cycling must be in position 1 or 2. However, if the person doing cycling was in position 1, the person doing hiking would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 9), which contradicts rule 7 (the person doing cycling is on the left of the person doing reading). So, the person doing cycling must be in position 2.

6. From rule 8, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3, the person doing sudoku must be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, or 6 (but not 3). However, if the person doing sudoku was in position 1, the person doing hiking would have to be in position 6 (because of rule 9), which contradicts rule 7 (the person doing cycling is on the left of the person doing reading). If the person doing sudoku was in position 2, it would contradict rule 4 (the person drinking coffee is to the right of the person drinking mirinda). If the person doing sudoku was in position 4, it would contradict rule 6 (the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk). If the person doing sudoku was in position 5, it would contradict rule 1 (the person eating artichoke is to the left of the person who's hobby is reading). So, the person doing sudoku must be in position 5.

7. From rule 9, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person doing hiking is in position 4, the person doing baseball must be in position 5 or 6. However, if the person doing baseball was in position 5, it would contradict rule 5 (the person eating mango is to the left of the person doing reading). So, the person doing baseball must be in position 6.

8. From rule 11, we know that the person watching musical movies is the person eating grapes. Since the person eating grapes is in position 1, the person watching musical movies is in position 1.

9. Now we can fill in the remaining positions:

   | Beverage      | coffee | mirinda | soy-milk |
   | Food          | artichoke | grapes | mango |
   | Hobby         | hiking | reading | sudoku |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure | animation | musical |
   | Pet           | fish | gold | hamster |

Lv6-6x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and each has 6 attributes, we can represent each person as a 6-digit number where each digit corresponds to the attribute (hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, sport). For example, if the first person's hobby is board-games, job is architect, prefers documentary, likes classical music, is Canadian, and plays basketball, we can represent them as 1204051.

2. From the clues, we know that each digit is unique for each person (different hobbies, jobs, etc.).

3. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the Russian is not the person watching sports movies (clue 9), the Russian cannot be in the 5th position. So, the Russian must be either 2 or 3. Let's assume the Russian is in position 3 (Russian: 03X...).

4. Since the nurse is in an even position (clue 5), the nurse cannot be in position 1 or 3. So, the nurse must be in position 2. Let's assume the nurse is X2... (job: ...2...).

5. From clue 2, the person watching western movies is to the left of the journalist. Since the nurse is a journalist (job: ...2...), the person watching western movies must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume the person watching western movies is in position 1 (movies: ...1...).

6. From clue 4, the person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the Indonesian. Since the Russian is not the person watching sports movies (clue 9), the Indonesian cannot be in position 3. So, the Indonesian must be in position 2 or 3. Let's assume the Indonesian is in position 3 (nationality: ...03...).

7. From clue 8, the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the Indonesian plays basketball (sport: ...03...), the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 1. Let's assume the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 1 (hobby: 1...).

8. From clue 7, the indonesian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left (hobby: 1...), the Indonesian cannot be on the far right. So, the Indonesian is in position 3 (nationality: ...03...).

9. From clue 6, the person who's sport is biathlon is in an even position. Since the Indonesian plays basketball (sport: ...03...), the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 2. Let's assume the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 2 (sport: ...2...).

10. From clue 1, the fan of classical music is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left (hobby: 1...), the fan of classical music must be on the far right.

11. From clue 3, the fan of r&b is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical music. Since the fan of classical music is on the far right, the fan of r&b must be in position 3. Let's assume the fan of r&b is in position 3 (music-genre: ...3...).

12. From clue 10, the fan of r&b is on the far left or far right. Since we already placed the fan of r&b in position 3, it must be on the far right.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Hobby         | board-games | biathlon   | r&b           |
| Job           |           |           |               |
| Movie-Genre   |           |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |           |           | r&b           |
| Nationality   | canadian   | indonesian | russian       |
| Sport         |           | basketball | water-polo    |

We still have to fill in the jobs, movie genres, and the remaining movie genre for the first person. Since the first person is the Canadian (nationality: canadian), they cannot be the journalist (job: ...2...). So, the first person's job cannot be architect or nurse. Since the first person's hobby is board-games, they cannot prefer sports movies (movie-genre: ...1...). Since the first person's music genre is not r&b (music-genre: ...), the first person's music genre cannot be classical (since the fan of classical music is on the far right). So, the first person's music genre is metal.

Since the first person's hobby is board-games, they cannot prefer documentary movies (since the person watching documentary movies is between the person watching sports movies and the Indonesian). So, the first person's movie genre is either western or another sports genre. Since the first person's music genre is metal, the first person cannot be the fan of classical music. So, the first person's movie genre is western.

Since the first person's hobby is board-games, they cannot be the fan of r&b (since the fan of r&b is on the far right). So, the first person's job must be architect.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Hobby         | board-games | biathlon   | r&b           |

Lv6-6x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, nationalities, pets, and sports, we can fill in the first row with one hobby, one job, one music-genre, one nationality, one pet, and one sport. Let's assume the first row is filled as follows:

   |               | Collecting | Fisherman | Classical | American | Mouse | Swimming |
   | Hobby         |               |            |            |         |         |           |
   | Job           |               |            |            |       |         |           |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |            |       |         |           |
   | Nationality   |               |            |            | American|         |           |
   | Pet           |               |            |            |       | Mouse    |           |

2. From point 11, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the fan electronic. Since the American is the fan techno (point 5), and techno is not electronic (different music-genres), the fan electronic must be in the first or second column. Let's assume the fan electronic is in the first column:

   |               | Collecting | Fisherman | Electronic | American | Mouse | Swimming |
   | Hobby         |               |            |            |         |         |           |

4. From point 9, we know that the fan electronic is on the left or right of the Australian. Since the Australian is in the first column, the fan electronic must be in the second column.

6. From point 4, we know that the scientist is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the sport is golf in the first row, the scientist must be in the third row.

7. From point 6, we know that the social-worker is on the far left or far right. Since the scientist is in the third row, the social-worker must be in the first or sixth row. However, the social-worker cannot be in the first row because the fisherman is not the owner of the mouse (point 7), and the only available pet in the first row is the mouse. So, the social-worker must be in the sixth row.

13. From point 6, we know that the social-worker is on the far left or far right. Since the social-worker is in the sixth column, the fisherman must be in the fifth column.

14. From point 3, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is the fan techno. Since the American is the fan techno (point 5) and the American is in the third column, the hobby sudoku must be in the third column. However, this contradicts our previous placement of sudoku in the third column. This means that our initial assumption about the fan electronic being in the first column was incorrect. Let's try placing the fan electronic in the second column instead:

Lv6-6x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 items (jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, sports, transport) to be placed in the table.

2. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the goat is not the fan of techno. So, we can place the goat owner in the first, second, or third row (not the third column since the goat owner is the soccer player). Let's place the goat owner in the first row for now.

3. From rule 9, we know that the person watching adventure movies is the owner of the goat. So, we can place adventure in the first column of the first row.

4. From rule 2, we know that the person driving the boat is in an odd position. Since the first row is filled, the boat driver must be in the second or third row. Let's place the boat driver in the second row for now.

5. From rule 4, we know that the engineer is to the right of the person playing lacrosse. Since the first row is filled, the lacrosse player must be in the second or third row. Let's place the lacrosse player in the second row for now. So, the engineer must be in the third row.

6. From rule 5, we know that the police-officer is not the fan of jazz. Since the first row is filled, the jazz fan cannot be in the first column of the second or third row. So, the jazz fan must be in the second column of the first row (since the goat owner is already in the first column of the first row).

7. From rule 6, we know that the fan of techno is to the left of the fan of jazz. So, the techno fan must be in the first column of the second row.

8. From rule 7, we know that the police-officer is to the right of the fan of jazz. So, the police-officer must be in the third column of the second row.

9. From rule 8, we know that the person playing lacrosse is not watching superhero movies. So, superhero movies cannot be in the second column of the second row (since the lacrosse player is already there). Superhero movies must be in the third column of the second row.

10. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the tram is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching disaster movies. Since the first row is filled, the tram driver must be in the second row. The only available spot is between the techno fan (adventure) and the police-officer (disaster). So, the tram driver is watching disaster movies.

11. Now, we have filled the second row: Techno (boat), Disaster (tram), Lacrosse (police-officer).

12. From rule 3, we know that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the second row is filled, the snake owner must be in the third row.

13. From rule 4, we know that the engineer is to the right of the person playing lacrosse. Since the second row is filled, the engineer must be in the third row as well.

14. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different jobs. Since we have already placed the engineer and the police-officer, the remaining job must be the analyst.

15. From rule 2, we know that the person driving the boat is in an odd position. Since the second row is filled, the boat driver cannot be the analyst. So, the analyst must be in the first row.

16. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different movie-genres. Since we have already placed adventure and disaster, the remaining movie-genre must be superhero.

17. From rule 1, we know that there are 3 different music-genres. Since we have already placed techno, the remaining music-genres must be jazz and trance.

18. From rule 6, we know that the fan of techno is to the left of the fan of jazz. Since the second row is filled, the fan of jazz must be in the first row.

19. From rule 7, we know that the police-officer is to the right of the fan of jazz. So, the police-officer must be in the third column of the first row.

20. From rule 5, we know that the police-officer is not the fan of jazz. So, the fan of jazz must be in the second column of the first row.

21. From rule 11, we know that the owner of the goat is not the fan of techno. Since the first row is filled, the goat owner cannot be in the first column (since the jazz fan is already there). So, the goat owner must be in the third column of the first row.

22. From rule 9, we know that the person watching adventure movies is the owner of the goat. So, the goat owner must be in the first row. This contradicts our previous placement of the goat owner in the third column of the first row. However, since the goat owner is the police-officer (from rule 1), we can swap the positions of the police-officer and the analyst in the first row.

23. Now, the final solution table is:

   |               |    1     |     2     |       3        |
   | Job           | analyst  | police-officer | engineer |
   | Movie-Genre   | adventure  | superhero   | disaster |
   | Music-Genre   | jazz     | techno      | trance   |
   | Pet           | frog     | goat       | snake    |
   | Sport         | lacrosse | soccer     | parkour  |
   | Transport     | boat     | tram       | ship     |

Lv6-6x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the owner of the mouse is the electrician, so let's place the electrician in the third position (since there are 3 people). Let's assume the electrician is in position 3.

2. The person who's sport is soccer is between the pilot and the social-worker. Since the electrician is in position 3, the pilot must be in position 1 and the social-worker in position 2 or 4. Let's assume the pilot is in position 1 and the social-worker is in position 2.

3. The person watching satire movies is not the person driving the motorbike, so the motorbike can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3 (since the electrician, pilot, and social-worker are already placed). Let's assume the motorbike is in position 4.

4. The fan funk is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person watching comedy movies. Since the social-worker is watching soccer (which is not comedy), the social-worker can't be the fan of funk. The fan of funk can't be in positions 1, 2, or 4 (since the motorbike and the social-worker are already placed). Let's assume the fan of funk is in position 5.

5. The owner of the hamster is not the pilot, so the hamster can't be in positions 1 or 4. Since the electrician has the mouse and the fan of funk can't be in position 5, the hamster must be in position 2.

6. The electrician is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the electrician is in position 3, the person who rows must be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume the rower is in position 1.

7. The owner of the hamster is on the far right, so the person watching comedy movies must be in position 6.

8. The fan techno is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the motorbike is in position 4 and the hamster is in position 2, the snowmobile can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the snowmobile is in position 5.

9. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the motorbike is in position 4 and the snowmobile is in position 5, the bike must be in position 3.

10. The person watching satire movies is not the person driving the motorbike, so the person driving the bike (who is in position 3) can't watch satire movies. The only remaining option for satire is position 6.

11. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since the social-worker is in position 2 and the mouse is owned by the electrician (who is in position 3), the mouse can't be in position 1. So, the mouse is in position 4.

Lv6-6x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 people, so each row represents one person. Let's label them A, B, and C from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the gardener is not an R&B fan, so let's assume A is not an R&B fan.

3. From rule 2, the drawer is to the right of the sports movie fan, so A cannot be the sports movie fan. Let's assume B is the sports movie fan.

4. From rule 3, the musical movie fan is on the far right, so C is the musical movie fan.

5. From rule 4, the folk fan is to the left of the rugby player. Since A is not an R&B fan, and C is the musical fan, A or B could be the folk fan. Let's assume A is the folk fan for now.

6. From rule 5, the pineapple eater is the subway driver. Since we don't know the position of the subway driver yet, we can't place the pineapple yet.

7. From rule 6, the swimmer is the airplane driver. Since we know the musical fan is C, and the swimmer is the airplane driver, C cannot be the swimmer. So, B is the swimmer.

8. From rule 7, the R&B fan is on the left or right of the airplane driver. Since B is the swimmer (airplane driver), A or C could be the R&B fan. Let's assume A is the R&B fan for now.

9. From rule 9, the disaster movie fan is in an odd position. Since we have placed 3 people already (A, B, C), the disaster movie fan must be the last one, so C is the disaster movie fan.

10. From rule 10, the skydiving person is to the right of the ship driver. Since we don't know the position of the ship driver yet, we can't place the skydiving person yet.

11. From rule 11, the rugby player is on the far right. Since C is the disaster movie fan and cannot be the rugby player (rule 9), B must be the rugby player.

12. From rule 12, the salsa fan is to the left of the airplane driver (B). So, A cannot be the salsa fan. Therefore, A must be the gardener.

Now, we have placed 5 people: A (gardener, R&B fan), B (swimmer, rugby player), C (disaster movie fan), and we know that C is not the pineapple eater (since B is the swimmer). So, the pineapple eater must be A.

We still have to place the salsa fan and the ship driver. Since A is the gardener and cannot be the salsa fan, and B is the rugby player and cannot be the salsa fan, the salsa fan must be C.

Since we know the positions of A (left), B (right), and C (right), the only remaining position is the center. The ship driver cannot be the gardener (rule 8), the R&B fan (rule 8), the salsa fan (already placed), or the disaster movie fan (already placed). So, the ship driver must be the pineapple eater.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 variables for each category (Beverage, Job, Music-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport) and 3 people. So, each variable will be repeated twice.

2. Let's assign the variables for the first person:
   - Beverage: almond-milk (AM)
   - Job: fisherman (F)
   - Music-Genre: classical (C)
   - Nationality: canadian (Can)
   - Pet: ferret (Fer)
   - Transport: helicopter (H)

3. Now let's assign the variables for the second person:
   - Beverage: iced-tea (IT) or tea (T) (We don't know yet)
   - Job: lawyer (L)
   - Music-Genre: rock (R)
   - Nationality: french (Fr)
   - Pet: fish (Fish)
   - Transport: jet-ski (JS) or ship (S) (We don't know yet)

4. Assign the variables for the third person:
   - Beverage: tea (T) (Since the first person drinks almond-milk and the second person drinks iced-tea or tea, the third person must drink tea)
   - Job: musician (M)
   - Music-Genre: trance (T)
   - Nationality: polish (P)
   - Pet: rat (R)
   - Transport: ship (S) (Since the first person is on a helicopter and the second person is on a jet-ski or ship, the third person must be on the ship)

5. Now let's use the given clues:

   - The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the fish: The first person (Fisherman) is on the left of the second person (Fish owner).
   - The owner of the rat is not the fan classical: The second person (Rat owner) is not a fan of classical music (Rock or Trance).
   - The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the polish: The Rat owner is either the third person (Polish) or to the right of the third person.
   - The polish is the person driving the helicopter: The third person (Polish) is driving the helicopter (H).
   - The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski: The first person (Fisherman) is on the left of the second person (Jet-ski driver).
   - The fan trance is somewhere to the right of the french: The third person (Polish) is a fan of trance music.
   - The polish is on the right of the fisherman: The third person (Polish) is to the right of the first person (Fisherman).
   - The lawyer is on the right of the musician: The second person (Lawyer) is to the right of the third person (Musician).
   - The person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the ferret: The second person (Lawyer) is on the right of the first person (Fisherman, who owns the ferret).

6. Now we can arrange the table:

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | iced-tea/tea | tea      |
| Job           | fisherman  | lawyer      | musician  |
| Music-Genre   | classical  | rock        | trance    |
| Nationality   | canadian   | french      | polish    |
| Pet           | ferret     | fish        | rat       |
| Transport     | helicopter | jet-ski/ship| ship      |

Since the second person's beverage is not specified, it can be either iced-tea or tea. The final solution table will be:
