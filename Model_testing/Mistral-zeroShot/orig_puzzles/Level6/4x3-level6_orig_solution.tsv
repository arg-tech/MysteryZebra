Lv6-4x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating asparagus is driving the car, so we can place asparagus in the Food column under row 1 and car in the Transport column under row 1.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    |           |               |            |
   | Food        | asparagus |               |            |
   | Sport       |           |               |            |
   | Transport   | car       |               |            |

2. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the jet-ski, we can place hot-chocolate in the Beverage column under row 2 and jet-ski in the Transport column under row 2.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    |           | hot-chocolate |            |

   | Sport       |           |               |            |
   | Transport   | car       | jet-ski       |            |

3. The person eating grapefruit is the person driving the roller, so we can place grapefruit in the Food column under row 3 and roller in the Transport column under row 3.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    |           | hot-chocolate | grapefruit  |
   | Food        | asparagus |               | roller     |
   | Sport       |           |               |            |
   | Transport   | car       | jet-ski       | roller     |

4. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the person eating asparagus, so volleyball cannot be in the Sport column under row 1.

5. The person eating lemon is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball is not in row 1, the only possible position for lemon is in the Food column under row 2.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    |           | hot-chocolate | grapefruit  |
   | Food        | asparagus | lemon         | roller     |

   | Transport   | car       | jet-ski       | roller     |

6. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since hot-chocolate is already in the Beverage column under row 2, 7up must be in the Beverage column under row 1.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    | 7up       | hot-chocolate |            |
   | Food        | asparagus | lemon         | roller     |
   | Sport       |           |               |            |
   | Transport   | car       | jet-ski       | roller     |

7. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since volleyball is not in row 1, the only possible positions for cricket and badminton are in the Sport column under rows 1 and 2, respectively.

   |             |     1     |       2       |     3      |
   | Beverage    | 7up       | hot-chocolate |            |
   | Food        | asparagus | lemon         | roller     |
   | Sport       | cricket   | badminton     | volleyball  |
   | Transport   | car       | jet-ski       | roller     |

Lv6-4x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From point 7, we know that the Japanese (Cauliflower) is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish. So, the Spanish cannot be in the first position (as there is no one to the left of them). Therefore, the Spanish must be in the third position.

2. From point 5, we know that the Japanese is eating cauliflower. So, the cauliflower must be in the third column.

3. From point 8, we know that the American is not eating onion. So, onion cannot be in the first or third column (as the Spanish and the Japanese are already in those positions). Therefore, onion must be in the second column.

4. From point 1, we know that the person driving the motorbike is either in the first or second position (as the Spanish is in the third position). However, from point 7, we know that the Japanese is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish. So, the person driving the skateboard must be in the third position. Therefore, the motorbike driver must be in the first position.

5. From point 2, we know that the person eating onion is to the left of the person eating cauliflower. Since the cauliflower is in the third column, the onion must be in the first column.

6. From point 3, we know that the doctor is not the American. Since the American is not eating onion (point 8), the doctor cannot be in the first column (as the first column is occupied by the onion eater). So, the doctor must be in the second or third column. However, from point 4, we know that the doctor is to the right of the dressmaker. Since the Spanish is in the third position (point 1), the dressmaker must be in the second position. Therefore, the doctor must be in the third position.

7. From point 6, we know that the doctor is not the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard driver is in the third position (point 4), the doctor cannot be in the third position (as they are in the second or third column). So, the doctor must be in the second column.

8. Now we know the positions of all the people and their jobs. The nationality of the person in the first column (onion eater) doesn't matter as it doesn't affect any of the given conditions. The nationality of the person in the second column (doctor) is American (as they are not the onion eater and are not the skateboard driver). The nationality of the person in the third column (Spanish) is known.

So, the final solution table is:

  |               |      Onion      |       Cauliflower      |      Spanish      |
| Food          | American        | Japanese              |                |
| Job           | Doctor          | Architect            | Dressmaker       |
| Nationality   | American        | Japanese              | Spanish          |

Lv6-4x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the fan of punk is not in the first column (since the scientist is in the first row). So, the fan of punk can only be in the second or third column.

2. From rule 2, the fan of country is between the owner of the frog and the fan of electronic. Since the scientist is the only one who can't be the fan of country (rule 4), and the fan of country can't be in the first column (rule 2), the fan of country must be in the second column.

3. From rule 2, we also know that the fan of electronic can't be in the third column. So, the fan of electronic must be in the first column.

4. From rule 5, the fan of country is not the person who has writing as a hobby. Since the fan of country is in the second column (rule 2), the person with writing as a hobby must be in the first or third column.

5. From rule 6, the person who has rock-climbing as a hobby is to the right of the person who has fishing as a hobby. Since the fan of electronic is in the first column (rule 3), the person with rock-climbing as a hobby can't be in the first row. So, the person with rock-climbing as a hobby must be in the second or third row.

6. From rule 7, the mechanic is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the fan of electronic is in the first row (rule 3), the mechanic can't be in the first row. So, the mechanic must be in the second or third row.

7. From rule 8, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the fan of electronic is in the first row (rule 3), the owner of the chinchilla can't be in the first row. So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the second or third row.

8. Now, we know that the fan of punk is in the second or third column, the fan of electronic is in the first column, the fan of country is in the second column, and the person with writing as a hobby is in the first or third column. The person with rock-climbing as a hobby is in the second or third row, the mechanic is in the second or third row, and the owner of the chinchilla is in the second or third row.

9. Since there are only 3 people and we know the positions of 5 of them (the fan of electronic, the fan of country, the person with writing as a hobby, the person with rock-climbing as a hobby, and the mechanic), we can deduce the positions of the remaining 2 people (the security-guard and the owner of the chinchilla).

10. The security-guard can't be in the first row (since the fan of electronic is there), so the security-guard must be in the second or third row. Since the mechanic is in the second or third row, the security-guard can't be in the third row. So, the security-guard must be in the second row.

11. The owner of the chinchilla can't be in the first row (since the fan of electronic is there), and can't be in the second row (since the security-guard is there). So, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the third row.

12. Now we know the positions of all 3 people. The hobbies, jobs, music-genres, and pets can be filled in accordingly.

Lv6-4x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 3 different hobbies, jobs, music-genres, and nationalities. So, each row and each column must have a unique value.

2. Let's start with the Nationality column. Since the French is on the left of the Mexican, and there are only 3 nationalities, the Nationality column must be in this order: Mexican, French, Canadian.

3. Now let's fill in the Job column. The musician is not the person who's hobby is puzzles, so the musician can't be in the first row or the third row because those are the only rows where the hobby of puzzles can be. So, the Job column must be in this order: Bartender, Musician, Pilot.

4. The fan of house music is the French. Since the French is in the second row, the Music-Genre column must be in this order: Classical, House, Hip-Hop.

5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the hobby of reading can't be in the first column (because the hobby of puzzles is there), the hobby of reading must be in the second or third column. But if the hobby of reading was in the second column, the musician (who is not the person who's hobby is puzzles) would be the fan of house music (which is the French), contradicting our previous conclusion. So, the hobby of reading must be in the third column. The only hobby left for the first column is gardening. So, the Hobby column must be in this order: Gardening, Puzzles, Reading.

6. The musician is between the Canadian and the fan of hip-hop. Since the Canadian is in the third row and the fan of hip-hop must be in the second or third row (because the fan of house music is in the second row), the musician must be in the second row. But the only job left for the second row is pilot, which contradicts our previous conclusion that the musician is not the pilot. This means our assumption that the fan of hip-hop is in the second or third row was incorrect. The fan of hip-hop must be in the first row. So, the correct order of the Hobby column is: Gardening, Hip-Hop, Reading.

7. Now we can fill in the Job column: Bartender, Musician, Pilot.

8. Finally, we can fill in the Music-Genre column: Classical, House, Hip-Hop.

The final solution table is:

| Hobby         | Gardening | Hip-Hop  | Reading   |

Lv6-4x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the chinchilla owner is to the left of the lawyer, we can place them in the first or second column. Let's place the chinchilla owner in the first column (1) for now.

2. The person eating spinach is between the videographer and the fan of techno. Since the chinchilla owner is in the first column, the only possible position for the fan of techno is in the third column (3). The only remaining position for the videographer is in the second column (2). So, the person eating spinach must be in the first column (1).

3. Now we know the person eating spinach is in the first column (1), so the owner of the horse must be in the second or third column. Let's place the horse owner in the third column (3) for now.

4. The person eating apple is on the left or right of the lawyer. Since the horse owner is in the third column (3), the person eating apple must be in the second column (2).

   |---|---|---|
   | Food | Garlic |  |
   | Music-Genre |  |  |
   | Sport | Biathlon |  |
   | Transport |  |  |

2. The fan of country is the person driving the motorbike. Since the person driving the motorbike is to the right of the fan of soul (from point 7), and the fan of soul can't be in column 1 (since the person eating garlic is there), the fan of country must be in column 2 or 3. However, since the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of country (from point 6), the fan of country must be in column 1. So, let's place country in the first row (row 1) and motorbike in the second row (row 2).

Since the person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van (from point 8), and the person eating corn can't be in column 1 (since the person eating garlic is there), the person driving the van must be in column 2 or 3. However, since the person who's sport is rugby is to the left of the person driving the van (from point 4), the person driving the van must be in column 3. So, let's place van in the third column (column 3) and leave the third row empty for now.

Since the person driving the van is in column 3, the person who's sport is rugby must be in column 1 or 2. However, since the person who's sport is baseball is on the far right (from point 5), the person who's sport is rugby can't be in column 3. So, the person who's sport is rugby must be in column 1 or 2. Since the person eating garlic is in column 1, the person who's sport is rugby must be in column 2. Let's place rugby in the second row (row 2).

5. The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby (from point 6). Since the person who's sport is rugby is in column 2, the fan of soul must be in column 3. Let's place soul in the first row (row 1).

7. The person driving the tram is not the person who's sport is baseball (since baseball is in the far right and tram can't be there). The person driving the tram is also not the person who's sport is biathlon (since biathlon is above the person driving the tram). The person driving the tram is also not the person who's sport is rugby (since rugby is to the left of the person driving the tram). The person driving the tram is also not the person who's music genre is country (since country is above the person driving the tram). The person driving the tram is also not the person who's food is garlic (since garlic is to the left of the person driving the tram). The only option left for the person driving the tram is the person who's music genre is soul. Let's place tram in the fourth row (row 4).

Lv6-4x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person eating apple is on the far left or far right. Let's assume the apple is on the far left (1st column).
2. Since the fan of reggae is the person eating apple, the reggae music-genre should be in the 1st column as well.
3. The fan of house is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. If the reggae is on the left, then house cannot be on the left because the fan of d&b is in the middle, and there's no room for both house and d&b on the left. So, house must be on the right.
4. The owner of the turtle is to the right of the person eating potato. Since we have placed reggae and house, the only remaining food is potato, which should be in the 3rd column.
5. Now, the owner of the chinchilla must be on the left of house, and the fan of d&b is in the middle. So, the chinchilla should be in the 2nd column.
6. The person driving the tram is the person eating apple, so the tram should be in the 1st row.
7. The person eating banana must be to the left or right of the person eating apple. Since apple is in the 1st column, banana can only be in the 2nd or 3rd column. If banana is in the 2nd column, it would mean that the chinchilla and house are in the same column, which is not possible. So, banana must be in the 3rd column.
8. The person driving the ship is not the fan of d&b. Since d&b is in the middle, the only remaining transport is the subway, which should be in the 2nd row.

Lv6-4x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the taxi driver is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Let's place the taxi driver in the rightmost column (column 3) and the documentary watcher in the leftmost column (column 1).

2. The fan of funk is watching fantasy movies. Since we already placed the documentary watcher and the taxi driver, we can place the fan of funk in the second column (column 2).

3. The person watching family movies is to the right of the fan of blues and to the left of the fan of fantasy movies. Since we already placed the fan of fantasy movies, we can place the family movie watcher in the third column (column 3).

5. The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Since we already placed the taxi driver, the only remaining option for golf is column 1.

6. The person who's sport is climbing is not the person watching fantasy movies. Since we already placed the fan of fantasy movies, the only remaining option for climbing is column 1.

Lv6-4x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 movie-genres, 3 music-genres, 3 nationalities, and 3 pets. So, each row and each column should have one unique value.

2. From point 1, we can deduce that the Italian cannot be in the first row (Movie-Genre) or the first column (Nationality) because there are only 2 other nationalities left for the other two rows. Let's assume the Italian is in the second row.

3. Since the Italian is not the fan of rock (point 1), the second row cannot be Music-Genre (Rock). So, the second row must be either Movie-Genre or Nationality.

4. The person watching martial-arts movies is not the owner of the mouse (point 3), so the third row cannot be Pet (Mouse).

5. Now, let's consider the second row as Nationality. Since the Italian is not in the first column (point 2), the second column must be Italian. This means the first row must be the Argentine (point 5).

6. The Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk (point 6), so the third column cannot be Argentine. Therefore, the third row must be Nationality (Egyptian).

7. The person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching comedy movies (point 7). Since the third row is Nationality (Egyptian), the second row must be Movie-Genre (Martial-Arts).

8. The person watching adventure movies is between the owner of the cat and the person watching martial-arts movies (point 4). Since the second row is Martial-Arts and the third row is Egyptian, the first row must be Movie-Genre (Adventure).

9. The only remaining option for the first column is Pet. Since the Argentine is not the owner of the mouse (point 3), the first row cannot be Pet (Mouse). So, the first column must be Pet (Cat).

10. Now, we know the first row is Movie-Genre (Adventure), the first column is Pet (Cat), and the second column is Nationality (Italian). The only remaining option for the second row is Music-Genre. Since the Italian is not the fan of rock (point 1), the second row must be either Dubstep or Punk. But the Argentine is somewhere to the right of the fan of punk (point 6), so the second row must be Dubstep.

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Cat     | Italian | Egyptian |
| Adventure | Dubstep | Martial-Arts |
|   Argentine | Punk   | Rock    |

Lv6-4x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 8, we know that the person eating banana is on the far right. Let's place banana in the rightmost column (column 3).

2. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an even position. Since banana is in the rightmost column, ice-hockey must be in column 2. So, ice-hockey goes in the second row, second column.

3. From rule 3, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person eating zucchini. Since ice-hockey is in the second column, zucchini must be in the third column. So, zucchini goes in the first row, third column.

4. From rule 6, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the person eating nectarine. Since zucchini is in the third column, nectarine cannot be in the third column. So, nectarine goes in the first row, second column.

5. From rule 2, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is the person watching drama movies. So, drama goes in the first row, first column.

6. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies. Since horror is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the airplane yet.

7. From rule 4, we know that the person driving the skateboard is not the person watching horror movies. Since horror is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the skateboard yet.

8. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard is not yet placed, we can't determine the position of the airplane yet.

9. From the remaining rules, there are no more concrete positions that can be determined. So, let's place the remaining items (car and superhero) randomly in the empty positions. For example, we can place car in the first row, second row, and superhero in the second row, third column.

Final solution table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |
| Food          | zucchini   | nectarine  | banana    |

| Sport         | rowing     | parkour     | rowing    |
| Transport     | airplane   | car         | skateboard |

Please note that the positions of car and superhero are not definitively determined and can be different based on the specific interpretation of the rules."
