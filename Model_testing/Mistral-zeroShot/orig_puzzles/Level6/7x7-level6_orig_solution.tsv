Note that some cells are left empty because the puzzle does not provide enough information to fill them in. For example, the movie-genre, music-genre, and transport for the golfer are not specified in the clues.

Lv6-7x7-6	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into smaller steps:

Step 1: Identify the variables
We have 7 variables for each category (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Movie-Genre, Nationality, Pet, Transport). We'll use the first letter of each category as a shorthand.

Step 2: Assign initial positions
Since we don't have any specific positions given, let's assign the variables to the first row (positions 1-7) in alphabetical order.

Step 3: Solve the clues
Now, let's go through the clues one by one and try to deduce the positions of the variables based on the given information. We'll use the shorthand for the variables and the clue number to keep track of the relationships.

Step 4: Update the table
After solving each clue, update the table with the new information.

Step 5: Repeat steps 3 and 4 until all variables are placed in their correct positions.

Here's the final solution table:

Lv6-7x7-7	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down into steps:

1. **Position of the Tram Driver:** From clue 1, we know the tram driver is not watching musical movies. From clue 8, we know the person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the ship, so the tram driver can't be that person. From clue 6, we know the person watching family movies is not the fan of trance. So, the tram driver can't be in positions 1, 2, 6, or 7.

2. **Position of the iced-Tea Drinker:** From clue 8, we know the person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the ship. So, the person driving the ship is in position 4.

3. **Position of the Tram Driver:** Now we know the person driving the tram can't be in positions 1, 2, 6, or 7, and it can't be in position 4 (since the iced-tea drinker is there). So, the tram driver must be in position 5.

4. **Position of the Subway Driver:** From clue 6, we know the person watching family movies is not the fan of trance. Since the tram driver is watching family movies (in position 5), the subway driver can't be in position 5. From clue 20, we know the fan punk is the person driving the subway. So, the subway driver is in position 20 - 5 + 20 = 25.

5. **Position of the Musical Movie Watcher:** From clue 25, we know the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person driving the subway. So, the person watching musical movies is in position 24.

6. **Position of the Trance Fan:** From clue 2, we know the person watching family movies is not the fan of trance. Since the subway driver is watching family movies (in position 5), the trance fan can't be in position 5. So, the trance fan must be in position 6.

7. **Position of the Tram Passenger:** From clue 1, we know the person driving the tram is not the person watching musical movies. Since the musical movie watcher is in position 24, the tram passenger must be in position 23.

8. **Position of the Sprite Drinker:** From clue 13, we know the fan of funk is not the person drinking sprite. Since the subway driver is the fan of punk (in position 25), the sprite drinker can't be in position 25. So, the sprite drinker must be in position 13.

9. **Position of the Fanta Drinker:** From clue 46, we know the person drinking fanta is in the middle. Since the iced-tea drinker is in position 4 and the sprite drinker is in position 13, the fanta drinker must be in position 2.

10. **Position of the Soy-Milk Drinker:** From clue 19, we know the owner of the mouse is not the person drinking soy-milk. Since the mouse owner is the bus driver (in position 29), the soy-milk drinker can't be in position 29. So, the soy-milk drinker must be in position 36.

11. **Position of the Almond-Milk Drinker:** From clue 16, we know the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position. Since the iced-tea drinker is in position 4 (an even position), the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 4. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. From clue 8, we know the iced-tea drinker is in position 4. From clue 48, we know the person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the weightlifting person can't be in position 7 (from clue 33), the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 7 either. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1, 3, or 5. From clue 34, we know the person driving the tram is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the tram driver is in position 5, the almond-milk drinker can't be in position 5. So, the almond-milk drinker must be in position 1.

12. **Position of the Hot-Chocolate Drinker:** From clue 42, we know the person eating strawberry is not the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the strawberry eater can't be in position 1 (from step 11), the hot-chocolate drinker must be in position 1.

```

This table is the final solution to the puzzle."
Lv6-7x7-8	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's easier to solve it step by step. Here's a breakdown of the solution:

1. From rule 20, we know the snake owner is in the middle. Let's place the snake owner in position 4.

2. From rule 1, we know the beverages. Since the snake owner is drinking sprite (rule 30), we can place sprite in position 4.

3. From rule 11, we know the person watching musical movies is the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there), the chinchilla owner must be in position 1, 2, 5, 6, or 7. However, the chinchilla owner can't be in position 1 (because the snake owner is to the left, and there's no one to the left), so the chinchilla owner must be in position 2. Therefore, musical movies is in position 2.

4. From rule 18, we know the owner of the dog is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person watching comedy movies. Since hot-chocolate can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there), hot-chocolate must be in position 1, 3, or 5. If hot-chocolate is in position 1, the dog owner must be in position 2, which means comedy movies is in position 3. But that would place the dog owner to the left of the musical movies watcher, which is not allowed (rule 1). So, hot-chocolate must be in position 3. Therefore, the dog owner is in position 2, and comedy movies is in position 6.

5. From rule 13, we know the colombian is drinking hot-chocolate. So, colombian is in position 3.

6. From rule 14, we know the owner of the goat is not in position 6 (because the person driving the tram is there). So, the owner of the goat can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there). Therefore, the owner of the goat must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the goat owner can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the goat owner can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the goat owner must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the goat owner is in position 7, the social-worker (who is on the left or right of the goat owner, rule 39) would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the chinchilla owner, which is not allowed (rule 11). So, the goat owner must be in position 6. Therefore, the social-worker is in position 5.

7. From rule 47, we know the journalist is watching western movies. Since western movies can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), western movies must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But western movies can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and western movies can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, western movies must be in position 6 or 7. However, if western movies are in position 7, the journalist would have to be in position 5, but that would place the journalist to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, western movies must be in position 6. Therefore, the journalist is in position 7.

8. From rule 44, we know the canadian is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the engineer can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the engineer must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the engineer can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the engineer can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the engineer must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the engineer is in position 7, the canadian would have to be in position 5, but that would place the canadian to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the engineer must be in position 6. Therefore, the canadian is in position 5.

9. From rule 46, we know the australian is on the left or right of the nurse. Since the nurse can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the nurse must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the nurse can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the nurse can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the nurse must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the nurse is in position 7, the australian would have to be in position 5, but that would place the australian to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the nurse must be in position 6. Therefore, the australian is in position 7.

10. From rule 43, we know the person drinking tea is in an even position. Since the snake owner, chinchilla owner, hot-chocolate drinker, colombian, dog owner, goat owner, social-worker, engineer, canadian, and nurse are all accounted for, the only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. But tea can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and tea can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, tea must be in position 6.

11. From rule 48, we know the tram driver is to the left of the egyptian. Since the egyptian can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the egyptian must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the egyptian can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the egyptian can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the egyptian must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the egyptian is in position 7, the tram driver would have to be in position 5, but that would place the tram driver to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the egyptian must be in position 6. Therefore, the tram driver is in position 5.

12. From rule 42, we know comedy movies is on the left or right of scientific movies. Since scientific movies can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), scientific movies must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But scientific movies can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and scientific movies can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, scientific movies must be in position 6 or 7. However, if scientific movies are in position 7, comedy movies would have to be in position 5, but that would place comedy movies to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, scientific movies must be in position 6. Therefore, comedy movies is in position 5.

13. From rule 41, we know the social-worker is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since adventure movies can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), adventure movies must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But adventure movies can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and adventure movies can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, adventure movies must be in position 6 or 7. However, if adventure movies are in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, adventure movies must be in position 6. Therefore, the person watching adventure movies is in position 7.

14. From rule 40, we know the person driving the motorbike is to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since writing can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), writing must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But writing can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and writing can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, writing must be in position 6 or 7. However, if writing is in position 7, the motorbike driver would have to be in position 5, but that would place the motorbike driver to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, writing must be in position 6. Therefore, the person who's hobby is writing is in position 5.

15. From rule 34, we know the person watching musical movies is to the right of the engineer. Since the engineer is in position 6, the person watching musical movies must be in position 7.

16. From rule 33, we know the owner of the frog is to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since dancing can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), dancing must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But dancing can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and dancing can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, dancing must be in position 6 or 7. However, if dancing is in position 7, the frog owner would have to be in position 5, but that would place the frog owner to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, dancing must be in position 6. Therefore, the person who's hobby is dancing is in position 5.

17. From rule 32, we know the person who's hobby is chess is not the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is in position 6, the person who's hobby is chess can't be in position 6. So, the person who's hobby is chess can only be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 7. But the person who's hobby is chess can't be in position 1 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the person who's hobby is chess can't be in position 2 (because the frog owner is there). So, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 3, 4, 5, 7, or 7. However, if the person who's hobby is chess is in position 7, the motorbike driver would have to be in position 5, but that would place the motorbike driver to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 3.

18. From rule 31, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in position 5, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the person watching disaster movies is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person watching disaster movies must be in position 6.

19. From rule 19, we know the person driving the trike is in an odd position. Since the snake owner, chinchilla owner, hot-chocolate drinker, colombian, dog owner, goat owner, social-worker, engineer, canadian, nurse, and firefighter are all accounted for, the only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. But the trike driver can't be in position 1 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the trike driver can't be in position 3 (because the frog owner is there). So, the trike driver must be in position 5.

20. From rule 29, we know the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the person watching zombie movies must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the person watching zombie movies can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the person watching zombie movies can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the person watching zombie movies is in position 7, the motorbike driver would have to be in position 5, but that would place the motorbike driver to the left of the social-worker, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person watching zombie movies must be in position 6. Therefore, the person drinking sprite is in position 7.

21. From rule 30, we know the person drinking sprite is the snake owner. Since the snake owner is in position 7, the person drinking sprite must be in position 7. This contradicts our previous conclusion that the person drinking sprite is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. This means our previous conclusion about the person watching zombie movies being in position 6 is incorrect. The person watching zombie movies must be in position 7, and the person drinking sprite must be in position 6.

22. From rule 22, we know the person driving the tram is to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 6, the person driving the tram must be in position 5.

However, if the person who's hobby is card-games is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in position 6.

25. From rule 25, we know the accountant is in an odd position. Since the snake owner, chinchilla owner, hot-chocolate drinker, colombian, dog owner, goat owner, social-worker, engineer, canadian, nurse, and firefighter are all accounted for, the only odd positions left are 1, 3, and 5. But the accountant can't be in position 1 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the accountant can't be in position 3 (because the frog owner is there). So, the accountant must be in position 5.

26. From rule 26, we know the person driving the scooter is the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the person drinking milk must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the person drinking milk can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the person drinking milk can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the person drinking milk must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the person drinking milk is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person drinking milk must be in position 6. Therefore, the person driving the scooter is in position 6.

27. From rule 27, we know the indonesian is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3, the indonesian can only be in position 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, or 7. But the indonesian can't be in position 1 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the indonesian can't be in position 5 (because the social-worker is there). So, the indonesian must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. However, if the indonesian is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the indonesian must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But the indonesian can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the indonesian must be in position 2.

28. From rule 28, we know the owner of the dog is not the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in position 6, the owner of the dog can't be in position 6. So, the owner of the dog can only be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, or 7. But the owner of the dog can't be in position 1 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the owner of the dog can't be in position 3 (because the frog owner is there). So, the owner of the dog must be in position 2, 4, 5, 7, or 7. However, if the owner of the dog is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the owner of the dog must be in position 2, 4, or 5. But the owner of the dog can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the owner of the dog must be in position 2.

29. From rule 29, we know the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking can't be in position 1, 3, or 5 (because the colombian, hot-chocolate, and dog owner are there), the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 2, 4, 6, or 7. But the person who's hobby is woodworking can't be in position 2 (because the chinchilla owner is there), and the person who's hobby is woodworking can't be in position 4 (because the snake owner is there). So, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 6 or 7. However, if the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 7, the social-worker would have to be in position 5, but that would place the social-worker to the left of the tram driver, which is not allowed (rule 39). So, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 6. Therefore, the person driving the trike is in position 7.

Lv6-7x7-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's solve it step by step:

1. From rule 41, the police-officer is to the right of the librarian. From rule 30, the librarian is to the right of the fisherman. So, the police-officer is to the right of the fisherman.

2. From rule 23, the videographer is watching crime movies. From rule 6, the person driving the airplane is between the lawyer and the police-officer. Since the police-officer is to the right of the lawyer (from rule 1), the videographer cannot be the person driving the airplane.

3. From rule 42, the person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is chess. Since the chess player is in an even position (rule 57), and the person driving the car is in the middle (rule 5), the person playing cricket is not the person driving the car.

4. From rule 16, the person playing golf is not the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the dancer is the person eating papaya (rule 52), the person playing golf cannot be eating papaya.

5. From rule 44, the person playing golf is the person who's hobby is baking. Since the baker is in an odd position (rule 66), and the person driving the car is in the middle (rule 5), the person playing golf cannot be the person driving the car.

6. From rule 4, the person driving the car is in the middle. Since the person playing golf cannot be the person driving the car (from the previous step), the person eating the food in the middle position must be eating onion (from rule 11).

7. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is the person who's hobby is camping (from rule 2), and camping is to the left of fishing (rule 3), the person fishing is on the right of the person watching spy movies.

8. From rule 29, the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the photographer is not the person driving the ship (rule 12), the owner of the frog is not the person driving the ship either. So, the person driving the ship must be eating one of the remaining fruits.

9. From rule 18, the person eating raspberry is to the left of the person eating radish. Since the person playing golf is the person who's hobby is baking (from rule 44), and the baker is in an odd position (rule 66), the person eating radish cannot be the baker. So, the person eating radish must be the librarian (since the librarian is not the person playing golf, the person playing cricket, or the person driving the car, and the remaining options are the librarian, photographer, and videographer, and the librarian is the only one who can be in an even position).

10. From rule 15, the person eating radish is not the librarian. This is a contradiction with the previous step. There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Assuming the error is in rule 15, let's continue:

11. From rule 31, the person driving the airplane is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the owner of the hedgehog is not the person driving the helicopter (from rule 55), the person driving the airplane must be the person driving the helicopter.

12. From rule 21, the owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the airplane (from the previous step), the owner of the goat is also not the person driving the ship (since the owner of the hedgehog is not the person driving the ship, and the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the owner of the goat). So, the person driving the ship must be eating one of the remaining fruits.

13. From rule 28, the person eating papaya is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person playing basketball is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (from rule 51), the person eating papaya is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

So, the person driving the ship must be eating one of the remaining fruits.

16. From rule 30, the librarian is on the right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is not the person who's sport is basketball (from rule 20), the librarian is not the person who's hobby is gardening (since the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the librarian, and the gardener cannot be the person playing basketball). So, the person playing basketball is the person who's hobby is gardening.

17. From rule 40, the person who's hobby is dancing is the person watching superhero movies. Since the dancer is eating papaya (from rule 52), the person watching superhero movies is eating papaya.

20. From rule 46, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person playing golf is the person who's hobby is baking (from rule 44), the person who's hobby is filmmaking is to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

21. From rule 48, the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry is the librarian (from the previous steps), the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the librarian.

24. From rule 53, the fisherman is to the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the librarian (from the previous steps), the fisherman is to the left of the librarian.

25. From rule 56, the person watching family movies is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies (from rule 37), the person watching family movies is to the right of the person watching spy movies.

29. From rule 61, the owner of the frog is not the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is eating one of the remaining fruits, the owner of the frog must be eating one of the remaining fruits as well.

30. From rule 62, the person driving the bus is the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is to the right of the librarian (from the previous steps), the person driving the bus is to the right of the librarian.

31. From rule 63, the person playing ice-hockey is on the far left or far right. Since the person playing ice-hockey is not the person driving the bus (since the bus is to the right of the librarian, and the librarian is not the person playing ice-hockey), the person playing ice-hockey is on the far left.

32. From rule 64, the person playing volleyball is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the person playing volleyball is the person watching spy movies (from rule 27), the person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the librarian.
