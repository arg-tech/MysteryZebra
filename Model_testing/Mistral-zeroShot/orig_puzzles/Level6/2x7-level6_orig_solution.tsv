2. The German cannot be in position 1 (as the American is to the left of the German). So, the German is in position 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7.

3. The Polish cannot be in position 1 (as the cat is in an odd position and position 1 is even). So, the Polish is in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 (not position 7 as the Polish is to the right of the cat).

4. The rat owner must be in an odd position (4, 5, or 7). The rat cannot be in position 7 (as the Australian is to the right of the American and the American is in position 2). So, the rat is in position 4 or 5.

5. If the rat is in position 4, the Australian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3 (as the Australian is to the right of the American and the American is in position 2). So, the Australian is in position 5 or 6. If the rat is in position 5, the Australian must be in position 6.

22. The cat is in position 1, 3, or 5. The American is in position 2, so the cat is not in position 1. The German is in position 3, so the cat is not in position 3. The cat is in position 5.

23. The Polish is to the right of the cat, so the Polish is in position 6.

24. The goat is to the left of the mouse, so the goat is in position 4.

25. The rat is in position 4 or 5. If the rat is in position 4, the Australian is in position 6. If the rat is in position 5, the Australian is in position 5.

26. The dog is to the left of the German, so the dog is in position 2.

27. The ferret is to the left of the Mexican, so the ferret is in position 2.

Lv6-2x7-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 7 music genres and 7 nationalities, so each row and each column will have one unique element.

2. From rule 12, we know that the fan classical is on the far right. Let's place it in the last column (7).

3. From rule 19, we know that the fan d&b is on the right of the fan trance. Since the fan classical is on the far right, the fan d&b must be in column 6.

4. From rule 18, we know that the fan house is somewhere to the left of the fan d&b. So, the fan house must be in column 5. From rule 14, we also know that the fan house is the Malaysian.

5. From rule 15, we know that the Japanese is on the left of the fan house. So, the Japanese must be in column 6.

6. From rule 7, we know that the Australian is on the left of the Japanese. So, the Australian must be in column 5.

7. From rule 6, we know that the French is on the left of the Japanese. So, the French must be in column 4.

8. From rule 17, we know that the French is on the right of the fan house (Malaysian). So, the fan house (Malaysian) must be in row 4.

9. From rule 11, we know that the fan hip-hop is not the French. Since the French is in row 4, the fan hip-hop cannot be in row 4.

10. From rule 10, we know that the Japanese is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the Japanese is in row 6, the fan hip-hop must be in row 5.

11. From rule 13, we know that the fan hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in row 6, the fan hip-hop must be in row 5.

12. From rule 16, we know that the fan pop is somewhere to the right of the Canadian. Since the fan house (Malaysian) is in row 4, the Canadian must be in row 3. So, the fan pop must be in row 4.

13. From rule 9, we know that the fan pop is somewhere to the right of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in row 6, the fan pop must be in row 4 or 5. But we already placed the fan pop in row 4, so it must be in row 5.

14. From rule 3, we know that the fan soul is somewhere to the right of the fan pop. Since the fan pop is in row 5, the fan soul must be in row 6.

15. From rule 20, we know that the fan soul is on the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is in row 5, the fan soul must be in row 6.

16. From rule 1, we know that there are 7 different music genres. We have placed 6 genres (classical, d&b, house, pop, hip-hop, soul, trance), so the remaining genre (trance) must be in row 1.

17. From rule 11, we know that the fan hip-hop is not the French. Since the French is in row 4, the nationality in row 1 must be different from French.

18. From rule 13, we know that the fan hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in row 6, the fan hip-hop must be in row 1 or 2. But we already placed the fan hip-hop in row 1, so it must be in row 2.

19. From rule 16, we know that the Canadian is in row 3. Since the fan pop is in row 5, the nationality in row 3 must be different from Canadian.

20. From rule 1, we know that there are 7 different nationalities. We have placed 6 nationalities (Australian, Japanese, French, German, Malaysian, Thai), so the remaining nationality (Thai) must be in row 1.

Lv6-2x7-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the librarian is not the Egyptian and must be on the left or right of the Egyptian, the Egyptian cannot be in the first or last position. Let's assume the Egyptian is in position 3 (as placing it in position 7 would violate rule 15).

2. The architect is to the right of the Japanese, so the Japanese cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 6. Let's place the Japanese in position 4.

3. The scientist is not the Japanese or the Pole, so the scientist cannot be in positions 1, 4, or 7. Since the scientist is also not the far left or far right (rule 15), the scientist can only be in positions 2, 3, 5, or 6. However, placing the scientist in position 2 would violate rule 10, so the scientist must be in position 3, 5, or 6. Since the scientist is not the Pole (rule 4), the scientist cannot be in position 6. So, the scientist is in position 5.

4. The freelancer is in an odd position (rule 5), so the freelancer can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. However, placing the freelancer in position 1 would violate rule 14 (the journalist is on the left of the American, and the American is to the right of the Colombian, so the journalist must be in position 2, which would place the freelancer in position 1). So, the freelancer is in position 3 or 5. Since the freelancer is not the American (rule 14), the freelancer is in position 5.

5. The American is to the right of the Colombian (rule 11), so the Colombian cannot be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 6. Let's place the Colombian in position 3.

6. The chinese is on the far right (rule 12), so the chinese is in position 7.

7. The journalist is on the left of the Chinese (rule 13), so the journalist is in position 6.

8. The journalist is on the left or right of the American (rule 14), so the American can only be in positions 1, 2, or 4. However, placing the American in position 1 would violate rule 15 (the scientist is on the far left or far right), so the American is in position 2 or 4. Since the American is not the Canadian (rule 14), the American is in position 4.

9. The polish is on the left of the accountant (rule 7), so the accountant cannot be in positions 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7. Let's place the accountant in position 6.

10. The canadian is on the far left or far right (rule 6), so the Canadian can only be in positions 1 or 7. However, placing the Canadian in position 1 would violate rule 9 (the polish is on the left or right of the Canadian), so the Canadian is in position 7.

11. The freelancer is in position 5, the architect is to the right of the Japanese (in position 4), the scientist is in position 5, the American is in position 4, the Colombian is in position 3, the chinese is in position 7, the journalist is in position 6, the polish is on the left of the accountant (in position 6), and the Canadian is in position 7. The only job left is the accountant, which must be in position 1.

Lv6-2x7-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since all jobs and sports are unique, we can use the positions to represent both. For example, we can assign job 1 to dancer, job 2 to electrician, and so on. Similarly, we can assign sport 1 to cycling, sport 2 to handball, and so on.

2. Let's start with the positions of the electrician and the person who does handball, as they are in odd positions 4. Since the electrician is in an odd position, let's assign electrician to position 1 (odd) and handball to position 5 (odd).

3. Skateboarding is to the right of weightlifting. Since handball is at position 5, let's assign weightlifting to position 3 (odd) and skateboarding to position 6 (even).

4. The dancer is not the person who does handball, so the dancer cannot be at position 1 or 5. Let's assign dancer to position 2 (even).

5. Surfing is in the middle, so it must be at position 4.

6. The photographer is on the left or right of snowboarding. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, and surfing, the only available positions for snowboarding are 2, 3, or 6. If snowboarding is at position 2, the photographer can be at position 1 or 3. However, this would violate rule 14 (snowboarding between cycling and the entrepreneur), so snowboarding cannot be at position 2. If snowboarding is at position 3, the photographer can be at position 1 or 5. This satisfies rule 14 (snowboarding between cycling and the entrepreneur), so let's assign snowboarding to position 3 and the photographer to position 1.

7. The entrepreneur is on the far left or far right. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, and snowboarding, the only available positions for the entrepreneur are 1, 2, 5, 6, and 7. If the entrepreneur is at position 1, it would violate rule 11 (skateboarding to the left of the electrician), so the entrepreneur must be at position 7.

8. The entrepreneur is to the left of the person who does cycling. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, and the entrepreneur, the only available positions for cycling are 2, 4, and 6. If cycling is at position 2, it would violate rule 13 (cycling is not the teacher), so cycling cannot be at position 2. If cycling is at position 6, it would violate rule 11 (skateboarding to the left of the electrician), so cycling must be at position 4.

9. The person who does cycling is to the left of the software-developer. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, and cycling, the only available positions for the software-developer are 1, 3, 5, and 7. If the software-developer is at position 1, it would violate rule 6 (photographer on the left or right of snowboarding), so the software-developer cannot be at position 1. If the software-developer is at position 3, it would violate rule 14 (snowboarding between cycling and the entrepreneur), so the software-developer must be at position 5.

10. The person who does weightlifting is not the software-developer. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, cycling, and the software-developer, the only available position for weightlifting is 3.

11. The person who does skateboarding is to the left of the electrician. Since we have already placed handball, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, cycling, the software-developer, and weightlifting, the only available positions for the electrician are 1, 2, 4, and 5. If the electrician is at position 1, it would violate rule 3 (skateboarding to the right of weightlifting), so the electrician cannot be at position 1. If the electrician is at position 5, it would violate rule 11 (skateboarding to the left of the electrician), so the electrician must be at position 2.

12. The dancer is in an even position. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, cycling, the software-developer, weightlifting, and the electrician, the only available positions for the dancer are 2, 4, and 6. If the dancer is at position 6, it would violate rule 5 (surfing in the middle), so the dancer must be at position 4.

13. The person who does cycling is not the teacher. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, the electrician, the dancer, the software-developer, and weightlifting, the only available position for the teacher is 7.

14. The person who does tennis is on the left or right of the person who does snowboarding. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, cycling, the software-developer, weightlifting, the electrician, the dancer, and the teacher, the only available positions for tennis are 1, 3, 5, and 7. If tennis is at position 1, it would violate rule 6 (photographer on the left or right of snowboarding), so tennis cannot be at position 1. If tennis is at position 7, it would violate rule 15 (tennis on the left or right of snowboarding), so tennis must be at position 3.

15. The musician is to the right of the dancer. Since we have already placed handball, skateboarding, surfing, snowboarding, the entrepreneur, cycling, the software-developer, weightlifting, the electrician, the teacher, and tennis, the only available positions for the musician are 2, 4, and 6. If the musician is at position 2, it would violate rule 12 (dancer in an even position), so the musician cannot be at position 2. If the musician is at position 6, it would violate rule 16 (dancer to the left of the musician), so the musician must be at position 4.

Final solution:

Lv6-2x7-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person driving the boat is in the middle. Let's place the boat in the 4th position.

2. Since the person eating cucumber is on the far right (rule 11), it must be in the 7th position.

3. From rule 9, the person driving the boat is on the left of the person eating banana. So, banana must be to the left of the boat, which means it's either in the 1st or 3rd position. But since the person driving the airplane is not the person eating cauliflower (rule 13), the airplane can't be in the 1st position. So, banana is in the 3rd position and cauliflower is in the 5th position.

4. From rule 14, the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi can't be in the 7th position (as it's not the person eating cucumber), it must be in the 6th position. So, the motorbike is in the 2nd or 4th position. But from rule 18, the person eating pear is not the person driving the motorbike, so the motorbike can't be in the 4th position. So, the motorbike is in the 2nd position and the taxi is in the 6th position.

5. From rule 15, the person eating garlic is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the subway can't be in the 7th position (as it's not the person eating cucumber), it must be in the 1st position. So, garlic is in the 5th position.

6. From rule 16, the person driving the taxi is on the far left or far right. Since the taxi is already placed in the 6th position, it's on the far right.

7. From rule 17, the person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the nectarine is eating to the left of the pear (rule 19), and the pear is to the left of the cauliflower (rule 2), and the cauliflower is to the left of the garlic (rule 5), the nectarine must be in the 2nd position, spinach in the 3rd position, and pear in the 5th position.

8. From rule 12, the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. So, the subway is in the 1st position.

9. From rule 8, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is in the 2nd position, the snowmobile is in the 4th position.

10. From rule 1, the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the person eating garlic. Since garlic is in the 5th position, the snowmobile is to the right of the 5th position, which means it's in the 6th position.

11. From rule 3, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat is in the 4th position, the skateboard is to the left of the 4th position, which means it's in the 3rd position.

12. From rule 6, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the nectarine is in the 2nd position, the skateboard is to the right of the 2nd position, which means it's in the 4th or 5th position. But from rule 19, the person eating pear is between the person eating nectarine and the person driving the skateboard. So, the skateboard can't be in the 4th position. So, the skateboard is in the 5th position.

13. From rule 18, the person eating pear is not the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is in the 2nd position, the pear can't be in the 2nd position. So, the pear is in the 5th position.

14. From rule 19, the person eating pear is between the person eating nectarine and the person driving the skateboard. Since the nectarine is in the 2nd position and the skateboard is in the 5th position, the pear must be in the 3rd position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x7-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the software-developer is in an odd position and does hobby drawing, they must be in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. However, since the software-developer is not the person who's hobby is sudoku (position 6), they cannot be in position 6. So, the software-developer is either 1, 3, or 7.

2. The accountant is in an odd position. Since the software-developer is already in an odd position, the accountant must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But the accountant cannot be in position 1 because the software-developer is there, so the accountant is either 3 or 5.

3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the accountant and software-developer are already placed, the only possible hobbies for them are collecting, cooking, fishing, or traveling. If the accountant is cooking, then the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the software-developer is not in position 6, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 2 or 4. If the accountant is not cooking, then the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But since the software-developer is not in position 6, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 2 or 4. So, the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 2 or 4, and the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2 or 4 as well.

4. Now, we know the accountant is in position 3 or 5, the person who's hobby is cooking and fishing are in positions 2 and 4, and the software-developer is in position 1, 3, or 7. We also know that the person who's hobby is drawing is to the left of the photographer, and the photographer is to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, the hobbies of the people in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 must be drawing, filmmaking, collecting, or traveling. Since the software-developer is not the person who's hobby is collecting, the hobby of the person in position 1, 3, or 7 cannot be collecting. Also, since the librarian is not the person who's hobby is drawing, the hobby of the person in position 1, 3, or 5 cannot be drawing. So, the hobbies of the people in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 must be filmmaking, collecting, traveling, or fishing.

5. The pilot is in the middle, so the pilot is in position 4. Since the pilot is not the person who's hobby is sudoku, the hobby of the person in position 4 cannot be sudoku. So, the hobbies of the people in positions 1, 3, 5, and 7 must be filmmaking, collecting, traveling, and fishing.

6. The firefighter is on the right of the pilot, so the firefighter is in position 5 or 7. Since the firefighter is not on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the accountant is in position 3, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1 or 5. So, the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 1, and the hobby of the person in position 5 must be traveling, filmmaking, or fishing.

7. The project-manager is somewhere to the left of the pilot, so the project-manager is in position 1, 2, or 3. But since the accountant is in position 3, the project-manager cannot be in position 3. So, the project-manager is either 1 or 2. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing, and the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 1 or 3. But since the software-developer is in position 1, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 3. So, the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 3, and the hobby of the person in position 1 must be filmmaking, collecting, or traveling.

8. The person who's hobby is drawing is to the left of the photographer, and the photographer is to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. So, the hobbies of the people in positions 1, 3, and 5 must be drawing, photographer, and filmmaking. But since the software-developer is in position 1 and does hobby drawing, the hobby of the person in position 3 must be photographer, and the hobby of the person in position 5 must be filmmaking.

9. The librarian is not the person who's hobby is drawing, so the librarian is not in position 1, 3, or 5. The librarian is also not the person who's hobby is cooking, so the librarian is not in position 2 or 4. The only remaining positions for the librarian are 6 or 7. But since the librarian is not on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking (position 2), the librarian must be in position 7.

10. The person who's hobby is sudoku is in an even position. The only even positions left are 2, 4, and 6. But since the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 2, and the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 4, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 6.

11. The photographer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the photographer is in position 5, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 3 or 7. But since the librarian is in position 7, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in position 3.

12. The person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1, 3, 5, or 7. But since the software-developer is in position 1, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 3, 5, or 7. But since the accountant is in position 3, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 5 or 7. But since the firefighter is in position 5, the person who's hobby is traveling must be in position 7.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x7-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 10, the person driving the van is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the owner of the hedgehog can't be the driver of the train (rule 15), the owner of the hedgehog must be on the right of the van driver (let's assume the van driver is on the right).

2. From rule 11, the owner of the goat is the person driving the van, so the goat is on the right.

3. From rule 7, the owner of the goat is to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the goat is on the right, the mouse must be on the left.

4. From rule 9, the owner of the mouse is not the person driving the motorbike, so the motorbike is on the left of the mouse.

5. From rule 4, the owner of the mouse is not the person driving the quad-bike, so the quad-bike is to the right of the mouse.

6. From rule 3, the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the owner of the goat (which is the van driver), so the quad-bike is on the left.

7. From rule 13, the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike, so the helicopter is on the right.

8. From rule 12, the person driving the helicopter is to the left of the person driving the van, but we already placed the helicopter on the right and the van on the right. This is a contradiction, so let's assume the van driver is on the left instead. This means the goat is on the left, and the mouse is on the right.

9. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog, but we already placed the motorbike on the left and the hedgehog is on the right. This is a contradiction, so let's assume the motorbike is on the right instead. This means the mouse is on the left, and the goat is on the right.

10. From rule 7, the owner of the goat is to the right of the owner of the mouse, which is correct.

11. From rule 9, the owner of the mouse is not the person driving the quad-bike, so the quad-bike is to the left of the mouse, which is correct.

12. From rule 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter has not been placed yet, it must be on the right of the guinea-pig's owner (let's assume the guinea-pig's owner is on the left).

13. From rule 2, the owner of the frog is to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig, so the frog is on the right.

14. From rule 8, the person driving the train is the owner of the guinea-pig, so the train is on the left.

15. From rule 6, the owner of the hamster is not the person driving the helicopter, so the hamster is not on the right. Since the hamster has not been placed yet, it must be on the left of the helicopter (let's assume the helicopter is on the right).

16. From rule 14, the owner of the mouse is on the right of the person driving the helicopter, so the mouse is on the right.

17. From rule 16, the person driving the van is on the left, which is correct.

18. From rule 11, the owner of the goat is the person driving the van, so the goat is on the left, which is correct.

19. From rule 4, the owner of the mouse is not the person driving the quad-bike, so the quad-bike is on the left, which is correct.

20. From rule 5, the owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person driving the scooter, so the scooter is on the right, which is correct.

21. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog, but we already placed the motorbike on the right and the hedgehog is on the right. This is a contradiction, so let's assume the motorbike is on the left instead. This means the mouse is on the left, and the goat is on the right.

22. From rule 7, the owner of the goat is to the right of the owner of the mouse, which is incorrect. However, since we already placed the goat on the right and the mouse on the left, the only way to satisfy rule 7 is to swap the positions of the goat and the scooter. So, the goat is on the right and the scooter is on the left.

23. From rule 1, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the motorbike is on the left and the hedgehog is on the right, the motorbike is on the left of the hedgehog, which is correct.

24. From rule 16, the person driving the van is on the left or right, but we already placed the van on the left. This is correct.

25. From rule 15, the owner of the hedgehog is not the person driving the train, so the hedgehog is not on the left, which means the hedgehog is on the right, which is correct.

So, the final solution table is:

|             |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |    6     |  7   |

Lv6-2x7-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Place the Mystery movie-genre on the far left (column 1). This leaves 6 genres for the remaining columns.

2. Since the Zombie movie-genre is to the left or right of the Mirinda drinker, and the Mystery genre is on the far left, Mirinda can't be in the first column. So, let's place Mirinda in the second column. This leaves 5 beverages for the remaining columns.

3. The Martial-Arts movie-genre is to the left or right of the Zombie movie-genre. Since Mirinda is in the second column, Martial-Arts can't be in the first or second column. Let's place Martial-Arts in the third column. This leaves 4 beverages for the remaining columns.

4. The Scientific movie-genre is to the left or right of the Mirinda drinker. Since Mirinda is in the second column, Scientific can't be in the first or second column. It also can't be in the third column because Martial-Arts is there. Let's place Scientific in the fourth column. This leaves 3 beverages for the remaining columns.

5. The Animation movie-genre can be on the far left or far right. Since we have placed 4 genres already, Animation can't be on the far left. So, let's place Animation in the seventh column. This leaves 2 beverages for the remaining columns.

6. The Family movie-genre is to the right of the Fanta drinker. Since we have placed 5 genres already, Family can't be in the seventh column because Animation is there. So, let's place Family in the sixth column. This leaves 1 beverage for the remaining column.

7. The remaining beverage, Water, is to the right of the Hot-Chocolate drinker and to the right of the Disaster movie-watcher. Since we have placed 6 genres already, Water can't be in the first or second column because Mirinda and Mystery are there. It also can't be in the third column because Martial-Arts is there. It can't be in the fourth column because Scientific is there. It can't be in the sixth column because Family is there. So, let's place Water in the fifth column.

8. The remaining beverage, Tea, can't be the Disaster movie-watcher because it's not allowed. Since we have placed 7 genres already, Tea can't be in the first or second column because Mirinda and Mystery are there. It also can't be in the third column because Martial-Arts is there. It can't be in the fourth column because Scientific is there. It can't be in the sixth column because Family is there. It can't be in the seventh column because Animation is there. So, let's place Tea in the fifth column.

9. The remaining beverage, Iced-Tea, can be on the left or right of the Animation movie-watcher. Since we have placed 7 beverages already, Iced-Tea can't be in the first or second column because Mirinda and Mystery are there. It also can't be in the third column because Martial-Arts is there. It can't be in the fourth column because Scientific is there. It can't be in the sixth column because Family is there. It can't be in the fifth column because Tea is there. So, let's place Iced-Tea in the seventh column.

10. The remaining beverage, Milk, is to the right of the Zombie movie-watcher. Since we have placed 7 beverages already, Milk can't be in the first or second column because Mirinda and Mystery are there. It also can't be in the third column because Martial-Arts is there. It can't be in the fourth column because Scientific is there. It can't be in the sixth column because Family is there. It can't be in the fifth column because Tea is there. It can't be in the seventh column because Iced-Tea is there. So, let's place Milk in the fifth column.

Here is the final solution table:

|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |   4    |      5       |    6     |     7     |

2. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter can't be in the middle (rule 15), the motorbike must be on the same side as the helicopter. Let's say the helicopter is on the right, so the motorbike is on the left.

3. From rule 12, we know that the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the motorbike is on the left, the helicopter must be on the right.

4. From rule 11, we know that the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the helicopter is on the right, the train can't be on the right. So, the train is on the left.

8. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right, the person who's hobby is dancing is second from the right.

9. From rule 14, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right, the person who's hobby is cooking must be on the far left.

12. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person driving the tram is on the far left, the person driving the subway must be second from the left.

13. From rule 6, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right, the person who's hobby is dancing is third from the right.

14. From rule 2, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person who's hobby is writing is second from the left, the helicopter must be on the left.

15. From rule 8, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is second from the left, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be on the right.

16. From rule 1, we know that the hobbies are different. Since we have assigned all hobbies, the remaining hobby must be collecting. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left, the person who's hobby is collecting must be on the far right.

1. Since the weightlifting person is in the middle, we can fill the 4th row with 'weightlifting'.

2. The Japanese is to the left of the Brazilian, so we can place the Japanese in the 1st or 2nd row. Let's place them in the 1st row with 'Japanese' and 'Sport1'.

3. Since the Japanese is on the left or right of the weightlifting person, Sport1 cannot be weightlifting. Let's place 'Sport1' in the 2nd row, and 'Sport2' in the 3rd row.

4. The Brazilian is not the weightlifting person, so the Brazilian cannot be in the 4th row. Let's place the Brazilian in the 5th row with 'Brazilian' and 'Sport5'.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far right, so 'Sport6' must be snowboarding in the 7th row.

8. The person who's sport is golf is to the left of the person who's sport is basketball, so 'Sport2' must be basketball in the 3rd row.

9. The person who's sport is basketball is in an even position, so 'Sport1' must be another sport in the 1st row.
