Lv6-3x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the manager is in an odd position and there are 4 jobs, the manager must be in position 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the manager is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The person who plays cricket is in position 4 (from condition 6). Let's assume the sport in position 2 is ice-hockey (we'll check other possibilities later).

3. The nurse is to the left or right of the person who plays cricket (condition 2). Since the manager is in position 1 and the nurse can't be in position 4 (because the sport in position 4 is cricket), the nurse must be in position 2 or 3. If the nurse is in position 2, then the sport in position 3 must be soccer (from condition 10). But this would mean the manager is in position 3, which contradicts our initial assumption. So, the nurse must be in position 3.

4. The Spanish is to the right of the doctor (condition 3). Since the manager is in position 1 and the nurse is in position 3, the doctor must be in position 2. This means the Spanish is in position 4.

5. The person who plays soccer is to the left or right of the person who plays cricket (condition 10). Since the person who plays cricket is in position 4, the person who plays soccer can't be in position 1 or 3 (because the nurse and the Spanish are already there). So, the person who plays soccer must be in position 2 or 5. If the person who plays soccer is in position 2, then the sport in position 5 must be ice-hockey (from condition 11). But this would mean the analyst is in position 5, which contradicts condition 7. So, the person who plays soccer is in position 5.

6. Now, let's check our initial assumption about the manager being in position 1. If the manager is in position 1, then the doctor must be in position 3 (from condition 8). But this would mean the Spanish is in position 4 and the person who plays soccer is in position 5, which contradicts condition 5 (since the person who plays soccer is to the right of the Spanish). So, the manager must be in position 3.

7. The analyst must be in position 2 (from condition 7).

8. The remaining sport, skateboarding, must be in position 1 (since all other positions are filled).

Here is the final solution table:

```

|           | Cricket | Ice-Hockey | Skateboarding | Soccer |

This table satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv6-3x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the baseball player is on the left or right of the soccer player. Let's assume the baseball player is on the left (1st position). This means the soccer player must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

2. The fan of classical music is in an even position. Since the baseball player is in the 1st position (odd), the classical fan cannot be in the 1st position. So, the classical fan must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Let's assume the classical fan is in the 2nd position.

3. The scientist is somewhere to the left of the golfer. Since the baseball player is in the 1st position and the classical fan is in the 2nd position, the scientist cannot be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, the scientist must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Let's assume the scientist is in the 3rd position.

4. The writer is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since the classical fan is in the 2nd position and the scientist is in the 3rd position, the writer cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position. So, the writer must be in the 4th position.

5. The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. Since the classical fan is in the 2nd position, the fan of funk must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Let's assume the fan of funk is in the 3rd position.

6. The person who plays handball is in an even position. Since the baseball player is in the 1st position (odd), the handball player cannot be in the 1st position. So, the handball player must be in the 2nd, 4th, or 6th position (since the 5th position is odd due to the scientist). Let's assume the handball player is in the 4th position.

7. The scientist is in an odd position. Since we already placed the scientist in the 3rd position, this condition is satisfied.

8. The writer is between the engineer and the fan of electronic music. Since the writer is in the 4th position and the scientist is in the 3rd position, the engineer must be in the 1st position and the fan of electronic music must be in the 2nd position.

9. The person who plays soccer is between the person who plays baseball and the engineer. Since the baseball player is in the 1st position and the engineer is in the 1st or 3rd position (due to the scientist being in the 3rd position), the soccer player must be in the 2nd position.

10. The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. Since the classical fan is in the 2nd position and the fan of funk is in the 3rd position, this condition is satisfied.

11. The person who plays handball is in an even position. Since the handball player is in the 4th position, this condition is satisfied.

Final solution:

Lv6-3x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From the first two clues, we know that the person who fishes is between the person watching thriller movies and the person watching either satire or sports movies. Let's call the positions as follows:
   - Fishing: Position 3
   - Thriller: Position 2 or 4
   - Satire: Position 1 or 4
   - Sports: Position 1 or 2

2. From clue 3, we know that the person watching satire movies is not the person who's hobby is baking. Since baking is one of the hobbies, the person watching satire movies cannot be in position 3 (as it's the only position left for baking). So, the person watching satire movies is in position 1, and the person watching thriller movies is in position 2.

3. From clue 4, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies, so the person watching sports movies is in position 4.

4. From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we know that the person watching sports movies (who's sport is skiing) is in position 4, the person who's hobby is cooking must be in position 2.

5. From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is the person who's hobby is baking. So, the person who's hobby is baking is in position 3.

6. From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person watching superhero movies. Since we know that the person watching sports movies (who's sport is soccer) is in position 4, the person who's sport is baseball must be in position 1, and the person watching superhero movies must be in position 2.

7. Now we know all the hobbies and movie-genres, so we can fill in the sports:
   - Position 1: Baking (hobby), Baseball (sport)
   - Position 2: Superhero (movie-genre), Thriller (movie-genre)
   - Position 3: Fishing (hobby), Baking (hobby)
   - Position 4: Cooking (hobby), Soccer (sport)

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-3x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the bike is on the far left or far right, let's place the bike driver in the first or last position. We'll place the bike driver in the first position for now.

2. The social worker can't be eating watermelon, so the social worker can't be in the second position (since the watermelon eater is between the fisherman and the van driver). So, the social worker can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

3. The social worker is on the right of the bike driver, so the social worker can't be in the first position. So, the social worker can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

4. The watermelon eater is between the fisherman and the van driver. Since the bike driver is in the first position, the fisherman can't be in the first position either. So, the fisherman can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

5. The project manager is to the left of the dressmaker. Since the bike driver is in the first position, the dressmaker can't be in the first position either. So, the dressmaker can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

6. The garlic eater is on the far right. Since the bike driver is in the first position and the social worker, fisherman, and dressmaker can't be in the first position, the garlic eater can only be in the last position.

7. The garlic eater is in an even position. Since the bike driver is in the first position and the social worker, fisherman, dressmaker, and van driver haven't been placed yet, this condition doesn't help us place any of the remaining people.

8. The person driving the subway is to the right of the person driving the bus. Since the bike driver is in the first position and the social worker, fisherman, dressmaker, garlic eater, and watermelon eater have been placed, the bus driver must be in the first position. So, the subway driver can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

9. The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the bike driver, social worker, fisherman, garlic eater, watermelon eater, and bus driver have been placed, the cauliflower eater can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

10. The person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the bike driver, social worker, fisherman, garlic eater, and cauliflower eater have been placed, the pomegranate eater can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

11. The person eating garlic is on the right of the person eating watermelon. Since the garlic eater is in the last position and the watermelon eater is between the fisherman and the van driver, the watermelon eater must be in the third position.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

- The van driver can't be in the first position because the watermelon eater is in the third position. So, the van driver can only be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since the subway driver can't be in the fifth position (because the garlic eater is in the fifth position), the van driver must be in the fifth position.

- The subway driver can't be in the first position because the bus driver is in the first position. So, the subway driver can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Since the van driver is in the fifth position, the subway driver must be in the fourth position.

- The dressmaker can't be in the first position because the bus driver is in the first position. Since the subway driver is in the fourth position, the dressmaker can't be in the fourth position either. So, the dressmaker can only be in positions 2 or 3. Since the garlic eater is in the fifth position and the van driver is in the fifth position, the dressmaker can't be in the fifth position. So, the dressmaker must be in the third position.

- The social worker can't be in the first position because the bus driver is in the first position. Since the dressmaker is in the third position, the social worker can't be in the third position either. So, the social worker can only be in the second position.

- The fisherman can't be in the first position because the bus driver is in the first position. Since the social worker is in the second position, the fisherman can't be in the second position either. So, the fisherman can only be in the fifth position.

So, the final solution table is:

1. We can start by placing the nationalities. Since the Russian is not the Turkish, we can place the Turkish in the first position (1). The Russian must be between the person eating mango and the Pakistani, so the Pakistani goes in position 3 and the Russian in position 2. The American is to the left of the person watching superhero movies, so the American goes in position 4.

2. Now, the airplane driver cannot be in the first position because the airplane driver is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the scooter driver is in the first position. So, the airplane driver must be in the second, third, or fourth position. Let's assume the airplane driver is in the second position (2).

3. Now, the person who's sport is climbing must be in the third position (3) because it's to the left of the person drinking milk (5) and to the right of the airplane driver (2).

4. The person driving the subway cannot be in the fourth position because the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (5), and the fourth position is the only remaining position. So, the subway driver must be in the third position (3). This means the person driving the snowmobile must be in the fourth position (4).

5. The person drinking milk must be in the second position (2) because it's to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (4) and not the person who's sport is rugby (6).

6. The person who's sport is rugby cannot be in the first position because the person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (5), and the first position is the only remaining position. So, the person who's sport is rugby must be in the third position (3).

7. The person drinking sprite cannot be in the second position because the person who's sport is climbing is to the left of the person drinking milk (5), and the second position is the only remaining position for the person drinking milk. So, the person drinking sprite must be in the first position (1).

8. The person drinking 7up must be in the fourth position (4) because it's to the left of the person drinking mirinda (11).

9. The person who's sport is basketball must be in the first position (1) because it's to the left of the person driving the subway (5).

10. The person who's sport is surfing must be in the third position (3) because it's to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (4).

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage    | 1    |     2      |     3      |   4    |
| Sport       |     basketball     | climbing | rugby | surfing |
| Transport   |     scooter     | airplane | subway | snowmobile |

#############
| Beverage    | scooter | airplane | milk | snowmobile |
| Sport       | basketball | climbing | rugby | surfing |
| Transport   |     |            |        |        |
#############

Since we don't have enough information about the fourth transport, the table is incomplete."
Lv6-3x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5), let's assume they are in position 3 for now.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig can't be in position 3 (as it's occupied by almond-milk), let's place the guinea-pig in position 1.

3. The owner of the frog is not the person eating raspberry. Since raspberry can't be in position 1 (as it's occupied by the guinea-pig), let's place raspberry in position 5.

4. The owner of the frog is between the owner of the pony and the owner of the guinea-pig. This means the frog can't be in position 1 (as the guinea-pig is already there), and the frog can't be in position 5 (as raspberry is there). So, the frog must be in position 2.

5. The owner of the pony is to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the guinea-pig is in position 1 and the frog is in position 2, the pony can't be in position 3 (as juice must be to its right). So, the pony must be in position 4.

6. The person drinking juice is on the right of the owner of the pony. So, juice must be in position 4.

7. The person eating avocado is somewhere to the right of the person eating apple. Since apple can't be in position 5 (as raspberry is there), apple must be in position 1. So, avocado must be in position 2, 3, or 4. But since the pony is in position 4 and the guinea-pig is in position 1, avocado can't be in position 4. So, avocado must be in position 2.

8. The person eating radish is on the left of the person eating turtle. Since raspberry is in position 5, turtle can't be in position 5. So, turtle must be in position 4. This means radish must be in position 3.

9. The person eating raspberry is on the far left. But we already placed raspberry in position 5. This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we ignore the last condition (9), the solution would be:

  |            |      1      |       2       |   3   |     4      |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | soy-milk    | juice | radish     |
| Food       | apple       | avocado     |       | raspberry   |
| Pet        |            | guinea-pig  |       | turtle      |

But since condition 9 is a contradiction, the puzzle has an error and cannot be solved as it stands."
Lv6-3x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the social worker eats lime (S3), and the cat owner is to the left of the lime eater (1.1). So, the cat owner can't be the social worker. Let's assume the cat owner is in position 1.

2. The hedgehog owner is between the cat owner and the social worker (2). Since the cat owner is in position 1, the hedgehog owner must be in position 2 or 3. If the hedgehog owner was in position 2, the social worker would have to be in position 4, but that would mean the cat owner is not to the left of the lime eater, which contradicts our first assumption. So, the hedgehog owner is in position 3.

3. The owner of the goldfish is to the left of the social worker (11). Since the social worker is in position 3, the goldfish owner must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if the goldfish owner was in position 1, the cat owner would be in position 2, which would mean the hedgehog owner is not between the cat owner and the social worker, contradicting our second assumption. So, the goldfish owner can't be in position 1. If the goldfish owner was in position 4, the architect would have to be in position 3, but that would mean the architect is to the right of the social worker, contradicting our tenth assumption. So, the goldfish owner can't be in position 4 either. Therefore, the goldfish owner must be in position 2.

4. The person eating radish is the fisherman (6). Since the goldfish owner is in position 2, the fisherman must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But if the fisherman was in position 1, the cat owner would be in position 2, which would mean the hedgehog owner is not between the cat owner and the social worker, contradicting our second assumption. So, the fisherman can't be in position 1. If the fisherman was in position 4, the architect would have to be in position 3, but that would mean the architect is to the right of the social worker, contradicting our tenth assumption. So, the fisherman can't be in position 4 either. Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 3.

5. The owner of the rat is to the left of the person eating asparagus (4). Since the fisherman is in position 3 and eats radish, not asparagus, the rat owner can't be in position 3. So, the rat owner must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But if the rat owner was in position 1, the cat owner would be in position 2, which would mean the hedgehog owner is not between the cat owner and the social worker, contradicting our second assumption. So, the rat owner can't be in position 1. If the rat owner was in position 4, the architect would have to be in position 3, but that would mean the architect is to the right of the social worker, contradicting our tenth assumption. So, the rat owner can't be in position 4 either. Therefore, the rat owner must be in position 2.

6. The architect is on the right of the social worker (10). Since the social worker is in position 3, the architect must be in position 4.

7. The person eating corn is not the owner of the rat (8). Since the rat owner is in position 2, the corn eater can't be in position 2. So, the corn eater must be in position 1, 3, or 4. But if the corn eater was in position 1, the cat owner would be in position 2, which would mean the hedgehog owner is not between the cat owner and the social worker, contradicting our second assumption. So, the corn eater can't be in position 1. If the corn eater was in position 4, the architect would have to be in position 3, but that would mean the architect is to the right of the social worker, contradicting our tenth assumption. So, the corn eater can't be in position 4 either. Therefore, the corn eater must be in position 3.

8. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (7). Since the cat owner is in position 1 and the hedgehog owner is in position 3, the hedgehog owner is to the right of the cat owner.

So, the final solution table is:

  |        |     1     |     2      |       3       |     4     |

Lv6-3x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking water is between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking 1, 2, 3, or 4 (in some order), and the person drinking 7up is in an even position, the possible positions for 7up are 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.

2. The social-worker is on the left of the person drinking 7up, so the social-worker must be in position 1.

3. The fan techno is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the social-worker is in position 1, the only possible position for the dressmaker is position 3.

4. The entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking 7up, so the entrepreneur must be in position 4.

5. Now we know the positions of the social-worker, dressmaker, and entrepreneur. The only remaining position is position 3, so the person drinking water must be in position 3.

6. The person drinking water is not the fan salsa, so the fan salsa must be in one of the remaining positions (1, 2, or 4). Since the social-worker is in position 1, the fan salsa cannot be in position 1. If the fan salsa were in position 4, the person drinking 7up would have to be in position 2, but we assumed it was in position 2 earlier, which would violate the condition that the entrepreneur is in position 4. Therefore, the fan salsa must be in position 2.

7. The fan r&b is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the entrepreneur is in position 4 and the fan salsa is in position 2, the only remaining position for sprite is position 1.

8. The only remaining beverage is almond-milk. Since the fan salsa is in position 2 and the person drinking water is in position 3, the only remaining position for almond-milk is position 1.

9. The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan salsa, so the job of the person drinking almond-milk must be different from the social-worker (who is the fan salsa). The remaining jobs are dressmaker, entrepreneur, and project-manager. Since the entrepreneur is in position 4, the person drinking almond-milk cannot be the entrepreneur. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be a dressmaker or a project-manager. Since the dressmaker is already in position 3, the person drinking almond-milk must be a project-manager.

The final solution table is:

|               |       1       |        2        |      3       |      4      |
