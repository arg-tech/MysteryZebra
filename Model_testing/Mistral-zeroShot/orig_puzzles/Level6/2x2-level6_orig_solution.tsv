Lv6-2x2-1	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two different types of food (nectarine and pear) and two different types of sports (soccer and volleyball).

2. The person who plays soccer is on the far left, so the Sport column for the first row must be soccer.

3. Since there are two different sports, the second row must have volleyball.

4. Now we know the Sports column:

   |         |   1    |     2      |
   | Food    |        |            |
   | Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

5. We also know that the person who eats pear is not the one playing volleyball (puzzle point 2). So, the person eating pear must be in the first row.

6. Since there are two different types of food, the first row must have nectarine, and the second row must have pear.

   |         |   1    |     2      |
   | Food    | Nectarine | Pear |
   | Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

So, the final solution table is:

| Food    | Nectarine | Pear |
| Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

Lv6-2x2-2	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food (Apple and Lemon) and two types of pets (Goat and Guinea-pig).

2. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. This means the arrangement could be:
   - Goat owner - Guinea-pig owner (1,2)
   - Guinea-pig owner - Goat owner (2,1)

3. The owner of the goat is not the person eating lemon. This means the person eating lemon cannot be the owner of the goat. So, if we assume the goat owner is in the first row, the person eating lemon must be in the second row.

4. Now, let's place the food. Since the goat owner is not eating lemon, the goat owner must be eating apple. So, the second row must be eating lemon.

5. Now, we have only one pet left (Guinea-pig). Since the goat owner is on the left, the guinea-pig owner must be on the right. The guinea-pig owner cannot eat lemon (as the goat owner is not eating lemon), so the guinea-pig owner must eat apple.

6. Finally, the guinea-pig must be in the first row, and the goat in the second row.

The final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Goat    | Guinea-pig |
|  Apple    |   Lemon    |
#############
```

This means the owner of the goat is on the left and eating apple, and the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right and eating lemon. The goat is in the second row and the guinea-pig is in the first row."
Lv6-2x2-3	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We have two types of food: plum and pumpkin. Let's denote P for plum and U for pumpkin.

2. We have two types of sports: handball and sailing. Let's denote H for handball and S for sailing.

3. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating plum. This means that if we denote the food columns as Column 1 and Column 2, then the arrangement should be U in Column 1 and P in Column 2, or P in Column 1 and U in Column 2.

4. The person who's sport is handball is not the person eating plum. This means that the person with H cannot be in the same column as P.

5. Let's try the arrangement P in Column 1 and U in Column 2 first. If the person with H is in Column 1, then the person with S must be in Column 2, but this violates the rule that the person eating plum is not the person with H. So, the person with H must be in Column 2.

6. Now, the person with H is in Column 2, so the person with S must be in Column 1. The person eating plum cannot be in Column 1 because the person with H is in Column 2, so the person eating plum must be in Column 2.

7. Finally, the person eating pumpkin must be in Column 1 because the person eating plum is to the right of the person eating pumpkin.

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |    1     |    2    |
  | Food    | Pumpkin | Plum   |
  | Sport   | Sailing  | Handball|

Lv6-2x2-4	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (apricot and grapefruit) and two types of pets (goldfish and hamster).

2. From point 1, we can create a 2x2 table with the possible combinations of food and pets for each row:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
   | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

3. Now let's apply the clues:

   a. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish. This means that in the row with Grapefruit, the Pet cannot be Goldfish. So, the table now looks like this:

      |        |    1     |     2      |
      | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
      | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

      (X) means the combination is not possible due to the first clue.

      |        |    1     |     2      |
      | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
      | Pet    |       X | Hamster    |

   b. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot. This means that in the table, the row with Grapefruit should be to the right of the row with Apricot. However, in our current table, the Grapefruit row is already to the right of the Apricot row. So, this clue doesn't help us eliminate any more combinations.

4. Now let's arrange the remaining possible combinations according to the second clue:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Grapefruit |
   | Pet    | Goldfish| Hamster    |

   To satisfy the second clue, we need to swap the positions of the rows:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |

5. Now, let's apply the first clue again to the new arrangement:

   a. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish. This means that in the row with Grapefruit, the Pet cannot be Goldfish. However, we already know that the Pet in the Grapefruit row is Hamster, so this clue is satisfied.

6. We have satisfied both clues with the final arrangement, so the solution table is:

   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |

   (The '#' symbol is used to separate the table from the explanation.)

   #####
   |        |    1     |     2      |
   | Food   | Apricot | Goldfish  |
   | Pet    | Hamster  | Grapefruit |
   #####

This is the final solution table that satisfies both clues. The person eating Apricot is the owner of the Goldfish, and the person eating Grapefruit is the owner of the Hamster, with the person eating Apricot being to the left of the person eating Grapefruit."
Lv6-2x2-5	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres: musical and superhero. Since they prefer two different genres, one person must watch a musical and the other watches a superhero movie.

2. We also know that the people prefer 2 different types of sport: golf and lacrosse. Again, since they prefer two different sports, one person must be into golf and the other into lacrosse.

3. Now, let's apply the clues:

   - Clue 1: The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means the person watching superhero movies cannot be in the second row and second column (since that's the only cell where both a superhero movie and lacrosse are possible). So, the superhero movie must be in the first row or the second column.

   - Clue 2: The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means the cell with the superhero movie cannot be above or to the left of the cell with lacrosse. Since we've already determined that the superhero movie cannot be in the second row and second column, the only remaining possibility is that the superhero movie is in the second column and the first row is reserved for the musical movie.

   - Now, we know the sport of the person watching the musical movie must be lacrosse (since the superhero movie is not). So, the lacrosse player must be in the first row.

   - Finally, the golf player must be in the second row, as the superhero movie is in the second column.

So, the final solution table is:

```
#############
|   Musical  |
|   Lacrosse |
| Sport      |
| Superhero  |
#############
```

This table satisfies all the given clues."
Lv6-2x2-6	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different music genres: d&b and indie. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. We also know that there are two different nationalities: Japanese and Polish. Let's label them as C and D respectively.

3. The fan of d&b is on the far right, so it must be in the second column and the second row (since the nationality is in the first row). So, the first row is the nationality and the second row is the music genre. So, d&b is B and the nationality corresponding to it is D (Polish).

4. The fan of indie is not Japanese, so it must be in the first column and the second row. So, indie is A and the nationality corresponding to it is C (Japanese).

5. Now we have the following table:

   |               |   1    |    2     |
   | Music-Genre   | A      | B        |
   | Nationality   | C      | D        |

6. Since we know that the people prefer 2 different music genres, the table is correct and complete.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x2-7	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. Since the jobs are different, we can write down one job in the first row and the other in the second row. Let's assume the accountant is in the first row (Job 1) and the social worker is in the second row (Job 2). So, the first row is filled:

   |       |      Accountant     |
   | Job   |                     |
   | Pet   |                     |

2. From point 1, we know the accountant is in an odd position, so the accountant must be in the first row (position 1). So, the second row (position 2) must have the social worker.

   |       |      Accountant     |
   | Job   | Accountant         |
   | Pet   |                     |

3. Now, let's fill the pets. From point 2, we know the accountant is not the owner of the hamster. Since there are only two pets, the accountant must have the goat, and the social worker must have the hamster.

   |       |      Accountant     |
   | Job   | Accountant         |
   | Pet   |      Goat          |
   |       |      Social Worker |
   |       |      Hamster       |

4. Now, we have the final solution:

   |       |      Accountant     |
   | Job   | Accountant         |
   | Pet   |      Goat          |
   |       |      Social Worker |

Lv6-2x2-8	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know there are two types of food (kale, potato) and two nationalities (japanese, mexican).

2. From the first rule, the person eating kale is to the left of the person eating potato. This means that either the kale eater is in the first column and the potato eater is in the second, or both are in the first column with kale to the left of potato.

3. From the second rule, the Japanese is not the person eating potato. This means the Japanese must be eating kale, and since there's only one spot for the Japanese in the first column (as the second column is already occupied by the potato eater), the Japanese must be in the first row.

4. Now we know the Japanese is eating kale, so the potato eater must be in the second row and second column (as the first column is occupied by the Japanese).

5. The nationality in the first row is still unknown, but since the Japanese is eating kale, the potato eater must be Mexican (as the other nationality, Japanese, is already taken).

Here is the final solution table:

```
#############
|   Japanese | Mexican |
|   Kale    |   Potato|
#############
```

This table represents the solution to the puzzle. The Japanese is eating kale, and the Mexican is eating potato."
Lv6-2x2-9	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two different music genres: dubstep and techno. Let's label them as A and B respectively.

2. Similarly, there are two different means of transport: train and trike. Let's label them as X and Y respectively.

3. From point 1, we can write the following for the Music-Genre row: A B

4. From point 2, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the train. This means that Y cannot be in the first column (since X is already there). So, the Transport row becomes X Y

5. Now, let's consider point 1 again. The person driving the train is not a fan of techno. This means that the first column (X) cannot be labeled as B (techno). So, the Music-Genre row becomes A _

6. Since there are only two music genres, the first column (X) must be labeled as A (dubstep). So, the Music-Genre row becomes Dubstep _

7. Now, we know that the person driving the train is not a fan of techno, so the second column (Y) must be labeled as B (techno). So, the Transport row becomes Train Techno

8. Finally, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the train. Since the train is driven by a dubstep fan (X), the trike must be driven by a techno fan (Y). So, the Transport row remains as Train Techno, and the Music-Genre row remains as Dubstep Techno

The final solution table is:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep | Techno |
| Transport     | Train  | Trike |

Lv6-2x2-10	"Let's break this down step by step:

1. We know that there are two jobs (entrepreneur and firefighter) and two means of transport (helicopter and van).

2. From the first rule, we know that the person driving the helicopter is not the firefighter. This means the firefighter must be in the van. So, we can fill the table as follows:

   |             |      1 (Van) |      2 (Helicopter) |
   | Job         | Firefighter  |                     |
   | Transport   |              | Helicopter         |

3. From the second rule, we know that the entrepreneur is in an even position. Since the firefighter is already in position 1 (which is an even number), the entrepreneur must be in position 2. So, we can fill the table as follows:

   |             |      1 (Van) |      2 (Helicopter) |
   | Job         | Firefighter  | Entrepreneur       |
   | Transport   |              | Helicopter         |

4. Now, we have filled both jobs and both means of transport. So, the final solution table is:
