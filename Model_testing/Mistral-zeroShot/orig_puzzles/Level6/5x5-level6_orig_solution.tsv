Lv6-5x5-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them P1 to P5 from left to right.

2. From rule 15, we know that P1 (the musical movie fan) is not driving the snowmobile. So, P1 can't be in position 3.

3. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since P1 can't be in position 3, P5 (the trike driver) can't be in position 5. So, P5 must be in position 1, 2, or 4.

4. From rule 17, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding (P4, according to rule 6) is not the owner of the chinchilla. So, the chinchilla can't be with P4. Therefore, P4 can't be in position 5.

5. From rule 18, we know that the person driving the snowmobile (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since P5 can't be in position 5, P5 can't be the tennis player. So, P5 can't be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, P5 must be in position 4.

6. From rule 19, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding (P4) is in an odd position. Since P5 is in position 4, P1, P2, and P3 must be even positions.

7. From rule 20, we know that the person watching sports movies (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since P5 can't be in position 1, P5 can't be the turtle owner. So, the turtle can't be with P5. Therefore, P5 can't be in position 2. So, P5 must be in position 4.

8. Now we know that P5 is in position 4, so P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3.

9. From rule 21, we know that the person watching musical movies (P1) is not the fan of blues. So, the blues fan can't be in position 1.

10. From rule 22, we know that the owner of the ferret (P2, according to rule 22) is watching spy movies.

11. From rule 23, we know that the owner of the hedgehog (not P2, as we found in step 10) is in an odd position. So, the hedgehog can't be with P5 (in position 4). Therefore, P5 can't be the owner of the hedgehog. So, the hedgehog can't be in position 2 or 4.

12. From rule 24, we know that the person driving the tram (not P1, as we found in step 2) is to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since P5 can't be the fan of hip-hop (in position 4), the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 5. So, the fan of hip-hop can't be in position 5.

13. From rule 25, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since P5 can't be the boat driver (in position 3), the boat driver can't be to the left of the superhero movie watcher. So, the boat driver can't be in position 1 or 2.

14. From rule 26, we know that the fan of blues is to the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle can't be with P5 (in position 4), the turtle can't be to the right of the fan of blues. So, the fan of blues can't be in position 5.

15. Now we know that the fan of blues can't be in position 5, so the fan of blues can be in position 1 or 2. Since P1 can't be the fan of blues (as we found in step 9), the fan of blues must be in position 2.

16. Since the fan of blues is in position 2, the turtle can't be with P2 (the fan of blues). So, the turtle can't be in position 2.

17. From rule 3, we know that the fan of jazz is in an odd position. Since P1 can't be the fan of blues and can't be in position 1 (as we found in step 9), P1 must be the fan of jazz.

18. Since P1 is the fan of jazz (in position 1), the person driving the snowmobile (not P1) can't be in position 1. So, the snowmobile driver can't be in position 1.

19. From rule 4, we know that the person watching musical movies is to the right of the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is in position 2, the person watching musical movies can't be in position 1.

20. From rule 5, we know that the fan of punk is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the fan of punk can't be in position 1.

21. From rule 13, we know that the owner of the ferret is to the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the owner of the ferret (P2) is in position 2, the owner of the frog can't be in position 1 or 2.

22. From rule 14, we know that the person watching musical movies is to the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 2, the person watching musical movies can't be in position 1.

24. From rule 11, we know that the fan of hip-hop is not the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the ferret (P2) is not the chinchilla owner (as we found in step 10), the chinchilla can't be with P2. So, the chinchilla can't be in position 2.

25. From rule 12, we know that the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is in position 1, the person watching documentary movies can't be in position 1.

27. From rule 2, we know that the person who's music genre is blues is in an odd position. Since P1 is the fan of jazz (in position 1), P3 can't be the blues fan. So, P3 must be the person watching documentary movies (as we found in step 26).

28. From rule 18, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since P5 is in position 4, P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3.

29. From rule 16, we know that the person driving the trike is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since P5 is the tennis player, P4 is the snowboarder, and P3 is watching documentary movies, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, P3 must be the person watching sports movies.

30. From rule 20, we know that the person watching sports movies is to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since P3 is watching sports movies, P5 (the tennis player) can't be the turtle owner. So, the turtle can't be in position 4.

31. From rule 23, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is in an odd position. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, P3 is watching sports movies, and P5 is the tennis player, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1.

32. From rule 9, we know that the person driving the trike is to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.

33. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the person driving the tram. Since P4 is the snowboarder, P1, P2, and P3 are in positions 1, 2, and 3. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P3 is watching sports movies, P5 must be the person driving the tram.

34. From rule 10, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the turtle. Since P3 is watching sports movies and P5 is driving the tram, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, and P4 is the snowboarder, the person who's sport is sailing can't be in position 1, 2, or 4. So, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3.

35. From rule 24, we know that the person driving the tram is to the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since P5 is driving the tram, P1, P2, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, and 4.

39. From rule 25, we know that the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the person driving the boat. Since P5 is the tennis player, P1, P2, P3, and P4 are in positions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Since P1 is the fan of jazz, P2 is the owner of the ferret, P3 is watching sports movies, P4 is the snowboarder, and P5 is the tennis player, the person watching superhero movies can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. So, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 5.

40. From rule 26, we know that the fan of blues is to the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is owned by P1 (the hedgehog owner), the fan of blues can't be in position 1.

41. From rule 2, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, hip-hop, and punk, the remaining music genre is reggae.

48. From rule 46, we know that the remaining pet type is the pet of P5 (the tennis player). Since the fan of punk is in position 3, the tennis player can't have a pet that is a chinchilla, ferret, frog, hedgehog, or turtle. So, the tennis player must have a dog.

49. From rule 2, we know that the people prefer 5 different music-genres. Since we have already placed the fans of blues, jazz, hip-hop, punk, and reggae, the music genre of P5 (the tennis player) must be country.

Lv6-5x5-4	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign a number to each category (Beverage, Movie-Genre, Pet, Sport, Transport) and each person (1 to 5 from left to right).

2. Let's start with the people's sports. We can use the given clues to eliminate possibilities and place them in their positions. For example, we know that the person playing handball is not the roller driver, so they can't be in position 5. Similarly, we can place the person playing tennis next to the bird owner (clue 12), and the person playing baseball next to the time-travel movie watcher (clue 13).

3. Next, let's place the pets. We know that the goldfish owner is to the left of the weightlifting person (clue 2), so the goldfish can't be in position 5. We can place the cat owner to the right of the time-travel movie watcher (clue 15), and the chinchilla owner to the left of the handball player (clue 9). The frog owner is the skateboard driver (clue 6), so we can place the frog. The bird owner is next to the tennis player (clue 12), so we can place the bird. The remaining pet, the cat, can be placed based on the remaining positions.

4. Now, let's place the means of transport. We know that the bus driver is not the frog owner (clue 3), so the bus can't be in position 3. We can place the helicopter to the right of the scooter (clue 20), and the scooter can't be the roller (clue 4), so it can't be in position 5. The skateboard is driven by the frog owner (clue 6), so it's in position 3. The roller can't be the bus (clue 8), so it can't be in position 1. The remaining transport, the roller, can be placed based on the remaining positions.

5. Now, let's place the beverages. We know that the soy-milk drinker is to the left of the almond-milk drinker (clue 14), and they are also in an even position (clue 18). We can place the soy-milk drinker in position 2 or 4. The almond-milk drinker can't be in position 5 (clue 17), so they can be in position 1, 2, or 4. The remaining beverages can be placed based on the remaining positions.

6. Finally, let's place the movie genres. We know that the musical movie watcher is to the left of the bird owner (clue 19), the time-travel movie watcher is on the left or right of the cat owner (clue 22), and the superhero movie watcher is on the far left (clue 21). The thriller movie watcher can't be the skateboard driver (clue 24), and they are to the left of the almond-milk drinker (clue 26). The remaining movie genres can be placed based on the remaining positions.

Here is the final solution table:

```

| Transport     | bus      | scooter      | roller    | helicopter  |  skateboard|
```"
Lv6-5x5-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 people, so we can represent each person with a number from 1 to 5.

2. From rule 19, the person who's hobby is video-games is to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the Indonesian drinks sprite (rule 8), the person playing video-games is either 1 or 2. Let's assume the video-games person is 1 for now.

3. From rule 15, the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since the Indonesian drinks juice (rule 12), the person singing can't be 2 (as it would violate rule 19). So, the person singing is either 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the singer is 3 for now.

4. From rule 14, the person who's hobby is baking is eating nectarine. Since the accountant is the person eating apricot (rule 17), the baker can't be 1 (as it would violate rule 3). So, the baker is either 2, 4, or 5. Let's assume the baker is 2 for now.

5. From rule 21, the baker is in the middle, so the baker must be 3. This means the singer is 4 and the video-games person is 1.

6. From rule 20, the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the accountant. Since the accountant is 3, the sudoku person can't be 3. So, the sudoku person is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. Let's assume the sudoku person is 5 for now.

7. From rule 18, the accountant is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the baker is the accountant, the almond-milk person can't be 3. So, the almond-milk person is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. Let's assume the almond-milk person is 4 for now.

8. From rule 10, the person drinking almond-milk is to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. This means the baker can't be 4 (as it would violate rule 7). So, the baker must be 3, and the almond-milk person is 4.

9. From rule 22, the person who's hobby is video-games is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the scientist. Since the video-games person is 1 and the sudoku person is 5, the scientist can't be 1 or 5. So, the scientist is either 2, 3, or 4. Let's assume the scientist is 2 for now.

10. From rule 16, the thai is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the baker is 3, the thai can't be 3. So, the thai is either 1, 2, or 4. Let's assume the thai is 1 for now.

11. From rule 6, the person eating cabbage is to the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the coffee drinker eats cauliflower (rule 2), the cabbage eater can't be 2. So, the cabbage eater is either 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the cabbage eater is 5 for now.

12. From rule 7, the person eating papaya is to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the coffee drinker is 2, the papaya eater can't be 1 or 2. So, the papaya eater is either 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the papaya eater is 4 for now.

13. From rule 13, the thai is to the left of the dressmaker. Since the thai is 1, the dressmaker can't be 1. So, the dressmaker is either 2, 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the dressmaker is 2 for now.

14. From rule 5, the social-worker is to the left of the doctor. Since the accountant is the social-worker (rule 17), the doctor can't be 3. So, the doctor is either 1, 2, 4, or 5. Let's assume the doctor is 5 for now.

15. From rule 4, the social-worker is to the left of the spanish. Since the social-worker is the accountant (rule 17), the spanish can't be 3. So, the spanish is either 1, 2, or 4. Let's assume the spanish is 4 for now.

16. From rule 1, the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the spanish. This means the social-worker can't be 4 (as it would violate rule 14). So, the social-worker must be 1, 2, or 5. But we already placed the social-worker as 3 (from rule 5), so there's a contradiction. It seems there's no solution for this puzzle as it's not possible to place all people according to the given rules.

Lv6-5x5-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is sailing is not the person drinking coffee, so sailing can't be in the first row.
2. The mechanic is the person watching mystery movies, so we know that the mechanic is not in the first row (since there are only 4 rows left for mystery). Let's place the mechanic in the 5th row.
3. The electrician is in the middle, so he must be in the 3rd row.
4. The bartender is the person who's sport is weightlifting, so weightlifting can't be in the 5th row (since the mechanic is there). Let's place weightlifting in the 1st row.
5. The person drinking coffee is in an odd position and the electrician is in the 3rd row, so the person drinking coffee must be in the 1st or 5th row. Since the mechanic is in the 5th row, the person drinking coffee must be in the 1st row.
6. The person drinking coffee is the owner of the goldfish, so the goldfish is in the 1st row.
7. The person watching romance movies is not the person who's sport is surfing, so romance can't be in the 4th row (since surfing is even). Let's place romance in the 2nd row.
8. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies, so the guinea-pig can't be in the 5th row. Let's place the guinea-pig in the 2nd row.

Lv6-5x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the positions are odd for cola and even for sprite, we can place them in positions 1 and 5 respectively.

2. The tram driver is the rower, so we can place the rower in position 4 (even position). Since the tram driver is to the right of the trike driver, the trike driver must be in position 2.

3. The onion eater is the surfer, so we can place the surfer in position 3.

4. The apricot eater is the fan of classical music, so we can place the classical fan in position 1.

5. The ship driver is not a fan of disco, so we can rule out positions 1, 2, 4, and 5 for the disco fan. Since the disco fan is the sailor, we can place the sailor in position 3 (the only remaining position for the disco fan).

6. The kiwi eater is on the left or right of the zucchini eater, and the fan of funk is to the right of the apricot eater. So, the fan of funk can't be in position 1 (as it would leave no room for the apricot eater to be on the right). Therefore, the fan of funk must be in position 5. This means the kiwi eater must be in position 2 and the zucchini eater in position 4.

7. The person drinking water is to the right of the biathlon person. Since the biathlon person can't be in position 1 (as it's occupied by the cola drinker), the biathlon person must be in position 2. This means the water drinker is in position 3.

8. The person driving the bike is the sprite drinker, so we've already placed them in position 5. Since the bike driver is to the left of the scooter driver, the scooter driver must be in position 3.

9. The person drinking iced-tea is the rower, so we've already placed them in position 4. The person drinking milk can't be the biathlon person (as the water drinker is to the right of the biathlon person), so the milk drinker must be in position 1.

10. The person who's sport is parkour is between the sprite drinker (bike driver) and the fan of jazz. Since the sprite drinker is in position 5, the parkour person must be in position 4. This means the fan of jazz is in position 3.

11. The person eating zucchini is in position 4 and the kiwi eater is in position 2. So, the person eating zucchini is to the left of the person eating kiwi.

12. The surfer is to the right of the sailor. Since the surfer is in position 3, the sailor must be in position 2.

13. The rower is the iced-tea drinker, so we've already placed them in position 4. The biathlon person can't be the fan of jazz (as we've placed the fan of jazz in position 3), so the biathlon person must be in position 5.

14. The trike driver is in position 2 and the kiwi eater is to the left of the person eating kiwi (which is the person in position 4). So, the trike driver must be in position 1.

15. The sailor is the disco fan, so we've already placed them in position 2.

16. The tram driver is the rower, so we've already placed them in position 4 (an even position).

17. The biathlon person is not the fan of jazz, so we've already placed them in position 5.

18. The zucchini eater is not the fan of disco, so we've already placed them in position 4.

19. The sprite drinker (bike driver) is between the parkour person (position 4) and the fan of jazz (position 3). So, the sprite drinker must be in position 5.

20. The rower is the iced-tea drinker, so we've already placed them in position 4. The milk drinker can't be the biathlon person (as the water drinker is to the right of the biathlon person), so the milk drinker must be in position 1.

21. The bike driver is the sprite drinker, so we've already placed them in position 5. The scooter driver must be in position 3 (as the bike driver is to the left of the scooter driver).

22. The rower is the iced-tea drinker, so we've already placed them in position 4. The person drinking milk can't be the biathlon person (as the water drinker is to the right of the biathlon person), so the person drinking milk must be in position 1.

23. The person driving the trike is in position 1 and the person driving the ship is not the fan of disco. Since the disco fan is the sailor (in position 2), the ship driver must be in position 5.

Lv6-5x5-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 17, we know that the person drinking juice is not the person driving the quad-bike. So, the quad-bike can't be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. From rule 7, the fan techno is the person driving the jet-ski. So, the jet-ski is in position 2, 4, or 5.

3. From rule 18, we know that the fan trance is not the person driving the quad-bike or the person driving the jet-ski. So, the fan trance can't be in positions 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. From rule 16, the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking mirinda. So, mirinda is in position 1, 3, or 5.

5. From rule 19, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is in the middle. So, the hobby of collecting is in position 3.

6. From rule 20, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. So, mirinda can't be in position 3. Therefore, mirinda is in position 1 or 5.

7. From rule 2, we know that the person watching thriller movies is the person driving the van. So, the van is in position 2.

8. From rule 8, we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person driving the van. So, lemonade can't be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, lemonade is in position 3 or 4.

9. From rule 9, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. So, reading can't be in position 1 or 2. Therefore, reading is in position 4 or 5.

10. From rule 11, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. So, fantasy can't be in position 5. Therefore, fantasy is in position 1 or 2.

11. From rule 13, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person watching western movies. So, hot-chocolate can't be in position 2. Therefore, hot-chocolate is in position 1, 3, or 5.

12. From rule 12, we know that the person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching spy movies. Since spy movies are in position 2 (rule 7), western movies can't be in position 1. Therefore, western movies are in position 3, 4, or 5.

13. From rule 14, we know that the fan trance is not the person drinking juice. Since juice is in position 3 or 4 (rule 8), the fan trance can't be in position 3 or 4. Therefore, the fan trance is in position 1 or 5.

14. From rule 15, we know that the fan jazz is on the left of the fan ambient. Since the fan ambient is not in position 1 (rule 15), the fan jazz can't be in position 2. Therefore, the fan jazz is in position 3 or 5.

15. From rule 21, we know that the fan techno is not the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching thriller movies is in position 2 (rule 7), the fan techno can't be in position 2. Therefore, the fan techno is in position 1, 3, or 5.

16. From rule 10, we know that the fan trance is not the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is not in position 1 or 2 (rules 7 and 10), the fan trance can't be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the fan trance is in position 5.

17. From rule 6, we know that the fan techno is not the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is not in position 1, 2, 3, or 5 (rules 6, 7, 16, and 18), the fan techno can't be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. This is a contradiction with our previous conclusion (step 2). There seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Here is the final solution table assuming there is no error in the puzzle:

| Beverage      |       1       |     2     |     3      |     4      |     5     |
| Hobby         |               |           |            |            |           |
| Movie-Genre   |               |           |            |            |           |
| Music-Genre   |               |           |            |            |           |
| Transport     |               |           |            |            |           |

This table is not complete because there is an error in the puzzle. The fan techno cannot be the person driving the jet-ski (rule 7) and cannot be the person driving the car (rule 6), but it also cannot be the person driving the quad-bike (rule 18) or the person driving the van (rule 21), which contradicts the initial assumption that it is the person driving the jet-ski (rule 7)."
Lv6-5x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, but we can solve it step by step. Let's break it down:

1. Let's assign numbers to the people based on their sports, starting from left to right: 1 - Snowboarding, 2 - Basketball, 3 - Weightlifting, 4 - Cricket, 5 - Parkour.

2. From the information given, we know that Basketball is either 1 or 5. Since it's to the left of Corn (5), Basketball must be 1. So, Snowboarding is 5, Weightlifting is 3, Cricket is 4, and Parkour is 2.

3. Now, we know that the person eating Corn is to the right of the person watching Superhero movies (5). So, Superhero movies must be 3, 4, or 5. Since Superhero movies are not at position 5 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the left of Corn (5), Superhero movies must be 4. This means the person eating Corn is 2 (Parkour).

4. The person eating Cucumber is not the person drinking Tea (5), so Cucumber is not 5. Also, Cucumber is to the right of Basketball (1), so Cucumber is not 1. Therefore, Cucumber must be 3, 4, or 5. Since Cucumber is not 5 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the left of Parkour (2), Cucumber must be 4. This means the person eating Cucumber is 1 (Snowboarding).

5. The person drinking Tea is on the far right (5).

6. The person eating Cucumber is not the person drinking Soy-Milk, so Soy-Milk is not 1, 2, 4, or 5. Soy-Milk must be 3.

7. The person drinking Milk is the person who's hobby is Dancing (1).

8. The person who's sport is Weightlifting is on the left of the person watching Thriller movies (1).

9. The person who's sport is Weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is Snowboarding (5), so Weightlifting is 2 or 3. Since Weightlifting is not 3 (Soy-Milk), it must be 2.

10. The person eating Lemon is not the person who's hobby is Dancing (1), so Lemon is not 2. Therefore, Lemon must be 3, 4, or 5. Since Lemon is not 5 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the left of Dancing (1), Lemon must be 4.

11. The person who's sport is Weightlifting is on the left of the person drinking Milk (1), so Weightlifting is 3.

12. The person who's hobby is Rock-Climbing is on the left of the person watching Thriller movies (1), so Rock-Climbing is 2.

13. The person who's hobby is Dancing is on the right of the person watching Satire movies. Since Dancing is 2, Satire movies must be 1, 3, or 4. Since Satire movies are not 1 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the right of Dancing (2), Satire movies must be 4.

14. The person watching Crime movies is the person who's sport is Basketball (1).

15. The person who's hobby is Dancing is not the person who's sport is Basketball, which we already know is 1.

16. The person drinking Milk is the person who's hobby is Dancing (1).

17. The person watching Thriller movies is the person eating Cucumber (1).

18. The person watching Crime movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is Singing. Since Crime movies are 1, Singing must be 2 or 3.

19. The person who's hobby is Singing is not the person eating Lemon (4), so Singing must be 2 or 3.

20. The person eating Cucumber is not the person drinking Soy-Milk (3), so Singing must be 2.

21. The person who's sport is Basketball is on the left of the person who's hobby is Rock-Climbing (2).

22. The person drinking Soy-Milk is on the right of the person drinking Sprite. Since Soy-Milk is 3, Sprite must be 1 or 2. Since Sprite is not 1 (Snowboarding), Sprite must be 2.

23. The person who's hobby is Writing is not the person who's sport is Basketball (1), so Writing must be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Since Writing is not 5 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the left of Dancing (1), Writing must be 2, 3, or 4. Since Writing is not 3 (Weightlifting), Writing must be 4.

24. The person who's sport is Cricket is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is Camping. Since Camping is not listed yet, let's assign Camping to 5. This means Cricket is 2, 3, or 4. Since Cricket is not 3 (Weightlifting), and it's not to the left of Dancing (1), Cricket must be 4.

25. The person eating Cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is Dancing (1), so Cauliflower is 2, 3, or 4. Since Cauliflower is not 3 (Weightlifting), and it's not to the left of Rock-Climbing (2), Cauliflower must be 4.

26. The person eating Watermelon is between the person drinking Fanta and the person eating Corn (2). Since Fanta is not listed yet, let's assign Fanta to 1. This means Watermelon is 2 or 3. Since Watermelon is not 3 (Soy-Milk), Watermelon must be 2.

27. The person watching Satire movies is not the person who's sport is Snowboarding (5), so Satire movies is 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since Satire movies are not 1 (Snowboarding), and it's not to the right of Dancing (1), Satire movies must be 2, 3, or 4. Since Satire movies are not 3 (Weightlifting), Satire movies must be 4.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |    4     |      5       |
