Lv6-6x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different items in each category, so we can represent each category with numbers from 1 to 4.

2. From rule 16, we know that the person eating cabbage is on the left of the nigerian. So, let's place the nigerian in position 3 or 4 (since position 1 and 2 are already taken by other items). Let's place the nigerian in position 3 for now.

3. From rule 6, we know that the nigerian is on the left of the person watching family movies. So, the person watching family movies must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But from rule 18, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person watching family movies, and from rule 19, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is not the person driving the bike. So, the person watching family movies can't be in position 1 (since position 1 is the only even position and the bike is an odd position). Therefore, the person watching family movies is in position 2.

4. From rule 17, we know that the person eating corn is in an odd position. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, the person eating corn must be in position 4.

5. From rule 11, we know that the person eating orange is the person who's sport is soccer. Since positions 1, 2, and 3 are taken, the person eating orange must be in position 4.

6. From rule 10, we know that the person driving the train is in an even position. Since positions 1, 2, and 4 are taken, the person driving the train must be in position 3.

7. From rule 9, we know that the person eating onion is the person driving the train. So, the person driving the train is in position 3.

8. From rule 14, we know that the polish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person driving the train (who is the person eating onion) is in position 3, the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 13, we know that the person who's sport is skiing is not the person driving the scooter. So, the person who's sport is skiing can't be in position 1 (since position 1 is the only even position and the scooter is an odd position). Therefore, the person who's sport is skiing is in position 2.

9. From rule 15, we know that the nigerian is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the nigerian is in position 3, the person drinking fanta must be in position 1 or 4. But from rule 20, we know that the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the train (who is the person eating onion) is in position 3, the person driving the scooter must be in position 2. So, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4.

10. From rule 12, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking fanta is in position 4, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1 or 2. But from rule 18, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person watching family movies, and from rule 2, we know that the person watching superhero movies is on the left of the polish. Since the polish is in position 2 and the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the polish, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1. So, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

11. From rule 8, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in position 1, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 3.

12. From rule 5, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the train is in position 3, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.

13. From rule 7, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the person eating cabbage. Since the person eating cabbage is on the left of the nigerian (who is in position 3), the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

14. From rule 21, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion. Since the person eating onion is in position 3, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 4.

15. From rule 4, we know that the person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking coffee is in position 2, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 1 or 4. But from rule 3, we know that the person watching superhero movies is on the left of the polish. Since the polish is in position 2 and the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the polish, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 1. So, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 5 clues that give us information about the position of certain elements (#3, #4, #6, #9, #17). Let's use these clues to place the elements in the table.

   - Since the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat (#3), we can place the skateboard and rat in the first two positions. Let's say skateboard in position 1 and rat in position 2.
   - The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini (#4), so water must be in a position to the left of zucchini. Since zucchini can't be in the first position (because it's not the far left or far right, as per #18), zucchini must be in the 3rd or 4th position. If zucchini is in the 3rd position, water must be in the 2nd position. If zucchini is in the 4th position, water can be in either the 1st or 2nd position. Let's assume zucchini is in the 3rd position and water is in the 2nd position.
   - The nigerian is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog (#7), so nigerian can't be in the first two positions. The owner of the hedgehog can't be in the last position (because it's not the far left or far right, as per #18), so the hedgehog must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. If the hedgehog is in the 2nd position, the nigerian must be in the 4th position. If the hedgehog is in the 3rd position, the nigerian can be in either the 1st or 4th position. Let's assume the hedgehog is in the 2nd position and the nigerian is in the 4th position.
   - The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person eating raspberry (#9), so the bus can't be in the last position. The person eating raspberry can't be in the first position (because it's not the far left or far right, as per #18), so the raspberry must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. If the raspberry is in the 2nd position, the bus must be in the 1st position. If the raspberry is in the 3rd or 4th position, the bus can be in the 2nd position. Let's assume the raspberry is in the 3rd position and the bus is in the 2nd position.
   - The person driving the train is in an even position (#12), so the train can only be in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the skateboard is in the 1st position and the bus is in the 2nd position, the train can't be in the 2nd position. So, the train must be in the 4th position.
   - The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat (#3), so the skateboard can't be in the last position. Since the bus is in the 2nd position and the train is in the 4th position, the skateboard can't be in the 4th position. So, the skateboard must be in the 1st position.
   - The owner of the horse is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing (#6), so the horse can't be in the last position. Since the skateboard is in the 1st position, the horse can't be in the 2nd position. So, the horse must be in the 3rd position.
   - The mexican is not the person driving the skateboard (#13), so the mexican can't be in the 1st position. Since the horse is in the 3rd position, the mexican can't be in the 4th position. So, the mexican must be in the 2nd position.
   - The owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the nigerian (#14), so the cat can't be in the 4th position. Since the raspberry is in the 3rd position, the cat can't be in the 2nd position. So, the cat must be in the 1st position.
   - The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (#15), so the rat can't be in the 1st position (because the cat is already there). So, the rat must be in the 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position. Since the skateboard is in the 1st position, the rat can't be in the 2nd position. So, the rat must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Since the zucchini is in the 3rd position, the rat can't be in the 3rd position. So, the rat must be in the 4th position.
   - The person eating potato is on the left or right of the mexican (#16), so the potato can't be in the 1st position (because the cat is already there) or the 2nd position (because the rat is already there). So, the potato must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Since the zucchini is in the 3rd position, the potato can't be in the 3rd position. So, the potato must be in the 4th position.
   - The mexican is not the person eating raspberry (#19), so the mexican can't be in the 3rd position (because the raspberry is already there). So, the mexican must be in the 2nd position.
   - The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat (#20), so the surfing can't be in the 4th position (because the rat is already there). So, the surfing must be in the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd position. Since the skateboard is in the 1st position and the mexican is in the 2nd position, the surfing can't be in the 1st or 2nd position. So, the surfing must be in the 3rd position.

2. Now that we have placed all the elements in the table, we can fill in the remaining categories:

   |               |      1       |    2     |      3      |       4       |
   | Beverage      | water       | juice    | almond-milk | lemonade     |
   | Food          | potato      | raspberry| broccoli    | zucchini     |
   | Nationality   | argentine   | mexican  | nigerian    | thai         |
   | Pet           | cat         | hedgehog | horse       | rat          |
   | Sport         | skateboarding| surfing  | swimming    | snowboarding  |
   | Transport     | bus         | scooter  | skateboard  | train        |

3. The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position (#5), but we have filled all the positions. This contradicts the given information, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle.

Lv6-6x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so we can represent them as A, B, C, and D, from left to right.

2. Let's start with the beverages. Since there are 4 different beverages, each person must have a unique drink. Let's assign the drinks to the people as follows:
   - A drinks 7up (since it's not the owner of the rabbit, which we know later)
   - B drinks milk (since it's not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, which we know later)
   - C drinks soy-milk (since it's not the person drinking sprite, which we know later)
   - D drinks sprite (since it's not the person driving the car, which we know later)

3. Now let's assign the food. Since there are 4 different foods, each person must have a unique food. We can assign the foods based on the hobbies and nationality constraints:
   - A (hiking, not colombian) eats kale (since the hiker eats kale)
   - B (not hiking, not colombian) eats carrot (since the person who's hobby is collecting eats carrot)
   - C (not hiking, not colombian) eats nectarine (since the remaining food is nectarine and strawberry, and the person eating strawberry is on the right of the colombian)
   - D (not hiking, colombian) eats strawberry (since the colombian is not the owner of the rabbit, which we know later, and the remaining food is nectarine, which is eaten by C)

4. Now let's assign the hobbies. We know that the hiker eats kale, so A has hiking. The remaining hobbies can be assigned as follows:
   - B has collecting (since the person who's hobby is collecting eats carrot and is not the hiker, which we know A is)
   - C has rock-climbing (since C drinks milk and is not the person who's hobby is writing, which we know later)
   - D has writing (since D drinks sprite and is the colombian, which is on the far left or far right, and the remaining hobby is writing)

5. Now let's assign the nationalities. We know that A is not colombian, so A is either Australian or French. Since the French is on the far left or far right, A cannot be French. So, A is Australian. Since the Australian is on the left or right of the hiker, A is on the left of B (hiker). So, A is Australian and B is hiking.

6. Now let's assign the pets. Since the owner of the rabbit is not the colombian, the owner of the rabbit is either A or D. Since the owner of the horse is on the far left, it cannot be D (since D eats strawberry, which is on the right of the colombian). So, the owner of the horse is A (Australian). Since the owner of the rabbit is not the person drinking 7up, the owner of the rabbit is C or D. Since the owner of the rabbit is not A, the owner of the rabbit is D (colombian).

7. Now let's assign the transport. Since the person driving the car is in an odd position and on the left of the person driving the bus, the person driving the car is B (since A is Australian and D is colombian, and the remaining positions are odd). Since the person driving the car is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus, the person driving the bus is D (since D is colombian and the remaining nationality is French). So, the person driving the bus is French and the person driving the car is B.

8. Since the person driving the motorbike drinks sprite, the person driving the motorbike is D (since D drinks sprite). Since the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus, the person drinking soy-milk is C.

9. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, the person drinking milk is A (since A drinks 7up and the remaining person drinking milk is C).

10. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, the person who's hobby is writing is B.

11. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the owner of the fish, the owner of the fish is A or C. Since the owner of the horse is on the far left, it cannot be A. So, the owner of the fish is C. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, the person driving the snowmobile is B.

12. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, the person who's hobby is writing is A.

13. Since the french is on the far left or far right, the french is A (since we already know that D is colombian).

14. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, the person driving the snowmobile is B.

15. Since the person eating strawberry is on the right of the colombian, the person eating strawberry is D.

16. Since the owner of the horse is on the far left, the owner of the horse is A (Australian).

17. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, the person who's hobby is collecting is B.

18. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, the person who's hobby is writing is A.

19. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile, the person who's hobby is collecting is B.

20. Since the owner of the rabbit is D (colombian), the owner of the fish is C.

The final solution table is:

|               |      A     |      B      |      C      |      D       |

Lv6-6x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 people, so each row represents a person. Let's label them A, B, C, and D from left to right.

2. From rule 1, the skateboard driver is in an odd position, so let's place the skateboard driver in position 1 (A) or 3 (C). Since the skateboard driver also does video-games (rule 13), and video-games can't be the person driving the subway (rule 20), we can place the skateboard driver in position 3 (C).

3. Now, the skateboard driver is Canadian (rule 11) and a fan of pop (rule 3). So, we can place the Canadian in position 3 (C) and the fan of pop in position 4 (D).

4. The fan of ambient is Nigerian (rule 10), so we can place the Nigerian in position 2 (B).

5. The Italian is not the skateboard driver (rule 19), so the Italian can't be in position 3 (C). The Italian can't be in position 1 (A) because the skateboard driver is Canadian, and the Canadian is on the right of the skateboard driver (rule 14). So, the Italian must be in position 2 (B).

6. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking (rule 4). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the hiker must be in position 4 (D). So, the camper must be in position 2 (B).

7. The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 5). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the rabbit owner must be in position 4 (D). So, the ferret owner must be in position 2 (B).

8. The owner of the frog is in an odd position (rule 7), so the frog owner must be in position 1 (A) or 3 (C). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the frog owner must be in position 1 (A).

9. The person who's sport is climbing is in an odd position (rule 2). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the climber must be in position 1 (A).

10. The person who's hobby is baking is the person who's sport is skateboarding (rule 13), so the baker is in position 3 (C).

11. The person who's sport is biathlon is a fan of pop (rule 3), so the biathlete is in position 4 (D).

12. The person who's hobby is video-games is not the person driving the subway (rule 20), so the video-gamer is not in position 4 (D). The video-gamer can't be in position 1 (A) because the skateboard driver is Canadian, and the Canadian is on the right of the skateboard driver (rule 14). So, the video-gamer must be in position 2 (B).

13. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping (rule 6). Since the hiker is in position 4 (D), the camper must be in position 2 (B).

14. The person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit (rule 24). Since the rabbit owner is in position 4 (D), the rower must be in position 1 (A), 2 (B), or 3 (C). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the rower can't be in position 3 (C). So, the rower must be in position 1 (A) or 2 (B).

15. The person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus (rule 15). Since the climber is in position 1 (A), the bus driver can't be in position 1 (A). So, the bus driver must be in position 2 (B), 3 (C), or 4 (D). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the bus driver can't be in position 3 (C). So, the bus driver must be in position 2 (B) or 4 (D).

16. The canadian is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (rule 14), so the Canadian can't be in position 3 (C). The Canadian is also not the skateboard driver (rule 19), so the Canadian can't be in position 1 (A). So, the Canadian must be in position 4 (D).

17. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing (rule 23), so the video-gamer can't be in position 1 (A) or 2 (B). So, the video-gamer must be in position 4 (D).

18. The person who's sport is rowing is not in position 4 (D) because the rower can't be on the right of the owner of the rabbit (rule 24). So, the rower must be in position 1 (A) or 2 (B).

19. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking (rule 4), so the camper must be in position 2 (B).

20. The person who's hobby is baking is the person who's sport is skateboarding (rule 13), so the baker is in position 3 (C).

21. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret (rule 21), so the rabbit owner must be in position 3 (C) or 4 (D). Since the skateboard driver is in position 3 (C), the rabbit owner can't be in position 3 (C). So, the rabbit owner must be in position 4 (D).

22. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right (rule 22), but we already know the positions of the skateboard driver, the Canadian, the fan of pop, the fan of ambient, the Italian, the camper, the baker, the climber, the ferret owner, and the frog owner. The only remaining position is position 1 (A). Since the skateboard driver is Canadian and a fan of pop, and the Canadian is on the right of the skateboard driver, the only possible position for the skateboard driver is position 3 (C). This contradicts our initial placement of the skateboard driver in position 3 (C).

There seems to be a contradiction in the puzzle, and it's not possible to solve it with the given rules."

Lv6-6x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 15, the Russian is to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the Thai is the person who's sport is water-polo (rule 6), the Russian cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4. So, the Russian must be in position 3.

2. From rule 17, the Turkish is in an odd position. Since the Turkish cannot be in position 1, 2, or 4 (already filled by the Russian, Thai, and we know the Turkish is not the first person), the Turkish must be in position 3.

3. From rule 12, the owner of the guinea-pig is the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position 3, the guinea-pig owner must be in an odd position (rule 9). So, the owner of the hamster must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (odd positions).

4. From rule 19, the owner of the hamster is on the far right. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is the Turkish (in position 3), the owner of the hamster must be in position 5.

5. From rule 18, the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is to the right of the Thai (rule 5), the person watching family movies cannot be in position 1 (left of the Thai). So, the person watching family movies must be in position 4.

6. From rule 16, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left. Since the person watching family movies is in position 4, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in position 1.

10. From rule 13, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the Thai is the person who's sport is water-polo (in position 3) and the person who's hobby is video-games must be to the right of the person driving the subway (rule 3), the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 2 or 4.

11. From rule 8, the person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the quad-bike is between the person driving the bus and the person watching romance movies (rule 1), the person driving the bus must be in position 1, and the person watching romance movies must be in position 2 or 4. Since the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 1 (left of the Thai, who is the person watching romance movies, according to rule 5), the person watching romance movies must be in position 4.

12. From rule 2, the person driving the bus is not the Turkish. Since the Turkish is in position 3, the person driving the bus must be in position 1, 2, or 5. But the person driving the bus cannot be in position 1 (already filled by the person driving the bus), and the person driving the bus cannot be in position 5 (since the person driving the subway must be to the left of the owner of the lizard, who is on the far right, according to rule 19). So, the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

13. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is writing is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train is in position 2, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1 or 3.

14. From rule 16, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 2 or 3. But the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in position 3 (since the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1, 3, or 5, and the person who's hobby is writing cannot be in position 3, according to rule 13). So, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in position 2.

15. From rule 7, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 2 or 4, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 1.

16. From rule 18, the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is in position 4, the person watching family movies must be in position 2 or 3. But the person watching family movies cannot be in position 3 (since the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1, 3, or 5, and the person who's hobby is writing cannot be in position 3, according to rule 13). So, the person watching family movies must be in position 2.

17. From rule 11, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 1, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in position 2.

18. From rule 10, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4, the owner of the lizard must be in position 3.

19. From rule 5, the person watching romance movies is to the right of the Thai. Since the Thai is in position 3, the person watching romance movies must be in position 4.

20. From rule 16, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 2. Since the person watching drama movies is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey (rule 20), the person watching drama movies must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But the person watching drama movies cannot be in position 3 (since the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1, 3, or 5, and the person who's hobby is writing cannot be in position 3, according to rule 13). So, the person watching drama movies must be in position 1.

21. From rule 3, the person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the person driving the subway is in position 5, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 6. But the person who's hobby is video-games cannot be in position 6 (since the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games, according to rule 13). So, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 3.

22. From rule 14, the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4, the owner of the lizard must be in position 3. But we already know that the owner of the lizard is in position 3 (from rule 18). This is a contradiction, so there must be an error in the puzzle.

Final solution table (with the error):

|               |      1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |

| Transport     | bus         | quad-bike  | subway     | train      |

The error is in rule 14, which states that the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. This is not possible because the person who's sport is climbing is in position 4, and the owner of the lizard is already in position 3."
Lv6-6x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the singing person is in an even position and there are 5 people, the singing person must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the singing person is in position 2 (grapes). So, the person eating grapes is the one with the hobby of singing.

2. Now we know that the rabbit owner is the skateboard driver. Let's place the rabbit owner in position 3 (skateboard).

3. The dog owner is to the right of the musical movie watcher and to the left of the zombie movie watcher. Since the singing person (grapes) is the musical movie watcher, the dog owner cannot be in position 2 (grapes) or 4 (musical). So, the dog owner must be in position 1 (food unknown) or 5 (food unknown). Let's place the dog owner in position 5 (Transport: unknown).

4. The person watching musical movies is to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the singing person (grapes) is the musical movie watcher, the crime movie watcher cannot be in position 2 (grapes) or 4 (musical). So, the crime movie watcher must be in position 1 (food unknown) or 3 (rabbit). Let's place the crime movie watcher in position 1 (Food: unknown).

5. The crime movie watcher (position 1) is also the hiking hobbyist. Since the hiking hobbyist is to the right of the musical movie watcher (position 2), the musical movie watcher cannot be in position 1. So, the musical movie watcher must be in position 4 (Food: grapes).

6. Now we know that the person watching crime movies is the hiking hobbyist. Since the hiking hobbyist is in position 1, the hiking hobby must be in position 1 (Hobby: hiking).

7. The person eating peas is to the right of the bus driver. Since the rabbit owner (position 3) is the skateboard driver, the bus driver cannot be in position 3. So, the bus driver must be in position 2 (Food: unknown). Therefore, the person eating peas is in position 4 (Transport: bus).

8. The person watching mystery movies is to the left of the person eating orange. Since the musical movie watcher (position 4) is to the left of the person eating orange, the person eating orange cannot be in position 4. So, the person eating orange must be in position 1 (Food: unknown).

9. The fan rock is the helicopter driver. Since the fan rock is on the left or right of the person eating orange (position 1), the person eating orange cannot be in position 2 (grapes) or 3 (rabbit). So, the person eating orange must be in position 5 (Food: orange).

10. Now we know that the fan rock (helicopter driver) is in position 5. Since the fan rock is on the left or right of the fan disco, the fan disco cannot be in position 5. So, the fan disco must be in position 1 (Music-Genre: disco).

11. The fan indie is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the hiking hobbyist (position 1) is not the baker, the baker must be in position 2 (Hobby: baking). So, the fan indie must be in position 4 (Music-Genre: indie).

12. The fan r&b is somewhere to the left of the person eating orange (position 5). Since the fan disco (position 1) and the fan indie (position 4) are to the left of the person eating orange, the fan r&b must be in position 2 (Music-Genre: r&b).

13. The person eating eggplant is the person who's hobby is singing (position 2).

14. The owner of the ferret is not the fan disco (position 1). Since the fan disco (position 1) and the fan r&b (position 2) are taken, the fan r&b cannot be the ferret owner. So, the ferret owner must be in position 3 (Pet: ferret).

15. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter (position 5). Since the fan rock (helicopter driver) is in position 5, the airplane driver cannot be in position 5. So, the airplane driver must be in position 4 (Transport: airplane).

17. The skateboard driver (rabbit owner) is in position 3 (Pet: rabbit).

18. The person driving the helicopter (fan rock) is in position 5 (Transport: helicopter).

Lv6-6x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know the positions of hot-chocolate (1st), fanta (not 1st), photography (not 1st or 4th), and country (not 4th).

2. Since the fan reggae is to the right of the person drinking fanta, fanta cannot be in the 1st or 4th position. So, fanta is in the 2nd position.

3. Since the fan reggae is not the person drinking hot-chocolate (9th), and hot-chocolate is to the left of photography (3rd or 1st), the fan reggae cannot be in the 1st position. So, the fan reggae is in the 4th position.

4. Since the fan trance is to the left or right of the fan country (4th or 3rd), and the fan trance is the photographer (3rd), the fan country cannot be in the 3rd position. So, the fan country is in the 1st position.

5. Since the person eating banana is in an odd position, and fanta and reggae are in even positions, the person eating banana is in the 2nd or 4th position. But since the person eating banana is to the left of the person driving the tram (5th condition), the person eating banana is in the 4th position.

6. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person who's hobby is photography (4th or 1st), the person who's hobby is photography cannot be in the 1st position. So, the person who's hobby is photography is in the 4th position.

7. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is to the left of the person drinking fanta, and the person who's hobby is photography is to the right of the person drinking fanta, the person who's hobby is traveling is in the 1st position.

8. Since the person eating tomato is in an odd position, and the person eating banana is in the 4th position, the person eating tomato is in the 1st position.

9. Since the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball, and the person who's hobby is traveling is in the 1st position (basketball's position), the person drinking milk is in the 2nd or 4th position. But since the person eating banana is in the 4th position, the person drinking milk is in the 2nd position.

10. Since the person eating asparagus is the person who's sport is golf (11th condition), and the person who's hobby is traveling is in the 1st position, the person eating asparagus is in the 3rd position.

11. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is to the left of the person eating garlic, and the person eating asparagus is in the 3rd position, the person who's sport is water-polo is in the 1st or 2nd position. But since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the 1st position, the person who's sport is water-polo is in the 2nd position.

12. Since the person eating garlic is the person driving the bike (13th condition), and the person who's sport is water-polo is in the 2nd position, the person eating garlic is in the 2nd position.

13. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is the fan blues (20th condition), and the person who's hobby is puzzles is driving the subway (19th condition), the person who's hobby is puzzles is in the 3rd position.

14. Since the person who's sport is sailing is not given, we can't determine the position of the person eating tomato (8th condition). So, let's fill the table with what we know so far:

| Beverage      |       1       |     2     |      3      |     4     |
| Food          |               |           |             |           |
| Hobby         |               |           |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |               |           |             |           |
| Sport         |               |           |             |           |
| Transport     |               |           |             |           |

15. Since the person who's sport is golf is driving the bus (15th condition), the person who's sport is golf is in the 1st position. But this contradicts the position of the person eating asparagus (11th condition). There seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as it's currently impossible to satisfy all conditions.

Here's the table with what we could determine:

| Beverage      |       1       |     2     |      3      |     4     |
| Food          |               |           |             |           |
| Hobby         |               |           |             |           |
| Music-Genre   |               |           |             |           |
| Sport         |               |           | golf        |           |
| Transport     |               |           | bike        |           |

The puzzle seems to have a contradiction and cannot be solved as it stands."
