20. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movie fan is in the fifth position, the zombie movie fan must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position. However, the zombie movie fan cannot be in the fifth position (as the zombie movie fan is not the owner of the ferret), so the zombie movie fan must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

26. The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the climber is in the third position, the superhero movie fan must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position. However, the superhero movie fan cannot be in the fourth position (as the superhero movie fan is not the gardener), so the superhero movie fan must be in the second, third, or fifth position. However, we already filled in the second position with the fantasy movie fan and the fifth position with the satire movie fan, so the superhero movie fan must be in the third position. Let's fill in the movie-genres:

27. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the satire movie fan is in the fifth position, the zombie movie fan must be in the second, third, fourth, or fifth position. However, the zombie movie fan cannot be in the fourth position (as the zombie movie fan is not the gardener), so the zombie movie fan must be in the second, third, or fifth position. However, we already filled in the second position with the fantasy movie fan and the fifth position with the satire movie fan, so the zombie movie fan must be in the third position.

28. The person watching romance movies is between the person who's hobby is chess and the fan pop. Since the chess hobby is in the fifth position and the pop fan is in the sixth position, the romance movie fan must be in the fourth position. However, we already filled in the fourth position with the gardener, so this contradicts the given information that the gardener is in an even position. This means our solution is incorrect, and we need to reconsider our assumptions.

Let's reconsider our assumptions:

1. The owner of the bird is not the person drinking iced-tea##6
   - This still holds true.

2. the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the owner of the rabbit
   - This still holds true.

Let's rearrange the table based on the still-holding true conditions:

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions based on the conditions that we haven't used yet:

   - Since the soy-milk is in the third position, the satire movie fan must be in the fourth, fifth, or sixth position.

Lv6-6x5-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 5, we know that the bartender is the bartender, so let's place him in the first row. Since he is to the right of the person drinking tea (rule 3), the tea drinker must be in the second row. So, the tea drinker is the manager (rule 12).

2. From rule 10, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far left. Since the bartender is not the ice-hockey player (rule 22), the ice-hockey player must be in the first row. Let's place him as job 1.

3. From rule 19, the indian is to the right of the photographer. Since the indian is the parkour player (rule 4), the photographer must be in the fourth row. Let's place him as job 4.

4. From rule 18, the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the handball player cannot be the bartender (rule 27) or the scooter driver (rule 2), the handball player must be in the third row. Let's place him as job 3.

5. From rule 14, the person driving the skateboard is to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the weightlifting person is the chef (rule 26), the skateboard driver must be in the fifth row. Let's place him as job 5.

6. From rule 11, the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the egyptian. Since the egyptian is not the rat owner (rule 30), the rat owner must be in the second row. Let's place the rat owner as job 2.

7. From rule 13, the paramedic is not the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla cannot be the cat owner (rule 16), the cat owner must be in the first row. Let's place the cat owner as job 1.

8. From rule 15, the chef is the person drinking coffee. Since the coffee drinker is not the rat owner (rule 2), the coffee drinker must be in the fourth row.

9. From rule 1, the owner of the rat is to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the mouse owner is the ice-hockey player (rule 5), the rat owner must be in the second or third row. Since the rat owner is not the paramedic (rule 8), the rat owner is job 2 (since the paramedic is job 2). So, the mouse owner is job 1.

10. From rule 9, the italian is not the person drinking sprite. Since the sprite drinker is the manager (rule 12), the italian must be in the third, fourth, or fifth row. Since the italian is in the middle (rule 25), he must be job 3.

11. From rule 24, the scooter driver is to the left or right of the skateboard driver. Since the skateboard driver is job 5, the scooter driver can be either job 2 or 4. However, the scooter driver cannot be the handball player (rule 2), so the scooter driver is job 4 (since the handball player is job 3).

12. From rule 20, the cat owner is on the far left or far right. Since the cat owner is job 1 (the mouse owner), the cat owner is on the far right.

13. From rule 29, the turkish is to the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the ice-hockey player is job 1, the turkish can be either job 2 or 3. However, the turkish is not the person drinking sprite (rule 9), so the turkish is job 2 (since the sprite drinker is job 3).

14. From rule 6, the person driving the ship is the person drinking tea. Since the tea drinker is the manager (rule 12), the person driving the ship is the manager.

15. From rule 23, the person driving the trike is on the far right. Since the cat owner is on the far right (rule 12), the person driving the trike is the cat owner (job 1).

16. From rule 17, the person driving the skateboard is not the person who's sport is handball. Since we already placed the handball player as job 3, the skateboard driver is job 5.

17. From rule 28, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in an even position. Since the weightlifting person is the chef (job 3), the chef is in an even position.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-6x5-9	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign hobbies to the columns. Since we know that the person with the hobby of camping is in the middle, we can place it in column 3. Let's place the hobbies in the following order from left to right: camping, magic-tricks, puzzles, traveling, drawing.

2. Next, let's assign jobs to the rows. Since we know that the firefighter watches drama movies, we can place him in row 4 (since drama is in column 4). Let's place the jobs in the following order from top to bottom: firefighter, designer, scientist, bartender, security-guard.

3. Now, let's assign movie genres. Since the person watching comedy movies is the fan of trance, we can place comedy in row 3 (since trance is in column 3). Let's place the movie genres in the following order from top to bottom: adventure, comedy, disaster, drama, thriller.

4. Next, let's assign music genres. Since the fan of folk is in an odd position, it must be in either row 1, 3, or 5. Since the fan of country is to the right of the fan of chinchilla, and the chinchilla owner is in an odd position, the fan of chinchilla must be in row 1 or 3. Since the fan of country is not the designer (who we know is the owner of the bird), the fan of country must be in row 5. Let's place the music genres in the following order from top to bottom: country, folk, jazz, punk, trance.

5. Now, let's assign pets. Since the owner of the dog is in an odd position and not the traveler, the owner of the dog must be in row 1, 3, or 5. Since the owner of the horse is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping and to the left of the person watching comedy movies, the horse owner must be in row 1 or 2. Since the owner of the bird is the designer, the bird owner must be in row 2. Since the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the fan of country, the chinchilla owner must be in row 4 or 5. Since the owner of the snake is to the left of the person watching drama movies, the snake owner must be in row 1, 2, or 4. Let's place the pets in the following order from top to bottom: bird, dog, horse, chinchilla, snake.

6. Finally, let's assign sports. Since the person watching comedy movies is the fan of trance and is on the far left or far right, it must be in either row 1 or 5. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the bartender, the person surfing must be in row 1. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the person who's hobby is camping, the person surfing is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the owner of the dog, the person surfing is not in row 1. Therefore, the person surfing must be in row 5. Since the person watching comedy movies is not the owner of the horse, the person doing biathlon must be in row 2. Since the person doing biathlon is on the far right, the person doing weightlifting must be in row 4. Since the person doing weightlifting is to the right of the person surfing, the person doing climbing must be in row 3. Since the person doing climbing is to the left or right of the person doing ice-hockey, the person doing ice-hockey must be in row 2.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv6-6x5-10	"This is a complex logic puzzle, and it's best to approach it systematically. Let's break it down:

1. First, let's assign each category a number from 1 to 5, and let's fill in the nationalities and jobs first, as they have fewer constraints.

   - The Dutch is the freelancer (D1), so we know that the freelancer is in an even position (D2 or D4).
   - The Dutch is not in position 1, so D2 and D4 are taken. Therefore, the Dutch is in position 4 (D4).
   - The Dutch is on the left or right of the Mexican (M), so M cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. Therefore, M is in position 2 (M2).
   - The Spanish (S) is somewhere to the right of the Mexican (M2), so S cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Therefore, S is in position 5 (S5).
   - The British (B) is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing (Ski), so Ski cannot be in position 5. Therefore, Ski is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since Ski is to the left of B, Ski cannot be in position 5. If Ski were in position 2, M would be to the right of Ski, which contradicts the given information. So, Ski is in position 1 (Ski1).
   - The police-officer (P) is the person who's sport is badminton (Bdm), so P is in position 2 (P2).
   - The writer is somewhere to the right of the fan soul (So), so So cannot be in position 5. If So were in position 1, P would be to the left of So, which contradicts the given information. So, So is in position 2, 3, or 4. Since P is to the left of So, So cannot be in position 2. If So were in position 4, P would be in position 3, but P is the police-officer, and the police-officer is in position 2. So, So is in position 3 (So3).
   - The remaining nationalities are British (B) and Indian (I). Since B is already taken, I is the British (B1).

2. Now, let's fill in the sports. Since the person watching sports movies is in an odd position (4 or 5), and the police-officer (P2) is watching action movies, P2 cannot be watching sports movies. Therefore, the person watching sports movies is in position 5 (Sports5). Since Ski1 is to the left of B1, Ski1 cannot be the person watching sports movies. So, the person watching sports movies is playing rugby (Rugby5).

3. Since the person watching action movies is the fan jazz (Jazz), Jazz is in position 2 (Jazz2). Since Jazz2 is the police-officer, Jazz2 cannot be the person watching sports movies. So, the person watching action movies is not playing rugby (Rugby1, Rugby3, or Rugby4). Since Jazz2 is to the left or right of the fan indie (Indie), Indie cannot be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, Indie is in position 3 (Indie3).

4. Since the person watching action movies is not the person who's hobby is woodworking (Woodworking), Woodworking is not in position 2. Therefore, Woodworking is in position 1, 3, or 5. Since Jazz2 is to the left or right of Indie3, Woodworking cannot be in position 3. If Woodworking were in position 1, Jazz2 would be to the left of Woodworking, which contradicts the given information. So, Woodworking is in position 5 (Woodworking5).

5. Since the fan trance (Trance) is the person who's hobby is board-games (BG), BG is in position 5 (BG5). Since Trance5 is to the right of P2, Trance5 cannot be the person watching sports movies. So, the person watching action movies is not playing water-polo (WP). Therefore, WP is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since Trance5 is on the right of P2, WP cannot be in position 2. If WP were in position 4, Trance5 would be in position 3, but Trance5 is the fan of trance music, and the fan of trance music is in position 5. So, WP is in position 1 (WP1).

6. Since the person watching action movies is not the person who's hobby is board-games (BG5), BG5 cannot be watching action movies. Therefore, BG5 is watching either western (W), epic (E), or sports (Sports) movies. Since BG5 is on the left or right of the fan trance (Trance5), Trance5 cannot be watching western (W) or epic (E) movies. Therefore, BG5 is watching either western (W) or sports (Sports) movies. Since BG5 is to the left or right of the fan ambient (Amb), Amb cannot be in position 1 or 5. Therefore, Amb is in position 2, 3, or 4. Since BG5 is to the left or right of Amb, BG5 cannot be in position 2. If BG5 were in position 4, Amb would be in position 3, but Amb is the fan of ambient music, and the fan of ambient music is in position 2. So, BG5 is in position 3 (BG3). Since BG3 is watching either western (W) or sports (Sports) movies, and BG3 is not watching action movies, BG3 is watching western (W3).

7. Since the person watching action movies is the fan jazz (Jazz2), Jazz2 cannot be watching western (W) or epic (E) movies. Therefore, Jazz2 is watching either sports (Sports) or sports (Rugby5) movies. Since Jazz2 is to the left or right of the fan indie (Indie3), Indie3 cannot be watching sports (Sports) movies. Therefore, Jazz2 is watching sports (Rugby5) movies.

8. Since the person watching action movies is the fan jazz (Jazz2), Jazz2 cannot be watching epic (E) movies. Therefore, E1, E2, E3, or E4 is watching epic (E) movies. Since E is to the left or right of W, W cannot be in position 5. Therefore, W is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since Jazz2 is to the left or right of Indie3, Indie3 cannot be in position 5. Therefore, Indie3 is in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. Since W is to the left or right of Indie3, W cannot be in position 3. If W were in position 1, Indie3 would be in position 2, but Indie3 is the fan of indie music, and the fan of indie music is in position 3. If W were in position 2, Jazz2 would be in position 3, but Jazz2 is the fan of jazz music, and the fan of jazz music is in position 2. Therefore, W is in position 4 (W4). Since W4 is not watching action movies, W4 is watching either western (W4) or epic (E) movies. Since W4 is to the left or right of Indie3, Indie3 is not watching epic (E) movies. Therefore, Indie3 is watching western (W) movies (Indie3 = W2).
