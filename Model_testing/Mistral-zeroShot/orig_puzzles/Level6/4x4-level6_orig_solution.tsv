Lv6-4x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 items in each category, so we can label them A, B, C, D for each category (Beverage, Food, Music-Genre, Nationality).

2. From rule 12, the fan house (H) must be in an odd position, so it can be either A, C, or D. Let's try placing H in position A for now.

3. From rule 13, the person drinking milk (M) is the fan house, so M = H = A.

4. From rule 7, the fan disco (D) is the person drinking cola (C), so C = D. Since C is already assigned to A, D must be B, C, or D. But D can't be D because D = C, so D = B or C. Let's try D = B for now.

5. From rule 8, the person drinking cola (D) is between the Italian (I) and the person eating apple (A). So, if D = B, then B = 2 and D = 3. But this violates rule 11, as Fanta can't be on the far left or far right. So, D can't be B. Therefore, D = C.

6. Now, D = C, so C = cola. This means A = milk.

7. From rule 1, we know there are 4 different beverages, so Fanta (F) must be either A, B, or D. But A and B are already assigned, so F = D. This means Fanta is water.

8. From rule 4, the fan hip-hop (Hip) is on the left or right of the fan funk (Fun). Since Hip can't be in position A (because it's on the left or right of Fun), Hip must be in position B, C, or D. But position B is already taken by the Italian, so Hip can't be in position B. Since Hip can't be in position A (because it's on the left or right of Fun), Hip must be in position C or D. Let's try Hip = C for now.

9. From rule 9, the colombian (Co) is on the left of the fan hip-hop (C). So, Co can only be in position A or B. But position A is already taken by the Italian, so Co = B.

10. From rule 10, the japanese (J) is not the person eating asparagus (Asp). So, J can't be in position C or D. Since J can't be in position A (because it's the far left or far right, and all other positions are taken), J must be in position B.

11. From rule 6, the person eating strawberry (Str) is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (F). Since F is in position D, Str can't be in position A (because it's on the left or right of F, and all other positions are taken). So, Str = C.

12. From rule 5, the person eating corn (Corn) is somewhere to the right of the fan house (H). Since H = A, Corn can't be in position A, B, or C. So, Corn = D.

13. From rule 2, the fan house (H) is on the left of the person eating asparagus (Asp). Since H = A and Asp = D, this is satisfied.

14. From rule 3, the person drinking cola (C) is not the egyptian (Egy). Since C = D and Egy can't be in position A, B, or C (because they are all taken), Egy = D.

15. From rule 1, we know there are 4 different nationalities, so the remaining nationality must be Italian (I).

16. From rule 8, the person drinking cola (C) is between the Italian (I) and the person eating apple (A). Since C = D and A = B, this is satisfied.

Now, let's put the final solution table:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |    4     |

Lv6-4x4-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is swimming is the person eating broccoli. Let's place them in the second position (2) and the broccoli in the first row (2).

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

| Sport         | Swimming  |           |          |               |

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since we don't know the position of weightlifting yet, we can't place drawing yet.

3. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since we don't know the position of reading yet, we can't place drawing yet.

4. The person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position. Since we already have one person in an odd position (Swimming), the traveling person must be in position 3 or 4.

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the fan hip-hop. If traveling is in position 3, then the fan hip-hop must be in position 4. But this would mean that the person who's hobby is traveling is not in an odd position, which contradicts rule 4. So, the traveling person must be in position 4.

6. The person who's hobby is traveling is the person who's sport is cricket. So, cricket is in position 4 and the sport in position 4 is cricket.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

7. The fan blues is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. So, the fan blues must be in position 3.

8. The fan soul is on the far left or far right. Since we already have two people on the left, the fan soul must be in position 4.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

9. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the fan blues. So, the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

| Sport         | Swimming  |         |         |   Cricket     |

10. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the fan punk. Since we already have three people on the left, the person who's hobby is reading must be in position 4.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

11. The person eating cherry is in an odd position. Since we already have three people in even positions, the person eating cherry must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

12. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the fan punk. Since the fan punk is not yet placed, we can't place reading yet.

13. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the fan blues. Since drawing is already placed, the fan blues must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

| Sport         | Swimming  |         |   Cricket|   Cricket     |

14. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the fan punk. Since the fan punk is not yet placed, we can't place reading yet.

Since we have reached a point where we can't place any more people or items based on the given rules, the table is as follows:

|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |       4       |

| Sport         | Swimming  |         |   Cricket|   Cricket     |

However, the rules don't provide enough information to place the fan punk and the hobby of the person in position 2. The table is incomplete.

Lv6-4x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 different items in each category, so we can fill in the categories with the given options.

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

2. From rule 11, we know that the person watching disaster movies is in an odd position. Since there are 4 items, the positions are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. Disaster movies can only be in position 1 or 3 (odd numbers). Since the fan blues is to the left of the person watching disaster movies (rule 5), the only possible position for disaster movies is position 1. So, the first row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

3. From rule 2, the person who's hobby is drawing is between the person watching fantasy movies and the fan pop. Since the person watching fantasy movies is in position 2 (from the previous step), and the fan pop is in position 4, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 3. So, the second row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

4. From rule 3, the person watching spy movies is the person drinking mirinda. So, the third row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

5. From rule 4, the person who's hobby is drawing is not the person drinking milk. Since we already know that the person who's hobby is drawing is drinking mirinda, the person drinking milk must be in position 2. So, the second row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

6. From rule 8, the fan electronic is between the person drinking milk and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we know the positions of the person drinking milk and the person who's hobby is drawing, the fan electronic must be in position 3. So, the second row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

7. From rule 12, the person drinking sprite is the person who's hobby is drawing. But we already know that the person who's hobby is drawing is drinking mirinda. There seems to be a contradiction here, so there might be an error in the puzzle.

However, if we assume that the person drinking sprite is the person who's hobby is baking (since they are both in position 2), the second row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | baking        | time-travel   | pop          |

8. From rule 10, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we know the position of the person who's hobby is camping (position 2), the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 3 or 4. But position 4 is already taken by the person who's hobby is photography, so the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 3. So, the second row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

9. From rule 13, the person watching fantasy movies is the fan electronic. But we already know that the fan electronic is in position 3. So, the first row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

10. From rule 6, the person who's hobby is drawing is not the person watching time-travel movies. But we already know that the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 3 (mirinda). So, the person watching time-travel movies must be in position 4. So, the fourth row becomes:

| Beverage      | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Music-Genre   |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------------|
| lemonade     | baking        | disaster      | blues        |
| milk         | camping       | fantasy       | electronic   |
| mirinda      | drawing       | spy           | jazz         |
| sprite       | photography   | time-travel   | pop          |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-4x4-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Turkish cannot be in the 6th position (rule 8), they can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. Let's assume the Turkish is in position 1 (we'll check other possibilities later).

2. The guinea-pig owner is to the left or right of the rabbit owner (rule 2). Since the Turkish is in position 1, the guinea-pig cannot be in position 1 or 2 (as the rabbit must be to the right of the guinea-pig). So, the guinea-pig can be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's assume the guinea-pig is in position 3.

3. The person driving the bike is to the right of the guinea-pig owner (rule 3). So, the bike owner can be in positions 4 or 5.

4. The person driving the ship is to the right of the person driving the bike (rule 11). So, the ship owner can be in positions 5 or 6.

5. The person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person drinking fanta (rule 10). Since the Turkish is drinking fanta (assumption), the skateboard owner can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

6. The person drinking water is to the left of the person driving the ship (rule 5). Since the ship owner can be in positions 5 or 6, the water drinker can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

7. The person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking fanta (rule 7). Since the Turkish is drinking fanta (assumption), the soy-milk drinker can be in positions 1 or 2.

8. The chinese is on the far right (rule 9). Since the Turkish is in position 1, the chinese cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the chinese can be in position 4 or 5.

9. The indonesian is to the left of the guinea-pig owner (rule 12). Since the guinea-pig is in position 3, the indonesian can be in positions 1, 2, or 4.

10. The owner of the pony is to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 14). Since the Turkish is in position 1, the pony owner cannot be in position 1. So, the pony owner can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

11. The person drinking fanta is to the right of the person driving the skateboard (rule 10). Since the skateboard owner can be in positions 2, 4, or 6, the fanta drinker cannot be in positions 2, 4, or 6. So, the fanta drinker can be in position 1 or 3. But we already have the Turkish in position 1 drinking fanta, so the fanta drinker must be in position 3.

12. Now we know the fanta drinker is in position 3, the Turkish is in position 1, and the guinea-pig is in position 3. This means the rabbit must be in position 2.

13. The person driving the bike is to the right of the guinea-pig owner (rule 3), so the bike owner must be in position 4.

14. The person driving the ship is to the right of the person driving the bike (rule 11), so the ship owner must be in position 5.

15. The person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person drinking fanta (rule 10), so the skateboard owner must be in position 6.

16. The person drinking water is to the left of the person driving the ship (rule 5), so the water drinker must be in position 1.

17. The person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking fanta (rule 7), so the soy-milk drinker must be in position 2.

18. The chinese is not the person driving the bike (rule 13), so the chinese must be in position 4.

19. The indonesian is to the left of the guinea-pig owner (rule 12), so the indonesian must be in position 1.

20. The owner of the pony is to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish (rule 14), but we already know the positions of the guinea-pig, rabbit, and pony. The only possible position for the pony is position 5.

21. The owner of the goldfish is not the Turkish (rule 1), so the goldfish owner can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. But since the positions of the guinea-pig, rabbit, pony, and chinese are already determined, the only possible position for the goldfish is position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage      | almond-milk | fanta       | soy-milk   | water     |
| Nationality   | indonesian  | turkish    | chinese    | colombian |

Lv6-4x4-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating strawberry is on the far left or far right, and the person drinking cola is on the far left, the person eating strawberry cannot be on the far left. So, the person eating strawberry must be on the far right.

2. The person drinking fanta is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the person drinking cola is on the far left and the person eating strawberry is on the far right, the person driving the subway must be in the middle.

3. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the person driving the subway is in the middle, the person driving the airplane must be on the far right.

4. The german is not the person eating strawberry, so the German must be either on the far left or the far right. Since the person driving the airplane is on the far right, the German cannot be on the far right. So, the German must be on the far left.

5. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person driving the airplane is on the far right, the person driving the scooter cannot be on the far right. So, the person driving the scooter must be on the far left, and the person drinking lemonade must be in the middle.

6. The turkish is between the person drinking fanta (who is the Dutch) and the brazilian. Since the Dutch is in the middle and the brazilian cannot be on the far left (because the German is there), the brazilian must be on the far right. So, the Turkish is in the middle.

7. The person eating lime is on the left of the person drinking fanta (who is the Dutch in the middle). So, the person eating lime is on the far left.

8. The person eating radish is not the brazilian, so the person eating radish must be on the far right.

Final solution table:

2. From rule 5, we know that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the taxi is already in the fourth position, the snowmobile must be in the third position.

4. From rule 2, we know that the fan of blues is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the turtle (and thus blues) is already placed, the snowmobile can't be in the first position. So, it must be in the third position.

   | Music-Genre | Pet | Sport | Transport |

6. From rule 8, we know that the owner of the horse is not the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since snowboarding is in the first position, the horse can't be in the first row.

7. From rule 9, we know that the owner of the hamster is the person driving the scooter. Let's place scooter in the fourth position.

   | hamster   |     |           | scooter |

8. From rule 5, we know that the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi is in the fourth position and the hamster is already placed, the taxi can't be in the third position. So, it must be in the second position.

10. From rule 11, we know that the fan of country is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is the fan of soccer (from rule 10), let's place country in the second position.

12. From rule 12, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the taxi is already placed, soccer can't be in the first position. So, it must be in the second position.

Lv6-4x4-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, and nationalities. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 4 for each category.

2. From rule 13 and 14, we know that the person with hobby 4 (photography) is on the far right and the french is also on the far right. So, hobby 4 = French.

3. From rule 11, we know that the fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of disco. Since hobby 4 is on the far right, hobby 1 (let's say it's filmmaking) must be the fan of disco because it can't be on the far right. So, hobby 1 = Disco.

4. From rule 4, we know that the fan of hip-hop is the person who's hobby is woodworking. So, hobby 3 = Hip-hop.

5. From rule 8, we know that the fan of techno is the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, hobby 2 = Techno.

6. From rule 7, we know that the chinese watches satire movies. Since the martial-arts and family movies are left or right of each other (rule 9), and the martial-arts movies can't be on the far left or far right (rule 10), the chinese must watch martial-arts movies. So, hobby 4 = Martial-arts.

7. Now we know that hobby 1 = Disco, hobby 2 = Techno, hobby 3 = Hip-hop, and hobby 4 = Martial-arts. The only hobby left is skydiving, so hobby 2 = Skydiving.

8. From rule 2, we know that the dutch is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since we know that hobby 1 = Disco and the dutch can't be on the far right (rule 14), the dutch must be on the left of hobby 1. So, nationality 2 = Dutch.

9. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the chinese. Since we know that hobby 3 = Hip-hop and the chinese watches martial-arts (hobby 4), the person who's hobby is woodworking (hobby 3) must be on the left of the chinese (nationality 3). So, nationality 1 = Chinese.

10. From rule 5, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since we know that hobby 1 = Disco and hobby 4 = Photography, the person who's hobby is filmmaking (hobby 1) must be on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (hobby 4). So, nationality 4 = French (since we know hobby 4 = Photography and the french is on the far right).

11. Now we know that nationality 1 = Chinese, nationality 2 = Dutch, nationality 3 = Hip-hop (woodworking), and nationality 4 = French (photography). The only nationality left is german. So, nationality 3 = German.

12. From rule 6, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan of techno. Since we know that hobby 3 = Hip-hop and hobby 2 = Techno (skydiving), the fan of hip-hop must be on the left of the fan of techno. So, music-genre 1 = Jazz.

13. From rule 15, we know that the fan of techno is not the chinese. Since we know that hobby 2 = Techno and nationality 3 = German, music-genre 2 = Sports (since it's the only genre left).

14. From rule 1, we know that there are 4 different movie-genres. Since we know that the chinese watches martial-arts (hobby 4), the dutch watches sports (music-genre 2), and the french watches family movies (since it's on the far right and the other genres are left or right of each other), the remaining genre must be satire. So, movie-genre 3 = Satire.

15. From rule 3, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the chinese. Since we know that hobby 3 = Hip-hop and nationality 3 = German, movie-genre 1 = Family (since it's the only genre left).

Lv6-4x4-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 people, so we can fill in the table with 4 different symbols (e.g., A, B, C, D) to represent the people.

2. Since there are 4 different types of food, we can assign each food to one of the people. Let's assign them as follows:
   - Person A eats corn
   - Person B eats eggplant
   - Person C eats lettuce
   - Person D eats pear

3. Now let's assign the movie-genres. Since there are 4 different genres, we can assign them as follows:
   - Person A watches action movies
   - Person B watches time-travel movies
   - Person C watches musical movies (from clue 6)
   - Person D's genre is yet to be determined

4. Now let's assign the nationalities. Since we know the position of the Thai and the Malaysian, we can assign them as follows:
   - Person A is Thai (from clue 1)
   - Person B is Malaysian (from clue 7)
   - Person C's nationality is yet to be determined
   - Person D's nationality is yet to be determined

5. Let's assign the sports. From clues 2, 3, 4, and 11, we know that:
   - Person B (Malaysian) does not do snowboarding (from clue 3)
   - Person B's sport is on the left of Person A's sport (from clue 2)
   - Person A (Thai) does snowboarding (from clue 11)
   - Person C does not do snowboarding (from clue 3)
   - Person D does not do climbing (from clue 5)
   - Person D does not do sailing (from clue 2)
   - Person D does not do weightlifting (from clue 9)
   - Person A (Thai) does snowboarding

   Since there are only 3 sports left (climbing, sailing, and weightlifting), Person C must do climbing (from clue 9, since Person A does snowboarding and is on the left or right of the person watching action movies).

6. Now we know that Person A (Thai) is on the right of Person C (climbing), so Person B (Malaysian) must be on the left of Person C (climbing).

7. Person D cannot do any of the sports we've assigned, so let's assign them sailing (since it's the only sport left). This means Person D is on the left of Person B (Malaysian) and on the right of Person A (Thai).

8. Now we know that Person C (climbing) is on the left of Person A (Thai), so Person D (sailing) must be on the right of Person C (climbing).

9. Since Person D (sailing) is on an even position (from clue 12), Person C (climbing) must be in an odd position. This means Person A (Thai) is in position 1 and Person B (Malaysian) is in position 2.

10. Now we know that Person A (Thai) is in position 1 and does snowboarding, so Person C (climbing) must be in position 3. This means Person D (sailing) is in position 4.

11. Since Person D (sailing) is in position 4, Person B (Malaysian) must be in position 2.

12. Now we know that Person B (Malaysian) does not do snowboarding, so Person C cannot do musical movies (from clue 6). This means Person C (climbing) must do action movies (since there's only one genre left).

13. Since Person C (climbing) does action movies and is on the left or right of Person A (Thai), Person A (Thai) cannot do action movies (from clue 9). This means Person D (sailing) must do action movies (since there's only one genre left for them).

14. Now we know that Person D (sailing) does action movies, so Person C (climbing) must do musical movies.

15. Since Person C (climbing) does musical movies and is on the left of Person A (Thai), Person A (Thai) must do time-travel movies (since there's only one genre left for them).

16. Finally, since Person A (Thai) does time-travel movies and is in position 1, Person B (Malaysian) must do weightlifting (since there's only one sport left for them).

The final solution table is:

Lv6-4x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 4 beverages, 4 music-genres, 4 nationalities, and 4 pets. So, each row and each column should have one unique item.

2. From rule 4, the person drinking milk is in an odd position. Since there are 4 items, the positions are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. So, milk must be in position 1, 3, or 5 (odd numbers).

3. From rule 8, the argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the nationalities are unique, the argentine cannot be in position 1 or 4. So, the argentine must be in position 3 or 5.

4. From rule 6, the argentine is on the right of the egyptian. Since the nationalities are unique, the egyptian cannot be in position 3 or 5. So, the egyptian must be in position 1 or 2.

5. From rule 11, the person drinking fanta is not the owner of the rabbit. Since the pets are unique, the fanta drinker cannot be in position 4 (where the rabbit is). So, the fanta drinker must be in position 1, 2, or 3.

6. From rule 5, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the fan ambient. Since the music-genres are unique, the fan ambient cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the fan ambient must be in position 2.

7. From rule 10, the fan r&b is on the left or right of the indonesian. Since the indonesian cannot be in position 1 (rule 9), the fan r&b cannot be in position 2 (because the fan ambient is there). So, the fan r&b must be in position 3 or 4.

8. From rule 7, the fan r&b is not the person drinking milk. Since the milk drinker is in position 1, 3, or 5, and the fan r&b is in position 3 or 4, the fan r&b cannot be in position 3. So, the fan r&b must be in position 4.

9. From rule 2, the egyptian is the fan folk. Since the nationalities are unique, the folk fan cannot be in position 1 or 5. So, the folk fan must be in position 2.

10. From rule 6, the argentine is on the right of the egyptian. Since the nationalities are unique, the argentine cannot be in position 1. So, the argentine must be in position 5.

11. From rule 3, the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the fan folk. Since the music-genres are unique, the fan folk cannot be in position 5. So, the fan folk must be in position 1 or 2. Since the argentine is in position 5, the bird owner must be in position 4.

12. From rule 1, the person drinking tea is the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the beverages are unique, the tea drinker cannot be in position 1, 2, or 5. So, the tea drinker must be in position 3.

13. From rule 9, the indonesian is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the nationalities are unique, the indonesian cannot be in position 5. So, the indonesian must be in position 1 or 2. Since the fan folk is in position 1, the indonesian must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |     4     |

| Nationality   | indonesian| argentine | ##########| egyptian |
| Pet           | bird      | ##########| ##########| guinea-pig|

We still have some empty spots, but we can't determine the exact beverage, music-genre, and pet for positions 2 and 3 (milk, ambient, and bird) because we don't have enough information to uniquely determine them. However, we know their nationality and the position of the fan r&b (position 4).

So, the final solution table is:

1. We know that there are 4 jobs, 4 music-genres, 4 pets, and 4 sports. So, each row and each column will have one unique element.

2. From rule 1, we know that the librarian is not in the first position (as the baseball fan is on the far left). So, the librarian can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

3. The scientist is the owner of the dog (rule 3), so the dog must be in a position where the scientist is. Since the scientist can't be in the first position (rule 5), the dog can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5.

4. The owner of the dog is on the left of the doctor (rule 4), so the doctor can't be in positions 2, 3, or 5. So, the doctor must be in position 1.

5. Now we know the doctor is in position 1, so the sports, music-genres, pets, and jobs for position 1 are determined.

6. The owner of the dog is not the person who's sport is soccer (rule 10), so the soccer player can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. So, the soccer player must be in position 5.

7. The fan r&b is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat (rule 6), so the goat can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the goat must be in position 4.

8. The fan r&b is in an odd position (rule 11), so it can't be in position 4 (as the goat is there). So, the fan r&b must be in position 3.

9. The mechanic is the fan soul (rule 8), so the mechanic can't be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (as the jobs, sports, pets, and music-genres for these positions are determined). So, the mechanic must be in position 3.

10. The fan country is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog (rule 9), so the hedgehog can't be in positions 1, 2, or 3. So, the hedgehog must be in position 4.

12. The person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the fan techno (rule 7), and the fan techno can't be in position 1 (as the jobs, sports, pets, and music-genres for this position are determined). So, the fan techno must be in position 2.

13. The only sport left is baseball. As it can't be in position 1 (rule 5), it must be in position 5.

So, the final solution table is:

|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |     4      |
| Job           | doctor   | mechanic | librarian| scientist  |
| Music-Genre   | country  | soul     | r&b      | techno     |
| Pet           | dog      | goat     | hedgehog | goldfish   |
| Sport         | baseball | lacrosse | soccer   | ice-hockey |
