Lv6-2x4-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is handball. Let's place baseball in the first or second position. If we place baseball in the first position, it leaves handball in the fourth position. However, this would mean that baseball is not on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball, which contradicts the third condition. So, baseball must be in the second position.

2. The person drinking lemonade is not the person who's sport is baseball. So, lemonade cannot be in the second position (since baseball is there). Therefore, lemonade must be in the first, third, or fourth position.

3. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since baseball is in the second position, volleyball must be in the third or fourth position.

4. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since handball is in the fourth position, mirinda must be in the second, third, or fourth position.

5. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since baseball is in the second position, juice must be in the third or fourth position.

6. The person who's sport is baseball is not the person drinking mirinda. Since baseball is in the second position, mirinda cannot be in the second position.

From conditions 1 and 3, we know that handball cannot be in the first position. So, handball must be in the fourth position.

From conditions 2 and 6, we know that lemonade cannot be in the second position (since baseball is there) and cannot be in the fourth position (since mirinda is there). So, lemonade must be in the third position.

From conditions 4 and 5, we know that mirinda cannot be in the fourth position (since handball is there) and cannot be in the first position (since juice is on the right of baseball). So, mirinda must be in the second position.

Finally, since baseball is in the second position, juice must be in the third position.

The final solution table is:

   | Food       |       |            |          |           |

2. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda, so milk cannot be in row 4. Let's place it in row 3 for now.

Lv6-2x4-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the coach is not the person drinking water, the coach must be drinking one of the other three beverages. Let's assume the coach is drinking fanta (we'll check this later).

2. The doctor is not the person drinking sprite, so the doctor must be drinking one of the other four beverages.

3. The electrician is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. If the coach is drinking fanta, then the electrician cannot be on the left of the coach (since the coach is on the far left or far right). So, the electrician must be on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

4. The doctor is the person drinking fanta. So, the doctor must be in the position where the coach was initially assumed to be (drinking fanta).

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the first or second position. Since the doctor is in the fourth position, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the first position. So, hot-chocolate is in position 1.

6. The person drinking fanta is in an odd position. Since the doctor is in the fourth position (an even position), the coach (initially assumed to be drinking fanta) must be in the third position. So, fanta is in position 3.

7. The electrician is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 1). So, the electrician is in position 2.

8. The person drinking water is not the coach. Since the coach is in position 3, water must be in one of the remaining positions (either 2 or 4).

9. The police-officer is somewhere to the right of the electrician (position 2). So, the police-officer can only be in position 4.

10. The coach is on the far left or far right. Since the electrician is in position 2 and the police-officer is in position 4, the coach must be in position 1.

11. The last position (position 4) is occupied by the police-officer. So, sprite must be in position 2 (since it's the only beverage left).

   |     |   |   |   |   |
   |     | G | S | H | T | (G = Guinea-pig, S = Snake, H = Hedgehog, T = Other pet)

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is to the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the snake owner is on the right, the guinea-pig owner must be in column 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the guinea-pig owner in column 2.

   |-----|---|---|---|---|
   |     | G | S | H | T |

   |-----|---|---|---|---|
   |     | T | S | H | G |
   |     | Q |   | B |   | (B = Quad-bike)

5. The person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the subway. Since the quad-bike driver is in column 3, the train driver must be in column 4.

   | Transport   |          |        |     |    |

2. The person drinking milk is to the left of the person driving the car. Since the person drinking milk is already in the second position, the person driving the car must be in the first position. So, the first person is driving a car.

   | Beverage    | 7up      | Milk    |     |    |
   |------------|----------|--------|-----|----|
   | Transport   | Car      |        |     |    |

3. The person drinking milk is also to the left of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the car is in the first position, the person driving the boat must be in the second position. So, the second person is driving a boat.

   | Beverage    | 7up      | Milk    | Boat |    |
   |------------|----------|--------|------|----|
   | Transport   | Car      |        |      |    |

4. The person drinking fanta is not the person driving the snowmobile. Since we have filled all the transport positions, the person driving the snowmobile must be in one of the beverage positions. Let's place the person driving the snowmobile in the third position (as it's the only empty beverage position). So, the third person is drinking fanta and driving a snowmobile.

   | Beverage    | 7up      | Milk    | Fanta |    |
   |------------|----------|--------|------|----|
   | Transport   | Car      |        | Snow |    |

5. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is in the third position, the person drinking iced-tea must be in the second position. So, the second person is drinking iced-tea.

   | Beverage    | 7up      | Iced-tea| Fanta |    |
   |------------|----------|---------|------|----|
   | Transport   | Car      |         | Snow |    |

6. The person driving the bike is not the person drinking 7up. Since we have filled all the beverage positions, the person driving the bike must be in one of the transport positions. Let's place the person driving the bike in the first position (as it's the only empty transport position). So, the first person is driving a bike.

   |------------|----------|---------|------|----|
   | Transport   | Bike     |         | Snow | Car|

7. The person driving the car is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the bike is in the first position, the person driving the car must be in the last position. So, the fourth person is driving a car.

1. Since the Australian is on the far right, we can place them in the last column (Column 4). Let's assume the Australian is watching Disaster movies (D).

2. Since the Australian is to the right of the person watching Disaster movies, the Disaster movies can only be in Columns 1, 2, or 3. Let's try placing Disaster movies in Column 1.

3. Now, the person watching Disaster movies is to the left of the Australian. This means the Colombian cannot be watching Disaster movies (D) because of rule 6. So, the Colombian cannot be in Column 1.

4. Since the Colombian is to the right of the Polish (rule 4), the Polish cannot be in Column 4. So, the Polish cannot be watching Disaster movies (D) in Column 1.

5. Now, the only option left for the Polish in Column 1 is Mystery (M). So, the Polish is watching Mystery movies.

6. Since the person watching Mystery movies is to the left of the Polish, the Indian cannot be watching Mystery movies (M).

7. Now, the only option left for the Indian in Column 1 is Spy (S). So, the Indian is watching Spy movies.

8. Since the person watching Spy movies is to the left of the Australian (rule 6), the Australian cannot be in Column 2.

9. Since the person watching Spy movies is also to the left of the person watching Disaster movies (rule 7), the Disaster movies cannot be in Column 3.

10. Now, the only option left for the Disaster movies is Column 2. So, the person watching Disaster movies is the Colombian (C).

11. Since the Colombian is to the right of the Polish (rule 4), the Polish cannot be in Column 2. So, the Polish must be in Column 3, watching Thriller (T).

1. We know that the genres are arranged in a row, so we can use the information about the position of the genres to eliminate possible arrangements.

2. From point 1, we know that gospel is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column with 'Gospel'.

3. From point 6, we know that the person watching spy movies is the fan of country music, so we can fill in the second row, second column with 'Country'. This means the second row, first column must be 'Spy'.

4. From point 3, we know that the person watching documentary movies is the fan of d&b, so the third row, first column must be 'Documentary' and the third row, second column must be 'D&B'.

5. From point 1, we know that gospel is on the left or right of country. Since gospel is already in the first column, country must be in the second column. So, the fourth row, second column is 'Country'.

6. From point 4, we know that the fan of reggae is to the left or right of the fan of country. Since country is in the second column, reggae can only be in the first or third column. But from point 5, we know that gospel is in the first column, so reggae must be in the third column. So, the fourth row, first column is 'Reggae'.

7. From point 7, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the fan of country. Since country is in the second column, zombie can only be in the first column. But from point 5, we know that gospel is in the first column, so zombie must be in the third column. So, the first row, third column is 'Zombie'.

8. The only genre left for the first row is 'Time-Travel'. So, the first row, first column is 'Time-Travel'.

The final solution table is:

```

| Time-Travel | Gospel  | Spy     | Documentary |
| Music-Genre |        |         |             |

7. From point 7, the person drinking tea cannot be in position 1 because the person drinking soy-milk must be to their right. So, the person drinking tea can only be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

8. From point 8, the person drinking milk cannot be the social-worker. Since the social-worker is in position 2 or 4, the person drinking milk cannot be in position 2. So, the person drinking milk can only be in position 4.

9. Now we know the person drinking milk is in position 4, so the journalist cannot be in position 4 either (from point 4). The journalist must be in position 2 or 3. But from point 5, the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in position 2. So, the journalist must be in position 3.

10. Now we know the journalist is in position 3, so the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.

11. From point 6, the coach cannot be in position 1. So, the coach must be in position 2.

12. From point 2, we know the social-worker is not in position 4. So, the social-worker must be in position 1.

13. From point 7, the person drinking tea must be in position 1, 2, or 4. But from points 2 and 12, the social-worker is in position 1 and the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2. So, the person drinking tea must be in position 4.

So, the final solution table is:

|            |   1   |     2      |       3       |      4       |

Lv6-2x4-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the bartender is in an odd position and there are 4 positions, the bartender must be in position 1, 3, or 5.
2. The person driving the helicopter is not the teacher, so the helicopter cannot be in position 1 (as it would be the first job, which is the bartender). So, the helicopter can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
3. The person driving the airplane is to the right of the lawyer. Since the subway is the lawyer, the airplane cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the lawyer). So, the airplane can be in positions 2, 3, or 4.
4. The person driving the subway (the lawyer) is in an even position, so the lawyer is in position 2 or 4.
5. The person driving the subway (the lawyer) is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. This means the skateboard cannot be in position 2 (as it would be to the left of the lawyer). So, the skateboard can be in positions 1, 3, or 4.
6. The person driving the subway (the lawyer) is the lawyer. So, the lawyer is in position 2 or 4.
7. The bartender is not the person driving the subway (the lawyer). Since the lawyer is in position 2 or 4, the bartender cannot be in position 2. So, the bartender is in position 1, 3, or 5.
8. The fisherman is somewhere to the right of the teacher. Since the teacher can only be in position 4 (as the subway is the teacher), the fisherman can be in positions 3 or 4.

Now, let's put the jobs and transports in the table:

|             |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Job         |            |        |            |           |
| Transport   |            |        |            |           |

Given the information, the only possible arrangement is:

|             |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Job         | bartender | subway | fisherman  | teacher   |
| Transport   | skateboard| helicopter| airplane | subway   |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x4-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 4 pets and 4 sports, so each row and each column will have one unique element.

2. From rule 7, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is in an even position. Since the first position is 1 and the last position is 4, weightlifting must be in position 2 or 4. But since rule 1 states that the person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the ferret and rule 8 states that the owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf, the person who's sport is weightlifting cannot be in position 4 (because position 4 is the owner of the hedgehog). So, the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 2.

3. Now we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is in position 2. From rule 4, we know that the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. So, the owner of the rabbit is in position 3 or 4. But since the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish (rule 2), the owner of the rabbit cannot be in position 4. So, the owner of the rabbit is in position 3.

4. Now we know that the owner of the rabbit is in position 3 and the owner of the weightlifting is in position 2. From rule 2, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. So, the owner of the fish is in position 1 or 2. But since the person who's sport is surfing is not the owner of the fish (rule 6), the owner of the fish cannot be in position 2. So, the owner of the fish is in position 1.

5. Now we know that the owner of the fish is in position 1, the owner of the rabbit is in position 3, and the owner of the weightlifting is in position 2. From rule 1, we know that the person who's sport is golf is not the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf (rule 8), the owner of the ferret must be in position 4.

6. Now we know that the owner of the ferret is in position 4, the owner of the fish is in position 1, the owner of the rabbit is in position 3, and the owner of the weightlifting is in position 2. Since there are only 4 pets and 4 sports, the remaining sport must be surfing. So, the person who's sport is surfing is in position 3 (because the owner of the rabbit is already in position 3).

So, the final solution table is:

  |         |    1     |       2       |    3    |    4     |
  | Pet     | fish     | weightlifting | rabbit  | ferret   |
  | Sport   | golf     | surfing      | swimming | swimming  |
