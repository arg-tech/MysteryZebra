Lv6-7x3-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and 6 categories (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport). Each person has one favorite beverage, food, hobby, job, nationality, pet, and sport.

2. Let's start with the positions of the people based on the given clues:

   - The owner of the bird is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's sport is water-polo. Let's place the bird owner (B) in position 2. Since the bird owner's hobby is fishing (F), the person to the left of B must have a hobby of fishing as well (F1). The person to the right of B must have a sport of water-polo (WP).

   - The pakistani (P) is between the australian (A) and the person who's hobby is fishing. Since B is already in position 2, P must be in position 1. A must be in position 3.

   - The person who's hobby is hiking (H) is not the owner of the mouse (M). So, H cannot be in position 6 (since M is eating artichoke). H cannot be in position 1 (since P is there). H cannot be in position 3 (since A is there). H cannot be in position 5 (since N is there). So, H must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But H cannot be in position 6 (since M is there). So, H must be in position 4.

   - The person drinking iced-tea (IT) is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini (Z). Since P is in position 1 and H is in position 4, IT cannot be in position 1 or 4. IT cannot be in position 3 (since A is there). So, IT must be in position 2 or 5. But IT cannot be in position 2 (since B is there). So, IT must be in position 5.

   - The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since IT is in position 5, IT must be in the far right.

   - The owner of the mouse (M) is the person eating artichoke (A). So, M is in position 3.

   - The person eating zucchini (Z) is somewhere to the right of the nigerian (N). Since N is in position 1 and H is in position 4, Z must be in position 2, 4, or 6. But Z cannot be in position 6 (since M is there). So, Z must be in position 2 or 4. But Z cannot be in position 2 (since IT is there). So, Z must be in position 4.

   - The coach (C) is somewhere to the left of the scientist (S). Since P is in position 1, C cannot be in position 1 or 2. C cannot be in position 3 (since M is there). C cannot be in position 4 (since Z is there). So, C must be in position 5. S must be in position 6.

   - The person who's sport is climbing (C) is on the right of the software-developer (SD). Since S is in position 6, SD must be in position 5.

   - The person drinking milk (MK) is in an even position. Since IT is in position 5 (odd), MK must be in position 2 or 4. But MK cannot be in position 2 (since B is there). So, MK must be in position 4.

   - The person who's hobby is writing (W) is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda (MR). Since IT is in position 5, W cannot be in position 5. W cannot be in position 1 (since P is there). W cannot be in position 3 (since M is there). So, W must be in position 2.

   - The person eating nectarine (N) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing (C). Since C is in position 5 and SD is to the left of C, N must be in position 6.

   - The person drinking mirinda (MR) is somewhere to the right of W. Since W is in position 2, MR must be in position 3, 4, or 6. But MR cannot be in position 6 (since N is there). So, MR must be in position 3 or 4. But MR cannot be in position 3 (since B is there). So, MR must be in position 4.

   - Now we have filled all the positions. Here is the final solution table:

   ```
   |               |         1          |     2     |     3      |
   | Beverage      |                    |           |            |
   | Food          |                    |           |            |
   | Hobby         |                    |           |            |
   | Job           |                    |           |            |
   | Nationality   |         Australian   |   Pakistani|   Nigerian |
   | Pet           |                    |     Bird  |      Mouse |
   | Sport         |         Water-polo  |    Climbing|   Lacrosse |
   ```

   The table shows the final positions of the people based on the given clues. The actual names or identities of the people are not provided in the puzzle."
Lv6-7x3-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that the hamster owner is on the skateboard, so let's place the hamster owner in the third row and first column (1,3). Since the transport options are unique, the skateboard must be in the third row.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is not the person eating mango, so the mango eater cannot be in the first column (1). Also, the mango eater cannot be in the third row (3) because the hamster owner is there. So, the mango eater must be in the second row.

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person driving the ship, so the ice-hockey player must be in the first column (1) and third row (3) because the skateboard is taken.

4. The social-worker is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person driving the subway. Since we know the hamster owner (board-games) and the ice-hockey player (subway) are in the first and third rows, the social-worker must be in the second row.

5. The social-worker is not the baker, so the baker must be in the first row or the third row. Since the first row is occupied by the ice-hockey player and the third row by the hamster owner, the baker must be in the second row.

6. The lawyer is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since the ice-hockey player (jazz fan) is in the first column (1), the lawyer must be in the first row.

7. The software-developer is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul. Since the social-worker is in the second row, the software-developer must be in the third row.

8. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games, so the hamster owner must be in the second column (2).

9. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the hamster owner is in the second column (2), the snowboarder must be in the third column (3).

10. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in the middle row (2).

11. The person eating cranberry is the person who's hobby is board-games, so the cranberry eater must be in the second row (2).

12. The social-worker is on the left of the person eating cranberry, so the social-worker must be in the first column (1).

13. The only remaining options for the food, hobby, job, music-genre, pet, sport, and transport are:

    Food: grapes, mango
    Hobby: chess
    Job: lawyer, social-worker, software-developer
    Music-Genre: dubstep, jazz, soul
    Pet: goat, hamster, rat
    Sport: ice-hockey, snowboarding, water-polo
    Transport: ship, skateboard, subway

    We can fill in the table as follows:

    |               |     1      |       2       |         3          |
    | Food          | lawyer    | cranberry    | hamster           |
    | Hobby         | social-worker| board-games  | chess            |
    | Job           | lawyer    | social-worker| software-developer|
    | Music-Genre   | jazz      | dubstep      | soul             |
    | Pet           | goat      | rat          | hamster          |
    | Sport         | ice-hockey| snowboarding | water-polo       |
    | Transport     | ship      | skateboard   | subway           |

    However, this table violates the condition that each row should have a unique food, hobby, job, music-genre, pet, sport, and transport. So, we need to rearrange the table.

    Let's swap the lawyer and social-worker in the first row and first column, and swap the lawyer and software-developer in the first row and third column.

    |               |     1      |       2       |         3          |
    | Food          | social-worker| cranberry    | hamster           |
    | Hobby         | lawyer     | board-games  | chess            |
    | Job           | social-worker| lawyer       | software-developer|
    | Music-Genre   | jazz      | dubstep      | soul             |
    | Pet           | goat      | rat          | hamster          |
    | Sport         | ice-hockey| snowboarding | water-polo       |
    | Transport     | ship      | skateboard   | subway           |

    Now, the table satisfies all the conditions.

    So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-7x3-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 people and each has a unique hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, and pet. Also, they use a unique means of transport. Let's assign them numbers from 1 to 6.

2. From the given clues, we can start by placing the Thai (#3) and Mexican (#5) in odd positions. Since the Thai is not on the far left (#14), the Mexican must be in position 1. So, Mexican = 1, Thai = 3 (or 5).

3. The person with the hobby of board-games (#1) is on the far left (#14), so board-games = 1.

4. The owner of the ferret (#3) is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games (#1), so the ferret owner cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since the odd positions are occupied by the Mexican and Thai, the ferret owner must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, since the owner of the mouse is in an odd position (#7), the ferret owner cannot be in position 5. So, the ferret owner is either 4 or 6.

5. The person who's hobby is singing (#2) is somewhere to the right of the scientist (#3), so singing cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since the Thai is not the person who's hobby is singing (#9), singing cannot be in position 3. So, singing must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, since the owner of the ferret is not the person who's hobby is singing (#9), singing cannot be in position 4. So, singing must be in position 5 or 6.

6. The owner of the mouse (#2) is in an odd position (#7), so the mouse owner must be in position 1, 3, or 5. But since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), the mouse owner cannot be in position 1. So, the mouse owner is either 3 or 5.

7. The lawyer (#4) is on the far left (#14), so the lawyer is 1.

8. The person who's hobby is photography (#6) is not the Thai (#10), so photography cannot be in position 3. Since the Thai is not the person watching superhero movies (#12), photography cannot be in position 5. So, photography must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 6. However, since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), photography cannot be in position 1. So, photography must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

9. The fan of rock (#2) is the person who's hobby is singing (#9), so rock = 2.

10. The fan of punk (#3) is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul (#6), so punk cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since the Thai is not the person watching superhero movies (#12), punk cannot be in position 3. So, punk must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), punk cannot be in position 6. So, punk must be in position 4 or 5.

11. The person watching fantasy movies (#5) is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike (#4), so fantasy cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the Thai is not the person watching superhero movies (#12), fantasy cannot be in position 6. So, fantasy must be in position 4 or 5.

12. The person watching superhero movies (#6) cannot be the Thai (#10), so superhero cannot be in position 3. Since the Thai is not the person watching superhero movies (#12), superhero cannot be in position 1 or 2. So, superhero must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), superhero cannot be in position 6. So, superhero must be in position 4 or 5.

13. The person driving the quad-bike (#4) is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train (#5), so quad-bike cannot be in position 1, 2, or 3. So, quad-bike must be in position 4, 5, or 6. However, since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), the quad-bike cannot be in position 6. So, the quad-bike must be in position 4 or 5. But we know that the Mexican is the person driving the quad-bike (#4), so the quad-bike must be in position 5.

14. The person driving the train (#5) is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike (#4), so train cannot be in position 6. So, train must be in position 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since the Thai is in an odd position (#10), the train cannot be in position 1, 3, or 5. So, the train must be in position 2 or 4. But we know that the Mexican is the person driving the quad-bike (#4), so the train must be in position 2.

15. The person driving the boat (#6) is the owner of the rat (#8), so the boat must be in position 6.

Lv6-7x3-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 7 items for each person (Beverage, Food, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport). Since there are only 6 people, one of the items will be repeated for one person. Let's assume that the repeated item is Sport for Person 3 (since there are only 3 unique sports).

2. Let's assign the unique items to the people:
   - Person 1: Iced-tea, Apple, Drawing, Librarian, Dutch, Pony, Baseball
   - Person 2: Juice, Asparagus, Filmmaking, Mechanic, Italian, Rabbit, Skiing
   - Person 3: Soy-milk (repeated), Lemon, Gardening, Videographer, Malaysian, Rabbit (repeated), Swimming (repeated)

3. Now let's apply the rules:
   - Rule 1: Gardening is to the right of Filmmaking. So, Gardening belongs to Person 3 and Filmmaking belongs to Person 2.
   - Rule 2: Rat is to the right of Pony. Since Person 1 has Pony, Person 3 must have Rat.
   - Rule 3: Pony is to the left or right of Rat. Since Person 1 has Pony, it cannot be to the left of Rat, so it must be to the right of Rat. This means Person 3 has Rat and Person 1 has Pony.
   - Rule 4: Dutch is on the far left or far right. Since Person 1 has Dutch, it must be on the far left.
   - Rule 5: Baseball is on the left of Librarian. Since Person 1 has Baseball and Dutch is on the far left, Librarian must be Person 2.
   - Rule 6: Soy-milk is on the left of Asparagus. Since Person 3 has Soy-milk and Rat, Asparagus must be Person 2.
   - Rule 7: Skiing is to the left of Baseball. Since Person 2 has Skiing and Asparagus, Baseball must be Person 1.
   - Rule 8: Dutch is not the person eating Asparagus. This is already confirmed as Person 2.
   - Rule 9: Skiing is not the owner of the Rabbit. This is Person 3.
   - Rule 10: Soy-milk is on the left of Rabbit. This is already confirmed as Person 3.
   - Rule 11: Librarian is to the right of Videographer. Since Person 2 is Librarian, Person 1 must be Videographer.
   - Rule 12: Apple is on the far left. This is already confirmed as Person 1.
   - Rule 13: Mechanic is to the left of Soy-milk. Since Person 1 has Soy-milk and is not Mechanic, Person 2 must be Mechanic.
   - Rule 14: Juice is to the left of Filmmaking. This is already confirmed as Person 2.
   - Rule 15: The owner of the Rabbit is the person who's hobby is gardening. This is already confirmed as Person 3.
   - Rule 16: Italian is the person who's sport is swimming. This is already confirmed as Person 2.

4. Now we can fill in the table:

|               |    1     |      2       |     3     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea |     Juice    |  Soy-milk |

5. However, there seems to be a mistake in the puzzle as the job of Person 3 is repeated as Videographer twice. We can't determine the job of Person 3 accurately based on the given rules. So, the final solution table is:

#############"
Lv6-7x3-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different sports, so we can label them A, B, and C. From the clues, we know that baseball is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, so let's place baseball as A. Since the person playing baseball is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, the person drinking iced-tea must be C. Let's place volleyball as B.

2. Now we know that the person playing volleyball is Brazilian, so we can place Brazilian as B. Since the person playing volleyball is to the left or right of the fan reggae, and the photographer is the fan reggae, the person playing volleyball cannot be on the far right. So, let's place volleyball as B2 and the photographer as B3.

3. The entrepreneur is not the fan reggae, so the entrepreneur cannot be B2 or B3. Since the photographer is on the far right, the entrepreneur must be on the left. Let's place the entrepreneur as A1.

4. The skateboard is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking iced-tea is C and the person drinking hot-chocolate is not A (because the entrepreneur is A1), the skateboard must be A2.

5. The fan electronic is not the person driving the skateboard, so the fan electronic cannot be A2. Let's place the fan electronic as C3.

6. The person eating kale is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the skateboard is A2 and the person driving the snowmobile cannot be A1 (because the entrepreneur is A1), the person driving the snowmobile must be A3. The person eating kale must be to the left of A3, so let's place kale as A2.

7. The person eating asparagus is American. Since the American cannot be A1 (because the entrepreneur is A1) and the person eating kale is A2, the American must be A1. So, let's place asparagus as A1.

8. The police-officer is not the fan rock, so the police-officer cannot be C1, C2, or C3 (because C3 is the fan electronic and C1 and C2 are already occupied). Since the entrepreneur is A1, the photographer is B3, and the skateboard is A2, the police-officer cannot be B2 or B3. So, the police-officer must be B1.

9. The person playing baseball is to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person playing baseball is A and the person drinking iced-tea is C, the person drinking fanta must be B1.

10. The german is the person drinking iced-tea, so we already know this.

11. The person playing rowing cannot be placed yet because we don't have enough information.

12. The music-genres can be placed based on the positions of the people: A1 (asparagus) is the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur is not a fan of electronic, rock, or reggae. B1 (fanta) is the person playing baseball, so the person playing baseball is not a fan of electronic, rock, or reggae. B2 (kale) is the person driving the snowmobile, so the person driving the snowmobile is not a fan of electronic, rock, or reggae. B3 (photographer) is a fan of reggae. C1 (hot-chocolate) and C2 (rowing) are still unknown. C3 (electronic) is the fan electronic.

13. The sport can be placed based on the positions of the people: A1 (asparagus) is the entrepreneur, A2 (kale) is the person driving the snowmobile, A3 (skateboard) is the person driving the skateboard, B1 (fanta) is the person playing baseball, B2 (kale) is the person driving the snowmobile, B3 (photographer) is playing volleyball, C1 (hot-chocolate) is the person playing rowing, and C2 (rowing) and C3 (electronic) are still unknown.

14. The nationality can be placed based on the positions of the people: A1 (asparagus) is American, A2 (kale) is the person driving the snowmobile (unknown nationality), A3 (skateboard) is the person driving the skateboard (unknown nationality), B1 (fanta) is the person playing baseball (unknown nationality), B2 (kale) is the person driving the snowmobile (unknown nationality), B3 (photographer) is Brazilian, C1 (hot-chocolate) is the person playing rowing (unknown nationality), and C2 (rowing) and C3 (electronic) are still unknown.

Since we cannot determine the nationality and sport for C1 and C2, we cannot fill in the table completely with the given information.

Here is the table with the information we have:

|               |       1        |      2       |      3       |
| Beverage      | fanta          | kale        | hot-chocolate|

The table is not complete because we cannot determine the nationality and sport for C1 and C2."
Lv6-7x3-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 people and 6 categories, so each category has one representative. Let's assign them one by one.

   - Food: Carrot, Cucumber, Kale (from left to right)
   - Hobby: Board-games, Collecting, Singing (from left to right)
   - Job: Freelancer, Mechanic, Software-developer (from left to right)
   - Movie-Genre: Comedy, Martial-arts, Western (from left to right)
   - Nationality: British, Chinese, Dutch (from left to right)
   - Sport: Basketball, Parkour, Swimming (from left to right)
   - Transport: Boat, Bus, Van (from left to right)

2. Now let's apply the given conditions:

   - The person driving the boat is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. So, Boat is assigned to the first person (leftmost), and Board-games is the first hobby.
   - The person driving the van is between the person watching western movies and the person watching comedy movies. Since Comedy is the third hobby, and Western is the second hobby, the van is assigned to the third person (middle). So, the third hobby is Van. The second hobby must be Bus, so the second person drives the bus.
   - The person watching comedy movies is the software-developer. So, the third person is a software-developer.
   - The mechanic is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since the second person drives the bus, the mechanic is either the first or the second person. However, the mechanic cannot be the first person because the first person drives the boat, and the mechanic cannot drive a boat. So, the mechanic is the second person, and the second hobby is Mechanic.
   - The person eating carrot is on the far right. Since the sixth person eats kale, the fifth person eats cucumber, and the fourth person eats carrot.
   - The person who's sport is basketball is not the person eating cucumber. Since the second person eats cucumber and is the mechanic, the person who's sport is basketball cannot be the second person. So, the person who's sport is basketball is either the first, third, or fifth person. However, the first person drives the boat, and the fifth person eats carrot, so the person who's sport is basketball is the third person. So, the third sport is Basketball.
   - The freelancer is not the person eating cucumber. Since the second person eats cucumber and is the mechanic, the freelancer is either the first, third, or fifth person. However, the first person drives the boat, and the fifth person eats carrot, so the freelancer is the third person. So, the third job is Freelancer.
   - The person watching comedy movies is the software-developer. This is already known.
   - The person who's sport is parkour is the person who's hobby is singing. Since the third person does comedy and is a software-developer, the fourth person does parkour and sings. So, the fourth hobby is Singing, and the fourth sport is Parkour.
   - The mechanic is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. This is already known.
   - The dutch is between the chinese and the person driving the bus. Since the first person is British and the second person is Chinese, the Dutch must be the third person. So, the third nationality is Dutch.
   - The person who's sport is martial-arts is not the person eating cucumber. Since the second person eats cucumber and is the mechanic, the person who's sport is martial-arts cannot be the second person. So, the person who's sport is martial-arts is either the first, third, or fifth person. However, the first person drives the boat, and the fifth person eats carrot, so the person who's sport is martial-arts is the third person. So, the third movie-genre is Martial-arts.

Lv6-7x3-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since there are 3 people and 6 positions, each person will occupy 2 positions (one for beverage, food, hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, and nationality, and the other for transport). Let's assign the positions as follows:

   |               |    1     |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |
   | Beverage      |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Food          |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Hobby         |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Movie-Genre   |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Music-Genre   |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Nationality   |           |          |          |          |          |          |
   | Transport     |           |          |          |          |          |          |

2. From point 8, the person eating grapefruit is in an even position. So, the positions for grapefruit are 2, 4, or 6. Since the positions are already assigned, grapefruit must be in position 4 (otherwise, it would violate the even position rule).

3. From point 11, the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the fan reggae. Since the hobbies are assigned (baking, chess, skydiving), and the fans are assigned (salsa, reggae), we know that the person doing skydiving is in position 1, 3, or 5. Since the person eating grapefruit is in position 4, the person doing skydiving cannot be in position 4 (otherwise, it would violate the left rule). So, the person doing skydiving is in position 1 or 3. Since the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies (point 7), and the person doing skydiving is in position 1 or 3, the person doing skydiving cannot be in position 3 (otherwise, it would violate the right rule). So, the person doing skydiving is in position 1.

4. From point 3, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is chess, and the person doing chess is in position 1. So, hot-chocolate is in position 1.

5. From point 9, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person doing skydiving is in position 1, the person drinking tea is in position 2.

6. From point 4, the person eating grapefruit is in position 4. So, the person eating cucumber must be in position 6 (since there are only 3 different foods).

7. From point 1, the fan salsa is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating cucumber is in position 6, the fan salsa can be in position 5 or 6. Since the person driving the trike is not the person watching musical movies (point 5), and the person eating cucumber is in position 6, the fan salsa cannot be in position 5 (otherwise, it would violate the musical movies rule). So, the fan salsa is in position 6.

8. From point 2, the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the boat is not the person in position 1 (since the person doing skydiving is in position 1), the person watching comedy movies is in position 2.

9. From point 10, the polish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 2, the polish cannot be in position 1 (since the person doing skydiving is in position 1). So, the polish is in position 3.

10. From point 6, the person driving the trike is not the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 2, the person driving the trike cannot be in position 1 (since the person doing skydiving is in position 1). So, the person driving the trike is in position 6.

11. From point 7, the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is in position 2, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 5. So, the person driving the motorbike is in position 6.

Now, let's fill in the table with the final solution:

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |    4     |    5     |    6     |

Lv6-7x3-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 3 different items for each category, so we can fill in the table with 3 unique items for each column.

2. From rule 1, we know the favorite beverages are almond-milk, hot-chocolate, and iced-tea. Let's fill in the Beverage column with these items.

3. From rule 4, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is not the one driving the snowmobile. So, we can't place almond-milk in the row with the snowmobile yet. Let's fill in the other two rows with hot-chocolate and iced-tea.

4. From rule 6, we know the chef is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we've filled in the snowmobile, we can place the chef in the remaining row. Let's assume the chef is drinking hot-chocolate (row 3).

5. From rule 5, we know the person driving the snowmobile is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since we've placed the chef with hot-chocolate in the snowmobile row, the person driving the snowmobile must be drinking iced-tea (row 1).

6. From rule 11, we know the fan blues is not the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we've placed the chef, we can rule out cooking as a hobby for the fan blues.

7. From rule 13, we know the fan blues is to the left of the fan metal. Since we've placed the chef, we can rule out the fan blues being in the first column.

15. From rule 12, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (which we've placed as the fan salsa). Since we've placed the fan salsa and the person driving the snowmobile, we can place almond-milk in the remaining row.

16. From rule 1, we know the remaining beverage is blues. Since we've placed all other beverages, we can place blues in the remaining row.

21. From rule 3, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since we've placed the person driving the snowmobile and badminton, we can place gardening in the second column.

Lv6-7x3-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 variables for each category (hobby, movie-genre, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport, transport) and 7 people (since the frog owner is in an odd position). So, the first row and the last row will have 6 variables filled, and the middle row will have 5 variables filled.

2. Let's start with the nationalities. Since the American is in the middle, they must be in the middle row. So, the nationalities are:
   - Middle row: American
   - First row: Dutch (left of American)
   - Last row: French (right of American)

3. The French is not the person driving the taxi, so the French cannot be in the last row. Therefore, the French must be in the first row, and the Dutch must be in the middle row.
   - First row: French, Dutch
   - Middle row: American
   - Last row: [empty]

4. The person driving the trike is the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the American is in the middle, the snowboarder cannot be in the middle row. So, the snowboarder must be in the first or last row. But the French is in the first row, so the snowboarder must be in the last row.
   - First row: French, Dutch
   - Middle row: American
   - Last row: Snowboarder

5. The person driving the ship is the fan of punk music. Since the French is not the person driving the taxi, the fan of punk music cannot be in the first row. So, the fan of punk music must be in the middle row or the last row. But the last row is already filled, so the fan of punk music must be in the middle row.
   - First row: French, Dutch
   - Middle row: American, Punk fan
   - Last row: Snowboarder

6. The person driving the taxi is not the owner of the mouse. Since the Dutch is in the first row and the French is not the person driving the taxi, the mouse owner cannot be in the first row. So, the mouse owner must be in the middle row or the last row. But the last row is already filled, so the mouse owner must be in the middle row.
   - First row: French, Dutch, [empty]
   - Middle row: American, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Last row: Snowboarder

7. The owner of the frog is in an odd position, which means it must be in the first or third row. But the first row is already filled, so the frog owner must be in the third row.
   - First row: French, Dutch, [empty]
   - Middle row: American, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Third row: Frog owner

8. The person who's hobby is cooking is not the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in the first row, the cook cannot be in the first row. So, the cook must be in the middle row or the third row. But the third row is already filled, so the cook must be in the middle row.
   - First row: French, Dutch, [empty]
   - Middle row: American, Cook, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Third row: Frog owner

9. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the fan of salsa music. Since the cook is in the middle row, the singer must be in the first row.
   - First row: French, Singer, Dutch, [empty]
   - Middle row: American, Cook, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Third row: Frog owner

10. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the French. Since the singer is on the left of the French, the gardener must be on the right of the French.
   - First row: French, Singer, Dutch, Gardener
   - Middle row: American, Cook, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Third row: Frog owner

11. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the American. Since the gardener is on the right of the French, the parkour person must be in the first row.
   - First row: Parkour, French, Singer, Dutch, Gardener
   - Middle row: American, Cook, Punk fan, Mouse owner
   - Third row: Frog owner

12. The owner of the fish is between the owner of the mouse and the owner of the frog. Since the fish owner must be in the third row, the mouse owner must be in the first position, and the frog owner must be in the second position.
   - First row: Parkour, French, Singer, Dutch, Mouse owner
   - Middle row: American, Cook, Punk fan, Frog owner
   - Third row: Fish owner

13. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the French. Since the gardener is already in the third row, this condition is satisfied.

14. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the fan of salsa music. Since the singer is already in the first row, this condition is satisfied.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-7x3-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know there are 6 unknowns (Beverage, Hobby, Job, Movie-Genre, Music-Genre, Pet, Transport) and 3 people. So, each unknown has 3 possible values.

2. Let's start with the people and their positions. Since the dancing person is to the left of the filmmaking person, we can assign positions 1, 2, 3 to them in some order. Let's say 1 is dancing, 2 is filmmaking, and 3 is reading.

3. From point 11, we know the mirinda drinker is on the left or right of the fan punk. Since the fan punk can't be the reader (point 3), and the reader is in position 3, the mirinda drinker must be in position 1 or 2. But the teacher watches horror movies (point 1), and the teacher can't be in position 1 (point 5), so the mirinda drinker must be in position 2. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |

   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the teacher is watching horror movies, so the teacher is in position 2. So, the teacher is a teacher, the hobby is filmmaking, and the movie genre is horror.

4. From point 9, we know the ferret owner is to the left of the horror movie watcher. Since the teacher is watching horror movies, the ferret owner must be in position 1. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      |               |            |                |
   | Hobby         |               |            |                |
   | Job           |               |            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     |                |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |                |
   | Pet           | ferret       |            |                |
   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the teacher is in position 2, so the job is police-officer or social-worker. Since the teacher can't be a social-worker (point 12), the job is police-officer.

5. From point 10, we know the milk drinker is to the left of the airplane driver. Since the police-officer is in position 2, the milk drinker must be in position 1. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      | milk         |            |                |
   | Hobby         |               |            |                |
   | Job           | police-officer|            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     |                |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |                |
   | Pet           | ferret       |            |                |
   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the hobby is one of dancing, filmmaking, or reading. Since the hobby can't be filmmaking (it's already taken), and it can't be reading (the reader is in position 3), the hobby is dancing.

6. From point 7, we know the comedy movie watcher is to the right of the airplane driver. Since the milk drinker is in position 1, the comedy movie watcher must be in position 3. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      | milk         |            |                |
   | Hobby         | dancing     |            |                |
   | Job           | police-officer|            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     | comedy         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |                |
   | Pet           | ferret       |            |                |
   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the music-genre is one of funk, gospel, or punk. Since the punk fan can't be the reader (point 3), and the reader is in position 3, the music-genre is not punk. So, the music-genre is either funk or gospel.

7. From point 8, we know the mirinda drinker is on the left or right of the police-officer. Since the milk drinker is in position 1 and the police-officer is in position 2, the mirinda drinker must be in position 3. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      | milk         |            | mirinda       |
   | Hobby         | dancing     |            |                |
   | Job           | police-officer|            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     | comedy         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            |                |
   | Pet           | ferret       |            |                |
   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the music-genre is either funk or gospel. Since the punk fan can't be the reader (point 3), and the reader is in position 3, the music-genre must be funk.

8. From point 4, we know the goat owner is to the left of the taxi driver. Since the ferret owner is in position 1, the goat owner must be in position 2. So, the table now looks like this:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      | milk         | goat      | mirinda       |
   | Hobby         | dancing     |            |                |
   | Job           | police-officer|            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     | comedy         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            | funk          |
   | Pet           | ferret       | goat       |                |
   | Transport     |               |            |                |

   We know the remaining transport is either airplane or scooter. Since the milk drinker is in position 1, the airplane driver can't be in position 1 (point 10), so the transport is scooter.

So, the final solution table is:

   |               |       1       |     2      |       3        |
   | Beverage      | milk         | goat      | mirinda       |
   | Hobby         | dancing     |            |                |
   | Job           | police-officer|            |                |
   | Movie-Genre   |               | horror     | comedy         |
   | Music-Genre   |               |            | funk          |
   | Pet           | ferret       | goat       |                |
   | Transport     |               |            | scooter       |
