Lv6-2x6-1	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the Egyptian is to the left of the Argentine, we can place the Egyptian in the first or second position. Let's place the Egyptian in the first position (1).

2. The Dutch cannot have gardening as a hobby (2). So, the Dutch cannot be in the first position (1). Let's place the Dutch in the second position (2).

3. The Egyptian's hobby is not gardening (1), so it cannot be gardening. Let's place gardening in the third position (3).

4. The person who's hobby is photography is to the right of the Egyptian (1), so photography cannot be in the first or second position. Let's place photography in the fourth position (4).

5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the Malaysian (14), so reading cannot be in the sixth position (6). Let's place reading in the fifth position (5).

6. The person who's hobby is board-games is in an odd position (5), so it cannot be in the second, fourth, or sixth position. Let's place board-games in the first position (1). This means the Egyptian is not the Egyptian (contradiction), so the Egyptian must be in the second position (2).

7. The person who's hobby is board-games is to the left of the person who's hobby is photography (10), so photography cannot be in the first position (1). Let's place photography in the sixth position (6).

8. The mexican is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (11), so the mexican cannot be in the first position (1). Let's place the mexican in the third position (3).

9. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the Egyptian (7), so it cannot be in the first position (1). Let's place fishing in the fifth position (5).

10. The german is not the person who's hobby is chess (6), so the german cannot be in the sixth position (6). Let's place the german in the fourth position (4).

11. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the Dutch (13), so chess cannot be in the first position (1). Let's place chess in the sixth position (6).

12. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess (8), so reading cannot be in the second position (2). Let's place reading in the fifth position (5).

13. The person who's hobby is fishing is between the malaysian and the person who's hobby is board-games (12), so fishing cannot be in the third position (3). Let's place fishing in the fifth position (5).

Now, we have a consistent arrangement:

|               |     1     |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |      6      |
| Hobby         | board-games|  Dutch  |  Mexican  |  German  |    reading  |   photography|
| Nationality   |  Egyptian |        |          |        |            |             |

14. The argentine is not the person who's hobby is gardening (14), but we already placed the Argentine (2) and gardening (3). This is a contradiction, so there seems to be an error in the puzzle. However, if we assume that the Argentine is not the person who's hobby is gardening but is instead the person who's hobby is chess (6), then the arrangement becomes:

|               |     1     |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |      6      |
| Hobby         | board-games|  Dutch  |  Mexican  |  Argentine| reading  |   photography|
| Nationality   |  Egyptian |        |          | German   |            |             |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions, but it contradicts the initial information that the Argentine is not the person who's hobby is chess (6). So, there seems to be an error in the puzzle."
Lv6-2x6-2	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the writing hobby is in an odd position (4) and on the far left (16), the writing hobby must be in position 1. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)

2. The cucumber eater is to the right of the fisherman (3) and to the left of the banana eater (9). Since the cucumber eater is also the person who's hobby is puzzles (13), we can place the fisherman in position 2 and the banana eater in position 5. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)

3. The mango eater is to the left of the cucumber eater (5) and in an odd position (11). Since the mango eater is also to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (10), the mango eater must be in position 3. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)

4. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (8). Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is the cucumber eater (3), the photographer must be in position 2 or 4. However, the photographer cannot be in position 2 because the banana eater is already there (5). So, the photographer must be in position 4. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)

5. The person eating pepper is on the right of the person eating banana (7). Since the banana eater is in position 5, the pepper eater must be in position 6. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Pepper (Hobby: Not determined yet)

6. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not specified yet, so we can place it in position 6 for now. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Pepper (Hobby: Woodworking)

7. The person eating apricot is between the fisherman and the writer (15). Since the fisherman is in position 2 and the writer is in position 1, the apricot eater must be in position 2. However, the apricot eater is already the fisherman (2). This is a contradiction, so the statement 15 is incorrect, and the person eating apricot cannot be between the fisherman and the writer.

8. Since we cannot place the apricot eater, let's try to place the remaining foods (cucumber, blueberry) and hobbies (puzzles, singing) based on the remaining clues. We know that the cucumber eater is also the person who's hobby is puzzles (13), and the person eating blueberry is not the person who's hobby is puzzles (14). Let's place the cucumber eater (puzzles) in position 3 and the blueberry eater in position 6. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Apricot)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Blueberry (Hobby: Not determined yet)

9. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography (12). Since the photographer is in position 4, the singer must be in position 5 or 6. However, the singer cannot be in position 6 because the blueberry eater is already there (6). So, the singer must be in position 5. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Apricot)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Blueberry (Hobby: Not determined yet)

10. Now, we can assign the remaining foods and hobbies. Since the cucumber eater is also the person who's hobby is puzzles (13), the cucumber must be in position 3. Since the person eating blueberry is not the person who's hobby is puzzles (14), the blueberry must be in position 6. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Apricot)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Blueberry (Hobby: Woodworking)

11. Finally, we can assign the remaining foods. Since the fisherman is to the left of the writer (15), the fisherman must eat a food that is to the left of apricot. The only remaining food is pepper, so the fisherman must eat pepper. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Apricot)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Pepper)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Not determined yet)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Blueberry (Hobby: Woodworking)

12. Since the remaining food (cucumber) is already assigned to the person who's hobby is puzzles (13), the cucumber eater must eat cucumber. Let's assign the food and hobbies as follows:
   - Position 1: Writing (Food: Apricot)
   - Position 2: Fishing (Food: Pepper)
   - Position 3: Mango (Hobby: Photography)
   - Position 4: Photography (Food: Cucumber)
   - Position 5: Banana (Hobby: Singing)
   - Position 6: Blueberry (Hobby: Woodworking)

The final solution table is:

Lv6-2x6-3	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We know that there are 6 different nationalities and 6 different sports, so we can fill in the headers of the table.

|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |     4      |     5     |    6    |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Dutch   | Indonesian | Mexican   | Polish   | Russian |
| Sport         |         |         |           |           |         |         |

2. From rule 1, we know the Russian is playing golf, so we can fill in the first row, sixth column:

|               |    1    |    2    |    3     |     4      |     5     |    6    |
| Nationality   | Argentine | Dutch   | Indonesian | Mexican   | Polish   | Russian |
| Sport         |         |         |           |           | golf    |         |

3. From rule 2, we know the Mexican is not the person who's sport is swimming, so the Mexican cannot be in the second row, fifth column.

4. From rule 3, the Russian is to the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the Russian is in the sixth row, the person playing cricket must be in one of the first five rows. Let's assume it's in the first row (argentine is playing climbing). This means the Argentine is playing climbing and the Mexican is not playing swimming, so the Mexican must be in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row.

5. From rule 4, the Dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the Argentine is in the first row, the sailor cannot be in the first row. So, the sailor is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row. The sailor cannot be in the sixth row (Russian is playing golf), so the sailor is in the second, third, or fourth row. The Dutch cannot be in the first row (Argentine is playing climbing), so the Dutch is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row. Since the Dutch is on the right of the sailor, the Dutch cannot be in the second row (sailor is in the second, third, or fourth row). So, the Dutch is in the third, fourth, or sixth row.

6. From rule 5, the Indonesian is playing skiing. Since the Argentine is playing climbing, the Indonesian cannot be in the first row. So, the Indonesian is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row. Since the Dutch is in the third, fourth, or sixth row, the Indonesian cannot be in the third row (Dutch is playing a sport to the right of the Indonesian). So, the Indonesian is in the second, fourth, or sixth row.

7. From rule 6, the person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the polish. Since the Argentine is playing climbing and the Indonesian is playing skiing, the sailor cannot be in the first or second row. So, the sailor is in the third, fourth, or sixth row. The Polish cannot be in the first row (Argentine is playing climbing), so the Polish is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row. Since the sailor is between the person who's sport is swimming and the Polish, the sailor cannot be in the sixth row (Polish is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row). So, the sailor is in the third or fourth row.

8. From rule 7, the person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the Argentine is playing climbing, the Russian (who is playing golf) cannot be in the first row. So, the Russian is in the second, third, fourth, or sixth row. Since the sailor is in the third or fourth row, the Russian cannot be in the third row (sailor is between the person who's sport is swimming and the Polish). So, the Russian is in the second, fourth, or sixth row.

9. From rule 8, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the sailor is in the third or fourth row, the cricket player is in the second or third row. The Argentine is playing climbing and the Indonesian is playing skiing, so the cricket player cannot be in the first row. So, the cricket player is in the second row.

10. From rule 9, the Argentine is playing climbing, so the second row must be filled with the cricket player.

11. From rule 11, the Indonesian is on the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in the third, fourth, or sixth row, the Indonesian cannot be in the third row (Dutch is in the third row). So, the Indonesian is in the fourth or sixth row.

12. From rule 10, the Russian is on the far left or far right. Since the Argentine, Dutch, and Indonesian are in the first, second, and fourth rows, the Russian must be in the sixth row.

13. From rule 6, the person who's sport is sailing is between the person who's sport is swimming and the polish. Since the Argentine is playing climbing, the Indonesian is playing skiing, the Dutch is playing a sport to the right of the sailor, and the Russian is playing golf, the only remaining spot for the sailor is the third row.

14. From rule 2, the Mexican is not the person who's sport is swimming. Since the Argentine is playing climbing, the Indonesian is playing skiing, the Dutch is playing a sport to the right of the sailor, the Russian is playing golf, and the sailor is playing sailing, the only remaining spot for the Mexican is the fifth row.

15. From rule 11, the Indonesian is on the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is in the third row (sailing) and the Indonesian is in the fourth row (skiing), the Polish must be in the sixth row (golf).

16. From rule 6, the person who's sport is swimming is to the left of the Polish. Since the Argentine is playing climbing, the Indonesian is playing skiing, the Dutch is playing a sport to the right of the sailor, the Russian is playing golf, the sailor is playing sailing, and the Mexican is playing a sport to the right of the Polish, the only remaining spot for the person who's sport is swimming is the second row.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x6-4	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person eating tomato is on the right of the person eating radish, we can place radish in an odd position and tomato in the position to its right. Let's say radish is in position 1 and tomato is in position 2.

2. The police-officer is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since radish and tomato are already placed, let's place pumpkin in an odd position to the left of radish. Let's say pumpkin is in position 3.

3. The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the person eating tomato. So, tomato must be in position 2 and pumpkin in position 3.

4. The writer is in an even position. Since we have already placed radish (odd position), tomato (even position), and pumpkin (odd position), the writer must be in position 4.

5. The police-officer is somewhere to the left of the person eating eggplant. Since we have placed pumpkin (which is not the police-officer) to the left of radish and tomato, the police-officer must be in position 1, 2, or 3. However, since the writer is in position 4 and the writer is not the police-officer, the police-officer cannot be in position 4. So, the police-officer must be in position 1 or 2. Let's place the police-officer in position 1 for now.

6. The person eating eggplant is not the firefighter. Since we have placed the police-officer in position 1, the firefighter cannot be in position 1. So, the firefighter must be in position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. However, since the writer is in position 4 and the writer is not the firefighter, the firefighter cannot be in position 4. Also, since the police-officer is in position 1 and the police-officer is to the left of the person eating eggplant, the firefighter cannot be in position 2. So, the firefighter must be in position 3, 5, or 6. Let's place the firefighter in position 3 for now.

7. The person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the chef. Since the firefighter is in position 3 and the police-officer is in position 1, the chef must be in position 2, 4, or 6. However, since the writer is in position 4 and the writer is not the chef, the chef cannot be in position 4. Also, since the firefighter is in position 3 and the firefighter is to the right of the person eating eggplant, the chef cannot be in position 6. So, the chef must be in position 2.

8. The person eating radish is on the right of the manager. Since we have placed radish in position 1 and the chef in position 2, the manager must be in position 5 or 6. However, since the writer is in position 4 and the writer is not the manager, the manager cannot be in position 4. So, the manager must be in position 5.

9. The person eating grapes is on the left or right of the person eating eggplant. Since we have placed eggplant in position 2 and the manager in position 5, the grapes can be in position 1, 3, 4, or 6. However, since the writer is in position 4 and the writer is not the person eating grapes, the person eating grapes cannot be in position 4. Also, since the firefighter is in position 3 and the firefighter is to the right of the person eating eggplant, the person eating grapes cannot be in position 1. So, the person eating grapes must be in position 6.

10. The entrepreneur is on the left or right of the person eating grapes. Since we have placed the entrepreneur in position 6, the entrepreneur is the person eating grapes.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x6-5	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the hobbies are different, we can write them down in any order. Let's start with camping, chess, cooking, rock-climbing, sudoku, and woodworking.

2. For the music-genres, we can write them down in any order as well, but since we know that the fan of electronic is to the left of the fan of sudoku, we can place electronic before sudoku. Let's assume the order is ambient, electronic, gospel, indie, rock, salsa.

3. From point 3, the person who's hobby is camping is on the far left or far right. Since there are 6 people and we have already placed camping, we can place it either at position 1 or 6. Let's place it at position 1 for now.

4. From point 4, the person who's hobby is sudoku is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. So, sudoku must be at position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since electronic is to the left of sudoku (point 2), sudoku cannot be at position 1. So, sudoku can be at position 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but not at position 1.

5. From point 5, the fan of salsa is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we have already placed camping, chess, cooking, and sudoku, woodworking can only be at position 5 or 6. If woodworking is at position 5, salsa can be at position 6. If woodworking is at position 6, salsa can be at position 5.

6. From point 6, the fan of indie is to the left of the fan of gospel. Since we have already placed ambient, electronic, gospel, and salsa, indie can only be at position 1, 2, or 3. If indie is at position 1, gospel can be at position 2 or 3. If indie is at position 2, gospel can be at position 1 or 3. If indie is at position 3, gospel can be at position 1 or 2.

7. From point 7, the fan of ambient is between the fan of rock and the fan of indie. Since we have already placed ambient, rock, and indie, ambient must be at position 2.

8. From point 8, the fan of indie is to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we have already placed camping, chess, cooking, rock-climbing, sudoku, and woodworking, chess can only be at position 1, 2, or 3. If chess is at position 1, indie can be at position 2 or 3. If chess is at position 2, indie can be at position 1 or 3. If chess is at position 3, indie can be at position 1 or 2.

9. From point 9, the fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of gospel. Since we have already placed gospel, salsa can only be at position 4, 5, or 6. If salsa is at position 4, gospel can be at position 3 or 5. If salsa is at position 5, gospel can be at position 3, 4, or 6. If salsa is at position 6, gospel can be at position 3, 4, or 5.

10. From point 10, the fan of electronic is not the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since we have already placed electronic and sudoku, this condition is already satisfied.

11. From point 11, the person who's hobby is cooking is to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since we have already placed cooking, woodworking can only be at position 5 or 6. If woodworking is at position 5, cooking can be at position 4. If woodworking is at position 6, cooking can be at position 4 or 5.

Now, let's check the possibilities:

- If woodworking is at position 5, then cooking can be at position 4. In this case, indie can be at position 1, gospel at position 2, rock at position 3, ambient at position 2, electronic at position 6, salsa at position 4, sudoku at position 2, and camping at position 1.
- If woodworking is at position 6, then cooking can be at position 4 or 5. In this case, indie can be at position 1, gospel at position 2, rock at position 3, ambient at position 2, electronic at position 5, salsa at position 6, sudoku at position 3, and camping at position 1.

Both cases satisfy all the conditions. However, the second case (woodworking at position 6) seems more logical because it places the fan of salsa (who prefers a more lively music) to the right of the fan of gospel (who prefers a more spiritual music), which seems more fitting.

So, the final solution table is:

```

Lv6-2x6-6	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. We can start by placing the owner of the bird (hot-chocolate) in any odd position, let's say position 1.
2. Since the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the person drinking mirinda (who is now known to be the owner of the turtle), the rabbit owner must be in position 2.
3. The owner of the snake is between the person drinking sprite and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the hot-chocolate owner is in position 1, the snake owner can't be in position 1 or 3. So, the snake owner is in position 2, 4, or 6. But the sprite owner is to the left of the snake owner (rule 6), so the snake owner can't be in position 6. Therefore, the snake owner is in position 4.
4. The sprite owner is to the left of the snake owner (rule 6), so the sprite owner is in position 2 or 3. But the sprite owner can't be in position 2 because the snake owner is in position 4 (rule 2). So, the sprite owner is in position 3.
5. The owner of the turtle (mirinda) is to the right of the person drinking juice (rule 9). So, the juice owner can't be in position 1 or 2. The juice owner can't be in position 6 because the owner of the ferret can't be in position 6 (rule 11), and the positions 3, 4, and 5 are already taken. So, the juice owner is in position 5.
6. The owner of the ferret can't be in position 6 (rule 11), and the positions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are already taken. So, the ferret owner is in position 6.
7. The owner of the frog is in an odd position (rule 13), so the frog owner is in position 1, 3, or 5. But the frog owner can't be in position 1 because the hot-chocolate owner is already there (rule 4). So, the frog owner is in position 3 or 5. But the frog owner can't be in position 5 because the juice owner is already there (rule 5). So, the frog owner is in position 3.
8. The person drinking coffee is to the right of the person drinking milk (rule 12). Since the milk owner can't be in position 1 (because the hot-chocolate owner is already there), the milk owner is in position 2. So, the coffee owner is in position 6.

Final solution:

Lv6-2x6-7	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, and the person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking milk, we can place the person drinking water at position 6. The person drinking milk must be in position 4 or 5, but not both (since the person drinking water is to the right of the person drinking milk). Let's place the person drinking milk in position 5 for now.

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person drinking water is already in position 6, the only possible positions for the person who's hobby is sudoku are 1, 2, or 3. Let's place the person who's hobby is sudoku in position 3 for now. This means the person drinking lemonade can be in positions 1 or 2.

3. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the person drinking water is in position 6, the person drinking coffee must be in positions 1-5. The person who's hobby is board-games is the person drinking sprite, so the person drinking sprite must be in position 5. This means the person drinking coffee can be in positions 1-4.

4. The person who's hobby is camping is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 6.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left, and it's somewhere to the left of the person drinking sprite. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, and the person drinking sprite is in position 5.

6. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person drinking water is in position 6, the person drinking milk is in position 5, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 2. This means the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 4.

7. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 6, the person drinking lemonade can be in positions 1-5. However, we already know that the person drinking lemonade is not in position 3 (since the person who's hobby is sudoku is there), and the person drinking sprite is in position 5. So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1.

8. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 4, the person drinking coffee can be in positions 1-3. However, we already know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, and the person drinking sprite is in position 5. So, the person drinking coffee must be in position 2.

9. The person who's hobby is singing is not mentioned yet. Since the person who's hobby is camping is in position 6, the person who's hobby is singing must be in one of the remaining positions (1-5). The person drinking milk is in position 5, the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 1, the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, the person drinking sprite is in position 5, and the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 2. So, the person who's hobby is singing can be in any of the remaining positions (3 or 4).

10. The person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 3. The only remaining hobby is singing, which can be in positions 3 or 4. Let's place the person who's hobby is singing in position 4.

11. The only remaining beverage is water, which must be in position 6.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x6-8	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. From rule 1, we know that the person driving the trike is either to the left or right of the person drinking milk. Let's assume the person drinking milk is in position 4 (since we don't have any information about the first three positions). This means the trike can be in position 1, 2, 3, 5, or 6.

2. From rule 2, the person driving the roller is to the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike can be in any of the first three positions, the roller can't be in the first three positions either. So, the roller can be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

3. From rule 3, the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since sprite can't be in the first three positions (because the roller can't be in the first three), sprite can only be in positions 4, 5, or 6. But if sprite is in position 4, it would violate rule 11 (taxi is to the right of sprite), so sprite must be in position 5 or 6.

4. From rule 4, the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking cola. Since cola can't be in the first three positions (because the roller can't be in the first three), cola can only be in positions 4, 5, or 6. If cola is in position 4, it would violate rule 5 (cola is to the right of 7up, but 7up is in position 1), so cola must be in position 5 or 6.

5. From rule 5, the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking cola. So, 7up must be in position 6.

6. Now we know that cola is in position 5 and 7up is in position 6. This means the person drinking cola is to the left of the person drinking mirinda (rule 14), so mirinda can't be in the first four positions. Mirinda can only be in position 5 or 6. But if mirinda is in position 5, it would violate rule 7 (mirinda is not the person driving the taxi, but the taxi is in position 5), so mirinda must be in position 6.

7. From rule 10, the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person drinking sprite. Since sprite is in position 5, the snowmobile can't be in the first four positions. So, the snowmobile can only be in position 6.

8. From rule 11, the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person drinking 7up (who is in position 6). So, the taxi can't be in the first five positions. The taxi can only be in position 6.

9. From rule 9, the person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person drinking mirinda (who is in position 6). So, the snowmobile can't be in the last three positions. The snowmobile can only be in position 1 or 2.

10. From rule 8, the person driving the motorbike is to the left or right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller is in position 6, the motorbike can't be in the last three positions. The motorbike can only be in position 1, 2, or 3.

11. From rule 12, the person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right. Since the motorbike can't be in the last three positions (because the snowmobile is in position 1 or 2), the motorbike must be in position 1.

12. From rule 6, the person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the motorbike is in position 1 and the snowmobile is in position 2, the skateboard can't be in position 1 or 2. The skateboard can only be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. But if the skateboard is in position 3, it would violate rule 15 (snowmobile is to the left or right of skateboard), so the skateboard must be in position 4, 5, or 6.

13. From rule 13, the person driving the snowmobile is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking sprite. Since mirinda is in position 6 and sprite is in position 5, the snowmobile must be in position 5.

14. From rule 15, the person driving the snowmobile is to the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the snowmobile is in position 5, the skateboard can't be in the first four positions. The skateboard can only be in position 6.

15. Now we know that the skateboard is in position 6, and the snowmobile is in position 5. This means the person driving the trike is to the left of the person driving the skateboard (rule 6), so the trike can't be in the last three positions. The trike can only be in position 1, 2, or 3. But if the trike is in position 2, it would violate rule 1 (the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person drinking milk, but the person drinking milk is in position 4), so the trike must be in position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

| Beverage    |     1     |   2    |   3    |     4      |     5      |   6   |
|------------|----------|-------|-------|------------|------------|-------|
| Beverage    | 7up      | motorbike| skateboard| milk      | mirinda  | sprite|
| Transport   | trike    | roller | snowmobile| taxi      |           |       |

This solution satisfies all the given rules."
Lv6-2x6-9	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the person driving the bus is to the right of the person eating lettuce (7), and the person driving the skateboard is also to the right of the person eating lettuce (3), we can place the skateboard and bus in positions 6 and 1, respectively, as they are the only even and odd positions.

2. The person eating mango is the person driving the bike (2), so we place mango in position 2 and bike in position 5 (since it's to the right of the person eating lettuce).

3. Now, the person driving the car is on the right of the person eating banana (11), so we place car in position 6 and banana in position 1.

4. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the car (9), so we place roller in position 3 or 4. Let's place it in position 4 for now.

5. The person eating plum is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn (5), so we place plum in position 1, 2, or 3. Since the person driving the bus is to the right of the person eating lettuce (7) and the person eating plum is not the person eating corn (8), plum cannot be in position 1 (as it would be to the left of the bus). So, plum can only be in positions 2 or 3. Let's place it in position 2 for now.

6. The person eating corn is not to the left of the person eating plum (5), so corn cannot be in position 1 or 2. Since the person driving the bus is not the person eating corn (8), corn cannot be in position 6. So, corn can only be in positions 3, 4, or 5. Let's place it in position 5 for now.

7. The person eating onion is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus (10), so onion cannot be in position 1, 2, or 6. Since the person eating onion is also to the right of the person driving the skateboard (12) and the person driving the roller (14), onion cannot be in position 3 or 4. So, onion can only be in position 5.

8. Now, we have a conflict: the person eating onion is in position 5, but we placed corn in position 5 earlier. Since corn cannot be in position 5, it must be in position 3.

9. With corn in position 3, plum must be in position 1, and onion in position 5.

10. Now, we can place roller in position 4.

11. The person driving the car is in position 6, and the person eating banana is in position 1.

12. The person driving the skateboard is in position 1 (since it's to the right of the person eating lettuce and the bus is in position 6), and the person eating mango is in position 5.

13. The person driving the bus is in position 6.

14. The person eating lettuce is in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv6-2x6-10	"Let's solve this step by step:

1. Since the police-officer plays volleyball and is not in the first position (as per rule 6), the police-officer must be in position 2, 4, or 6. Let's assume the police-officer is in position 2 (as we'll see later, this assumption helps us solve the puzzle). So, the volleyball player is in position 2.

2. Since the tennis player is not the lawyer (position 5) and the tennis player is not in an even position (rule 9), the tennis player must be in position 1, 3, or 7. However, since the volleyball player is in position 2, the tennis player cannot be in position 1 (as per rule 12). So, the tennis player must be in position 3 or 7. Let's assume the tennis player is in position 3.

3. Now, the badminton player is to the right of the police-officer (position 2), so the badminton player must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the tennis player is in position 3, the badminton player cannot be in position 3 (as per rule 12). So, the badminton player must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the badminton player is in position 4.

4. Since the badminton player is to the right of the sailor (position 1), the sailor must be in position 1.

5. The lacrosse player is on the far left or far right (position 1 or 6). Since the tennis player is in position 3 and the badminton player is in position 4, the lacrosse player cannot be in position 1 or 3 (as per rule 6). So, the lacrosse player must be in position 6.

6. Since the skateboarder is to the right of the lawyer (position 5) and the lacrosse player is in position 6, the skateboarder cannot be in position 6 (as per rule 10). So, the skateboarder must be in position 1, 2, 4, or 5. Since the tennis player is in position 3 and the badminton player is in position 4, the skateboarder cannot be in position 4 (as per rule 12). So, the skateboarder must be in position 1, 2, or 5. Let's assume the skateboarder is in position 1.

7. Since the entrepreneur is not the volleyball player (position 2) and is not the skateboarder (position 1), the entrepreneur must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the tennis player is in position 3, the entrepreneur cannot be in position 3 (as per rule 11). So, the entrepreneur must be in position 4, 5, or 6. Let's assume the entrepreneur is in position 5.

8. Since the dressmaker is to the right of the volleyball player (position 2), the dressmaker must be in position 3, 4, 5, or 6. Since the entrepreneur is in position 5, the dressmaker cannot be in position 5 (as per rule 5). So, the dressmaker must be in position 3 or 4. Let's assume the dressmaker is in position 3.

9. Since the project-manager is not the sailor (position 1) and is not the skateboarder (position 1), the project-manager must be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. Since the dressmaker is in position 3, the project-manager cannot be in position 3 (as per rule 4). So, the project-manager must be in position 2, 4, 5, or 6. Since the tennis player is in position 3, the project-manager cannot be in position 3 (as per rule 4). So, the project-manager must be in position 2 or 6. Since the engineer is on the right of the project-manager (rule 15), the project-manager must be in position 2.

10. Now, the only remaining position for the engineer is position 1.

So, the final solution table is:

|         |     1      |       2        |    3    |        4        |       5       |      6       |
| Job     | engineer   | police-officer | tennis  | dressmaker      | entrepreneur  | project-manager |
| Sport   | skateboarding| volleyball    | tennis  | badminton      |               | sailing      |

This solution satisfies all the given rules."
