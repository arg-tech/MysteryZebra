Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Let's assign the nationalities to the cities on the left side (as per rule 9).
   - Norweigan: liverpool (leftmost)
   - British: miami (next to norwegian)
   - German: venice (next to british)
   - Danish: hannover (next to German)
   - Swede: nizza (remaining city)

2. Assign hobbies to the people based on rules 3, 5, and 12.
   - Woodworking: comedy (rule 12)
   - Traveling: traveling (rule 5)
   - Fishing: (middle position, will be filled later)
   - Photography: danish (rule 3)
   - Reading: (will be filled later)

3. Assign pets to the people based on rules 2 and 10, 11.
   - Dog: swede (rule 2)
   - Cat: (left or right of zombie watcher, will be filled later)
   - Bird: documentary watcher (rule 6)
   - Fish: (will be filled later)
   - Horse: (left or right of western watcher, will be filled later)

4. Assign movie genres based on rules 7, 13, and 15.
   - Western: nizza (rule 7)
   - Horror: german (rule 13)
   - Zombie: (left or right of reader, will be filled later)
   - Documentary: bird owner (rule 6)
   - Comedy: woodworker (rule 12)

5. Fill the remaining positions based on the given rules.
   - Fishing: venice (middle position, as it's not assigned yet and the person traveling to miami is the person who's hobby is traveling, so venice must be the person traveling to hannover)
   - Reading: miami (left or right of zombie watcher, and it's not assigned yet, so it must be the person watching zombie movies)
   - Fish: miami (as the person reading is the person watching zombie movies, and the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading, so the fish must be assigned to miami)
   - Horse: hannover (as the person traveling to liverpool is the norwegian, and the norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to liverpool, so the horse must be assigned to hannover)

6. Final solution table:

| City | liverpool | miami | venice | hannover | nizza |
|------|----------|-------|--------|---------|-------|
| Nationality | norwegian | british | german | danish | swede |
| Pet | (fish) | cat | dog | (horse) | (empty) |
| Hobby | fishing | reading | traveling | woodworking | photography |
| Movie-Genre | (empty) | zombie | comedy | horror | western |

Since the pets and movie genres are not explicitly mentioned in the rules, I've left them empty. However, you can assign them based on your preference. For example, you can assign the cat to the norwegian (liverpool) and the horse to the swede (nizza)."
Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Since the people's birthday is in 5 different months, each row (except the ""Birthday"" column) must contain one and only one person.

2. From rule 9, the person traveling to Prague is on the far left. So, the person in the first row (City) must be Prague. Let's place it as Prague.

3. From rule 14, the person traveling to Prague is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the first row is Prague, the second row (Color) must be blue.

4. From rule 12, the bluemaster-smoker is the person who's birthday is in November. Since the second row is blue, the fifth row (Birthday) must have November.

5. From rule 15, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in May. Since the fifth row is November, the fourth row (Color) must be either white or yellow (as green and red are already taken). If it's white, the blend-smoker would be on the left of the November-born person, which is impossible because the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person traveling to Prague (rule 14). So, the fourth row must be yellow.

6. From rule 7, the person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker. Since the fourth row is yellow, the third row (Cigar) must be dunhill.

7. From rule 11, the librarian is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker. Since the third row is dunhill, the sixth row (Job) must be either nurse or librarian. If it's nurse, the librarian would be on the right of the dunhill-smoker, which is impossible because the librarian is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (rule 11). So, the sixth row must be librarian.

8. From rule 8, the person who's birthday is in July is in the middle. Since the fifth row is November and the sixth row is Librarian, the third row (Cigar) must be pall-mall, and the seventh row (Job) must be nurse.

9. From rule 6, the pall-mall-smoker is the dancer. Since the third row is pall-mall, the second row (Color) must be red, and the first row (City) must be San Francisco (rule 3).

10. From rule 13, the person traveling to Venice is the prince-smoker. Since the first row is San Francisco, the fourth row (Color) must be either green or white (as red, blue, and yellow are already taken). If it's green, the person traveling to Venice would be on the right of the person who likes blue (rule 14), which is impossible because the person traveling to Prague is on the far left (rule 9). So, the fourth row must be white.

11. From rule 4, the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since the fourth row is white, the second row (Color) must be green.

12. From rule 10, the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the nurseerman. Since the fourth row is yellow and the sixth row is Librarian, the fifth row (Birthday) must be May.

13. From rule 5, the person who likes green is the person who's birthday is in March. Since the second row is green, the first row (City) must be New York (rule 1).

14. From rule 2, the person traveling to Nizza is the dressmaker. Since the first row is New York, the third row (Cigar) must be blend.

15. From rule 1, the person traveling to New York is the person who likes red. Since the first row is New York, the second row (Color) must be red.

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

```

Einstein_domain_replacements_2	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. We know that there are 5 different music-genres, so each row will have one of the genres. Let's assign them:
   - Row 1: indie (since it's not mentioned yet)
   - Row 2: country (from point 4 and 5)
   - Row 3: metal (from point 1)
   - Row 4: salsa (from point 4)
   - Row 5: soul (from point 7)

2. We know that there are 5 different birthday months, so each column will have one of the months. Let's assign them:
   - Column 1: April (from point 1)
   - Column 2: June (from point 3 and 14)
   - Column 3: July (from point 9, 14, and 15)
   - Column 4: September (from point 2)
   - Column 5: December (from point 13)

3. We know that there are 5 different favourite beverages, so each cell in the Beverage column will have one of the beverages. Let's assign them:
   - Row 1: beer (from point 12)
   - Row 2: coffee (from point 5)
   - Row 3: tea (from point 3)
   - Row 4: milk (from point 8)
   - Row 5: water (from point 15)

4. We know that there are 5 different jobs, so each row will have one of the jobs. Let's assign them:
   - Row 1: teacher (from point 12)
   - Row 2: photographer (from point 7)
   - Row 3: musician (from point 6)
   - Row 4: police-officer (from point 13)
   - Row 5: paramedic (from points 10 and 15)

5. We know that there are 5 different pets, so each row will have one of the pets. Let's assign them:
   - Row 1: cat (since it's not mentioned yet and the paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the cat)
   - Row 2: dog (from point 2)
   - Row 3: bird (from point 6)
   - Row 4: fish (since it's not mentioned yet)
   - Row 5: horse (since it's not mentioned yet and the photographer is on the left or right of the owner of the horse)

6. Now we need to find the position of the remaining pet, horse. Since the photographer is on the left or right of the owner of the horse, it must be in column 4 or 5. However, the only available spot in column 5 is already occupied by the police-officer. So, the horse must be in column 4.

7. Now we know that the owner of the horse is in row 5, which means the photographer is in row 2. So, the owner of the cat must be in row 1.

8. Now we can fill in the remaining pets:
   - Row 1: cat
   - Row 2: dog
   - Row 3: bird
   - Row 4: fish
   - Row 5: horse

Here is the final solution table:
