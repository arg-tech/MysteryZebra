Zebra_domain_replacements_0	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Here's the final solution table:

```
|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Music-Genre	| indie	| pop	| techno	| electronic	| trance	|
| Food		| onion	| zucchini	| carrot	| radish	| lettuce	|
| Game	| go	| domino	| monopoly	| mah-jongg	| chess	|
| House		| colonial	|	| gothic-revival	| townhouse	| futuristic	| Victorian	|
| Flower		| marigold	| azalea	| bellflower	| dahlia	| orchid	|
```

Here's how we filled in the table:

1. Since the fan of indie is the person eating onion, we place indie in the first row, first column, and onion in the fifth row, first column.
2. The fan of pop is the person growing azalea, so we place pop in the second row, second column, and azalea in the sixth row, second column.
3. The person playing go is the person eating zucchini, so we place go in the third row, third column, and zucchini in the fifth row, third column. Since zucchini is to the right of carrot, we place carrot in the fifth row, second column.
4. The fan of techno is the person playing domino, so we place techno in the fourth row, fourth column, and domino in the third row, fourth column.
5. The person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot, so we cannot place them in the first five positions. Therefore, we place them in the sixth row, third column.
6. The colonial house is the person growing bellflower, so we place colonial in the first row, fifth column, and bellflower in the sixth row, fifth column.
7. The Victorian house is the person eating radish, so we place Victorian in the first row, fourth column, and radish in the fifth row, fourth column.
8. The person playing monopoly is in the middle, so we place monopoly in the third row, middle column. Since there are only five people, the middle column must contain the fifth food, lettuce.
9. The fan of electronic is on the far left, so we place electronic in the second row, first column.
10. The gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold. Since the Victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid, and we already placed the Victorian house, the only available position for the gothic-revival house is the second row, third column. Therefore, the person growing marigold must be in the first row, third column. So, we place marigold in the sixth row, third column.
11. The Victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid. Since the gothic-revival house is to the left or right of the person who grows marigold, and we already placed the gothic-revival house, the only available position for the Victorian house is the first row, fourth column. Therefore, we place orchid in the sixth row, fourth column.
12. The townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg, so we place townhouse in the second row, fifth column, and mah-jongg in the third row, fifth column.
13. The fan of trance is the futuristic house, so we place trance in the fifth row, fifth column, and futuristic in the first row, fifth column.
14. The fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since the fan of electronic is already placed, and the only available positions for the electronic fan are the second and fourth columns, the person eating lettuce must be in the fifth row, second or fourth column. However, since the person playing monopoly is in the middle, the person eating lettuce cannot be in the middle column. Therefore, we place lettuce in the fifth row, fourth column.

Zebra_domain_replacements_1	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning the music-genres, jobs, hobbies, and sports to the rows and columns.

1. Since the fan of gospel is traveling to Prague, we can place gospel in the Prague cell (row 1, column 5).
2. The fan of d&b plays ice-hockey, so we can place d&b in the ice-hockey cell (row 2, column 3).
3. The chef is traveling to Hannover, so we can place chef in the Hannover cell (row 3, column 1).
4. The fan of ambient is the bartender, so we can place ambient in the bartender cell (row 4, column 2).
5. The person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh, so the order is Edinburgh, Hannover. Since the chef is in Hannover, the person traveling to Edinburgh must be in row 1, column 4 (music-genre).
6. The person who's hobby is sudoku is the person who's sport is baseball, so we can place sudoku in the baseball cell (row 5, column 1) and baseball in the corresponding hobby cell (row 1, column 5).
7. The person who's hobby is photography is traveling to Rome, so we can place photography in the Rome cell (row 2, column 4).
8. The dressmaker is in the middle, so we can place dressmaker in the Edinburgh cell (row 1, column 3).
9. The fan of soul is on the far left, so we can place soul in the first column (column 1).
10. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person traveling to Edinburgh (dressmaker) is in the middle, the person who's sport is badminton must be in row 3 or 5. If it's in row 3, the person who's hobby is filmmaking would be in column 2 or 4. However, since the fan of ambient (bartender) is in column 2, the person who's sport is badminton must be in row 5. So, we can place badminton in the badminton cell (row 5, column 3) and filmmaking in the corresponding hobby cell (row 2, column 4).
11. The person who's hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in column 4, the person who's sport is cricket must be in column 2 or 6. However, since the person traveling to Edinburgh (dressmaker) is in column 3, the person who's sport is cricket must be in column 2. So, we can place cricket in the cricket cell (row 4, column 2).
12. The person who's hobby is skydiving is the software-developer, so we can place skydiving in the software-developer cell (row 5, column 5).
13. The fan of blues is the person who's hobby is cooking, so we can place blues in the cooking cell (row 3, column 5).
14. The fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin. Since the person traveling to Edinburgh (dressmaker) is in column 3, the person traveling to Berlin must be in column 4 or 5. However, since the person who's hobby is photography is in column 4, the person traveling to Berlin must be in column 5. So, we can place Berlin in the Berlin cell (row 5, column 5).

Now, let's put '#############' around the final solution table:

This is the final solution table for the given logic puzzle."
Zebra_domain_replacements_2	"To solve this logic puzzle, we can use a process of elimination and deduction. Let's start by assigning variables to each unknown:

| Job   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| City  | A | B | C | D | E |
| Genre | F | G | H | I | J |
| House | K | L | M | N | O |
| Hobby | P | Q | R | S | T |

Now let's apply the given clues:

1. The manager is the person traveling to Venice (A = A)
2. The journalist is the person who's hobby is writing (Q = P)
3. The fan of rock is the person traveling to Hamburg (G = B)
4. The analyst is the fan of salsa (I = 4)
5. The person traveling to Hamburg is to the right of the person traveling to Colone (B > C)
6. The modern house is the person who's hobby is collecting (O = M)
7. The palace house is the person traveling to New York (L = D)
8. The fan of funk is in the middle (H = 3)
9. The police-officer is on the far left (3 = P)
10. The wooden house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing (9 or 10 = R)
11. The palace house is to the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess (D = S or E)
12. The colonial house is the fan of dubstep (N = I)
13. The engineer is the gothic-revival house (O = 5)
14. The police-officer is to the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool (3 = A or E)

Now we can start filling in the table with the known information:

| Job   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| City  | A | B | C | D | E |
| Genre | F | G | H | I | J |
| House | M | L | N | O | K |
| Hobby | P | Q | R | S | T |

From clue 14, we know that the police-officer is either in the first or last column. Since the police-officer is on the far left (3 = P), the manager (A) must be in the last column (E).

Now we can use clue 14 again to determine the position of the police-officer (3 = E or A). Since the police-officer is to the left of the person traveling to Liverpool (3 < A), the police-officer must be in the first column (3 = P).

Now we can fill in the remaining positions:

| Job   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| City  | A | B | C | D | E |
| Genre | F | G | H | I | J |
| House | M | L | N | O | K |
| Hobby | P | Q | R | S | T |

From clue 10, we know that the wooden house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing (9 or 10 = R). Since the modern house (M) is already assigned, the wooden house must be in the first column (9 = R).

Now we can use clue 12 to determine the position of the colonial house (N = I). Since the modern house (M) and the palace house (L) are already assigned, the colonial house (N) must be in the third column (C).

Now we can use clue 11 to determine the position of the palace house (D = S or E). Since the colonial house (N) is in the third column (C), the palace house (D) must be in the fifth column (E).

Now we can use clue 8 to determine the position of the fan of funk (H = 3).

Now we can use clue 5 to determine the position of the person traveling to Hamburg (B > C). Since the colonial house (N) is in the third column (C), the person traveling to Hamburg (B) must be in the fourth column (D).

Now we can use clue 4 to determine the position of the analyst (I = 4).

Now we can use clue 13 to determine the position of the engineer (O = 5).

Now we can use clue 2 to determine the position of the journalist (Q = P).

Now we can use clue 1 to determine the position of the manager (A = A).

Now we can use clue 6 to determine the position of the person who's hobby is collecting (M = O).

Now we can use clue 9 to determine the position of the police-officer (3 = P).

Now we can use clue 10 to determine the position of the person who's hobby is drawing (R = 1 or 2). Since the wooden house (R) is in the first column, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in the second column (Q = 2).

Now we can use clue 3 to determine the position of the fan of rock (G = B).

Now we can use clue 7 to determine the position of the palace house (L = D).

Now we can use clue 12 to determine the position of the colonial house (N = C).

Now we can use clue 14 to determine the position of the person traveling to Liverpool (A < E).

Now we can use clue 11 to determine the position of the person who's hobby is chess (S = E or D). Since the palace house (D) is already assigned, the person who's hobby is chess must be in the fifth column (S = E).

Now we can use clue 6 to determine the position of the person who's hobby is collecting (M = O).

Now we have the final solution table:

#############
| Job   | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|-------|---|---|---|---|---|
| City  | A | B | C | D | E |
| Genre | F | G | H | I | J |
