Einstein_orig_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Let's assign variables to each category:
   - C: Color
   - N: Nationality
   - P: Pet
   - B: Beverage
   - S: Cigar

2. From the given information, we can make some initial assumptions:
   - There are 5 different colors, so each cell in the first column should contain a unique color.
   - Similarly, each cell in the last column should contain a unique nationality, cigar brand, pet, and beverage.

3. Let's start with the nationalities:
   - The norwegian is on the far left (N1), so N1 = norwegian.
   - The swedish is the owner of the dog (N4 = dog), so N4 = swede.
   - The german is the prince-smoker (S3 = prince), so N3 = german.
   - The british is the person who likes red (C1 = red), so N2 = british.
   - The remaining nationality is danish (N5 = danish).

4. Now let's fill in the pets:
   - The swedish is the owner of the dog (P4 = dog), so P1, P2, P3, and P5 are the remaining pets.
   - The pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird (P6 = bird).
   - The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (P2, P3, or P5 are the owners of the cat).
   - The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (P4 or P5 are the owners of the horses).
   - The norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue (P1, P2, or P3 are the pets of the person who likes blue).
   - The remaining pet is the owner of the fish (P5 = fish).

5. Let's fill in the beverages:
   - The person drinking milk is in the middle (B3 = milk).
   - The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (C1 < C2), and the person who likes green is the person drinking coffee (B2 = coffee).
   - The person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker (S5 = yellow).
   - The person drinking tea is the danish (B4 = tea).
   - The remaining beverage is water (B5 = water).

6. Let's fill in the cigars:
   - The bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer (S2 = beer).
   - The pall-mall-smoker is the owner of the bird (S6 = pall-mall).
   - The german is the prince-smoker (S3 = prince).
   - The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking water (S1 or S5 are the blend-smokers).
   - The remaining cigar is the master (S4 = master).

7. Now we have the final solution table:

   |		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
   | Color		| red	| green	| white	| blue	| yellow	|
   | Nationality	| british	| danish	| german	| swede	| norwegian	|
   | Pet		| cat	| bird	| dog	| fish	| horse	|
   | Beverage	| beer	| coffee	| milk	| tea	| water	|
   | Cigar		| bluemaster	| pall-mall	| prince	| master	| blend	|

Putting '#############' around the final solution table:
