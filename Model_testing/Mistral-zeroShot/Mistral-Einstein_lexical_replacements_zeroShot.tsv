Einstein_lexical_replacements_1	"Solving this puzzle step by step:

1. Place the Indonesian on the far left (position 1) as per condition 9. Since there are 5 nationalities, the Indian must be in position 2 (condition 14), the Japanese in position 3 (condition 14), the Nigerian in position 4 (condition 1), and the Chinese in position 5 (remaining nationality).

2. Place the Nationalities across the top row accordingly.

3. Since the person who likes brown is on the left of the person who likes lavender (condition 4), and the person who likes brown is the person drinking lemonade (condition 5), we can place Brown and Lemonade in positions 1 and 2 in the 3rd and 4th columns respectively.

4. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle (condition 8), it must be in position 3. So, Almond-Milk goes in the 3rd column.

5. Since the davidoff-smoker is the owner of the goat (condition 6), the goat must be with the Davidoff-smoker. Since the person who likes brown is on the left of the person who likes lavender (condition 4), and the person who likes brown is the person drinking lemonade (condition 5), the goat must be on the right of the lemonade (position 4). So, Davidoff goes in position 5 and Goat goes in position 4.

6. Since the person who likes emerald is the old-henry-smoker (condition 7), Old-Henry must be in a position where the corresponding color is Emerald. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle (condition 8), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be on the left or right of the Old-Henry-smoker (condition 11). So, Hot-Chocolate can't be in position 2, and it must be in position 1 or 3. If it were in position 1, the Old-Henry-smoker would have to be in position 3, but then the person drinking almond-milk would be in the middle (condition 8), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Hot-Chocolate must be in position 3, and Emerald must be in position 2. So, Old-Henry goes in position 2.

7. Since the cain-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret (condition 10), and the cain-smoker is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (condition 15), the Cain-smoker can't be in position 1 or 3. So, Cain goes in position 4 or 5. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle (condition 8), the person drinking mirinda must be on the left or right of the Cain-smoker (condition 12). So, Mirinda can't be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, Cain goes in position 5, and Mirinda goes in position 1.

8. Since the indian is the aristoff-smoker (condition 13), Aristoff goes in position 2.

9. Since the person who likes pink is on the left or right of the Indonesian (condition 14), the person who likes pink can't be in position 1. So, Pink goes in position 2, 3, or 4. If Pink were in position 2, the person who likes lavender would have to be in position 1, but then the person who likes brown would be on the right of the person who likes lavender (condition 4), which is a contradiction. If Pink were in position 3, the person who likes turquise would have to be in position 1, but then the person who likes brown would be on the left of the person who likes lavender (condition 4), which is a contradiction. Therefore, Pink goes in position 4.

10. Since the person who likes turquise is the Nigerian (condition 1), Turquise goes in position 1.

11. Since the swedish is the owner of the hamster (condition 2), Hamster goes in position 5.

12. Since the person who likes lavender is on the right of the person who likes brown (condition 4), and the person who likes lavender can't be in position 1 (condition 9), the person who likes lavender must be in position 2. So, Lavender goes in position 2.

13. Since the remaining color is pink (condition 1), it goes in position 3.

14. Since the remaining beverage is soy-milk (condition 3), it goes in position 4.

15. Since the remaining pet is the ferret (condition 6), it goes in position 1.

1. We know the malaysian likes apricot, so we can place them in the first row, first column (A1).
