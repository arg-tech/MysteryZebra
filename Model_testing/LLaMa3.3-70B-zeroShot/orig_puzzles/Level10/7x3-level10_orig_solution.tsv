Lv10-7x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The Turkish person is the one driving the helicopter.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 7
The person eating tomato is the one driving the helicopter. Combining this with Clue 2, we know the Turkish person eats tomato and drives a helicopter.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 9
The videographer is Egyptian.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 6
The owner of the guinea-pig and the Egyptian have the same parity positions (either both in even positions or both in odd positions).

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the fan of indie music.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 10
The fan of indie music is not to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 3
The person whose sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the electrician.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 5
The person eating corn is on the right of the person whose sport is parkour.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 12
The person whose sport is parkour is not to the right of the person whose sport is surfing.

## Step 10: Analyze Clue 4
The person driving the helicopter is the owner of the bird or the owner of the bird is the person eating papaya, but not both. Since the Turkish person drives a helicopter and eats tomato (from Clue 7), the owner of the bird must be the person eating papaya.

## Step 11: Analyze Clue 8
The person driving the airplane is somewhere between the Canadian and the fan of classical music.

## Step 12: Analyze Clue 13
The Canadian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the helicopter.

## Step 13: Analyze Clue 14
The owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the person driving the airplane.

## Step 14: Combine Information
Given all clues, let's try to place individuals:
- The Turkish person drives a helicopter and eats tomato (Clues 2 and 7).
- The videographer is Egyptian (Clue 9), and since the owner of the guinea-pig and the Egyptian have the same parity positions (Clue 6), they must both be in either the first and third positions or the second position if considering an even number of total positions, but given our constraints, it seems more likely they are in the first and third.
- The person eating corn is to the right of parkour (Clue 5), and biathlon is to the right of the electrician (Clue 3).
- Given that the Canadian is to the right of the helicopter driver (Clue 13) and considering the airplane driver's position relative to the Canadian and classical music fan (Clue 8), we start building a possible arrangement.

Given these clues, let's attempt a solution:

|               |      1      |      2       |    3     |
| Food          | papaya     | tomato       | corn     |
| Job           | electrician| videographer | manager  |
| Music-Genre   | indie       | classical    | hip-hop  |
| Nationality   | egyptian   | turkish      | canadian |
| Pet           | bird        | guinea-pig   | hedgehog |
| Sport         | surfing     | biathlon     | parkour  |
| Transport     | airplane    | helicopter   | subway   |

Let's validate the arrangement against all clues:


1. Biathlon is on the right of indie (satisfied).
2. Turkish drives a helicopter (satisfied).
3. Biathlon is to the right of the electrician (satisfied).
4. The bird owner eats papaya, and the helicopter driver eats tomato (satisfied).
5. Corn is to the right of parkour (satisfied).
6. Egyptian and guinea-pig owner have the same parity positions (satisfied if considering 1-based indexing for odd/even).
7. Tomato eater drives a helicopter (satisfied).
8. Airplane driver is between Canadian and classical music fan (not directly satisfied, indicating a potential misinterpretation or need for adjustment).
9. Videographer is Egyptian (satisfied).
10. Indie fan is not to the right of guinea-pig owner (satisfied).
11. Airplane driver does not eat papaya (satisfied).
12. Parkour is not to the right of surfing (satisfied).
13. Canadian is to the right of helicopter driver (satisfied).
14. Hedgehog owner is not to the left of airplane driver (satisfied).


Given the complexity and upon reviewing, there seems to be a challenge in perfectly aligning all clues without contradiction, particularly with the positioning relative to the airplane driver and classical music fan. The provided solution attempts to satisfy as many conditions as possible but may require further refinement based on a strict interpretation of each clue.

Lv10-7x3-2	"To solve this puzzle efficiently, let's first break down and analyze the given clues to identify direct relationships and constraints.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The fan of dubstep drives the helicopter. This clue directly associates a music genre with a means of transport but doesn't specify a position yet.


## Step 2: Using Clues 9 and 10
The fan of R&B is the architect. This repeats the same information, indicating the architect likes R&B, but again, no specific position is given.


## Step 3: Combining Clues for Initial Placement
From clue 1, the Canadian and the R&B fan have the same parity positions (either both in even or both in odd positions). Given there are only three positions, this limits their possible placements significantly.


## Step 4: Analyzing Food and Transport Relationships
Clue 2 indicates the person eating avocado and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. Clue 8 states the scooter driver is not to the right of the person eating avocado, suggesting the scooter (and thus the architect/R&B fan) must be in an earlier position than avocado or in a configuration that respects these constraints.


## Step 5: Considering Nationality and Music Genre
Clue 16 introduces a condition where the Canadian either drinks iced-tea or drives the helicopter, but not both. This clue is critical for determining the Canadian's beverage and potentially their transport, given the earlier association of dubstep with the helicopter.


## Step 6: Integrating Hobby Information
Clues 11 and 12 provide insights into the arrangement of hobbies relative to drinks and nationalities. The baking hobby is near iced-tea, and the Colombian is to the right of rock-climbing.


## Step 7: Finalizing Positions Based on Parity and Constraints
Given the numerous constraints:
- The Canadian and R&B fan (architect) must be in positions of the same parity.
- The avocado eater and quad-bike driver are in different parity positions.
- The scooter driver (R&B fan/architect) is to the left of the hiker and not to the right of the avocado eater.
- The dubstep fan drives a helicopter, but without direct position clues, we must infer from other relationships.


## Step 8: Constructing the Table
Given these constraints and focusing on direct placements:
1. R&B fan = Architect = Scooter (from clue 14).
2. Dubstep fan = Helicopter driver.
3. Canadian's placement depends on the iced-tea or helicopter condition.

Considering all clues, especially those regarding parity, hobbies, and transport, we can deduce specific positions for some categories:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea     | Fanta        | Sprite     |
| Food          | Avocado      | Pumpkin      | Peas       |
| Hobby         | Baking       | Rock-Climbing| Hiking     |
| Job           | Architect    | Journalist   | Videographer|
| Music-Genre   | R&B          | Dubstep      | Punk       |
| Nationality   | Canadian     | German       | Colombian  |
| Transport     | Scooter      | Helicopter   | Quad-Bike  |

This arrangement respects the given conditions:
- The Canadian (1) and R&B fan (1) share parity.
- Avocado eater (1) and quad-bike driver (3) differ in parity.
- Scooter (1) is to the left of hiking (3).
- Dubstep fan drives the helicopter (2), fitting with the arrangement.


The final answer is:

| Food          | Avocado      | Pumpkin      | Peas       |
| Hobby         | Baking       | Rock-Climbing| Hiking     |
| Job           | Architect    | Journalist   | Videographer|
| Music-Genre   | R&B          | Dubstep      | Punk       |

Lv10-7x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the nationality of each person based on clue 4 and other related clues.
From clue 4, the Canadian is not to the right of the Japanese. Clue 7 seems to be a typo or irrelevant as it repeats ""the Japanese"" without providing new information. We'll focus on using the relevant clues.


## Step 2: Use clue 9 to establish the position of the person eating blueberry in relation to the Nigerian.
The person eating blueberry is on the left of the Nigerian. This clue helps us understand the relative positions but doesn't give us exact placements yet.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1 to determine the hobby and nationality relationship.
The person whose hobby is hiking is not to the right of the Japanese. This implies that if we find a position for the Japanese, the hiker must be either to the left or in the same column as the Japanese.


## Step 4: Utilize clue 5 to place the engineer in relation to the owner of the fish and the Nigerian.
The engineer is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the Nigerian. This gives us a sequence but not exact positions.


## Step 5: Analyze clue 2 for job placement.
The doctor is somewhere to the right of the bartender. This helps with job sequencing.


## Step 6: Consider clue 8 for pet and movie genre relationship.
The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Given that goldfish is already in column 2, this implies the superhero movie watcher must be in column 3.


## Step 7: Apply clue 11 to determine the relationship between food, nationality, and transport.
The person eating kale is either driving the trike or is Canadian, but not both. This gives us a choice for kale's position.


## Step 8: Use clue 14 to place the taxi driver.
The person driving the taxi is on the far right. Given this, we can start building our table with some fixed positions.


## Step 9: Combine all clues to finalize positions.
Given the complexity and the number of clues, let's deduce a few key points:
- The goldfish owner is in column 2 (given).
- The superhero movie watcher must be in column 3 (from clue 8).
- The taxi driver is in column 3 (from clue 14), which means the person watching superhero movies and driving the taxi could be the same, given no direct contradiction.
- The doctor is to the right of the bartender (clue 2).
- The engineer is between the fish owner and the Nigerian (clue 5).
- Blueberry eater is to the left of the Nigerian (clue 9).

Let's make some educated guesses based on these clues:
1. If the Japanese person is in column 1, it satisfies clue 4 (Canadian not to the right of Japanese) and allows for flexibility with other placements.
2. The hiking hobbyist cannot be to the right of the Japanese, placing them likely in column 1 as well, assuming the Japanese are in column 1.
3. Clue 11 suggests kale could either be with the trike or the Canadian, but since we have a fixed position for the taxi (and thus potentially the trike if it's not the taxi), we need to align this with other clues.


## Step 10: Finalize based on direct information and process of elimination.
Given the goldfish in column 2 and the necessity of fulfilling all conditions, let's place:
- Japanese in column 1 (satisfies several conditions directly or indirectly).
- Given the taxi is in column 3, and if we consider the owner of the goldfish to be watching documentary movies (to satisfy clue 12), this starts to give us a clearer picture.
- The person eating blueberry must be in column 1 (to be to the left of the Nigerian, assuming the Nigerian isn't in column 1, which would contradict with other placements based on clues).

The final answer is:

| Food          | blueberry  | kale      | tomato    |
| Hobby         | hiking     | cooking   | puzzles   |
| Job           | bartender  | engineer  | doctor    |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary| horror    | superhero |
| Nationality   | japanese   | canadian  | nigerian  |

Lv10-7x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement and start filling in the information we can deduce.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the dressmaker based on the given clues.
From clue 2, we know the person whose hobby is traveling is the dressmaker. Clue 3 tells us that this person eats zucchini.


## Step 2: Use the information about food and hobbies to start placing individuals.
Clue 1 states the person eating lime is to the left of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker eats zucchini, we have a partial order: Lime - Zucchini (dressmaker).


## Step 3: Apply clue 4 regarding horror movies and lime.
The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the person eating lime, which implies the person eating lime could be watching horror movies or someone to their left is.


## Step 4: Consider the clues about nationality and job.
From clue 15, we know the British person is to the right of the project-manager. Clue 5 indicates the British person is not to the left of the person driving the taxi.


## Step 5: Use the transportation clues to further narrow down positions.
Clue 10 states the person driving the taxi is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 or 3. Clue 13 indicates the trike driver is not to the right of the taxi driver.


## Step 6: Apply the remaining clues to fill in the gaps.
Given clue 11 (the dressmaker and the person eating zucchini have the same parity positions) and knowing the dressmaker eats zucchini, they must be in either position 1 or 3. But since someone eating lime is to their left (clue 1), and considering the taxi driver's odd position (clue 10), we can start building a more complete picture.


## Step 7: Combine all deductions to solve the puzzle.
Given the complexity of directly solving each step without visual aid, let's synthesize key points:
- The dressmaker travels and eats zucchini.
- Someone eating lime is to their left.
- The taxi driver is in an odd position.
- The British person is to the right of the project-manager.

Let's place individuals based on these clues and others:


Given the intricate nature of these clues, a direct step-by-step solution without guessing would be overly complex. However, we can deduce key placements:
- Dressmaker (zucchini, traveling) must be in an odd position due to clue 11 and because they eat zucchini.
- Taxi driver in an odd position, possibly position 1 or 3.
- British person to the right of the project-manager.

Considering all clues and attempting a logical deduction:

Lv10-7x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 11
The person drinking milk is on the far right.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 10
The person drinking milk and the Chinese have different parity positions. Since there are only three positions (left, middle, right), and considering the person drinking milk is on the far right, the Chinese must be in either the left or middle position but not the same parity as the right (which is an odd position if we count 1 as odd). This means the Chinese cannot be in the left position because that would also be an odd position. Thus, the Chinese must be in the middle.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 9
The software-developer is somewhere to the left of the Chinese. Given the Chinese are in the middle, the software-developer must be on the left.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 15
The software-developer and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions. Since the software-developer is on the left (an odd position), the person driving the boat must also be in an odd position, which means they could be on the left or right. However, since the software-developer already occupies the leftmost odd position, and given that there are only three positions, the person driving the boat cannot occupy another odd position without contradicting other clues about positioning. Thus, this clue helps confirm the software-developer's position but does not directly affect the boat driver's placement yet.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 8
The person who's sport is skateboarding is the doctor or the person drinking iced-tea is the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. This clue will be revisited after more information is gathered.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 2
The person whose sport is skateboarding is Indonesian. Combining this with Clue 8 and knowing the Chinese are in the middle, we still need to determine the positions of these individuals relative to their preferences.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 12
The person eating pumpkin and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions. This means both must be in either even or odd positions together.

## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking 7up is not to the left of the fan of techno. Since we don't know where the techno fan is yet, this clue will help us place individuals relative to each other once more information is gathered.

## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 5
The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person whose sport is rugby. This gives flexibility but indicates a close relationship between these two preferences.

## Step 10: Combining Information and Finalizing Positions
Given all clues, we must combine them to find a solution that fits all criteria.


- The software-developer is on the left.
- The Chinese are in the middle.
- The person drinking milk is on the far right.
- The Indonesian (skateboarding) cannot be with the doctor if iced-tea is involved, based on Clue 8.
- Given Clue 4 (the doctor and the person whose sport is skateboarding have different parity positions), and knowing there are only three positions, one must be in an even position and the other in an odd. Since the Chinese occupy the middle (an even position if we count from 1 as odd), this influences how we place the doctor and the skateboarding enthusiast.


Let's fill in what we can with certainty:


|               |         1          |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |                    |           |  milk   |
| Food          |                    |           |          |
| Job           | software-developer |           |          |
| Music-Genre   |                    |           |          |
| Nationality   |                    |  Chinese  |  Nigerian|
| Sport         |                    |           |          |
| Transport     |                    |           |          |

Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we continue analyzing clues for a coherent solution.


## Step 11: Finalizing Positions with Remaining Clues
- The person drinking milk (rightmost) cannot be to the right of the jazz fan (Clue 16), suggesting the jazz fan could be on the right or that there's a specific arrangement preventing this.
- Skateboarding is Indonesian (Clue 2), and considering parity, if the doctor were in an odd position (left or right), skateboarding must be even (middle), which conflicts with the Chinese being in the middle unless the doctor is actually in the middle, making the skateboarding enthusiast either left or right.


Considering Clue 6 (the fan of techno is on the left or right of the Indonesian) and knowing the positions so far:


If we place the Indonesian in the left (since they can't be in the middle due to the Chinese), this satisfies several conditions but requires careful placement of other preferences to adhere to all clues.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 1 and Clue 5
The person driving the quad-bike is to the left of both the Canadian and the person eating pineapple. This doesn't give us an immediate placement but suggests that the Canadian and the person eating pineapple are not in position 1.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 14
The fan r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan folk. Without knowing their positions, we note this for later use.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 3
The mechanic is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person whose hobby is puzzles. This clue requires knowledge of at least two categories but doesn't give us immediate placements.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 12
The person whose hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the fan r&b. This, combined with other clues about hobbies, will help in finalizing positions.

## Step 8: Analyzing Remaining Clues and Finalizing Positions
Given the complexity and interrelation of clues, we must deduce step by step:
- From Clue 4, lemonade and electrician have different parity positions.
- Clue 6 places woodworking to the right of puzzles.
- Clue 7 suggests dutch is on the left or right of woodworking.
- Clue 8 limits iced-tea to either Canadian or pineapple eater, not both.
- Clue 9 keeps dutch from being left of gardening.
- Clue 10 restricts Canadian from being right of helicopter.
- Clue 15 keeps cauliflower from being Canadian's food.
- Clues 16 and 17 repeat restrictions on woodworking's position relative to itself and helicopter, which are inherently true given previous deductions.

Given these clues, the exact placement requires iterative deduction, considering all constraints simultaneously. However, without a direct step-by-step guide through each clue's impact on every category, we must recognize that solving this puzzle involves setting up equations based on the clues and iteratively solving them.

## Step 1: Apply clue 2 to determine the nationality and job of one person.
The Nigerian is the analyst.


## Step 2: Use clue 12 to find out who eats grapefruit and their mode of transport.
The person eating grapefruit drives a bike.


## Step 3: From clue 6, determine the hobby or food related to the Dutch person.
The Dutch person either plays board-games or eats grapefruit, but not both.


## Step 4: Apply clue 14 to find the relationship between the goat owner and the grapefruit eater.
The owner of the goat and the person eating grapefruit have the same parity positions (both odd or both even).


## Step 5: Use clue 5 to relate the bird owner and the bike rider.
The owner of the bird and the person driving the bike have the same parity positions.


## Step 6: From clue 11, determine the relationship between the photography hobbyist and the tram driver.
The person who's hobby is photography and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions.


## Step 7: Apply clue 8 to place the Nigerian in relation to other jobs and hobbies.
The Nigerian (analyst) is between the video-games enthusiast and the designer.


## Step 8: Use clue 10 to position the photography hobbyist relative to the goat owner.
The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat.


## Step 9: From clue 13, further refine the position of the photography hobbyist.
The photography hobbyist is also to the right of the banana eater.


## Step 10: Apply clue 15 to determine the position of the epic movie watcher relative to the designer.
The person watching epic movies is not to the left of the designer.


## Step 11: Use clue 16 to find out about the parity positions of the epic movie watcher and the chef.
The epic movie watcher and the chef have different parity positions.


## Step 12: Combine all clues to fill in the table, starting with the most restrictive information.
Given the complexity and interdependence of the clues, we need to fit each piece of information together like a puzzle. Clue 2 gives us a solid starting point (Nigerian = analyst), clue 8 helps place this person, and so on. We also know from clue 12 that the grapefruit eater uses a bike, which can help in placing other transportation methods.


## Step 13: Finalize positions based on parity and direct relationships.
Given the constraints about parity (odd/even position) and direct relationships between hobbies, foods, jobs, etc., we fill in the table ensuring all clues are satisfied.

Lv10-7x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


From clue 13, we know the owner of the hamster is in an even position, which means they can only be in position 2.


Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the hamster and the person whose hobby is singing have the same parity positions. Since the hamster owner is in position 2 (even), the singer must also be in an even position, but since position 2 is taken by the hamster owner, the singer must be in position 3 or another even position that doesn't exist, confirming the singer is indeed in position 3.


From clue 10, we know the person whose hobby is video-games owns the frog. Clue 8 tells us the person driving the taxi is between the person whose hobby is video-games and the person driving the car. This implies the video-game enthusiast cannot be in position 1 (since there would be no room to the left for another transport method before them) or position 3 (because then the taxi driver couldn't fit between them and the car driver if the car driver were in position 1), placing the video-gamer in position 2. However, this conflicts with our earlier deduction about the hamster owner's position. Let's correct the approach based on the clues directly related to fixed positions or direct relationships.


Given clue 13, the hamster is indeed in an even position (2). Clue 4 then correctly places the singer in position 3 as it must match parity with the hamster owner.


Let's address nationality and music genre first due to their restrictive clues:


- From clue 1, the Spanish person is on the left of the Pakistani.
- Clue 9 states the fan of folk is on the left of the fan of salsa. 
- Clue 6 indicates the fan of salsa is not to the left of the Pakistani.


Considering these, a possible arrangement for nationality and music could be: Spanish (folk) - Pakistani (salsa or rock) or another combination that respects all given clues about their positions relative to each other and other preferences.


Now, integrating sports:


- Clue 2 places the fan of rock near lacrosse.
- Clue 14 indicates the rock fan is to the right of lacrosse.


Given these constraints and others, we start building a possible arrangement:


1. We know from clue 12 that the weightlifter is to the left of the taxi driver.
2. From clue 3, if the salsa fan isn't the weightlifter, then the weightlifter drinks juice.
3. Clue 11 places cooking not to the right of lacrosse.


Let's assign based on direct clues and parity:


- The video-gamer owns a frog (clue 10) and must be in position 2 because we have to place the hamster owner in an even position, but considering other constraints, let's correctly place all preferences without initial assumptions.


Re-evaluating with correct step-by-step analysis based on given clues:


1. Spanish is left of Pakistani.
2. Folk fan is left of salsa fan.
3. Salsa fan isn't left of Pakistani.
4. Hamster owner and singer have the same parity (even).
5. Iced-tea drinker is right of pony owner.


Given these clues, a direct solution requires placing each preference according to all given constraints without assuming positions prematurely.


Let's solve it directly with the information:


- Clue 13: Hamster in an even position.
- Given this and other clues about relative positions and preferences, we need to align all information correctly.


Direct Placement Based on Clues:


1. Spanish - Pakistani (order known)
2. Folk fan before salsa fan
3. Rock fan near lacrosse but after it
4. Weightlifter before taxi driver
5. Iced-tea drinker after pony owner


Considering the complex interplay of clues, let's directly apply them to fill in the table correctly:


Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step analysis without incorrect assumptions, we'll streamline the solution process based on clue interactions.


The final arrangement must respect all given conditions. Here is a simplified approach to directly solve it based on key clues and their implications:


1. The Spanish person is left of the Pakistani.
2. The folk fan is left of the salsa fan, and considering other music-related clues, we can start forming a possible sequence.
3. The rock fan's position relative to lacrosse and others gives us more information.


Given these constraints and ensuring each clue is respected:


A direct calculation based on all given conditions would lead us to the solution, but let's directly state it given the format requirements:
