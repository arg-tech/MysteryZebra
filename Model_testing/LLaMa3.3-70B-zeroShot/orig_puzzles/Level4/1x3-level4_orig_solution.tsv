Lv4-1x3-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
2. The person who's sport is rugby is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is rugby is in an odd position.

From clue 2, we know that rugby is on the far right, which means it must be in position 3 (since there are only 3 positions).

From clue 3, we know that rugby is in an odd position, which confirms that it is indeed in position 3 (since 3 is an odd number).

Now, let's look at clue 1. We know that skateboarding is to the right of surfing. Since rugby is already in position 3, skateboarding must be in position 2, and surfing must be in position 1.

Here is the solution table:


#############
| Sport   |    1    |       2       |   3   |
|         | surfing | skateboarding | rugby |

Lv4-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person eating carrot is in an odd position.
2. The person eating cabbage is on the far left.

From clue 2, we know that cabbage is at position 1 since it's on the far left.


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            |        |

Now, considering clue 1, the person eating carrot must be in an odd position. Given there are three positions (1, 2, and 3), the odd positions are 1 and 3. However, since cabbage is already at position 1, carrot must be at position 3 to satisfy both clues.


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage |            | Carrot |

The only food left is watermelon, which by elimination, must be in position 2.


|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   | Cabbage | Watermelon | Carrot |

Therefore, the solution table with '##########' around it is:

Lv4-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person whose hobby is drawing is in an even position.
2. The person whose hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
3. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person whose hobby is drawing.

From statement 1, since there are only three positions and an even position can be either 2, we know the person who likes drawing must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.

Statement 3 directly tells us that the magic-tricks enthusiast is to the right of the drawing enthusiast. Given the drawing enthusiast is in position 2 (from statement 1), this means the magic-tricks enthusiast must be in position 3, as there is no position further to the right.

The only hobby left is board-games, which by process of elimination, must be in position 1 since positions 2 and 3 are already determined.

So, the final arrangement based on the given clues is:

#############
|         |      1      |    2    |      3       |

Lv4-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions for the jazz fan.
The jazz fan can only be in an odd position, which means they can be in position 1 or 3 since these are the only odd positions available.


## Step 2: Consider the position of the techno fan relative to the jazz fan.
The techno fan must be on the left of the jazz fan. If the jazz fan is in position 1, there's no space for the techno fan to be on their left. Therefore, the jazz fan cannot be in position 1 and must be in position 3.


## Step 3: Place the techno fan.
Given that the jazz fan is in position 3, the techno fan must then be in a position to the left of the jazz fan, which means they can only be in position 1 or 2. However, since the techno fan needs to be directly to the left of the jazz fan and there are three positions (with one being occupied by jazz), the techno fan must be in position 2 to satisfy the ""on the left"" condition indirectly by eliminating other options due to the constraints provided.


## Step 4: Place the country music fan.
The only remaining genre is country, which can now be placed in the only empty slot, position 1, as positions 2 and 3 are determined to be occupied by techno and jazz respectively based on previous steps.


## Step 5: Correcting the placement of techno and jazz fans based on the ""on the left"" condition.
Given that the techno fan must be on the left of the jazz fan, and considering the odd position requirement for the jazz fan, it means the techno fan should indeed be in position 1 (to be on the left) if we were strictly following the initial interpretation. However, this would conflict with the logic derived from step 2 and step 3 due to a misunderstanding of ""on the left"" implying direct adjacency isn't strictly necessary given the odd/even constraint already places jazz in an odd position. The correct placement should have techno directly before jazz if possible, but since jazz is in position 3 (an odd number), techno must indeed precede it, thus occupying position 2 does not fulfill ""on the left"" as directly as needed for a final solution without considering direct adjacency as a requirement.


## Step 6: Finalize positions based on constraints.
Re-evaluating the constraints and correcting the logic flow:
- The jazz fan is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Given that techno must be to the left of jazz, if jazz is in position 3, then techno can only be in position 1 or 2. But since country also needs a place and considering the ""on the left"" condition for techno relative to jazz, we have to ensure direct precedence.


The correct interpretation should directly address the puzzle's statement:
- If jazz is in an odd position (which could be 1 or 3), but considering techno must be on the left of jazz, then if jazz were in position 1, there would be no space for techno to its left. Thus, jazz must indeed be in position 3.
- With jazz in position 3, and knowing techno must precede it, techno should be in position 2 or 1 to be ""on the left."" Given country also needs placement and considering all positions, we finalize the arrangement.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | Country | Techno | Jazz |

Lv4-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues provided:


1. The person eating onion is to the left of the person eating papaya.
2. The person eating onion is in an odd position.


Given there are 3 positions and the types of food are kiwi, onion, and papaya, we need to figure out the arrangement based on the clues.


From clue 2, since the person eating onion must be in an odd position, this means they can only be in position 1 or 3. However, considering clue 1, if the person eating onion were in position 3, there would be no one to their right for them to be ""to the left of"" the person eating papaya (since papaya cannot be in a non-existent position 4). Thus, the onion must be in position 1.


Knowing this, and following clue 1 that the person eating onion is to the left of the person eating papaya, we can deduce the order as follows:


- Onion is in position 1 (because it's the only odd position where being ""to the left"" makes sense given our constraints).
- Papaya must then be in position 2 because it needs to be to the right of onion.


This leaves kiwi for position 3, as there are no other options left for it.


So, the final arrangement is:


|        |   1   |   2    |  3   |
| Food   | Onion | Papaya | Kiwi |


Therefore, the solution table surrounded by '#############' is:

Lv4-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:


1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.


Given there are 3 positions (1, 2, 3) and based on clue 2, hot-chocolate must be in position 2 since it's the only even position available.


So, we have:


- Position 2: Hot-chocolate


From clue 1, since hot-chocolate is to the left of mirinda, mirinda cannot be in position 1 (because then it would be to the left of hot-chocolate), so mirinda must be in position 3.


This leaves us with:


- Position 1: ? (Since hot-chocolate and mirinda's positions are determined)
- Position 2: Hot-chocolate
- Position 3: Mirinda


The only drink left for position 1 is 7up.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:


#############

Lv4-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions to determine the arrangement of jobs.


## Step 1: Apply the first condition
The engineer is on the right of the designer. This means the designer cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space for the engineer to the right of the designer.


## Step 2: Apply the second condition
The engineer is in an even position. Given there are three positions (1, 2, 3), the even positions are 2. This means the engineer must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Combine conditions to find the designer's position
Since the engineer is in position 2 and must be to the right of the designer, the designer must be in position 1.


## Step 4: Determine the analyst's position
With the designer in position 1 and the engineer in position 2, the only remaining position for the analyst is position 3.


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x3-8	"Let's analyze the given statements:


1. The teacher is in an odd position.
This means the teacher can be in position 1 or 3.

2. This statement doesn't provide any useful information as it just states the paramedic is the paramedic.

3. The teacher is on the right of the paramedic.
Given that the teacher must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and considering the teacher must be to the right of the paramedic, this means:
- If the teacher were in position 1, there would be no space for the paramedic to the left, which contradicts statement 3. Therefore, the teacher cannot be in position 1.
- This leaves us with the teacher being in position 3.

So, if the teacher is in position 3 and must be to the right of the paramedic, the paramedic must be in position 2 or 1. However, since statement 3 indicates the teacher (in position 3) is to the right of the paramedic, the paramedic cannot be in position 3, which we've established for the teacher, and logically cannot be in a position that would place them to the right of the teacher. Thus, the only position left for the paramedic that makes sense given our deductions so far is position 1 or 2, but since the teacher must be to the right of the paramedic, it means the paramedic has to be in position 1 (if in position 2, there would be no space to the left of the teacher for the paramedic).

This leaves us with:
- Paramedic in position 1.
- Teacher in position 3.

The only job left is the designer, which must then go into position 2.


Given this analysis, the final table should look like this:


#############
|       |    1     |     2     |    3    |
| Job   | Paramedic| Designer | Teacher |

Lv4-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position.

Given there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), and considering clue 2, the person drinking iced-tea can only be in position 1 or 3 since these are the odd positions.

However, if the person drinking iced-tea were in position 1, according to clue 1, there would be no one to their left drinking cola (since position 1 is the first and has no one to its left), which contradicts the requirement that iced-tea must be to the right of cola. Therefore, iced-tea cannot be in position 1.

This means iced-tea must be in position 3, as it's the only other odd position available.

Now, with iced-tea in position 3, and considering clue 1 that iced-tea is to the right of cola, cola must then be in either position 1 or 2. Since iced-tea is already determined to be in position 3, and it has to be to the right of cola, cola cannot be in position 2 (because then there would be no space for another beverage between cola and iced-tea). Therefore, cola must be in position 1.

The only remaining position is 2, which must then be occupied by Fanta, as all three beverages are different and the positions of cola and iced-tea have been determined.

So, the final arrangement is:

So, we have:
- Papaya in position 2.

Now, using the first clue that the person eating pepper is to the left of the person eating papaya, pepper must be in position 1 because it has to be to the left of papaya.

This leaves plum for position 3, as there's no other option left.
