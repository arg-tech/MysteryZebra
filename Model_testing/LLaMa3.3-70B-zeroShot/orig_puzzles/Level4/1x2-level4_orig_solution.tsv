Lv4-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the nationality of each person based on the given clues.


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions for the Indian.
Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2) and the clue states ""the indian is in an even position"", the Indian must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


## Step 2: Assign the nationality to each position based on the clues.
Since the Indian is in position 2, and there are only two nationalities (Indian and Polish), the person in position 1 must be Polish.


The final solution table with the requested format is:


#############
|               |   1    |   2    |
| Nationality   | Polish | Indian |

Lv4-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Understanding the positions and sports
We have two positions (1 and 2) and two sports (cycling and swimming). The statement ""the person who's sport is swimming is in an even position"" means that swimming must be associated with position 2 since it's the only even position mentioned.


## Step 2: Filling out the table
Given that swimming is in position 2, we can fill out the table as follows:

| Sport   |    1    |    2     |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cycling |         |          |
| Swimming|         |          |

Since swimming is in position 2 and there are only two sports, cycling must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Finalizing the table
Now, let's place the sports into their respective positions:

| Sport   |    1    |    2     |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Cycling |    X    |          |
| Swimming|         |    X     |

However, to represent this in a simpler form as requested, we acknowledge that position 1 is for cycling and position 2 is for swimming.


The final answer is: 
#############
| Sport   |    1    |    2     |
|---------|---------|----------|
|         | Cycling | Swimming |

Lv4-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues.


## Step 1: Understand the given information
We have two types of sports: sailing and snowboarding. The person whose sport is snowboarding is in an even position.


## Step 2: Apply the clue about the even position
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the person who prefers snowboarding must be in an even position, this means the person who prefers snowboarding must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Fill in the table based on the clues
Given that snowboarding is in position 2, sailing must then be in position 1, as these are the only two sports mentioned and each position can only hold one sport.


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |    1    |      2       |
| Sport   | Sailing | Snowboarding |

Lv4-1x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which movie genre is preferred by the person in position 1 and which is preferred by the person in position 2.


## Step 1: Determine the genre for position 1
Given that the person watching fantasy movies is in an odd position, and since there's only one odd position (position 1) mentioned, the person in position 1 must prefer fantasy movies.

## Step 2: Determine the genre for position 2
Since there are only two genres mentioned (fantasy and superhero) and we've already determined that the person in position 1 prefers fantasy, by elimination, the person in position 2 must prefer superhero movies.

The final answer is: ########. 
|               |    1    |     2     |

Lv4-1x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which sport is preferred by the person in position 1 and which sport is preferred by the person in position 2.


## Step 1: Determine the sport for position 2
The statement ""the person who's sport is volleyball is in an even position"" tells us that volleyball must be in either position 2, since it's the only even position available in the table.


## Step 2: Assign volleyball to position 2
Given the information from step 1, we can assign volleyball to position 2.


## Step 3: Determine the sport for position 1
Since there are only two sports mentioned (snowboarding and volleyball), and volleyball has been assigned to position 2, snowboarding must be the sport for position 1.


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given clue:

1. The Mexican is in an even position.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2) and the statement refers to the Mexican being in an even position, it implies the Mexican must be in position 2 because position 2 is the only even position available.


So, if the Mexican is in position 2, then by process of elimination, the Chinese person must be in position 1.

Here's the solution table:

Lv4-1x2-7	"Given the information:


## Step 1: Determine the positions and their corresponding sports.
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two sports (skiing and water-polo), we can start by placing water-polo in an odd position as per the first clue.


## Step 2: Apply the clue about the person who prefers water-polo being in an odd position.
The odd position available is position 1. Therefore, water-polo must be placed in position 1.


## Step 3: Place the remaining sport in the remaining position.
With water-polo in position 1, skiing must then be placed in position 2.


The final solution table based on the given clues is:

Lv4-1x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the information given:


## Step 1: Understanding the positions and pets
We have two positions (1 and 2) and two pets (goat and horse). The owner of the horse is in an even position.


## Step 2: Applying the rule about the horse's owner
Since the owner of the horse is in an even position, and our only even position is 2, the horse must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Determining the pet in position 1
Given that there are only two pets (goat and horse) and the horse is in position 2, the goat must be in position 1.


The final answer is: ########.

Lv4-1x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two types of food: artichoke and tomato.
2. The person eating artichoke is in an even position.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the person eating artichoke must be in an even position, this means the person eating artichoke must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.

So, if the person in position 2 is eating artichoke, then by deduction, the person in position 1 must be eating tomato.

Here's the solution table:

Lv4-1x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which mode of transport (bike or quad-bike) corresponds to each position (1 and 2). Given the clue:


1. The person driving the bike is in an even position.


Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is odd while position 2 is even, we can deduce that:


- Position 2 must be the bike because it's the even position.
- Position 1, which is given as quad-bike, fits the remaining mode of transport.


Therefore, the solution table should look like this:


#############
|             |     1     |  2   |
| Transport   | quad-bike | bike |
