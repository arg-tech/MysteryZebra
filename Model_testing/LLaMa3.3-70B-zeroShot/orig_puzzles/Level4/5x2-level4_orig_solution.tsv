From clue 1, ""the pakistani is on the right of the person watching epic movies,"" and since there are only two positions, this means the person watching epic movies must be in position 1, and the Pakistani must be in position 2.

Lv4-5x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the dog.
2. The person watching action movies is the manager.
3. The person watching action movies is in an even position (which means they are in position 2 since positions are counted as 1 and 2).
4. The scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.


From clue 3, we know the manager (who watches action movies) must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            |             |
| Job           |            |  Manager    |
| Movie-Genre   |            |  Action     |
| Pet           |            |             |
| Sport         |            |             |


From clue 2 and the information above, we've already filled in some of the table for position 2.


Now, considering clue 4, since the scientist must be on the left or right of the person who prefers surfing, and given that one of the positions is already occupied by the manager (who cannot be a scientist based on the job clue), the scientist must be in position 1. This also means surfing cannot be associated with the manager (since the manager is already determined to be in position 2), so it must be associated with the scientist or someone else, but since there are only two people, surfing's association will determine the sport for both positions.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            |             |
| Job           | Scientist |  Manager    |
| Movie-Genre   |            |  Action     |
| Pet           |            |             |
| Sport         |            |             |


From clue 1, almond-milk is on the right of the dog owner. Given that the manager (action movies) is in position 2 and must drink something, if the dog were associated with the scientist, then almond-milk would have to be on the left (which contradicts clue 1 since it says almond-milk is to the right of the dog), meaning the dog cannot be with the scientist if almond-milk is in position 2. This implies the dog's owner must be in position 1 for the statement about almond-milk being to its right to make sense, but considering our setup so far and the need to fulfill all conditions without contradiction:


- The manager (action movies) in position 2 must drink mirinda because if they drank almond-milk, it would contradict clue 1 since there's no one to their right for almond-milk to be ""on the right of.""
- Thus, almond-milk is associated with position 1.


Given this logic and revisiting our clues:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|  Mirinda    |
| Job           | Scientist |  Manager    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      |  Action     |
| Pet           | Dog       |  Lizard     |
| Sport         | Surfing   |  Volleyball |


This arrangement satisfies all the conditions given in the puzzle:


1. Almond-milk is to the right of the dog owner (dog is with the scientist, and almond-milk is indeed to its right).
2. The action movie watcher is the manager.
3. The person watching action movies is in an even position (position 2).
4. The scientist is next to the person whose sport is surfing (which, based on our deductions, must be associated with the scientist for all clues to fit without contradiction).


Therefore, the final solution table is:

|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|  Mirinda    |

Lv4-5x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the helicopter
From clue 2, we know the person driving the helicopter is on the far left. This means the transport for the first column is a helicopter.


## Step 2: Identify the dressmaker's transport
From clue 4, we understand the dressmaker drives a skateboard. Since there are only two types of transport mentioned and the helicopter is already assigned to the left, the skateboard must be on the right.


## Step 3: Place the lacrosse player relative to the basketball player
Clue 5 tells us that the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball. This means basketball must be on the left and lacrosse on the right.


## Step 4: Determine the nationality positions based on lacrosse
From clue 1, we know the Mexican is either on the left or the right of the person whose sport is lacrosse. Since lacrosse is on the right (from step 3), and considering the limited positions, the Mexican cannot be to the right of lacrosse because there's no position further to the right. Thus, the Mexican must be on the left.


## Step 5: Place the hobbies
Clue 3 states that the person whose hobby is Sudoku is in an odd position. Given we have two people (thus two positions), this means Sudoku must be on the left since it's the only odd position available (positions are 1 and 2, with 1 being odd).


## Step 6: Combine all information to fill out the table
- The helicopter is on the far left (Step 1).
- Basketball is on the left because lacrosse is on the right of basketball (Step 3).
- The Mexican is on the left (Step 4), which means the Japanese person must be on the right.
- Sudoku is on the left (Step 5), making puzzles the hobby for the right side.
- Since the dressmaker drives a skateboard and is not specified to have any particular sport or nationality, but given the skateboard is on the right (Step 2), the dressmaker must be on the right. This also means the doctor is on the left.


## Step 7: Finalize positions
Given all clues:
- Left: Mexican, Helicopter, Basketball, Doctor, Sudoku
- Right: Japanese, Skateboard, Lacrosse, Dressmaker, Puzzles


The final answer is:

Lv4-5x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


Given:
- Two types of food: cranberry, kiwi
- Two movie genres: action, horror
- Two music genres: blues, pop
- Two nationalities: Italian, Nigerian
- Two sports: cycling, skateboarding

Clues:
1. The fan of blues is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling.
2. The person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies.
3. The Nigerian is in an odd position.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues.


From clue 3, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the Nigerian must be in an odd position, the Nigerian can only be in position 1 because both positions are odd or even depending on how you count them, but given typical logic puzzle conventions, we'll proceed with assuming ""odd"" refers to the first position as it's a common interpretation.


So, initially:
|               |    1     |       2       |
| Food          |          |               |
| Movie-Genre   |          |               |
| Music-Genre   |          |               |
| Nationality   | Nigerian | Italian       |
| Sport         |          |               |

From clue 1, since the blues fan must be to the right of the cycling enthusiast:
- If cycling is in position 1 (Nigerian), then blues must be in position 2. 
- But we don't know the sport for the Nigerian yet.


From clue 2, the person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies.
- This means if action movies are watched by the person in position 1, then cranberry must be eaten by the person in position 2. 


Given these constraints:
- Let's assume cycling is associated with the Nigerian (position 1) because we need blues to be on the right of cycling, and there's no other way for this arrangement without violating other rules as they're introduced.
- If the Nigerian likes cycling (in position 1), then by clue 1, blues must be in position 2.


So, a possible arrangement:
|               |    1     |       2       |
| Food          | kiwi    | cranberry     |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | horror        |
| Music-Genre   | pop     | blues         |
| Nationality   | Nigerian| Italian       |
| Sport         | cycling | skateboarding |

This fits all given clues:
1. Blues is to the right of cycling.
2. Cranberry is to the right of action movies (assuming kiwi corresponds with action based on elimination).
3. The Nigerian is in an odd position.


Therefore, the solution table, taking into account the logical deductions and assuming the positions are numbered starting from 1 as ""odd,"" is:


#############
|               |    1     |       2       |
| Food          | kiwi    | cranberry     |
| Movie-Genre   | action  | horror        |
| Music-Genre   | pop     | blues         |
| Nationality   | Nigerian| Italian       |
| Sport         | cycling | skateboarding |

Lv4-5x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate.
2. The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.
3. The teacher is on the right of the Malaysian.
4. The person driving the motorbike is on the far right.


From clue 4, we know the motorbike rider is on the far right, which means they are in position 2.


## Step 1: Place the motorbike rider
Since the motorbike rider is on the far right (position 2), we start with this information:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |
| Job           |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |
| Nationality   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike  |


## Step 2: Apply clue 3 - The teacher is on the right of the Malaysian
This means the teacher cannot be in position 1, as there would be no one to their left. However, without knowing the exact positions of the Malaysian and the teacher yet, we'll have to come back to this after applying other clues.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 - The person watching romance movies is in an odd position
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is the only odd position available, the person watching romance movies must be in position 1.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |
| Job           |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance    |             |
| Nationality   |            |             |
| Transport     |            | Motorbike  |


## Step 4: Apply clue 1 - The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate
Since we've established that position 1 watches romance movies, and without knowing who eats pomegranate yet, let's consider clue 3 again in relation to clue 1. If the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian (clue 3), and given the motorbike rider is already placed on the far right (position 2), it means the Malaysian must be in position 1 because the teacher has to be to their right, which would be in position 2 if we were just considering these two clues. However, this seems to conflict with our placement based on other clues until we consider all possible arrangements.


## Step 5: Combine all clues
Given that:
- The motorbike rider is in position 2.
- The person watching romance movies is in position 1 (odd position).
- The teacher must be on the right of the Malaysian, which means if the Malaysian were in position 1, the teacher would have to be in position 2. But we know the motorbike rider is in position 2.


Considering all clues together:
- Since the person watching romance movies is in an odd position (position 1), and this does not directly conflict with any other clue once properly aligned, let's solidify that placement.
- The teacher being on the right of the Malaysian suggests a specific order but doesn't necessarily dictate the food or transport for each, except the motorbike rider is already placed.


Given these considerations and realizing we need to place the Malaysian next to someone eating pomegranate (which could be in either position based on initial readings), let's directly apply what we know about positions and preferences without assuming too much about the exact placement of food or nationality at first.


## Step 6: Finalize placements
Given the constraints:
- The motorbike rider is in position 2.
- Romance movies are watched by someone in position 1.
- The teacher must be to the right of the Malaysian, but since the motorbike rider occupies position 2, and considering other clues about movie preferences and transport, we need to align jobs, nationalities, foods, and transports correctly.


Since direct deductions lead to complexities without making some assumptions based on given data:
- Let's correct our approach focusing strictly on given information and logical deductions step by step.


Given the constraints directly from clues without over-assuming:


1. Malaysian is next to someone eating pomegranate.
2. Romance movies are in position 1.
3. Teacher is to the right of Malaysian.
4. Motorbike rider is in position 2.


Let's apply these directly and correctly:


If the romance movie watcher is in position 1, and considering other clues about transport (motorbike in position 2), we should look at job and nationality placements more closely with food.


Given that the motorbike rider cannot watch romance movies because they are in an even position (2), and must be either the teacher or not, depending on how we align jobs with nationalities and foods:


## Step 7: Correct Alignment
Let's realign based on strict clue interpretation:
- Since the person watching romance movies is in position 1, this fulfills the odd position requirement.
- The motorbike rider being in position 2 means they could potentially be the teacher if the Malaysian were in position 1, fulfilling ""the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian.""


However, direct placement without considering all possible alignments of food, job, and nationality together might lead to oversight. Let's correctly place based on clues:


- If the Malaysian is next to someone eating pomegranate and must be either in position 1 or 2 to fulfill this, considering other placements:
- The teacher being on the right of the Malaysian means if the Malaysian were in position 1 (watching romance movies), the teacher would indeed be in position 2.


Considering all clues strictly for a final alignment:


Given the need for direct and logical step-by-step reasoning without over-assumption, let's finalize based on given data:


The person watching romance movies is in position 1. Given this and other constraints about jobs, nationalities, foods, and transports, we should directly apply what we know without assuming placements not directly supported by clues.


Thus, considering all constraints for a logical solution:


Given that:
- The motorbike rider is on the far right.
- Romance movies are watched in position 1.
- The teacher must be to the right of the Malaysian.


Direct application and correct interpretation of clues lead us to consider how these fit together with food and nationality placements.


For the final table based on logical deductions from given clues:


Given all constraints, let's solve directly without over-assuming placements:


If the person in position 1 watches romance movies and considering other clues about transport (motorbike rider in position 2), job (teacher to the right of Malaysian), and the need for the Malaysian to be next to someone eating pomegranate:


The direct solution, considering all given information and applying logical deductions step by step without over-assuming placements, should directly reflect the clues provided.


Given this, let's place individuals based on jobs, nationalities, foods, movie genres, and transports as per the clues:

- Position 2: Teacher riding motorbike, eating pomegranate (fulfilling the condition of being next to the Malaysian and in position 2).

This alignment directly reflects the clues provided without over-assuming any placements.

Given this direct and logical application of clues:
The final table should accurately reflect the specific details about each individual's job, nationality, food, movie genre, and transport as per the provided clues. 

However, since we don't have explicit information on how to align all variables directly from the clues without making some inferences based on given constraints:

A logical approach considering the direct implications of clues would be:
- Position 1: Romance movies (fulfilling the odd position requirement).
- Position 2: Motorbike rider.

Considering nationalities, jobs, and foods with these positions:
- If the Malaysian is in position 1 watching romance movies, the teacher must be in position 2 to fulfill ""the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian.""
- Given the need for the Malaysian to be next to someone eating pomegranate, if they are in position 1, then position 2 (motorbike rider) could potentially eat pomegranate.

However, we must align all variables correctly:
- If the motorbike rider is the teacher and in position 2, this fulfills ""the teacher is on the right of the Malaysian"" only if the Malaysian is indeed in position 1.
- The condition that the Malaysian must be next to someone eating pomegranate can be fulfilled by having the person in position 2 eat pomegranate.

Given these considerations and aligning with the format provided for a direct answer:
The final answer is not explicitly stated as it requires making some inferences based on given constraints."
Lv4-5x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The owner of the hamster is in an odd position.
   - This means the hamster's owner can only be in position 1.

2. The fisherman is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
   - Since there are only two positions, this implies the person watching satire movies must be in position 1, and the fisherman in position 2.

3. The person drinking fanta is the fisherman.
   - From clue 2, we know the fisherman is in position 2. So, Fanta must be associated with position 2.

4. The musician is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
   - This means the musician must be in position 1 (since they have to be on the left), and the person whose sport is surfing must be in position 2.

Now, let's compile the information:

- Position 1: 
  - Beverage: Not Fanta (because Fanta is associated with the fisherman in position 2), so it must be Tea.
  - Job: Musician
  - Movie-Genre: Satire (from clue 2)
  - Pet: Hamster (from clue 1, since the hamster's owner is in an odd position)
  - Sport: Not Surfing (because surfing is associated with position 2), so it must be Ice-Hockey.

- Position 2:
  - Beverage: Fanta
  - Job: Fisherman
  - Movie-Genre: Horror (since satire is taken by position 1)
  - Pet: Rabbit (since hamster is in position 1)
  - Sport: Surfing

Here's the solution table:


#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |    Tea     |   Fanta   |
| Job           |  Musician  | Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   |  Satire    |  Horror   |
| Pet           |  Hamster   |  Rabbit   |
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey |  Surfing  |

Lv4-5x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the van.
2. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
3. The person drinking sprite is on the right of the person eating cucumber.


From clue 2, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and an even position means position 2, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.


Given clue 1, if the rock fan is to the right of the van driver, and considering the adventure movie fan is already placed in position 2, it implies the van cannot be driven by the person in position 2 (since there's no one to the right of position 2). Thus, the van must be associated with position 1.


Clue 3 tells us that the sprite drinker is to the right of the cucumber eater. Since the adventure fan is already in position 2, and we've determined the rock fan must also be in position 2 (to be to the right of the van driver), it means the cucumber eater cannot be in position 2 (because then the sprite drinker would have no place to be to their right). Therefore, cucumber must be associated with position 1.


Now, let's assemble what we know:


- Position 1: Van, Cucumber
- Position 2: Adventure, Rock


The only beverage left for position 1 is cola (since the sprite drinker is in position 2), and thus sprite is with position 2. For food, grapefruit must be with position 2 because cucumber is already associated with position 1.


For transport, roller must be with position 2 since van is with position 1.


Lastly, for movie-genre and music-genre, romance must go with position 1 (since adventure is in position 2), and disco must go with position 1 (since rock is in position 2).


So, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola    | Sprite    |
| Food          | Cucumber| Grapefruit|
| Movie-Genre   | Romance | Adventure |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Rock      |
| Transport     | Van     | Roller    |

Lv4-5x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and fill in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the nationality and pet for position 2 based on clue 4.
Given that the Indonesian is the owner of the rabbit and from clue 1, the owner of the rabbit is in an even position, we can place ""Indonesian"" and ""rabbit"" in position 2.

## Step 2: Apply clue 3 to determine the transport for each person.
Since the person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, and given that one person must be using a taxi (the other means of transport), we can start forming connections but need more information to solidify positions.

## Step 3: Use clue 2 to place the nurse in relation to board-games.
The person whose hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the nurse. This clue doesn't give us a specific position yet, but it tells us that these two activities are related to adjacent individuals.

## Step 4: Analyze possible positions for sudoku and board-games based on transport clues.
Since we know from clue 3 that the subway user is to the right of the sudoku enthusiast, and considering the nurse must be next to the board-games enthusiast (clue 2), we can start piecing together the relationships.

## Step 5: Piece together all information to fill out the table.
Given:
- The Indonesian owns a rabbit (position 2).
- The rabbit owner is in an even position, confirming position 2 for the rabbit and Indonesian.
- The subway user is to the right of the sudoku player.
- Board-games are next to the nurse.

Let's assume the nurse is in position 1 because if the nurse were in position 2, the board-games enthusiast would have to be either in a non-existent position 0 or an even position (which doesn't match our current setup since we're trying to fit all pieces). Thus:
- Position 1 could potentially be the nurse, but we need to fit in the hobbies and transport.

Considering the transport clue (subway to the right of sudoku), if sudoku were in position 1, the subway would have to be in position 2, which fits because it's to the right. But since the Indonesian is in position 2 with a rabbit, and we need to fit the nurse next to board-games, let's solidify:
- Position 2: Indonesian, rabbit.
Given the constraints, the dressmaker (other job) could be in position 1, but we have to figure out who does what and matches the transport.

Let's try placing sudoku in position 1 because it allows us to satisfy clue 3 easily by having the subway in position 2. However, this seems contradictory since we've established the Indonesian is in position 2. This means sudoku must be in position 1 (to satisfy the condition that subway is to its right), and thus board-games must be next to the nurse.

So:
- Sudoku is likely in position 1 (because it allows for the subway to be to its right, fitting clue 3).
- Board-games then could only fit next to the nurse if the nurse were also in one of these positions. Given sudoku's placement, board-games must be in position 2 or an adjacent position not mentioned directly in clues provided but inferred through elimination.

However, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in directly applying these steps without visually aligning all given conditions perfectly due to the complexity and interdependence of the clues.


## Step 6: Correctly Apply All Clues
Given the complexity and my initial approach's limitations, let's reconsider with strict adherence to clues:
1. Rabbit owner is in an even position (thus, position 2).
2. Board-games enthusiast is next to the nurse.
3. Subway user is to the right of sudoku player.

Directly from clue 4: Indonesian owns the rabbit and thus must be in position 2.


Given the constraints and directly filling based on clues without overcomplicating:
- Position 1 (Hobby): Sudoku (because if it were board-games, the nurse would have to be in a non-existent position 0 or an even number which doesn't fit with other given data).
- Position 2 (Hobby): Board-games (next to the nurse as per clue 2, and since sudoku is likely in position 1 to satisfy transport conditions indirectly through elimination).
- Job: Nurse must be next to board-games; hence, position 1 could have dressmaker to fit (since the nurse can't be with sudoku directly due to hobby adjacency requirements).
- Nationality: Position 2 is Indonesian.
- Pet: Rabbit in position 2.
- Transport: Subway to the right of sudoku means if sudoku is in position 1, subway must be associated with position 2.


However, my explanation has not strictly followed the clue application in a straightforward manner due to overanalysis and incorrect direct application of clues without visual aid. The proper method involves systematically eliminating possibilities based on given conditions until only one solution remains.


The final answer is:

Lv4-5x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:


1. The electrician is in an odd position.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies.
3. The person whose hobby is collecting is the writer.
4. The fan of house is on the far left.
5. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of indie.


From clue 1, the electrician must be in position 1 since it's the only odd position available.


From clue 4, the fan of house music is on the far left, which means they are also in position 1.


Given this information, we can start filling out the table:


|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |               |               |
| Hobby         |               |               |

| Music-Genre   | house         |               |


From clue 5, since the fan of house is on the far left, the fan of indie must be in position 2.


Now, our table looks like this:


|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |               |               |

| Music-Genre   | house         | indie         |


From clue 3, the person whose hobby is collecting is the writer. Since the electrician is already in position 1, the writer must be in position 2.


So, we update our table:


|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |               |               |

The only hobby left is rock-climbing, which must be in position 1.

| Music-Genre   | house         | indie         |


From clue 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This means the person watching spy movies must be in position 1, and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.


So, we update our table for movie genres:


|               |       1       |       2       |
| Beverage      |               |               |

| Movie-Genre   | spy           |               |
| Music-Genre   | house         | indie         |


The only movie genre left is sports, which must be in position 2.


Now, our table looks like this:

Lv4-5x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step to the given table.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The person eating cabbage is in an odd position. This means the person eating cabbage can only be in position 1.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The fan of house is on the far left or far right. Since there are only two positions, this clue suggests that if the house music fan is not in position 1, they must be in position 2.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person whose hobby is camping is on the left of the fan of soul. This implies that if the camper is in position 1, the soul music fan must be in position 2. However, we need to consider the positions relative to each other without assuming specific positions yet.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The Polish person is on the left of the person driving the bus. This clue indicates a relationship between nationality and transport but doesn't specify positions directly without considering other clues.

## Step 5: Combine Clues for Solution
From Clue 1, cabbage is in an odd position, so it's in position 1.
From Clue 2, house music could be in either position 1 or 2, but since cabbage (and thus potentially its associated characteristics) is already determined to be in position 1, we need to consider how the other clues interact with this setup.

Given Clue 3 and knowing cabbage is in position 1, if camping is also in position 1 (with cabbage), then soul must be in position 2. This starts to give us a possible arrangement:
- Position 1: Cabbage, Camping, ? (Music and Nationality to be determined)
- Position 2: ?, Soul, ?

Clue 4 indicates the Polish person is on the left of the bus user. If the Polish person is in position 1 (with cabbage and camping), then the bus must be in position 2, implying the train is in position 1.

Now, considering all clues together:
- Position 1 has cabbage, camping, and since house can be on the far left or right but soul is already determined to be in position 2 (from Clue 3), house could fit with cabbage and camping.
- The Polish person must be in position 1 because they are on the left of the bus user (Clue 4), which means kale, soul, and bus go together in position 2.

The final arrangement considering all clues is:
- Position 1: Cabbage, Camping, House, Polish, Train
- Position 2: Kale, Soul, Filmmaking, Pakistani, Bus

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | Cabbage | Kale       |
| Hobby         | Camping | Filmmaking |
| Music-Genre   | House   | Soul       |
| Nationality   | Polish  | Pakistani  |
| Transport     | Train   | Bus        |
#############


The final answer is:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | Cabbage | Kale       |
| Hobby         | Camping | Filmmaking |
