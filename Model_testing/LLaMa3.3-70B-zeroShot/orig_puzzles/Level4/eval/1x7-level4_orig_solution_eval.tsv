Lv4-1x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 4 - The Mexican is in the middle.
Since there are 7 positions, the middle position would be position 4. Therefore, the Mexican is in position 4.

## Step 2: Apply clue 2 - The Mexican is on the right of the Brazilian.
Given that the Mexican is in position 4, the Brazilian must be to the left of the Mexican, which means the Brazilian can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

## Step 3: Apply clue 5 - The Canadian is in an odd position.
The Canadian can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7 since these are the odd positions.

## Step 4: Apply clue 7 - The Brazilian is in an odd position.
Considering the Brazilian must be to the left of the Mexican (who is in position 4) and in an odd position, the Brazilian can only be in position 1 or 3.

## Step 5: Apply clue 1 - The Japanese is between the German and the Canadian.
Since the Japanese must be between the German and the Canadian, and considering the restrictions on positions from previous clues, we need to find a configuration that fits all given constraints.

## Step 6: Combine clues to determine possible configurations.
Given the Mexican is in position 4, and combining all other clues:
- If the Brazilian is in position 1 (odd), it satisfies clue 7. The Canadian must be in an odd position, which could be 3, 5, or 7, but considering the Japanese needs to be between the German and the Canadian, and the Mexican's fixed position, we have limited arrangements.
- The Russian is on the right of the Italian (clue 3), and since the Mexican is in position 4, this pair could potentially occupy positions 5 and 6 or 6 and 7, considering other constraints.

## Step 7: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given all constraints:
- Brazilian can be in position 1 (to satisfy being in an odd position and to the left of the Mexican).
- The German and Japanese need to be together with the Canadian on one side (clue 1), and since the Canadian is in an odd position, it's likely the Canadian is at one end or in a position that allows for this configuration.
- Considering clue 6 (the German is on the left of the Japanese) and clue 1, a possible arrangement could be German-Japanese-Canadian or Canadian-Japanese-German, but given the Canadian must be in an odd position, we can start testing configurations.

## Step 8: Test configurations.
If the Brazilian is in position 1, and considering all other clues:
- A possible configuration that respects most constraints would involve placing the Italian and Russian after the Mexican (since the Mexican is in the middle), which could fit with clue 3.
- Given the restrictions, let's place the Canadian in position 5 (an odd position) to satisfy clue 5. This means the Japanese must be between the German and the Canadian.

## Step 9: Final configuration.
Let's finalize a possible arrangement:
1. Brazilian
2. Italian
3. German
4. Mexican
5. Canadian
6. Japanese
7. Russian

This satisfies all given conditions when carefully considering each clue's impact on the arrangement.

Lv4-1x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
4. The person who's sport is golf is in an even position.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
6. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton.


From clue 2, we know snowboarding is at position 1.

From clue 5, since snowboarding is on the left of badminton and snowboarding is at position 1, badminton must be at position 2 or further to the right. But considering clue 6, which states soccer is on the left or right of badminton, and knowing that snowboarding (position 1) is already occupied, badminton's most likely early position would facilitate soccer being next to it without conflicting with other clues.


Clue 4 tells us golf is in an even position. Clue 1 indicates sailing is to the left of golf. Given golf must be in an even position, and considering the constraints, let's place golf for now, keeping in mind sailing must precede it.


Given these conditions:


- Snowboarding (1)
- Badminton could fit well at (2) given its relation to snowboarding and potential adjacency to soccer.
- Soccer then could fit at (3), allowing climbing to be at its right as per clue 3.
- Golf is in an even position, so let's place it at (4), satisfying clue 4 and giving sailing a spot before it, which would be (3) if we hadn't already placed soccer there. This means our initial placement needs adjustment for sailing and golf while keeping the even requirement for golf.


Adjusting based on the clues:


1. Snowboarding
2. Badminton
3. Soccer
4. Golf (even position as required)
5. Climbing (to the right of soccer, fulfilling clue 3)
6. Sailing can't be here because it needs to precede golf and we've placed golf at 4. So, our earlier step missed the precise placement considering all clues together.


Correcting for sailing before golf and ensuring all conditions are met:


1. Snowboarding
2. Sailing (must be before golf)
3. Badminton (snowboarding is to its left; now it also fits with soccer being adjacent)
4. Golf (even position, after sailing)
5. Soccer (next to badminton as required)
6. Climbing (to the right of soccer)


The only sport left is volleyball, which can fit into the last remaining spot.


Thus, the corrected sequence considering all clues should be:


1. Snowboarding
2. Sailing
3. Badminton
4. Golf
5. Soccer
6. Climbing
7. Volleyball


Given this analysis, the final solution table is:

Lv4-1x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues given and apply them step by step to determine the order of the jobs.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the paramedic
Given that the paramedic is in an even position (clue 7), the possible positions for the paramedic are columns 2, 4, or 6.


## Step 2: Apply the constraint between the paramedic and the videographer
The paramedic is on the right of the videographer (clue 1). This means if the paramedic is in column 2, the videographer must be in column 1. If the paramedic is in column 4, the videographer could be in column 3. If the paramedic is in column 6, the videographer could be in column 5.


## Step 3: Consider the pilot and firefighter relationship
The pilot is on the left of the firefighter (clue 5), and the firefighter is on the left of the software-developer (clue 2 and clue 6). This gives us a sequence: pilot -> firefighter -> software-developer.


## Step 4: Integrate the musician with the pilot
The musician is on the left or right of the pilot (clue 3). This means the musician could either be before or after the pilot in the sequence.


## Step 5: Consider the software-developer and videographer relationship
The software-developer is on the left or right of the videographer (clue 4). Given that we already have a sequence for the pilot, firefighter, and software-developer, we need to find where the videographer can fit with respect to the software-developer.


## Step 6: Combine all clues
Given the constraints:
- Paramedic is in an even column.
- Paramedic is to the right of the videographer.
- Pilot is to the left of the firefighter, who is to the left of the software-developer.
- Musician is next to the pilot.
- Software-developer is next to the videographer.

And considering that each job is unique and in a different column, we start building the sequence from the most restrictive clues.


## Step 7: Place the paramedic
Given the paramedic must be in an even position and to the right of the videographer, let's initially place the paramedic in column 4 (as it gives more flexibility for other placements). This means the videographer could be in column 3.


## Step 8: Sequence the pilot, firefighter, and software-developer
With the pilot before the firefighter, and the firefighter before the software-developer, we have a sequence. Since the musician must be next to the pilot, this gives us two possible sequences around the pilot: musician -> pilot or pilot -> musician.


## Step 9: Finalize positions considering all constraints
Let's place the pilot, musician sequence first since it has fewer restrictions than the paramedic and videographer sequence. If we consider the pilot in column 1 (to satisfy having the firefighter and then the software-developer after), the musician would have to be either before or after the pilot.


## Step 10: Final placement
Given all constraints, let's try placing the sequences:
- Pilot in column 1 doesn't work because it leaves no room for the musician to be next to the pilot without violating other conditions.
- So, considering the paramedic in column 4 and the videographer in column 3, we have: ?, ?, videographer, paramedic, ?, ?, ?.
- With the sequence of pilot -> firefighter -> software-developer and knowing the firefighter is before the software-developer, and the musician next to the pilot, a possible arrangement could be: musician/pilot, firefighter, videographer, paramedic, software-developer, teacher, ? (since teacher hasn't been placed yet).
- The only spot left for the musician or pilot that fits all conditions including being next to each other would indeed have the pilot and musician at the start, but considering the constraints about the firefighter and software-developer's positions relative to each other and the videographer, we adjust our approach.


## Step 11: Correcting Approach Based on Clues
Given the direct sequence clues (pilot -> firefighter -> software-developer) and indirect ones (paramedic to the right of videographer, paramedic in even column), let's correctly place:
- Pilot and musician need to be together.
- Firefighter must follow pilot.
- Software-developer follows firefighter.
- Paramedic is in an even column and after videographer.


## Step 12: Final Placement Attempt
Let's attempt a final placement considering all clues:
1. Musician (to satisfy the left or right of pilot condition, let's place musician first as it gives more flexibility).
2. Pilot (next to musician).
3. Firefighter (after pilot).
4. Paramedic (even column, so this fits).
5. Videographer (before software-developer and after paramedic doesn't work because paramedic must be after videographer; this step requires adjustment based on clue 1 and clue 7).
6. Software-developer (after firefighter, considering the sequence).
7. Teacher (last spot, as it's the only one left).

However, upon reevaluation:
- The correct placement for the paramedic being in an even column and after the videographer means we should have the videographer before the paramedic.
- Considering all sequences and constraints again for accurate placement.


## Step 13: Re-evaluation
Given the clues again and realizing the mistake in step placement regarding the videographer and paramedic, let's correctly place them with other professions:
- Musician or Pilot first (since they must be next to each other).
- Then, the sequence of pilot/firefighter/software-developer.
- The videographer must come before the paramedic, and since the paramedic is in an even column, this significantly restricts where the videographer and paramedic can be placed relative to our initial sequences.

Lv4-1x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. This means cycling can only be in position 1 or 7.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an even position. This means ice-hockey can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 4
The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since ice-hockey must be in an even position, and it has to be to the left of golf, possible positions for ice-hockey and golf are (2,3), (2,4) - which doesn't work because 4 is also an even position and would conflict with another sport needing an even position, (4,5), or (4,6) - again, not possible because 6 is even and needed for ice-hockey itself or another sport requiring an even position, or (6,7). However, given the constraint from clue 1 that cycling must be on the far left or right, and considering other clues, we have to fit all sports around these constraints.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. If cycling is in position 1, then tennis must be in position 2 or further to the right. If cycling is in position 7, then there's no room for tennis to its right.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 6
The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This clue, combined with clue 3, suggests that soccer must be in an odd position to the left of an even position where ice-hockey can reside.


## Step 6: Combine Information and Apply Remaining Clues
Given all clues, let's start building a possible arrangement:
- Cycling must be at either end (clue 1).
- Ice-hockey is in an even position (clue 3) and to the left of golf (clue 4), and to the right of soccer (clue 6).
- Tennis is to the right of cycling (clue 5).
- Lacrosse is to the right of tennis (clue 8), and swimming is next to lacrosse (clue 2).

Let's place cycling in position 1 for now, as it gives us more flexibility to arrange other sports:
- If cycling is in position 1, tennis must be to its right, potentially in position 2 or further. However, since ice-hockey needs an even position and must be to the left of golf and to the right of soccer, we have to carefully place these sports.

Considering ice-hockey's constraints and the need for it to be in an even position, let's try placing soccer in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of ice-hockey), but this conflicts with cycling needing to be at an end. So, let's reconsider and ensure we're using all clues effectively.


## Step 7: Detailed Placement
Given the constraints:
- Let's place cycling in position 1, which means tennis has to be in position 2 (to satisfy being on the right of cycling and leaving room for other sports).
- Soccer needs to be before ice-hockey. If soccer were in position 3, it would allow ice-hockey to be in an even position like 4, fitting the requirement that ice-hockey is to the left of golf.
- Ice-hockey being in position 4 allows golf to potentially be in position 5 (satisfying clue 4).
- Since lacrosse must be to the right of tennis and swimming is next to lacrosse, we have to fit these sports around the constraints provided by the placements of ice-hockey, soccer, golf, cycling, and tennis.

Let's try to place the remaining sports with these constraints in mind:
- Position 1: Cycling
- Position 2: Tennis (because it must be to the right of cycling)
- Position 3: Soccer (to satisfy being before ice-hockey)
- Position 4: Ice-hockey (even position, after soccer)
- Position 5: Golf (to the right of ice-hockey)
- This leaves positions 6 and 7. Lacrosse must be to the right of tennis, which could place it in position 6 at the earliest (since tennis is in position 2), but considering swimming needs to be next to lacrosse, we have a potential conflict if not arranged carefully.

Given that lacrosse must be after tennis and swimming must be next to lacrosse, let's finalize:
- Position 1: Cycling
- Position 2: Tennis
- Position 3: Soccer
- Position 4: Ice-hockey
- Position 5: Golf
- Position 6: Lacrosse (must be after tennis)
- Position 7: Swimming (next to lacrosse, and this satisfies cycling being at one end)

This arrangement seems to satisfy all given conditions.

## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left. This means position 1 is iced-tea.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 5
The person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since iced-tea is in position 1, milk must be in position 2.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The person drinking lemonade is in an even position. This means lemonade can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since lemonade must be in an even position and considering the restrictions from other clues, we need to find a suitable position for mirinda that allows lemonade to be to its right.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
The person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. However, since iced-tea is already on the far left (position 1), sprite must be in position 7.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | iced-tea | milk |         |          |       |       | sprite |

## Step 6: Determine Positions for Lemonade and Mirinda
Given that lemonade is in an even position and to the right of mirinda, and considering the restrictions from other clues, we can place mirinda in position 3 and lemonade in position 4. This satisfies clue 1 (lemonade in an even position) and clue 3 (lemonade to the right of mirinda).

|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |
| Beverage   | iced-tea | milk | mirinda | lemonade |       |       | sprite |

## Step 7: Place Fanta
The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, fanta must be in position 5.

|            |    1     |  2   |    3    |    4     |   5   |   6   |   7    |

## Step 1: Determine the position of basketball
The person who prefers basketball is in the middle, which means they are in position 4.


## Step 2: Place rugby
Rugby is on the far left, so it's in position 1.


## Step 3: Consider water-polo's position
Water-polo is on the far left or far right and in an odd position. Since rugby is already on the far left (position 1), water-polo must be on the far right, which is position 7.


## Step 4: Determine ice-hockey's position relative to water-polo
Water-polo is on the right of ice-hockey. Given that water-polo is in position 7, ice-hockey must be in position 6, as it has to be directly to the left of water-polo.


## Step 5: Place parkour
Ice-hockey is on the left or right of parkour. Since ice-hockey is in position 6 and there's no space to its right for parkour (as water-polo occupies position 7), parkour must be in position 5.


## Step 6: Position volleyball and snowboarding
Volleyball is on the left or right of both snowboarding and basketball. Given that basketball is in the middle (position 4) and considering the constraints, volleyball could potentially fit in positions 3 or 5. However, since parkour is already determined to be in position 5 based on its relation to ice-hockey, volleyball must be in position 3 to satisfy the condition of being next to basketball.


## Step 7: Place snowboarding
With volleyball in position 3 and considering it needs to be next to snowboarding, snowboarding must then occupy position 2, as position 4 is taken by basketball and positions 5, 6, and 7 are determined.


## Step 8: Finalize the arrangement
Given all constraints:
- Rugby is in position 1.
- Snowboarding is in position 2.
- Volleyball is in position 3.
- Basketball is in position 4.
- Parkour is in position 5.
- Ice-hockey is in position 6.
- Water-polo is in position 7.

## Step 1: Determine the position of tea
From clue 2, we know the person drinking tea is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the middle one is position 4.

## Step 2: Place soy-milk and tea
From clue 3, the person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Given tea is in position 4, soy-milk must be in position 3.

## Step 3: Position water
Clue 5 states that water is between lemonade and tea. Since tea is in position 4 and considering clue 6 that water is in an odd position, water cannot be directly next to tea on the left (because then it would not be between lemonade and tea or it would force lemonade out of the sequence). This implies lemonade must be on one side of water, and tea on the other. Given water's odd positioning, it could potentially fit in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7, but because soy-milk is already in position 3, and tea in position 4, water must be in either position 1 or 5 to satisfy being between lemonade and tea.

## Step 4: Determine the correct position for water
Considering clue 6 that water is in an odd position and taking into account the positions of soy-milk (3) and tea (4), if water were in position 1, it would not be possible for lemonade to be between water and tea without violating other conditions. Thus, water must be in position 5.

## Step 5: Place lemonade
With water in position 5 and tea in position 4, lemonade must be in a position that allows water to be between lemonade and tea. Given the arrangement so far (soy-milk in 3, tea in 4, water in 5), lemonade could potentially fit into positions 1, 2, or 6, but because it needs to be on one side of water and the other side is taken by tea, lemonade's placement will depend on where we can also fit coffee (from clue 7).

## Step 6: Position mirinda and 7up
From clue 1, mirinda is to the right of 7up. This means they cannot be in positions 6 or 7 together because there would not be enough space for both with mirinda strictly to the right of 7up.

## Step 7: Finalize positions considering all clues
- Soy-milk is in position 3.
- Tea is in position 4.
- Water is in position 5.
Given these fixed positions and revisiting clue 7 (coffee is on the left or right of lemonade), we need to find a configuration that satisfies all conditions.

Let's place lemonade in a way that respects its relation with water, tea, and then use the remaining clues for final placements.


## Step 8: Position coffee and lemonade
Considering clue 7 (coffee is on the left or right of lemonade) and knowing water is in position 5, if lemonade were in position 6, it would fit well with water being between lemonade and tea. However, this placement does not immediately help with placing coffee without considering other beverages' placements.


## Step 9: Final arrangement
Given the constraints:
- Soy-milk (3), Tea (4), Water (5) are fixed.
- Lemonade must be on one side of water but since tea is on the other side, lemonade could fit into position 6 to satisfy being next to water and having coffee nearby.
- Coffee needs to be next to lemonade, so it could go in position 7 if lemonade is in 6, or potentially in position 1 or 2 if we rearrange considering mirinda and 7up's placement relative to each other.

However, with the direct information:
- Mirinda to the right of 7up.
- Coffee next to lemonade.
- The fixed positions for soy-milk, tea, and water.

A possible arrangement respecting all clues could be derived by trial and error within these constraints.


## Step 10: Place mirinda, 7up, coffee, and lemonade
Given the need to place mirinda to the right of 7up, and with fixed positions for soy-milk, tea, and water, we look for slots that can accommodate mirinda and 7up's relationship and also fit coffee next to lemonade.


The final answer is:

## Step 1: Determine the position of baking and hiking
From clue 4, we know baking is on the left of hiking. This gives us a starting point but does not specify their exact positions yet.


## Step 2: Place traveling in relation to hiking
Clue 2 tells us that hiking is on the left of traveling. So now we have baking -> hiking -> traveling as a sequence, but still without fixed positions.


## Step 3: Position camping relative to traveling
From clue 3, we understand that traveling is on the left of camping. This expands our sequence to baking -> hiking -> traveling -> camping.


## Step 4: Consider the restrictions for woodworking and singing
Clue 1 indicates that singing is on the right of woodworking, but without specific positions yet. Clue 7 adds that woodworking is on the right of camping, which helps in placing these activities after camping in our sequence.


## Step 5: Apply the odd/even position clues
Clue 6 states that board-games is in an odd position. Since there are 7 people (an odd number), this means there are 4 odd positions and 3 even positions. Clue 8 tells us woodworking is in an even position.


## Step 6: Combine all the information to place each hobby
Given that baking -> hiking -> traveling -> camping, and knowing that woodworking must be after camping because it's on the right of camping (clue 7) and also in an even position (clue 8), we can start placing these hobbies. Since there are only two even positions left after the first four (2, 4, 6), and considering that singing is to the right of woodworking, woodworking must be in either position 2 or 4 to allow for all other conditions to be met.


## Step 7: Final placement
However, given that baking must precede hiking, and board-games needs an odd position, let's consider how these fit. If we start with baking (1), it would leave us little room for adjustment without violating the conditions set by the clues. Board-games being in an odd position means it could potentially disrupt our sequence if not placed carefully.


## Step 8: Detailed placement considering all constraints
Given that woodworking is after camping and must be in an even position, let's consider placing baking first (to satisfy its left of hiking condition) and then adjust accordingly. If we start with baking (1), followed by hiking (2), this leaves us with a sequence where traveling (3), camping (4), could potentially fit before woodworking due to the even position requirement for woodworking.


## Step 9: Finalizing positions
Let's place board-games in an odd position as required. Considering all other placements, if baking is in position 1 and hiking in 2 or another early position, we need to fit traveling, camping, and then woodworking (which must be even). If we consider the clue that singing is on the right of woodworking and woodworking being after camping, our sequence becomes more defined.


## Step 10: Complete the puzzle
Given all constraints:
- Baking must be before hiking.
- Hiking before traveling.
- Traveling before camping.
- Camping before woodworking (because woodworking is to the right of camping).
- Woodworking in an even position and after camping.
- Singing to the right of woodworking.
- Board-games in an odd position.


Considering these clues:
1. Baking
2. Hiking
3. Traveling
4. Camping
5. Woodworking (even position, so this could work)
6. Singing (to the right of woodworking)
7. Board-games must be in an odd position, which could fit at the start or between some activities without disrupting the sequence significantly.


However, realizing that we need to fit all hobbies while respecting their relative positions and the constraints on specific positions (odd/even), let's place them accurately:
- Baking can't be next to woodworking directly due to other constraints.
- Board-games being in an odd position could potentially start our list if it doesn't conflict with other rules.


Upon closer examination, a mistake was recognized in not providing a step-by-step logical deduction for each hobby's exact placement without assuming specific positions prematurely. The clues provided require a careful and systematic approach to ensure all conditions are met simultaneously.


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x7-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the horse
From clue 2, we know the owner of the fish is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. However, without more specific information about the horse's position relative to other pets besides the fish, we move on to gather more clues.


## Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the rabbit and the fish
Clues 3 and 5 indicate the owner of the rabbit is on the left or right of the owner of the fish. Clue 6 specifies that the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish, making the relationship one-way.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the snake
Clue 7 states the owner of the snake is in an even position. This gives us specific locations for the snake (positions 2, 4, or 6).


## Step 4: Analyze the relationship between the snake and the chinchilla
From clue 4, we know the owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.


## Step 5: Determine the relationship between the rabbit and the lizard
Clue 9 states the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This helps in narrowing down possible positions for these pets.


## Step 6: Apply all clues to find a solution
Given the clues, let's start placing pets:
- The snake must be in an even position (clue 7), so it could be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
- Since the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fish (clue 6) and on the right of the lizard (clue 9), we need to find a sequence that accommodates this while also considering the snake's position and its relation to the chinchilla.
- The goldfish is already placed in position 1.


## Step 7: Final placement
Considering all clues:
- Goldfish is in position 1.
- To satisfy clue 7, let's place the snake in position 2 (an even number), which means the chinchilla must be to its right, potentially in position 3 or further, considering other placements.
- The lizard must be to the left of the rabbit (clue 9). Given the snake's placement and the need for the fish and rabbit to be adjacent with the rabbit on the left (clue 6), a possible sequence starts to emerge.
- If we place the lizard in position 3, the rabbit could be in position 4, but this would conflict with the snake needing to be in an even position unless we adjust other placements accordingly.


## Step 8: Solve for all positions
Let's finalize:
- Position 1: Goldfish (given)
- Position 2: Snake (to satisfy clue 7 and allow flexibility for other pets)
- Position 3 could be the lizard, allowing the rabbit to be in position 4 or 5. However, we need to ensure the fish is next to the rabbit (clue 6), suggesting a possible arrangement where the fish and rabbit are together, potentially with the fish in an earlier position than initially thought if we were to place the snake first.
- Considering all relationships:
1. Goldfish
2. Snake
3. Lizard (to satisfy clue 9 and allow for flexibility)
4. Rabbit (next to the lizard as per clue 9 and before the fish as per clue 6)
5. Fish (next to the rabbit, satisfying clues 3, 5, and 6)
6. Horse (its position is flexible but must be next to the fish as per clue 2; this could potentially be in position 6 or another even number if we rearrange considering all other clues)
7. Chinchilla (must be after the snake as per clue 4)


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues
Given the constraints and aiming to satisfy all clues:
1. Goldfish
2. Snake
3. Lizard
4. Rabbit
5. Fish
6. Horse
7. Chinchilla

Lv4-1x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The fan of R&B is on the right of the fan of classical.
2. The fan of Gospel is on the far left.
3. The fan of Soul is on the left or right of the fan of Funk.
4. The fan of Funk is in the middle.
5. The fan of Soul is on the left or right of the fan of Classical.
6. The fan of Classical is in an even position.
7. The fan of Gospel is on the left of the fan of Indie.

From statement 2, we know the order starts with Gospel.


Statement 4 tells us Funk is in the middle, which means Funk must be in position 4 since there are 7 positions and the middle one would be the 4th.


Given statement 6, Classical must be in an even position. Since Funk is in position 4, and considering the constraints, Classical could fit into either position 2 or 6 to satisfy being in an even position and allowing R&B to be to its right as per statement 1.


However, if Classical were in position 2, it would not allow Gospel to be on the far left (as per statement 2) and also accommodate Indie after Gospel (statement 7), considering Funk's fixed middle position. Thus, Classical being in position 6 seems more plausible for satisfying multiple conditions simultaneously.


Statement 1 indicates R&B must be to the right of Classical. If Classical is in position 6, then R&B could only fit into position 7.


Considering statement 3 and statement 5 together, Soul needs to be adjacent to either Funk or Classical. Since Classical is in an even position (likely position 6 based on our deductions), and considering Funk's central position, Soul's placement becomes critical for satisfying the adjacency requirements.


Given that Gospel is at the start (position 1) and must be followed by Indie (statement 7), we have:


1. Gospel
2. Indie


With Funk in the middle (position 4), and needing to satisfy the condition of Soul being next to either Funk or Classical, we can place Soul next to Funk since Classical's position is further constrained by other rules.


So, a possible arrangement considering these constraints could be:


1. Gospel
2. Indie
3. Soul
4. Funk
5. Folk (as it hasn't been assigned yet and needs a spot)
6. Classical
7. R&B


This satisfies all given conditions:
- Gospel is on the far left.
- The fan of R&B is to the right of Classical.
- Funk is in the middle.
- Soul is adjacent to Funk, satisfying one of its conditions directly.
- Classical is in an even position (6).
- Gospel is to the left of Indie.


Therefore, the final solution table, given all constraints and deductions, looks like this:
