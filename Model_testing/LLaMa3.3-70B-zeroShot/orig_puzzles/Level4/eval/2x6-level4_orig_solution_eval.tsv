Lv4-2x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 1
The person driving the scooter is the owner of the guinea-pig.

## Step 2: Apply clue 2
The owner of the pony is the person driving the tram.

## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The person driving the taxi is in an even position. This means the taxi driver can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

## Step 4: Apply clue 4 and combine with clue 1
The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the tram and the person driving the taxi. Since the scooter driver owns a guinea-pig (clue 1), this gives us a sequence but not exact positions yet.

## Step 5: Apply clue 6
The person driving the ship is on the far right, which means they are in position 6.

## Step 7: Apply clue 3 and combine with previous information
The owner of the horse is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. This doesn't give us exact positions but tells us about the relative positioning.

## Step 8: Apply clue 9
The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the horse. Combining this with clue 3, we get a sequence: rabbit, horse, guinea-pig.

## Step 9: Apply clue 7 and clue 8
The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard, and the owner of the snake is the person driving the skateboard. Given the ship is in position 6, the skateboard must be in position 5.

## Step 10: Combine all clues to determine positions
Given the taxi must be in an even position (clue 5) and considering other placements:
- The scooter (guinea-pig owner) has to be between the tram (pony owner) and the taxi.
- The ship (position 6) is next to the skateboard (snake owner), which means the skateboard must be in position 5.
- The sequence from clue 3 and clue 9 (rabbit, horse, guinea-pig) needs to fit with other placements.

Let's try to fit these sequences into the table while respecting all conditions.


Given the constraints:
- Scooter (guinea-pig) is between tram (pony) and taxi.
- Taxi is in an even position.
- Ship is at the far right (position 6).
- Skateboard (snake) is in position 5, next to the ship.
- Sequence: rabbit, horse, guinea-pig.

We need to place these with the transport means as clues suggest.


## Step 11: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
1. The scooter (guinea-pig) must be between tram and taxi, but since taxi is in an even position, and considering other placements, we can start building our table.
2. Tram (pony) could be in position 1 to allow scooter (guinea-pig) to fit between tram and taxi, considering taxi's even positioning.
3. Given the ship is in position 6 and skateboard (snake) in position 5, we fill in the rest based on sequences and constraints.

Let's place them:
- Tram (pony) in position 1 to satisfy the condition of being on one side of the scooter.
- Taxi must be in an even position; if tram is in 1, taxi could be in 4 to allow for the scooter to be between them.
- Scooter (guinea-pig) then fits best in position 2 or 3 to be between tram and taxi. Given the sequence rabbit, horse, guinea-pig, and the fact that guinea-pig is on the right of the horse, we can deduce positions for these pets relative to each other.
- Since scooter (guinea-pig) has to be on the right of the horse (clue 9), and considering the sequence rabbit, horse, guinea-pig, if we place rabbit and horse before the guinea-pig, it fits well with scooter in position 3, making the sequence: rabbit, horse, guinea-pig for positions 1, 2, and 3 or starting from a different point.
- However, given tram (pony) is in position 1, we adjust our thinking to fit all clues.


Given all constraints and sequences:
- Position 1: Tram (pony)
- Position 6: Ship
- Position 5: Skateboard (snake)
- Taxi in an even position, which could be 2 or 4, but given the scooter needs to be between tram and taxi, and considering other placements, we adjust accordingly.


Let's finalize with all clues in mind:
1. Tram (pony) - Position 1
2. Since scooter (guinea-pig) is between tram and taxi, and taxi must be even, a possible arrangement considering the sequence rabbit, horse, guinea-pig could fit if we place the pets according to their transport and the clues about their positions relative to each other.

Lv4-2x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the Dutch and Chinese
From clue 2, the Dutch is on the far left or far right. Clue 7 states the same for the Chinese. Since there are only two far positions (left and right), one must be Dutch and the other Chinese.


## Step 2: Identify the position of the Brazilian
Clue 1 says the person watching horror movies is to the left of the Brazilian, and clue 3 indicates the mystery movie watcher is to the right of the Brazilian. This means the Brazilian cannot be on either far end because there must be at least one person to their left (watching horror) and one to their right (watching mystery).


## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The person watching mystery movies is the Dutch. Given that the Dutch can only be on the far left or far right, this creates a conflict with clue 3 unless we consider the arrangement more closely. If the Dutch are watching mystery movies and must be on one of the ends, then clue 3 (mystery to the right of Brazilian) suggests the Dutch cannot be on the far right because there would be no room to the right for anyone else, implying the Dutch are likely on the far left.


## Step 4: Place the Italian
Clue 8 says the Italian is in an even position. This means the Italian can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.


## Step 5: Apply clue 9 and 6
The person watching comedy movies is to the left of the Italian (clue 9), and also to the left of the satire movie watcher (clue 6). This means the order must be Comedy -> Satire, with the Italian being after Comedy but not necessarily directly after.


## Step 6: Consider clue 10
The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. Given that we have a sequence of Comedy -> Satire from clue 6, and knowing the Italian must be in an even position (clue 8) which also follows Comedy (clue 9), we can start to piece together possible arrangements.


## Step 7: Apply remaining clues
- Clue 4 states the Japanese is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
- Given that clue 1 indicates horror is to the left of Brazilian, and clue 3 says mystery (Dutch) is to the right of Brazilian, we start building a table with these constraints.


## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues
Let's synthesize:
- Dutch (Mystery) must be on one end (clue 5), likely the left given the need for someone to the left of the Brazilian (clue 1).
- Chinese, then, is on the other end.
- Comedy is before Satire and Italian (clues 6 and 9), with Italian in an even position.
- Scientific movies are watched by someone who has the Japanese to their right (clue 4), which could fit between the Brazilian and the far right if we consider all constraints.


Given these steps, let's attempt a solution:


|               |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4     |      5      |    6    |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Comedy  | Satire     | Horror  | Scientific | Time-travel|
| Nationality   | Dutch   | Italian | Brazilian | Chinese is incorrect based on step 1, so let's correct this with the proper placement considering all clues and steps. Given the constraints, a likely correction involves placing the Chinese on one end and ensuring the Dutch (mystery) and other nationalities are correctly positioned according to the clues provided.


Correcting for the process:
- If Dutch is on the far left (1) watching Mystery movies,
- Then Comedy must be before Satire, with Italian in an even position (2 or 4),
- Horror to the left of Brazilian, but since Dutch (Mystery) is on the far left, this means Brazilian cannot be in position 2,
- Scientific followed by Japanese.


Re-evaluating for accurate placement considering all clues correctly:


|               |    1    |    2    |     3      |    4     |      5      |    6    |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Comedy  | Horror     | Satire  | Scientific | Time-travel|
| Nationality   | Dutch   | Italian | Brazilian | Chinese does not fit here based on initial analysis; correct placement considering clues would place the Chinese or Dutch on the ends, and given the constraints about movie genres and nationalities, let's finalize with a corrected understanding of the clues.


The final answer is:

Lv4-2x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and apply them to the table.

1. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
2. The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
3. The person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
4. The fan of rock is in an odd position.
5. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
6. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
7. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the fan of metal.
8. The person who's sport is basketball is on the far left or far right.
9. The person who's sport is handball is the fan of soul.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- From clue 8, basketball can only be at position 1 or 6. But given clue 1 (basketball is to the left of golf), and considering all other clues about relative positions, it makes more sense for basketball to be at position 1 because if it were at position 6, golf would have to be after it, which doesn't fit with many other conditions.
- From clue 4, rock must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
- Since the fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of rock (clue 5), and given that handball is the fan of soul (clue 9), we need to find a place where rock and soul can be next to each other. Considering rock's possible positions, if rock were at position 1, it would conflict with basketball being at position 1 based on clue 8.
- Given clue 6, salsa must be near basketball, which is now placed at position 1.

Let's make some initial placements:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   |            |       |         |               |            |          |
| Sport         | Basketball |       |         |               |            |          |

Given that basketball is at position 1, and salsa must be next to it (clue 6), let's place salsa:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa      |       |         |               |            |          |
| Sport         | Basketball |       |         |               |            |          |

Now, let's address the rock and soul relationship (clue 5) and handball being the fan of soul (clue 9). Since rock must be in an odd position, and considering salsa is at position 1, a good fit for rock could be position 3 or 5. Given that soul needs to be next to rock, and handball is the fan of soul, let's consider placing rock at position 3 (since it gives us more flexibility with other clues).

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa      |       | Rock    |               |            |          |
| Sport         | Basketball |       |         |               |            |          |

Now, place soul next to rock. Since handball is the fan of soul (clue 9), and we need to fit in other sports and genres:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa      | Soul  | Rock    |               |            |          |
| Sport         | Basketball | Handball |         |               |            |          |

Given the constraints about golf (clue 1), r&b, and weightlifting (clues 2 and 3), let's fit them in. Since golf must be to the right of basketball and near r&b:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa      | Soul  | Rock    | R&B           |            |          |
| Sport         | Basketball | Handball |         | Golf          |            |          |

Now, considering cycling is to the left of metal (clue 7), and the remaining spots:

|               |     1      |   2   |    3    |       4       |     5      |    6     |

Lv4-2x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the person watching action movies
The person watching action movies is on the far left (Clue 3). So, the first column will be filled with ""action"" under Movie-Genre.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the train and its implications
The person driving the train is in an even position (Clue 4), which means they can be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, since the boat is on the far right (position 6) (Clue 1), the train cannot be in position 6, leaving options 2 and 4.


## Step 3: Position the scientific movies watcher
The person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train (Clue 2). Given that the train can only be in positions 2 or 4, this means the scientific movie watcher could potentially be in positions 1, 3, or 5 if the train is in position 2 or 4.


## Step 4: Place the skateboard and family movies
The person driving the skateboard watches family movies (Clue 5). This gives us a direct correlation but doesn't specify their position yet.


## Step 5: Position the motorbike rider relative to family movies
The motorbike rider is on the left or right of the person watching family movies (Clue 6), which means if we find where family movies are, we can narrow down the motorbike's possible positions.


## Step 6: Analyze the relationship between scientific and satire movies
The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies (Clue 7). This clue helps in arranging the movie genres but requires knowing the positions of either the train or another fixed point to place them accurately.


## Step 7: Place action and drama movies relative to each other
The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies (Clue 8), and since action is already placed on the far left, drama must be next to it, meaning drama could only be in position 2.


## Step 8: Position the van driver relative to drama movies
The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching drama movies (Clue 9). Given that drama is likely in position 2 (to be next to action in position 1), this means the van cannot fit as described unless we reconsider our initial assumptions about the train's and other vehicles' positions.


## Step 9: Reconsidering Positions Based on Clues
Given the complexity, let's directly apply some clues:
- Action is on the far left (Position 1).
- Drama must be next to action, so it could be in position 2.
- The van driver is to the left of drama, but since action is already on the far left and next to drama, this clue actually suggests a specific arrangement where the van's placement needs reevaluation based on other clues.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Given all clues:
1. Action movies are in position 1.
2. Since drama must be next to action and considering the van's driver is to the left of drama, which doesn't fit directly with our current understanding, we need to adjust. The direct placement from clues indicates drama should indeed follow action, placing it in column 2.
3. The train can only be in an even position not occupied by the boat or conflicting with other placements, so if drama is in 2, and considering other constraints, the train's most likely spot is 4, making scientific movies potentially in 3 or 5.
4. Given the skateboard rider watches family movies and the motorbike rider is next to them, these need to fit around the fixed points.
5. The boat is on the far right (position 6), which influences the placement of other transportation means.


## Step 11: Direct Placement with Clues
Considering all constraints:
- Action in position 1, drama likely follows but given the van's placement clue, we must adjust our understanding to fit the van, action, and drama together logically.
- Train in an even spot, not 6 (taken by boat), so potentially 2 or 4. If drama is indeed next to action (in 1), then train could be in 4.
- Scientific movies are near the train but also after satire, which helps place them relative to each other.


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv4-2x6-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching musical movies and the person driving the train.
From clue 2, we know the person watching musical movies is also the person driving the train. Clue 11 tells us this person is on the far right, so they must be in position 6.

## Step 2: Place the person driving the snowmobile.
Clue 5 indicates the person driving the train is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the train is in position 6, the snowmobile must be in position 5.

## Step 3: Position the person watching western movies.
From clue 4, we know the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person watching western movies. Given the snowmobile's position in 5, western movies must be in position 4 or less. But since the snowmobile is directly to the right of the western movie watcher and there are no other positions between them for another transport, western movies must be in position 4.

## Step 4: Place the person watching musical movies and the train in the table.
Based on steps 1 and 2, we have:
|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |    6    |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |             | Western    |             | Musical |
| Transport     |             |            |             |            | Snowmobile | Train   |

## Step 5: Determine the position of the person watching romance movies and the skateboard.
Clue 1 states the skateboard is between romance movies and the helicopter. Clue 12 tells us the skateboard is in an even position, so it must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since western movies are already in position 4, the skateboard must be in position 2.

## Step 6: Position the person watching romance movies.
Given the skateboard's position in 2 and considering clue 1, romance movies cannot be in position 1 because there needs to be space for another transport (helicopter) on one side of the skateboard. So, romance movies must be in a position that allows the helicopter to also fit according to clue 1.

## Step 7: Position the person watching scientific and documentary movies.
Clue 6 states scientific movies are to the left of documentary movies. Clue 8 says scientific movies are to the right of time-travel movies, implying an order of time-travel, scientific, documentary from left to right.

## Step 8: Finalize positions based on remaining clues.
- The person watching musical movies (and driving the train) is already placed in position 6.
- The snowmobile driver is in position 5.
- Western movies are in position 4.
- The skateboard is in position 2, with romance movies needing to be either before or after it but considering other placements, likely after, given the constraints about documentary and western movie positions relative to others.

Given all clues:
1. Time-travel must be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of scientific, which in turn is to the left of documentary.
2. Scientific movies then would logically follow time-travel.
3. Documentary could fit after scientific but considering clue 9 and other constraints, we need to ensure documentary can be next to western or skateboard (as per clues 7 and 9).
4. The helicopter must be on one side of the skateboard, so it fits best in position 3 if romance is directly associated with the skateboard's positioning requirement.

Given these deductions:
|               |      1      |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |    6    |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel | Romance    | Scientific | Western    | Documentary| Musical |
| Transport     | Bike       | Skateboard | Helicopter |            | Snowmobile | Train   |

However, upon careful review of all clues and considering the process might have led to an oversight in direct placement based on some clues (especially regarding direct adjacencies and the specific requirement for documentary being next to either western or skateboard), we must ensure all conditions are met perfectly.


## Step 9: Re-evaluate placements with strict adherence to clues.
- The train is correctly placed at the end with musical movies.
- Snowmobile is before the train, which places it in position 5.
- Western movies precede the snowmobile, placing them in position 4.
- Given documentary needs to be next to either western or skateboard and considering all other placements, we need to adjust our understanding of clue applications.


Considering all constraints again for a precise fit:
1. Musical movies (and train) are at the end.
2. Snowmobile precedes the train, placing it in position 5.
3. Western movies are before snowmobile, so they're in position 4.
4. Documentary and western need to be adjacent or documentary needs to be next to skateboard. Given the constraint about scientific being to the left of documentary, we must fit these genres around the existing transports.


Given the clues about adjacency (documentary next to western or skateboard), the puzzle requires fitting the remaining movie genres into positions that satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.


The final answer is:

Lv4-2x6-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each rule step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the British and the music genre they prefer.
From rule 1, we know the British person prefers disco. However, without further information about their position relative to others, we can't place them yet.


## Step 2: Place the Turkish and Polish individuals based on their relative positions.
Rule 2 tells us that the Turkish person is to the left of the Polish person. This doesn't give us exact positions but establishes a relationship between two nationalities.


## Step 3: Determine the Argentine's position relative to the fan of jazz.
From rule 3, knowing the Argentine is to the right of the jazz fan and from rule 8 that the Russian is the fan of jazz, we have a clue about the order but still lack exact positions.


## Step 4: Establish the relationship between the fans of indie and rock music.
Rule 4 indicates the fan of indie is to the left of the fan of rock. Rule 5 further refines this by stating the fan of indie is on the far left or far right, which gives us a critical piece of information about potential positions.


## Step 5: Apply rule 6 regarding the position of the gospel music fan.
The fan of gospel is in an odd position (rule 6), meaning they could be in positions 1, 3, or 5.


## Step 6: Determine the relationship between the trance and gospel fans.
Rule 7 states that the fan of trance is to the left of the fan of gospel. This helps narrow down possible positions for both genres.


## Step 7: Combine information from previous steps with rule 8.
Knowing the Russian is the jazz fan (rule 8) and combining this with other rules, especially about relative positions, starts to fill in the puzzle.


## Step 8: Apply rule 9, which repeats the information about the indie fan's position.
The repetition of rule 9 doesn't add new information but emphasizes the importance of the indie fan's placement.


## Step 9: Use rule 10 regarding the Turkish person's position relative to the rock fan.
The Turkish person is to the left of the rock fan (rule 10), which, combined with previous rules, especially about the Polish and Turkish positions, helps finalize some placements.


Given these steps and combining all the clues:


- The British fan of disco can be placed in one of the remaining spots after considering other constraints.
- The Russian fan of jazz is to the left of the Argentine (from rule 3).
- The indie fan must be on the far left or far right, and since they are also to the left of the rock fan (rule 4), and the Turkish is to the left of the Polish and also to the left of the rock fan (rules 2 and 10), we can start building a possible order.
- Considering rule 6 (gospel in an odd position) and rule 7 (trance to the left of gospel), and knowing that indie must be on one end, we have to fit trance and gospel around these constraints.


A potential arrangement considering all clues could look like this:


|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |
| Music-Genre   | indie  | trance | gospel |   jazz    |  disco  |  rock   |
| Nationality   | turkish| polish | british|  russian  | argentine| spanish |


However, this initial arrangement doesn't perfectly fit all rules without further refinement. Let's correct and refine based on the constraints:


1. British is disco (rule 1).
2. Turkish is to the left of Polish (rule 2).
3. Argentine is to the right of jazz (rule 3), and Russian is jazz (rule 8).
4. Indie is to the left of rock, and indie is on the far left or far right (rules 4 and 5).
5. Gospel in an odd position (rule 6).
6. Trance to the left of gospel (rule 7).
7. Turkish to the left of rock (rule 10).


Given these rules and ensuring we adhere strictly to them, let's attempt a corrected placement:


If indie is on the far left (to satisfy rule 5), and considering all other constraints about relative positions and music genres, we must fit the pieces together carefully.


A possible correct arrangement could be:


|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |
| Music-Genre   | indie  | trance | gospel |   jazz    |  rock   |  disco  |
| Nationality   | turkish| polish | british|  russian  | spanish | argentine|


This arrangement seems to fit most of the given clues but may still require adjustment based on a strict reading of all rules, especially concerning the positions of trance and gospel relative to other genres and nationalities.


Upon further review, ensuring that the Argentine is to the right of the jazz fan (Russian), the British is correctly placed with disco, and all other constraints are met:


The final answer is:

Lv4-2x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 4 to determine the leftmost sport.
The person whose sport is cricket is on the far left. This means the first position is already determined for the sport, but not the job.

## Step 2: Use clue 7 to place the engineer.
Since the engineer is on the left or right of the person whose sport is cricket and cricket is at position 1, the engineer must be at either position 1 (which would mean their sport isn't cricket, based on later clues) or more likely, at position 2 because someone else's sport is cricket.

## Step 3: Apply clue 6 to place the software-developer.
The software-developer is on the right of the engineer. If we assume the engineer is indeed at position 2 (since cricket is at position 1 and it seems unlikely for the engineer to be doing two things), then the software-developer must be at position 3.

## Step 4: Use clue 9 to place the analyst.
The analyst is in an even position. This means the analyst could be at positions 2, 4, or 6. However, since positions 2 and possibly 3 are taken by other jobs (engineer and software-developer), we need to consider where the analyst fits without conflicting with other clues.

## Step 5: Apply clue 1 to place the writer.
The person whose sport is tennis is the writer. We don't know the position yet, but this gives us a direct job-sport pairing.

## Step 6: Use clue 8 to further refine the writer's placement.
The nurse is on the left of the person whose sport is tennis. This means the nurse and the writer (tennis) are in consecutive positions, with the nurse first.

## Step 7: Apply clue 3 and 5 to place badminton.
The person whose sport is badminton is on the left or right of the writer but specifically on the left based on clue 5. This means badminton is between the nurse and the writer.

## Step 8: Use clue 2 to consider snowboarding's placement relative to the project-manager.
Snowboarding is on the left or right of the project-manager, but we don't know where the project-manager is yet.

## Step 9: Apply clue 10 for lacrosse and rugby.
Lacrosse is on the right of rugby. This gives us a relative positioning but not an absolute one without knowing more about their job positions.

## Step 10: Compile all information into a coherent table.
Given all clues, we can start placing individuals:
- Cricket (sport) is at position 1. Since the engineer must be next to cricket and considering other placements, let's assume the engineer does not do cricket but is near it.
- The software-developer is after the engineer, suggesting positions 2 for the engineer and 3 for the software-developer if we were strictly following initial assumptions. However, the direct placement of jobs based on sports isn't straightforward without considering all clues together.

Let's correct our approach with a more integrated analysis:
1. Cricket (position 1) - The job here could be analyst (to satisfy even position), but let's not jump to conclusions.
2. Engineer (near cricket) - If cricket is at position 1, engineer could indeed be at position 2, satisfying being near cricket and allowing software-developer to follow.
3. Software-developer (after engineer) - This would place the software-developer at position 3.

Considering nurse and writer:
- Nurse must be before tennis (writer), so if we consider badminton's placement relative to the writer (on the left), a possible sequence could involve nurse, badminton, then writer. However, without direct job assignments for these sports yet, let's proceed with caution.

Given all constraints:
- The project-manager and snowboarding need to be adjacent.
- Lacrosse is after rugby.

Direct placements based on clues:
1. Cricket (sport) - Let's assign the analyst here as it fits an even position when considering later clues might necessitate adjustments for other positions.
2. Engineer (job) could fit well at position 2, with software-developer at 3, but let's directly place known pairs and single elements first.

Let's try to fill in based on direct information:
- Position 1: Cricket (sport), Analyst (job) as a starting point since analyst needs an even position and cricket is at the start.
- Position 4 or later for nurse and writer (tennis) because badminton must be between them, and considering other placements.

Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, let's solidify known relationships:
- Nurse is before writer (tennis).
- Badminton is on the left of the writer.
- Engineer and software-developer are in sequence.
- Analyst is in an even position.

A possible arrangement considering all clues could look something like this:

|         |        1        |      2       |         3          |    4     |     5     |   6    |
| Job     |  Analyst       | Engineer    | Software-developer| Nurse   | Writer   |Project-Manager|
| Sport   |  Cricket       | Rugby       | Lacrosse          | Badminton| Tennis  | Snowboarding|

However, let's ensure we've correctly applied all clues without assuming positions not directly stated:
- The project-manager and snowboarding are adjacent (satisfied).
- The nurse is before the writer (tennis), with badminton in between (partially satisfied but needs exact placement).
- Engineer and software-developer sequence (satisfied).

Given this analysis, let's refine our understanding based on direct clues without over-assuming:

Lv4-2x6-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
From clue 1, the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left or far right. We cannot determine the exact position yet.


## Step 2: Analyze the position of the person whose sport is swimming relative to the person drinking iced-tea.
From clue 2, the person whose sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.


## Step 3: Determine the relative positions of snowboarding and volleyball.
From clue 3, the person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.


## Step 4: Analyze the position of surfing relative to swimming.
From clue 4, the person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming.


## Step 5: Determine the order of iced-tea and water.
From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking water.


## Step 6: Analyze the position of volleyball relative to water.
From clue 6, the person whose sport is volleyball is on the right of the person drinking water.


## Step 7: Identify the possible positions for volleyball.
From clue 7, the person whose sport is volleyball is in an odd position.


## Step 8: Determine the possible positions for milk.
From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in an even position.


## Step 9: Analyze the relative positions of hot-chocolate and milk.
From clue 9, the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.


## Step 10: Identify the possible positions for cricket.
From clue 10, the person whose sport is cricket is in an odd position.


## Step 11: Determine the position of sprite.
From clue 11, the person drinking sprite is on the far right.


## Step 12: Analyze the relative positions of weightlifting and volleyball.
From clue 12, the person whose sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person whose sport is volleyball.


Given these clues, we can start filling in the table. From clue 11, sprite is at position 6. Clue 1 suggests snowboarding could be at position 1 or 6, but since sprite is at 6 (from clue 11), and considering other constraints, we'll have to place snowboarding at position 1 or another spot that fits all conditions.


Considering volleyball must be in an odd position (clue 7) and on the right of water (clue 6), and weightlifting is to the left of volleyball (clue 12), we start seeing a pattern. However, given the complexity and the interdependence of the clues, let's directly infer from critical clues:


- Volleyball being in an odd position and to the right of water, and considering other constraints, helps us narrow down positions.
- The order of iced-tea and water (clue 5) gives us another sequence.
- Snowboarding on the right of volleyball (clue 3) but also considering it could be on the far left or right initially seems conflicting without further analysis.


Let's piece together a possible arrangement based on key clues:


1. The person drinking milk is in an even position, and since milk is to the right of hot-chocolate (clue 9), this gives us one sequence.
2. Volleyball being odd-positioned (clue 7) and to the right of water (clue 6), with weightlifting to its left (clue 12), helps in placing these sports.


Given all clues, a possible arrangement could be deduced as follows, but due to the complexity and without directly iterating through each step's deduction due to format constraints, let's consider how these clues interact:


- Cricket in an odd position.
- Surfing to the left of swimming (clue 4).
- Iced-tea to the left of water (clue 5).


However, given the strict format and the complexity of solving this puzzle step-by-step without iterative deductions visible for each clue's interaction, we recognize that a detailed, step-by-step logical deduction for each possible arrangement considering all clues simultaneously would be ideal but is challenging to present in this format.


Therefore, based on the provided clues and recognizing the need for a systematic approach to solve such puzzles, let's aim for the final solution considering all interactions:


Given the constraints:
- Snowboarding at 1 or 6, but sprite is at 6.
- Volleyball odd-positioned and after water.
- Weightlifting before volleyball.
- Surfing before swimming.
- Iced-tea before water.
- Milk even-positioned and after hot-chocolate.

## Step 1: Place the person drinking mirinda
From clue 8, the person drinking mirinda is on the far left.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |

## Step 2: Place the person whose hobby is skydiving
From clue 6, the person whose hobby is skydiving is on the far right.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |

## Step 3: Place the person drinking iced-tea
From clue 4, the person drinking iced-tea is in an even position.
Given the restrictions, iced-tea can only fit in position 2 or 4 without conflicting with other clues yet. However, considering clue 3 (fanta is on the right of iced-tea) and clue 7 (iced-tea is on the right of writing), iced-tea must be in position 4 to allow for fanta and another beverage to its left.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |

## Step 4: Place the person drinking fanta
From clue 3, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
So, fanta must be in position 5.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |
| Beverage   | mirinda |            |         | iced-tea     | fanta  |           |
| Hobby      |         |            |         |              |        | skydiving |

## Step 5: Determine the hobby for fanta
From clue 2, the person whose hobby is hiking drinks fanta.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |
| Beverage   | mirinda |            |         | iced-tea     | fanta  |           |
| Hobby      |         |            |         |              | hiking | skydiving |

## Step 6: Place the person whose hobby is writing
From clue 7, the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
This means writing must be in position 3, as iced-tea is already placed in position 4.
|            |    1    |     2      |    3    |      4       |   5    |     6     |
| Beverage   | mirinda |            |         | iced-tea     | fanta  |           |
| Hobby      |         |            | writing |              | hiking | skydiving |

## Step 7: Place cola and magic-tricks
From clue 5, the person whose hobby is writing is between the person drinking cola and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
Since writing is in position 3, cola must be in either position 1 or 2, and magic-tricks must be in the other of those positions. However, mirinda is already in position 1, so cola must be in position 2, and magic-tricks must also be to one side but since filmmaking's placement is dependent on 7up (clue 1) which we haven't placed yet, we'll come back to this after placing other knowns.

## Step 8: Place the person whose hobby is filmmaking
From clue 1, the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
Given that the far ends are occupied by mirinda and skydiving, and positions 3 to 5 have writing, iced-tea, and fanta respectively, 7up can only fit in position 2 (if we consider cola's placement flexible based on later clues) or another position if we adjust other placements. However, considering the restrictions around cola and magic-tricks from clue 5, and knowing that mirinda is fixed at position 1, we should revisit how to accommodate all beverages and hobbies without violating any rules.

## Step 9: Re-evaluate placements with all clues in mind
Considering all clues together:
- Mirinda is on the far left (position 1).
- Iced-tea is in an even position, which we've placed in position 4.
- Fanta is to the right of iced-tea, so it's in position 5.
- The person with hiking as a hobby drinks fanta, placing them in position 5.
- Writing is between cola and magic-tricks, but since writing must be before iced-tea (from clue 7), writing is best placed in position 3.
- Skydiving is on the far right (position 6).
- Given these placements, we need to fit in cola, magic-tricks, filmmaking, and 7up without violating any rules.

## Step 10: Finalize placements
Considering clue 5 (writing between cola and magic-tricks) and knowing writing is in position 3, cola must be before writing, thus in position 2. Magic-tricks then follows after writing but before other known placements like fanta and skydiving. However, we need to account for 7up's placement relative to filmmaking (clue 1), which suggests a close proximity but doesn't specify exact positions without considering the remaining slots.

Given all constraints:
- Position 1 is mirinda.
- Position 4 is iced-tea.
- Position 5 is fanta (with hiking).
- Position 6 is skydiving.
- Writing in position 3, between cola and magic-tricks, suggests cola in position 2 to satisfy clue 5.

The only positions left for 7up and the associated hobby filmmaking are around these fixed points. However, given that we've established a sequence where cola is likely in position 2 (to allow writing to be between cola and another beverage/hobby), magic-tricks could follow writing but must also accommodate 7up's placement relative to filmmaking.

The puzzle's constraints necessitate placing 7up near filmmaking while respecting the placements of mirinda, iced-tea, fanta, skydiving, and the relationships between hobbies like hiking, writing, magic-tricks, and others. However, direct assignments for 7up, cola, magic-tricks, and filmmaking require careful consideration of all given clues.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the train is on the far left. From clue 9, this person drinks almond-milk. So, we have:


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |

From clue 11, the person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position, which confirms the first position since it's an odd number.


Clue 7 tells us the person driving the scooter drinks cola and is on the far right. Clue 6 also mentions the scooter being on the far right. So:


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |

| Transport   | train      |          |               |       |           | scooter |


From clue 8, the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is at position 6, and given that all positions must be filled with different means of transport and beverages, the motorbike must be at position 5.


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |
| Beverage    | almond-milk|          |               |       |           | cola    |
| Transport   | train      |          |               |       | motorbike | scooter |


Clue 10 says the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since cola is at position 6, milk must be to its left, which places milk at either position 4 or 5. However, since we've already placed motorbike (and thus a different beverage) at position 5, milk cannot be there. Therefore, milk must be at position 4.


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |
| Beverage    | almond-milk|          |               | milk  |           | cola    |
| Transport   | train      |          |               |       | motorbike | scooter |


From clue 1, the person driving the ship is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking milk. Clue 5 indicates that hot-chocolate is on the left or right of water. Clue 4 says the person drinking water drives the ship. Given milk's position at 4 and the need for hot-chocolate to be near both water (ship) and milk, we can start piecing together the middle.


Since the motorbike is at position 5 and cannot drink cola (as that's the scooter's beverage), and considering clue 3 which states the van is on the left of the quad-bike, we need to fit in the ship (which drinks water) near milk. The only configuration that makes sense given all constraints (especially with hot-chocolate needing to be next to water and water being the ship) is having the ship at position 3, which means water must also be at position 3.


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |
| Beverage    | almond-milk|          | water         | milk  |           | cola    |
| Transport   | train      |          | ship          |       | motorbike | scooter |


Given the placement of water (ship) at position 3, and knowing from clue 5 that hot-chocolate is on the left or right of water, hot-chocolate must then be at either position 2 or 4. However, since milk is already placed at position 4 to satisfy other conditions (especially being next to cola as per clue 10), hot-chocolate must be at position 2.


|             |      1      |    2     |       3       |   4   |     5     |    6    |
| Beverage    | almond-milk|hot-chocolate| water         | milk  |           | cola    |
| Transport   | train      |          | ship          |       | motorbike | scooter |


Now, we have to place lemonade. The only beverage left without a position is lemonade, and the only transport means left are van and quad-bike. From clue 3, the van must be on the left of the quad-bike.


Since all positions except for the transports at 2 and 4 are filled with specific beverages and transports, we look to fill these spots with what remains: lemonade (beverage) and van/quad-bike (transport). Considering the arrangement:


- The train is at position 1.
- Hot-chocolate is at position 2, which leaves us to decide on its transport. Given that the scooter (cola), motorbike, ship (water), and train (almond-milk) are placed, and knowing the van must be before the quad-bike, we can deduce that hot-chocolate's transport cannot be the van or quad-bike since those need to go together in a specific order.
- Water (ship) is at position 3.
- Milk is at position 4, which also needs a transport. Given the constraints and what's left (van and quad-bike), milk must be associated with either the van or quad-bike. Since the van must precede the quad-bike (clue 3) and considering the motorbike is already placed at position 5, we deduce that the only place for the van and quad-bike sequence is starting from position 2 or 4, but since hot-chocolate is at position 2, it's more logical to pair milk with one of these transports.
- The only logical conclusion given the need for van before quad-bike, and knowing motorbike is at 5 (which must drink lemonade as it's the only beverage left), is that the quad-bike drinks milk.


Therefore, the arrangement considering all clues must be adjusted slightly based on this logic to ensure everything fits:


The person drinking hot-chocolate can't drive the van or quad-bike because those need to be together in a specific order (van before quad-bike). Given the remaining options and knowing that lemonade is left, it makes sense for hot-chocolate to be with a transport not yet ruled out for position 2, but considering our constraints and aiming for a solution that fits all given clues without direct assignment of transport to hot-chocolate yet:


Let's directly place what we can with certainty based on previous deductions and then finalize the arrangement.


Given the logic puzzle's complexity and our step-by-step deduction, let's solidify what we have with certainty before making final placements:


1. Train (almond-milk) is at position 1.
2. Hot-chocolate is at position 2.
3. Ship (water) is at position 3.
4. Milk (quad-bike) seems a logical fit based on previous deductions, placing it at position 4 with the quad-bike as its transport.
5. Motorbike (lemonade) must then be correctly placed at position 5, given it's the only remaining beverage for this spot.
6. Scooter (cola) is at position 6.


Now, fitting in the van: since the van must precede the quad-bike and all other spots are filled with specific transports except for position 2 (hot-chocolate), we realize a direct assignment mistake was made in not initially pairing hot-chocolate directly with a transport due to focusing on beverage placement first. Given this correction need, let's finalize based on logical deduction of what must fit where considering the puzzle's rules:


The final arrangement should reflect all deductions accurately, ensuring each clue is respected.


Therefore, correctly placing everything according to the clues and deductions made:


The only spot left for van (considering it must come before quad-bike) that makes sense with our current setup and doesn't disrupt other placements would indeed be associated with hot-chocolate or another arrangement that fits all given rules without contradiction. However, given our direct path and previous steps aiming towards a coherent solution, let's finalize:
