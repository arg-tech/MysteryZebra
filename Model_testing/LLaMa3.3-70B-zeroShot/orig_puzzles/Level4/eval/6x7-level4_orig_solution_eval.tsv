Note: The solution is based on the given clues, and it satisfies all the conditions. However, please note that logic puzzles can have multiple solutions if the clues are not sufficient to uniquely determine the arrangement. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. From clue 20, the person driving the bike is on the far left.
2. From clue 21 and 4, the fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
3. Using clues 1, 11, and 25, we can determine the positions of the motorbike, subway, and mirinda.
4. Clues 2, 17, and 36 help us place the rabbit, soy-milk, volleyball, and sports movies.
5. With clue 28, we know the taxi is between water and ambient, which helps place the taxi and ambient.
6. Using clues 14, 15, and 33, we can determine the positions of trance, swimming, and mirinda.
7. Clues 26, 27, and 32 help us place the skateboard, guinea-pig, western movies, basketball, and chinchilla.
8. Finally, using the remaining clues, we can fill in the rest of the table.

Note: The music-genre for the last person is not explicitly stated in the puzzle, but based on the given information, it can be deduced that the fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of funk (clue 23), and the fan of blues is on the right of the fan of funk (clue 29). Since the fan of folk is on the far left (clue 35), the order of music-genres can be determined. However, the puzzle doesn't explicitly state which music-genre corresponds to the last person.


After re-examining the clues, I found that the correct solution for the music-genre of the last person is actually 'r&b'. 

The corrected table would be:

Note: The solution is obtained by carefully applying the given constraints and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues are used:

* Clue 1: The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right, but since clue 20 states that the person driving the boat is on the far left, and clue 34 states that the person driving the boat is the person who's sport is cycling, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is writing is on the far left.
* Clue 2: The person driving the boat is on the left of the person eating orange. Since the person driving the boat is on the far left, this means that the person eating orange must be in position 4 or later.
* Clue 3: The person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. This clue helps to establish a relationship between the food and hobby columns.
* Clue 11: The owner of the pony is between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. This clue helps to establish a relationship between the pet and food columns, as well as the hobby column.
* Clue 19: The owner of the pony is in an even position. This clue helps to narrow down the possible positions for the owner of the pony.
* Clue 31: The person who's sport is swimming is the person eating apple. This clue helps to establish a relationship between the sport and food columns.

By applying these clues and using logical deductions, we can fill in the table to obtain the solution."	{'food': ['plum', 'pomegranate', 'blueberry', 'orange', 'apple', 'kale', 'grapes'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'card-games', 'magic-tricks', 'photography', 'camping', 'board-games', 'skydiving'], 'job': ['librarian', 'scientist', 'firefighter', 'architect', 'software-developer', 'accountant', 'musician'], 'pet': ['hedgehog', 'ferret', 'pony', 'rat', 'goldfish', 'snake', 'lizard'], 'sport': ['cycling', 'sailing', 'rowing', 'lacrosse', 'rugby', 'swimming', 'skiing'], 'transport': ['boat', 'ship', 'train', 'motorbike', 'quad-bike', 'trike', 'snowmobile']}	True	7	False

#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the puzzle. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* From clue 6, the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left.
* From clue 31, the person who's sport is rugby is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse, and from clue 1, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the egyptian. Combining these with other clues, we can start filling in the table.
* Clue 26 states that the owner of the rabbit is on the far left, and clue 36 states that the argentine is the owner of the rabbit. Therefore, the argentine is on the far left.
* Clue 37 states that the owner of the rabbit is the fan of pop, so the music genre for the argentine is pop.
* Using the remaining clues, we can fill in the rest of the table. For example, clue 2 states that the person driving the ship is in an odd position, and clue 7 states that the person driving the subway is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Clue 4 states that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
* Continuing this process, we can fill in the entire table.

Note: The solution was obtained by carefully applying the given constraints and using a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

* From clue 5, the fan of funk is in the middle, so funk must be at position 4 (since there are 7 positions).
* From clue 11, the person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since volleyball is mentioned in clue 6 as being associated with the russian, we can conclude that the russian is at position 7 and drinks 7up.
* From clue 9, the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. This means that mystery must be at a higher position number than thriller.
* Clue 10 states that the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This gives us a starting point for the beverage column.
* We can continue applying the clues in this manner, using each new piece of information to narrow down the possibilities and make further deductions.

Note that there are many possible paths to the solution, and different people may arrive at the answer through different sequences of logical steps.
