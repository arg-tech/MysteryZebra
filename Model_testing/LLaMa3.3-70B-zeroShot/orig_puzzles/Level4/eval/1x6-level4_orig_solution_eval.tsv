Lv4-1x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the fan of house.
2. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of folk.
3. The fan of house is on the right of the fan of folk.
4. The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of rock.
5. The fan of house is in an odd position.
6. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of folk.


From statement 5, we know the fan of house must be in positions 1, 3, or 5 since these are the only odd positions available.


Given statement 3 and statement 6, the fan of house cannot be in position 1 because it needs to be on the right of the fan of folk. If house were in position 1, there would be no space for folk to its left. Therefore, house can only be in positions 3 or 5.


Considering statement 2 and statement 4 together, we have a sequence where gospel is to the left of rock, and rock is to the left of folk. This gives us a partial sequence: gospel -> rock -> folk.


Given that house must be on the right of folk (statement 3) and can only be in an odd position (statement 5), the only feasible arrangement for these constraints is having house in position 5, as it allows folk to be to its left while also accommodating the requirement from statement 2 that rock is to the left of folk.


With house in position 5, we have:
- Position 5: House
- Since house is on the right of folk (statement 3), and considering the sequence gospel -> rock -> folk, folk must be in position 4 to allow house to be to its right.
- This gives us: ... -> gospel -> rock -> folk -> house


Given statement 4, gospel must be before rock. So, we have:
- Position 1 or 2 for gospel and rock because they need to precede folk (now in position 4).
- Since gospel is to the left of rock, and considering the space needed for disco to be next to house (statement 1) without conflicting with other placements, we can deduce:
  - Gospel cannot be in position 2 if we want to satisfy all conditions including having disco either on the very left or right. Thus, gospel is likely in position 1.


Now, placing rock and folk while respecting the constraints:
- Position 1: Gospel
- Position 2: Rock (since it must be after gospel and before folk)
- Position 3 cannot be folk because house needs to be after folk, so this leaves us with disco for position 6 or position 3 being a potential spot for another genre that fits. However, given the need for disco to be next to house and considering all other placements:
  - Position 4: Folk
  - Position 5: House


The remaining genres are soul and disco. Since disco needs to be on the left or right of house (statement 1), and with house in position 5, disco must be in either position 4 or 6. However, since folk is in position 4, disco can only fit in position 6.


Soul is the only genre left and can fit into the remaining slot, which would logically be position 3, given that we have sequences established for the other positions based on the clues provided.


Therefore, considering all statements and placements:
- Position 1: Gospel
- Position 2: Rock
- Position 3: Soul (as it's the only one left and fits here without conflicting with any rules)
- Position 4: Folk
- Position 5: House
- Position 6: Disco


The final solution table is:

Lv4-1x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


From clue 3, the chef is in an odd position, which means the chef can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.


Given clue 2, the chef is on the far left or far right. Combining this with clue 3, the chef must be in either position 1 or position 5 (since these are the only odd positions that are also on the far left or far right).


Let's consider the placement of the firefighter and the electrician based on clues 1 and 5:


- The firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician.
- The electrician is on the right of the firefighter.


This sequence must appear in this order: software-developer, firefighter, electrician.


Now, incorporating clue 6:


- The software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant.


Given that we already have a sequence with the firefighter and the electrician, and knowing the software-developer's position relative to the firefighter and the accountant, we can deduce that the accountant must be on one end of this sequence. However, considering clue 4:


- The accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager.


And since the chef occupies either the far left or far right (and considering the odd positions), let's place the chef and see how it affects other placements.


If the chef is in position 1, we have limited space to fit all conditions. Let's examine if placing the chef on one end helps satisfy all conditions:


Placing the chef in position 5 gives us more flexibility with the remaining clues:


Given the constraints, let's fill in possible positions based on these deductions and see which arrangement satisfies all given conditions.


We know from clue 1 that the firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician. Clue 5 adds that the electrician is to the right of the firefighter, reinforcing this sequence. Clue 6 indicates the software-developer is also between the firefighter and the accountant, suggesting a possible sequence but requiring careful placement to satisfy all conditions.


Considering clue 4, where the accountant must be next to the project-manager, and knowing the positions of some jobs, let's finalize the placements:


Given that we need to place the chef on an odd number (1, 3, or 5) and on the far left or right, and considering all other constraints, one possible arrangement could start with the chef in position 1 or end with the chef in position 5.


Let's consider starting with the chef in position 1 to see if we can fit all jobs according to the clues:


- Position 1: Chef (satisfies clue 2 and 3)
- We then need to fit the software-developer, firefighter, electrician sequence.
- The accountant must be next to the project-manager (clue 4).
- Given the constraints, a possible arrangement that fits all conditions is needed.


Trying different configurations while keeping these rules in mind:


The only configuration that seems to fit given the clues provided and trying out different scenarios would involve carefully placing each job according to the constraints. Let's see if we can deduce the correct order based on these deductions:


Given all constraints, here's a possible solution table that attempts to satisfy all conditions:


#############
|       |  1   |        2        |     3      |         4          |      5      |      6      |
| Job   | Chef | Software-dev   | Firefighter| Electrician       | Accountant | Project-mgr|
#############


This arrangement attempts to fit the clues provided, but let's verify against each clue:


1. The firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician: Satisfied.
2. The chef is on the far left or far right: Satisfied (far left).
3. The chef is in an odd position: Satisfied (position 1).
4. The accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager: Satisfied (to the left).
5. The electrician is on the right of the firefighter: Satisfied.
6. The software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant: This clue presents a challenge in the initial arrangement provided.


Upon re-evaluation, considering all clues again for accuracy:


The correct sequence that satisfies all conditions, including clue 6 about the software-developer's position relative to the firefighter and the accountant, requires precise placement. Given this, an adjustment might be necessary to fit the software-developer between the firefighter and the accountant while maintaining the other sequences.


Let's reconsider the placements with a focus on satisfying clue 6 directly and ensuring all other clues are met:


A revised approach focusing on clue 6 and the required sequence of software-developer, firefighter, electrician, along with the accountant's relation to the project-manager and the chef's position, leads us to carefully consider each job's placement.


Given the complexities and the need for a direct solution that fits all provided clues without contradiction:


A direct calculation based on given constraints suggests we prioritize the relationships between jobs as outlined in the clues. Given this, let's finalize with an arrangement that meets these requirements directly while ensuring no clue is contradicted.


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The paramedic is between the manager and the bartender.
2. The bartender is on the right of the engineer.
3. The musician is on the left or right of the manager.
4. The manager is in an even position.
5. The photographer is on the far right.


From clue 4, we know the manager can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, since the photographer must be in position 6 (clue 5), the manager cannot be in position 6, leaving positions 2 and 4 as possibilities for the manager.


Given clue 1, if the manager were in position 2, the paramedic would have to be in either position 1 or 3 to be between the manager and the bartender. However, this setup doesn't allow for the bartender to be on the right of the engineer (clue 2) without conflicting with other conditions when trying to place all jobs.


So, let's consider the manager being in position 4. This means the paramedic must be either in position 3 or 5 to be between the manager and the bartender (clue 1). The photographer is fixed in position 6 (clue 5).


For the musician to be on the left or right of the manager (clue 3) and considering the manager is in position 4, the musician could be in positions 3 or 5. However, since the paramedic also needs to be between the manager and the bartender and must occupy one of these positions, we have a conflict if we try to place the musician directly next to the manager without considering the other clues.


Given that the bartender is on the right of the engineer (clue 2) and the photographer occupies position 6, the bartender cannot be in position 6. If the paramedic is in position 3 (to satisfy clue 1 with the manager in position 4), this leaves us with positions 1, 2, and 5 to place the remaining jobs: engineer, musician, and bartender.


Let's try placing the engineer, musician, and bartender while satisfying all clues:


- Manager is in position 4.
- Paramedic could be in position 3 (to fit between manager and bartender).
- Photographer is fixed in position 6.


We need to place the engineer so that the bartender can be on its right. If we put the engineer in position 1, this leaves positions 2 and 5 for the musician and bartender. However, since the paramedic must be between the manager and the bartender (and assuming it's in position 3), the musician could fit in position 2 or 5.


Trying to satisfy clue 3 with the manager in position 4 means the musician should ideally be next to the manager if possible, but given our constraints, let's see how we can arrange everyone:


If the engineer is in position 1 and the musician is in position 2 (to fit next to the manager or at least on one side of it considering other placements), this doesn't directly conflict with any rules. The paramedic could then indeed be between the manager and the bartender if the manager is in position 4, but we need a configuration that satisfies all clues.


Given these constraints:


- Engineer must be before the bartender (clue 2).
- Manager is even, so it's either in 2 or 4; given photographer is in 6, manager can't be in 6.
- Paramedic between manager and bartender (clue 1), suggesting a sequence like: ...Manager...Paramedic...Bartender or the reverse, depending on their order.


Let's finalize with the manager in position 4 (since it fits better with other clues) and arrange jobs accordingly:


1. Engineer (to satisfy clue 2 and have bartender after engineer).
2. Musician (clue 3; musician next to manager but since manager is in 4, this works for being on one side of the manager considering our setup needs).
3. Paramedic.
4. Manager.
5. Bartender (satisfies clue 1 with paramedic between manager and bartender, and clue 2 with engineer before bartender).
6. Photographer.


Therefore, the final solution table looks like this:

Lv4-1x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step according to the given clues.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 - The owner of the ferret is in an even position.
Given that there are 6 positions (1 through 6), the even positions are 2, 4, and 6. So, the ferret can be in any one of these positions initially.


## Step 2: Apply clue 5 - The owner of the mouse is on the far right.
This means the mouse must be in position 6.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 - The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the mouse.
Since the mouse is in position 6, and considering the ferret can only be in an even position, if the ferret were in position 6 (which is taken by the mouse), there would be no room for the turtle to fit between them. Thus, the ferret must be in either position 2 or 4 to allow the turtle to fit between the ferret and the mouse.


## Step 4: Determine the possible positions of the ferret and turtle with the mouse in position 6.
- If the ferret is in position 2, the turtle could be in position 4 (because it needs to be between the ferret and the mouse), which satisfies clue 2 but we need to consider other clues as well.
- If the ferret is in position 4, there's no direct space for the turtle to be between the ferret and the mouse without overlapping or going out of bounds.


## Step 5: Apply clue 1 - The owner of the goat is on the right of the owner of the pony.
This clue doesn't specify exact positions but indicates a relationship. We know from other clues that position 6 is taken by the mouse, so we have to fit the goat and pony in such a way that respects all given conditions.


## Step 6: Apply clue 4 - The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the cat.
This gives us another relationship but doesn't specify exact positions. However, since the goat must be to the right of the pony (clue 1) and to the left of the cat (clue 4), we have a sequence: pony, goat, cat.


## Step 7: Combine all clues for a possible solution.
Given that:
- The mouse is in position 6.
- The ferret must be in an even position, and considering the turtle needs to be between the ferret and the mouse, let's place the ferret in position 2 (to allow flexibility).
- The turtle then can fit in position 4, satisfying clue 2.
- We have a sequence of pony, goat, cat from clues 1 and 4.

Let's attempt to fill in the remaining positions with these sequences and rules in mind.


## Step 8: Final placement considering all clues.
Given the mouse is in position 6, and if we place the ferret in position 2 (an even number), the turtle can be in position 4. The sequence of pony, goat, cat needs to fit around these constraints.


Considering all constraints:
- Mouse is in 6.
- Ferret could be in 2 (to satisfy being in an even position and allowing space for other pets).
- Turtle then fits well in 4, between ferret and mouse.
- Pony, goat, cat sequence must fit around these placements while respecting clue 1 (goat to the right of pony) and clue 4 (goat to the left of cat).

A possible arrangement that respects all given conditions could be:
- Position 1: Pony
- Position 2: Ferret
- Position 3: Goat
- Position 4: Turtle
- Position 5: Cat
- Position 6: Mouse

This sequence maintains the goat to the right of the pony and to the left of the cat, with the turtle between the ferret and the mouse, and the mouse on the far right.

Lv4-1x6-5	"## Step 1: Analyze the given conditions to understand the positions of the foods.
From condition 1, we know the person eating pear is at position 1. Condition 6 tells us that the person eating orange is at position 6.

## Step 2: Determine the position of pepper based on condition 2.
Condition 2 states that the person eating pepper is in an even position but not at position 4, meaning pepper can be at positions 2 or 6. However, since orange is already determined to be at position 6, pepper must be at position 2.

## Step 3: Use conditions 3 and 5 to determine the relative positions of tomato, radish, and watermelon.
Conditions 3 and 5 indicate that tomato is to the left of radish, and radish is to the left of watermelon. This gives us a sequence: tomato -> radish -> watermelon.

## Step 4: Combine all the information to fill in the table.
Given the sequences and positions determined:
- Pear is at position 1.
- Pepper is at position 2.
- The sequence tomato -> radish -> watermelon needs to fit into positions 3, 4, and 5, as these are the only positions left that can accommodate this order.
- Orange is at position 6.

## Step 5: Finalize the table based on the determined positions.
The sequence that fits all conditions is:
1. Pear
2. Pepper
3. Tomato
4. Radish

Lv4-1x6-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:


1. The software-developer is in an even position.
2. The journalist is on the right of the project-manager.
3. The project-manager is between the journalist and the engineer.
4. & 5. The engineer is on the right of the doctor (these are essentially the same clue).
6. The software-developer is on the right of the journalist.
7. & 8. These clues seem redundant or incorrectly stated, as they simply restate the role without adding new information.


Given these clues, we can start filling in the table:


- From clue 1, the software-developer must be in position 2, 4, or 6 since those are even positions.
- Clue 3 indicates the order is either engineer-project-manager-journalist or journalist-project-manager-engineer. But from clue 2 and the corrected understanding of clue 8 (which likely meant to imply the project-manager is before the journalist), we know the journalist is on the right of the project-manager, suggesting the sequence: ...-project-manager-journalist-...
- Clue 4 & 5 suggest the doctor comes before the engineer.
- Since the software-developer must be after the journalist (clue 6) and in an even position, this limits where the journalist and thus the project-manager can be.


Let's piece it together with these considerations:


Given the constraints:
- The doctor and engineer sequence is fixed as doctor-engineer due to clue 4.
- The sequence involving the project-manager and journalist must have the project-manager before the journalist (clue 8, correcting for redundancy).
- The software-developer being on the right of the journalist and in an even position means if the journalist were in position 3, the software-developer would be in position 4 or 6. But since clue 1 specifies the software-developer is in an even position and we know from other clues that positions must accommodate specific sequences (like doctor-engineer), we can deduce further.


Possible arrangement considering all constraints:


If we start with the fixed sequence of doctor-engineer and knowing the project-manager-journalist sequence, and given the software-developer's constraint, one possible arrangement is:


|       |     1     |   2    |    3     |        4        |     5      |         6          |
| Job   |  Doctor  | Engineer | Project-manager | Journalist | Fisherman | Software-developer |


This satisfies:
- The doctor is before the engineer.
- The project-manager is between the engineer and journalist (considering a broader interpretation of ""between"" in clue 3, given other constraints).
- The software-developer is in an even position (6) and to the right of the journalist.
- The journalist is on the right of the project-manager.


However, realizing that some clues might have been misinterpreted or misstated due to their redundancy or ambiguity, let's re-evaluate strictly based on clear, non-redundant information:


1. Software-developer in an even position.
2. Journalist to the right of the project-manager.
3. Project-manager between journalist and engineer (which could mean either side but is clarified by other clues).
4. Engineer to the right of the doctor.


Given these, a more fitting arrangement considering the constraints and avoiding over-specification from potentially erroneous clues would align with logical deductions about positions and sequences:


The fisherman's position wasn't directly constrained in any clue, so that person could fit into any remaining slot not taken by the other jobs based on their specific constraints. Given this and re-evaluating for clarity and directness of clues without over-assuming from potentially misstated or redundant information:


Therefore, considering all provided constraints and focusing on a logical sequence that fits all given clues directly without inferred redundancy:

Lv4-1x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:

1. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking coffee is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking cola.
3. The person drinking cola is in an even position.
4. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.
5. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking milk.
6. This statement is a repeat of statement 4, so it doesn't add any new information.

From statement 3, we know cola can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, since soy-milk is already indicated to be in position 6 (from the table given), and coffee must be between soy-milk and cola (statement 2), cola cannot be in position 6. This leaves positions 2 and 4 as possibilities for cola.

Given statement 4 (and 6, which is a repeat), fanta must be next to cola. Since cola can only be in an even position, if cola were in position 2, fanta would have to be in either position 1 or 3. If cola were in position 4, fanta would have to be in either position 3 or 5.

From statement 5, we know fanta is on the right of milk. This means that if fanta is in position 3 (next to a potential cola in position 2), milk cannot fit to its left because there's no space for iced-tea to be to the left of milk as required by statement 1. Thus, if cola were in position 2, it would create a problem with placing milk and iced-tea according to their constraints.

So, let's consider cola being in position 4. If cola is in position 4, fanta could be in either position 3 or 5. For fanta to be on the right of milk (statement 5), and considering that milk must be to the right of iced-tea (statement 1), a possible arrangement for these three is: iced-tea, milk, cola, with fanta then being in position 5, because it also needs to be next to cola.

Given coffee is between soy-milk and cola (statement 2), and knowing soy-milk is at the end (position 6) and cola is in position 4, coffee must be in position 5. However, we've already placed fanta in position 5 based on other constraints. This seems to create a conflict.

Let's re-evaluate: If cola is in position 4, and considering all other statements:
- Fanta can't be in position 3 because it needs to be next to cola (statement 4) and also to the right of milk (statement 5). So, fanta being in position 5 makes sense.
- Coffee must be between soy-milk and cola. Since soy-milk is in position 6, coffee cannot be directly next to soy-milk without violating the condition that it's between soy-milk and cola. Thus, coffee should be closer to cola but not directly next to soy-milk.

Considering all constraints again with a focus on resolving the apparent conflict:
- If cola is in position 4, fanta could indeed be in position 5 (to satisfy being next to cola and to the right of milk).
- Milk must be to the right of iced-tea. Given that fanta is in position 5, milk could fit into position 3 if we adjust other positions accordingly.

However, there's a mistake in my initial logic regarding the placement of coffee between soy-milk and cola with the given constraints and the fixed position of soy-milk at the end. Let's correct this by properly applying all constraints:

1. Given soy-milk is in position 6, and considering statement 2 (coffee is between soy-milk and cola), if cola were in position 4, coffee would have to be in position 5 to be between them.
2. But we've determined fanta needs to be next to cola (statement 4) and since cola is in an even position, fanta being in position 5 fits this requirement but conflicts with coffee's placement based on initial analysis.

Reassessing for accuracy:
- Cola in position 4 allows for fanta to be in position 3 or 5. Given that milk must be to the right of iced-tea and fanta to the right of milk, a possible arrangement considering all drinks could be: iced-tea, milk, fanta, cola, coffee, soy-milk.

This order respects:
- Milk is to the right of iced-tea.
- Fanta is to the right of milk and next to cola.
- Coffee is between soy-milk and cola, given the linear arrangement.
- Cola is in an even position (4).
- Soy-milk is at the end.

Thus, the correct table based on all constraints provided would be:

Lv4-1x6-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of photography based on statement 2.
The person whose hobby is photography is in an even position (2 or 4 or 6). This limits the possible positions for photography.


## Step 2: Use statements 1 and 4 to further refine the position of photography and its relation to board-games and skydiving.
Statement 1 says photography is between board-games and skydiving. Statement 4 reiterates this but emphasizes the order as skydiving, photography, board-games (though it seems there might be a slight misunderstanding in interpreting these statements directly due to their similarity). Given statement 2's constraint that photography must be in an even position, if we consider ""between"" in a strict sense regarding positions, and knowing photography can't be on the far left or right because it needs to be between two other hobbies, this suggests photography could likely only fit in position 4 to satisfy being between skydiving and board-games while also adhering to an even position.


## Step 3: Place skydiving relative to video-games based on statement 3.
The person whose hobby is skydiving is to the left of the person whose hobby is video-games. This gives us a starting point for placing these two hobbies but doesn't give exact positions yet.


## Step 4: Determine the possible range for board-games based on statement 5.
Board-games can only be at position 1 or 6, as it must be on the far left or far right.


## Step 5: Combine information to narrow down positions for skydiving and photography.
Given that photography is between skydiving and board-games (and considering photography's even position), if board-games were at position 1, skydiving would have to be in position 2 or 3 for photography to fit in an even position. However, since photography must be in an even position and between them, this scenario fits well with the possibility of skydiving being before photography (in an odd position like 3) if board-games were at position 1.


## Step 6: Place camping and fishing based on statements 6 and 7.
Fishing is to the left of camping. This means these two hobbies can be placed in any order that satisfies this condition, but they must be next to each other.


## Step 7: Final placement considering all constraints.
Given photography's likely position in 4 (to satisfy being between skydiving and board-games and in an even position), and knowing skydiving is before video-games, we can start placing hobbies:
- If board-games were at position 1 (far left), it would fit well with having skydiving, then photography, and then considering the other constraints.
- Skydiving must be before photography (so likely in position 2 or 3 if considering a direct sequence).
- Photography is in position 4 as deduced for satisfying even positioning and being between hobbies.
- Given the constraint that fishing is to the left of camping, these can fit into any remaining slots that allow them to be adjacent.


## Step 8: Attempting a possible arrangement based on deductions:
Considering board-games at position 1 (to satisfy far left or right condition directly), followed by skydiving, then photography in an even position (4), we have:
- Position 1: Board-games
- Position 2: Skydiving (since it must be before video-games and photography is between them in a broad sense)
- Position 3: Fishing (to allow for adjacency with camping)
- Position 4: Photography
- Position 5: Camping (next to fishing, satisfying the condition that fishing is to the left of camping)
- Position 6: Video-games (since skydiving must be to its left)


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x6-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking tea is in an odd position. This means tea can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 5
The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right. This places almond-milk in position 6.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3 and Clue 4 Together
Since the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk (Clue 3), and considering almond-milk is in position 6, tea must be in position 5 because it's the only odd position that satisfies both being next to almond-milk and adhering to Clue 1. Additionally, Clue 4 states the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Given tea is now fixed in position 5, cola must be in either position 4 (since it can't be in an odd position that would conflict with other rules when we consider all clues together).


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 6
The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking cola. This confirms that cola cannot be to the right of tea, reinforcing the placement of cola before tea, which aligns with our deduction from step 3.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 2
The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola. Given cola's position in 4 (from step 3 and step 4), lemonade must be either before or after cola, but since lemonade has to be between juice and cola, this means juice and lemonade must occupy positions that allow for this arrangement while respecting other placements.


## Step 6: Finalizing Positions
Given tea in position 5 and almond-milk in position 6, cola in position 4 (as deduced), we have:
- Tea: Position 5
- Almond-milk: Position 6
- Cola: Position 4

For lemonade to be between juice and cola, considering cola is in position 4, lemonade must be in position 3 (to satisfy being between another drink and cola, and because tea occupies the other odd position that would fit this criteria). This leaves positions 1 and 2 for juice and mirinda (the only remaining beverage not yet placed).

Since lemonade is between juice and cola, and cola is in position 4, juice must be in position 2 to satisfy the ""between"" condition with lemonade in position 3.


## Step 7: Placing Mirinda
The only position left for mirinda, which hasn't been directly mentioned in relation to a specific position or neighbor, is position 1, as all other positions are determined by the clues provided.


The final answer is:

Lv4-1x6-10	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the mystery movie watcher
The person watching mystery movies is on the far right, which means they are at position 6.

## Step 2: Determine the possible positions for the satire movie watcher
Given that the satire movie watcher is to the left or right of the mystery movie watcher and considering the mystery movie watcher is at position 6, the satire movie watcher must be at position 5, as there is no position to the right of 6.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the documentary movie watcher
Since the satire movie watcher is on the right of the documentary movie watcher and the satire movie watcher is at position 5, the documentary movie watcher must be at a position to the left of 5. Considering other constraints, this will be refined further.

## Step 4: Determine the possible positions for the spy and martial-arts movie watchers
The spy movie watcher is to the left of the martial-arts movie watcher. Also, considering the spy movie watcher is in an odd position, potential spots could be 1 or 3, given that other positions may be taken by other genres based on subsequent clues.

## Step 5: Refine the position for the romance movie watcher
The romance movie watcher is in an odd position and to the right of the martial-arts movie watcher. This means if the martial-arts movie watcher were at position 4 (the only even position left that could satisfy being to the left of an odd position), the romance movie watcher would have to be at a position that doesn't exist (to the right of 6 or in a non-existent higher odd number). Thus, the martial-arts and spy pair needs to fit into positions that allow for the romance movie to also fit according to its clues.

## Step 6: Combine all information to deduce each genre's position
Given the mystery movie is at position 6, satire at 5, and considering the need for the spy to be in an odd position and to the left of martial-arts, and the romance being in an odd position but after martial-arts, a likely arrangement starts to form:
- Spy must be at 1 (to satisfy being in an odd position and allowing space for other genres).
- Martial-arts then follows spy, potentially at 2 or another even number that allows for romance to follow it in an odd position.
- Romance is in an odd position after martial-arts, which could fit if martial-arts is at 2 (then romance could be at 3, but this contradicts since romance needs to be after martial-arts directly and in an odd position).
- Documentary must precede satire, so it fits before position 5.
Considering the constraints:
- Spy at 1,
- Martial-arts at 2 doesn't work because then romance would have to be at 3 (which is odd but doesn't allow for documentary and satire's correct positioning based on their clues).
- A possible arrangement could be: Spy at 1, Documentary at 3 (since it must precede satire), Satire at 5 (as deduced), Mystery at 6. This leaves positions 2 and 4 for Martial-arts and Romance, with Romance needing to be after Martial-arts.
- Therefore, a possible fit considering all clues is: Spy at 1, Martial-arts at 2, Documentary at 3, Romance at 4 doesn't work because romance must be odd. This indicates a misunderstanding in the previous step regarding direct placement without considering all constraints simultaneously.

## Step 7: Correct the understanding of genre placements based on all given clues
Re-evaluating:
- Spy is odd and before Martial-arts.
- Documentary is before Satire, and Satire is at 5.
- Mystery is at 6.
- Romance is odd and after Martial-arts.
Given these constraints again and ensuring each clue is satisfied without contradiction:
1. Spy (odd) -> 1 or 3, considering other placements.
2. Since Romance must be odd and after Martial-arts, and given Satire's position at 5, a correct sequence that respects all rules must consider the direct relationships and positional constraints.

## Step 8: Finalize genre positions
Given all clues again:
- Mystery is at 6.
- Satire is at 5 because it's next to Mystery and on its left.
- Documentary then must be before Satire, placing it potentially at 4 or earlier. However, since Romance needs an odd position after Martial-arts, and Spy before Martial-arts in an odd position:
- A correct sequence could be derived by fixing the known positions (Mystery and Satire) and then fitting the rest based on their constraints.

The final answer is:
