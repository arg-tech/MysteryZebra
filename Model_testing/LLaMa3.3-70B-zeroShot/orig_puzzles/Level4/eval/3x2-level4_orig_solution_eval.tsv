Lv4-3x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. There are 2 different nationalities: Colombian, Mexican.
2. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: skiing, water-polo.
3. The people use 2 different means of transport: roller, taxi.
4. The person whose sport is skiing is on the right of the person driving the roller.
5. The Mexican is in an odd position.


Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the Mexican must be in an odd position, the Mexican can only be in position 1.


## Step 1: Determine the nationality of each position
- Position 1: Mexican (because it's an odd position)
- Position 2: Colombian (since there are only two nationalities)


## Step 2: Use clue 4 to determine the sport and transport for each position
- Since the person whose sport is skiing must be on the right of the person driving the roller, and given that ""right"" in this context means position 2 when considering a left-to-right arrangement:
- Position 1 (Mexican) cannot have skiing as their sport because they need to be to the left of the skiing person.
- Therefore, Position 1 must drive the roller, and Position 2 must do skiing.


## Step 3: Assign transport based on clue 4
- Position 1 (Mexican): roller
- Position 2 (Colombian): taxi (since the other means of transport is already assigned)


## Step 4: Assign sports based on previous steps
- We've established that Position 2 (Colombian) does skiing.
- Therefore, Position 1 (Mexican) must do water-polo.


The final solution table should look like this:


#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican   | Colombian|
| Sport         | water-polo| skiing   |
| Transport     | roller    | taxi     |

Lv4-3x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position based on clue 2.
Given that ""the canadian is in an even position,"" and since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the Canadian must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


## Step 2: Apply clue 1 to determine the arrangement of transport and beverage.
The clue states, ""the person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda."" This means the train cannot be in position 2 (because there would be no one to its right), so it must be in position 1. Consequently, mirinda must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Determine the remaining arrangements.
Since the Canadian is in position 2 and mirinda is also in position 2, we can conclude that the Canadian drinks mirinda.


## Step 4: Fill in the remaining blanks based on elimination.
- The transport not yet assigned (motorbike) must be in position 1 because the train is already assigned to position 1 for the transportation column. However, from step 2, we know the train is in position 1. So, motorbike must be in position 2, but since the train is on the left of mirinda and thus in position 1, it means motorbike has to be associated with the other beverage (sprite) in position 2, based on elimination for transport.
- For nationality, we've already determined the Canadian is in position 2. Thus, by elimination, the Turkish person must be in position 1.


## Step 5: Finalize the table based on deductions.
Given the clues and our step-by-step deduction:
- Position 1: Train (transport), Turkish (nationality), Sprite (beverage) - because mirinda is ruled out for this position by clue 1, and Canadian is ruled out by clue 2.
- Position 2: Motorbike (transport), Canadian (nationality), Mirinda (beverage)


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite  |  Mirinda  |

Lv4-3x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The hobbies are collecting and writing.
2. The movie genres are fantasy and martial-arts.
3. The sports are ice-hockey and swimming.
4. The person whose hobby is writing is in an even position, which means they must be in position 2 since there are only two positions (1 and 2) and position 2 is the only even position available.
5. The person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.

Given these clues:

- From clue 4, we know the person who likes writing must be in position 2.
- Since there are only two positions, the person who likes collecting (the other hobby) must be in position 1.
- For clue 5, since the fantasy movie watcher is to the right of the ice-hockey fan, and considering the layout:
  - If the ice-hockey fan were in position 2, there would be no one to the right of them for the fantasy fan to be. Therefore, the ice-hockey fan must be in position 1.
  - This means the swimming fan (the other sport) must be in position 2, as each person has a unique preference.
- Given that the writing hobby is in position 2 and so is martial-arts (because fantasy has to be in position 1 due to the clue about being to the right of ice-hockey), we can now fill out the table.

So, the filled-out table looks like this:

#############
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | Collecting  | Writing  |
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy     | Martial-arts|
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey  | Swimming  |
#############

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- The person whose hobby is writing (position 2) is in an even position.
- The person watching fantasy movies is to the right of no one since they are on the left, but this was a misunderstanding in interpreting the clue. Given the correct understanding that fantasy must be next to ice-hockey and considering the constraints:
  - Ice-hockey is correctly placed with its corresponding fantasy genre in a way that respects the ""to the right"" condition if we consider the initial misinterpretation. However, the actual constraint requires fantasy to be on the right of ice-hockey, which was incorrectly interpreted due to the phrasing of the solution process.
  - Correcting for this misunderstanding: The person who likes fantasy should indeed be next to (and to the right of) the person whose sport is ice-hockey. Given the constraints and correcting my logic flow:
    - If ice-hockey is in position 1, and fantasy needs to be to its right, then fantasy must be in position 2.
    - This means martial-arts is in position 1.
    - The writing hobby is in an even position (2), which matches with the fantasy movie genre being on the right of ice-hockey if we correctly align hobbies with sports and genres as per the clues.

Correcting my earlier response to properly reflect the conditions without misinterpretation:

Given the constraints:
- Writing is in position 2.
- Fantasy must be to the right of ice-hockey, meaning if ice-hockey is in position 1, fantasy should indeed follow, but since we have a limited number of positions and genres, this requires careful placement.

Revisiting with correct logic and proper attention to detail:

If ice-hockey is in position 1 (to satisfy the condition that fantasy is to its right), then:
- Ice-hockey in position 1.
- Fantasy must be in position 2 because it needs to be to the right of ice-hockey, but this conflicts with my initial placement based on misunderstanding. The correct approach should consider all constraints simultaneously.

Correct Approach:
1. Writing is in an even position (2).
2. Ice-hockey and fantasy's relationship requires fantasy to be after (to the right of) ice-hockey.
3. Each person has unique preferences for hobbies, movie genres, and sports.

Given this, a correct alignment considering all constraints would actually require re-evaluating the placements based on the direct clues without assuming positions prematurely:

- Ice-hockey in position 1, as it allows fantasy to be placed according to the clue (but we see now this was initially misaligned with other preferences).
- Correctly, if ice-hockey is in position 1 and fantasy needs to be to its right but considering our unique constraints:
  - The person who watches fantasy movies being on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey actually should guide us to place ice-hockey first (position 1), followed by fantasy. However, with writing in an even position (2) and each preference being unique, we have to adjust our understanding based on all clues together.

The accurate table, respecting that writing must be in position 2 (even), and correctly placing the other preferences according to the given constraints without my earlier misinterpretation, should directly derive from the conditions provided:

- Ice-hockey cannot be in position 2 because fantasy needs to be to its right.
- Writing being in an even position means it's in position 2.

Thus, aligning all clues properly and avoiding premature assumptions about positions based on partial clue analysis, we actually need to ensure each person has a unique set of preferences that fit the given conditions without contradicting any statement:

Given the constraints directly:
1. Ice-hockey is in position 1 (as it needs to be before fantasy).
2. Writing's placement indicates an even number, which here is position 2.
3. Fantasy must follow ice-hockey but considering our setup and direct clues, we place preferences according to all given conditions.

Directly solving based on the constraints without incorrect assumptions:

The writing hobby in an even position (2) directly tells us where one hobby is. The fantasy genre being to the right of ice-hockey means if ice-hockey were in position 1, fantasy would indeed be in position 2, but considering our direct clues about hobbies and sports:

Ice-hockey's placement before fantasy, with writing in an even position (thus in position 2), requires us to align these preferences correctly according to the puzzle statement.

The corrected understanding based on directly applying all constraints without misinterpretation should reflect:

- Ice-hockey first, followed by its corresponding genre preference being after it.
- Writing's placement in an even position (2).

Given this and ensuring each person has a unique set of preferences that fit all conditions provided, the table reflecting these placements accurately according to the clues given is:

Lv4-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
This means the ship is in column 2, and the superhero movie is in column 1.

2. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position.
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the odd position must be 1.

Lv4-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. **Food**: lime, raspberry
2. **Sport**: cricket, rugby
3. **Transport**: quad-bike, skateboard
4. Clues:
   - The person eating raspberry is to the right of the person whose sport is rugby.
   - The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering the clues:

- From clue 2, since the quad-bike driver must be in an odd position, this means the quad-bike driver can only be in position 1 because it's the only odd position available.
  
Let's assign based on the clues:

1. **Position 1 (odd)**: Since the person driving the quad-bike must be in an odd position, let's start by placing the quad-bike in position 1.

2. Given that raspberry is to the right of rugby (clue 1), and knowing there are only two positions, rugby must be on the left (position 1) for raspberry to be to its right. However, we've already determined the quad-bike is in position 1 based on clue 2. This means the person who prefers rugby cannot be driving the quad-bike if we follow both clues logically without contradicting each other.

Considering the constraints and aiming to satisfy both conditions without direct contradiction:

- If the person eating raspberry must be to the right of the person whose sport is rugby, and there are only two positions, it implies rugby should be in position 1 for the condition to hold (since raspberry needs to be on its right).

However, given our need to place the quad-bike in an odd position (which is position 1), we can deduce:

- **Position 1**: Since the quad-bike must be here and considering rugby also needs to be here to satisfy the placement of raspberry to its right, let's clarify:
  - The person in position 1 drives a quad-bike and prefers rugby.
  
This leaves us with:
- **Position 2** (even): Must have skateboard (as it's the only transport left), must prefer cricket (since rugby is taken), and eats raspberry (to be to the right of rugby).

Thus, our solution table looks like this:

#############
|             |     1     |     2      |
| Food        | lime     | raspberry  |

Lv4-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:


1. The fan of metal is on the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.
2. The person whose sport is basketball is in an odd position.


Given the constraints and clues:


- Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering clue 2, the person who likes basketball must be in position 1 because it's the only odd position available.


Let's fill in what we know based on the clues:


|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |
| Sport         | Basketball |            |


From clue 1, since the metal fan is to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing, and considering the sport for position 1 is basketball, we can infer that fishing cannot be in position 1 (because then there would be no one to the right of it for the metal fan to be next to). Therefore, fishing must be in position 2's hobby slot, but this contradicts our direct interpretation. Let's correct the understanding based on all given clues:


If basketball is in position 1 (as deduced), and considering that metal's fan must be to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing (clue 1), it means fishing cannot be directly associated with position 1 because there needs to be a ""right"" position for the metal fan, implying fishing should indeed be in one of the slots but let's clarify with all clues:


Given basketball is in an odd position (thus position 1), and knowing we have two hobbies (fishing, singing), two music genres (metal, trance), and two sports (basketball, water-polo):


- Basketball is already placed in position 1.
- The metal fan must be to the right of fishing, implying if fishing were in position 1, metal would have to be in a non-existent position to its right. Thus, fishing should be associated with position 2 to satisfy the ""to the right"" condition for metal's placement.


So, correcting our approach based on clue 1 and knowing all hobbies and preferences must be uniquely assigned:


- Position 1 has basketball as its sport.
- Since metal's fan is to the right of fishing (and given our setup), fishing should indeed be in position 2 to allow metal to be placed correctly according to the clues.


Now, let's assign the remaining hobbies and music genres based on the constraints:


|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Fishing   |
| Music-Genre   | Trance    | Metal     |
| Sport         | Basketball| Water-Polo|


This setup satisfies all given conditions:
- The fan of metal is to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.
- The person whose sport is basketball is in an odd position (position 1).


Therefore, the solution table, considering all clues and constraints provided, looks like this:

Lv4-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the accountant.
2. The person whose sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person whose sport is skiing.
3. The person eating pepper is in an even position.

Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering the constraints:

- From point 3, since the person eating pepper is in an even position, this means the person eating pepper must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.
- From point 1, the person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the accountant. This implies that skiing cannot be in position 2 (because then it wouldn't be to the left of anyone), so skiing must be in position 1.
- Since skiing is in position 1 and the person eating pepper is in position 2, and from point 2, sailing must be on the left or right of skiing. Given skiing is already in position 1, sailing cannot be to the left of skiing (since there's no position 0), so sailing must be in position 2.
- The accountant, according to point 1, must be to the right of skiing, which means the accountant must be in position 2, because skiing is in position 1.

Now, let's combine all this information with the food options (pepper and radish) and job types (accountant and dancer):

- Position 1 has skiing as the sport.
- Position 2 has sailing as the sport and pepper as the food, and it also must be the accountant based on our deductions.

Given that position 2 is the accountant eating pepper and enjoying sailing, we can deduce the following for position 1:

- Since position 2 is taken by the accountant, position 1 must be the dancer.
- The sport in position 1 is skiing, as deduced earlier.
- The only food left for position 1 (since pepper is taken by position 2) is radish.

Therefore, the completed table looks like this:

1. The person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
2. The person eating pumpkin is in an odd position.


Given that we have two positions (1 and 2), the only odd position available is position 1. Therefore, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 1.


Now, let's fill out what we know based on these clues:

| Sport       |         |            |
| Transport   |         |            |


Since the person eating pumpkin is in position 1 and the person driving the helicopter must be to the right of the person whose sport is surfing, it means the helicopter cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to its left for the surfing condition). Thus, the helicopter must be in position 2.


Given this information:


|             |    1    |     2      |
| Food        | Pumpkin | Blueberry |
| Sport       |         |            |
| Transport   | Bike     | Helicopter|


The only sport left that can fit the first clue (the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing) without contradicting any given information is for surfing to be in position 1 and volleyball to be in position 2, as this satisfies all conditions:


|             |    1    |     2      |

Lv4-3x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Hobbies: baking, woodworking
2. Jobs: bartender, scientist
3. Music genres: classical, r&b
4. The scientist is on the right of the fan of r&b.
5. The person whose hobby is baking is in an even position.

From clue 5, since there are only two positions and the second position (2) is the only even position available, the person who enjoys baking must be in position 2.

Now, using clue 4, if the scientist is on the right of the fan of r&b, and considering the person in position 2 has a hobby of baking, this means the scientist cannot be in position 1 because then they would not be to the right of anyone. Thus, the scientist must be in position 2, but we've established that the baker is in position 2 based on clue 5. However, this initial interpretation seems to create a conflict. Let's clarify:

- Since the scientist must be to the right of the r&b fan (clue 4), and given there are only two positions, the scientist cannot occupy position 1 if they are to be to the right of someone. This means our earlier deduction about the scientist's position needs correction in light of all clues.

Correcting the approach:
- The baker is in an even position, which means position 2 (as it's the only even position available).
- If the scientist is on the right of the fan of r&b and considering the layout, this implies the r&b fan must be in position 1 for the scientist to be ""on the right"" of them in position 2. However, clue 5 tells us the baker (who must be in position 2) can't occupy both roles (scientist and baker), indicating a misunderstanding in combining clues.

Re-evaluating:
- The person whose hobby is baking is in position 2.
- Given this, if we follow clue 4 correctly, it means the scientist (being on the right of the r&b fan) would actually imply the scientist should be in position 2. But since baking's hobbyist is already placed there due to being an even position as per clue 5, our deduction process hit a snag.

Let's rectify this by correctly applying all given conditions without assuming conflicting placements:
- The person with the hobby of baking must indeed be in position 2.
- This means the scientist cannot also be in position 2 if we strictly follow clue 5 without other considerations. So, let's properly place based on all clues without overwriting previous deductions incorrectly.

The correct step-by-step logic should be:
1. The baker is in position 2 (even position).
2. Since the scientist must be to the right of the r&b fan and we have only two positions, it means the r&b fan cannot be in position 2 if the scientist is to be on their right. This actually places the r&b fan in position 1.
3. With the r&b fan in position 1, the scientist (being on their right) must indeed be in position 2, which aligns with our need to place the scientist after considering all given clues.

However, this creates a direct conflict because we previously concluded the baker must be in position 2 based on clue 5. Let's resolve this by re-examining our deductions and correctly assigning roles without contradiction:

Given that:
- The person who enjoys baking is indeed in an even position (thus position 2),
- And acknowledging the scientist needs to be on the right of the r&b fan,

We need to reconsider how these clues interact. If the baker is in position 2, then for the scientist to be ""on the right"" of the r&b fan as per clue 4, it actually suggests an initial misunderstanding in applying the clues directly without considering all possible configurations.

The resolution:
- Position 1 must have the r&b fan because the scientist (who is on their right) needs to be in position 2.
- Given this setup and re-evaluating clue 5 (the baker is in an even position), it actually fits that the baker could indeed be in position 2, aligning with our corrected understanding.

Now, correctly placing all elements without overwriting previous deductions incorrectly:
1. The r&b fan must be in position 1 for the scientist to be on their right.
2. This places the scientist (and thus, by deduction, also the baker) in position 2 because of clue 5 indicating the even position for baking.

However, we still need to align all clues without contradiction:
- The scientist is indeed in position 2, as they must be to the right of the r&b fan.
- The person with the hobby of baking being in an even position means they are also in position 2, which creates a conflict unless we correctly interpret that these roles (scientist and baker) can indeed coexist in our setup due to how clues were initially misapplied.

To finalize without contradictions:
1. Position 1: r&b fan
2. Since the scientist is on the right of the r&b fan, they must be in position 2.
3. The hobby of baking being in an even position also places it in position 2.

This means our final setup should correctly reflect all clues without any role overlap or misinterpretation:

Given that we have:
- A scientist who is on the right of the r&b fan,
- A baker in an even position (which must be position 2),
- And considering both jobs and hobbies,

The correct alignment respecting all given conditions would actually place the r&b fan, bartender, and woodworking in position 1, with the scientist, baking, and classical music in position 2. This satisfies clue 4 (scientist to the right of r&b), clue 5 (baker in an even position), and correctly allocates all hobbies, jobs, and preferences without contradiction.

Thus, the final solution table should be:

1. The person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
2. The person drinking 7up is in an even position.

Given that we have two positions (1 and 2), the even position would be position 2.


From clue 2, since the person drinking 7up must be in an even position, this means the person drinking 7up is in position 2.


Now, let's consider the hobbies and foods:


- Since the person whose hobby is singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi (clue 1), and given that there are only two positions, the person eating kiwi must be in position 1, and the person with the hobby of singing must be in position 2.

- The food left for position 2 is kale (since kiwi is already assigned to position 1).
- The hobby left for position 1 is filmmaking (since singing is already assigned to position 2).


So, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|            |      1      |    2    |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | 7up     |
| Food       | kiwi        | kale    |
| Hobby      | filmmaking | singing |
