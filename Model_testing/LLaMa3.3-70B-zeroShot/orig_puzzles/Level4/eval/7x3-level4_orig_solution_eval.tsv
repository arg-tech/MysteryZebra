Lv4-7x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching thriller movies.
From clue 8, we know the person watching thriller movies is on the far right, which means they are in position 3.


## Step 2: Identify the dancer and their nationality.
From clue 4, the dancer is Russian. This information will be crucial for placing nationalities.


## Step 3: Place the manager based on movie preference.
Clue 10 states the person watching superhero movies is the manager. Clue 3 indicates this person is on the left or right of the owner of the snake, but we don't know the snake's owner's position yet.


## Step 4: Determine the beverage of the snake's owner.
From clue 13, the owner of the snake drinks hot-chocolate. Clue 6 states this person is in an odd position, meaning they could be in position 1 or 3.


## Step 5: Place the ambient music fan and their food preference.
Clue 1 says the fan of ambient music eats nectarine. This helps with placing food but doesn't directly give us a position.


## Step 6: Use clue 9 to further refine positions.
The person eating nectarine is between the Japanese and the fan of country music. This gives us a sequence but not exact positions yet.


## Step 7: Place the bird owner based on clues 5 and 11.
The bird owner is between the person eating plum and the person drinking soy-milk (clue 5), and also between the person watching thriller movies and the Russian (clue 11). Since the Russian is a dancer and must be either in position 1 or 2 to fit with other clues, this helps narrow down positions.


## Step 8: Combine information about the manager and the snake owner.
Given clue 2 (the manager is on the left or right of the Russian) and clue 10 (the manager watches superhero movies), we can start piecing together the jobs and nationalities.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues.
- The person watching thriller movies is in position 3 (clue 8).
- The dancer (Russian) must be in either position 1 or 2. Given clue 11, if the Russian were in position 2, there wouldn't be space for the bird owner between the Russian and the thriller movie fan, so the Russian must be in position 1.
- Clue 9 places the nectarine eater (ambient music fan) between Japanese and country music fans. Since the Russian is in position 1 and must be next to the manager (clue 2), and considering clue 10, we can deduce the manager must watch superhero movies and could fit into position 2 if it weren't for the need to place the snake owner.
- The snake owner drinks hot-chocolate (clue 13) and is in an odd position (clue 6). Given the thriller movie fan is in position 3, and considering clue 3 (superhero movie fan is next to the snake owner), we realize there's a conflict unless we reconsider positions based on all given clues.


## Step 10: Reconsider positions with new insights.
Given the complexity and potential for error in step-by-step logical deduction without visual aids or a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities, let's directly apply key clues to deduce the final table:


1. Russian dancer (clue 4) in position 1.
2. Manager watches superhero movies (clue 10), must be next to Russian (clue 2), and since the manager can't be in position 3 (thriller fan's spot), they're likely in position 2 if we consider all other constraints about movie genres, pets, and beverages.


Given these insights, let's construct a possible solution table based on the clues provided:


|               |     1     |     2     |         3          |

Lv4-7x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the Chinese person's position and job
From clue 10, the Chinese is the accountant. Clue 14 states the Chinese is in an odd position, but since clue 13 places the person whose sport is swimming (who is also Chinese, from clue 5) on the far right, this must mean the Chinese is actually in position 3 because there are only three positions and being on the ""far right"" directly tells us their position.


## Step 2: Place the accountant and determine the turtle's owner
From clue 4, the accountant owns the turtle. Given the Chinese (who is also the accountant) must be on the far right (position 3), this places the turtle in position 3 as well.


## Step 3: Determine the positions based on the turtle and traveling hobby
Clue 3 states the owner of the turtle is in an odd position, which we've established as position 3. Clue 1 mentions the designer is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is traveling, but since the turtle's owner (accountant) is already fixed in position 3, and considering other constraints about positions, we'll need to integrate this information with other clues for precise placement.


## Step 4: Place the fan of hip-hop
From clue 8, the fan of hip-hop is in the middle. This means they are in position 2.


## Step 5: Determine the sport and food for each person
Clue 7 states the person whose sport is baseball eats apple, and clue 9 says this person is on the right of the fan of folk. Since the Chinese (accountant) is in position 3 and their sport is swimming, we can start piecing together the sports and foods.


## Step 6: Place the Australian
Clue 6 states the Australian is on the left of the person eating onion. This gives us a relative positioning but requires integration with other clues for exact placement.


## Step 7: Integrate all clues for final placement
- The Chinese accountant is in position 3, owns a turtle, and prefers swimming.
- The hip-hop fan is in the middle (position 2).
- Clue 12 says the accountant is on the left or right of the musician. Given the accountant's fixed position in 3, the musician must be in either position 1 or 2, but since position 2 is taken by the hip-hop fan, and considering other constraints, we'll have to carefully place the musician.
- Clue 11 states the person whose hobby is chess is Spanish. This, combined with clue 1 about the designer and traveler, will help finalize positions.


## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, let's summarize key points:
- Chinese accountant in position 3, with swimming as their sport.
- Hip-hop fan in position 2.
- Australian on the left of the onion eater.
- Baseball player eats apple and is on the right of the folk fan.
- Designer on the left or right of the traveler.
- Spanish person's hobby is chess.

Lv4-7x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


Given:
- 3 favourite beverages: fanta, juice, lemonade
- 3 types of food: cabbage, peach, watermelon
- 3 jobs: engineer, paramedic, project-manager
- 3 music-genres: hip-hop, jazz, salsa
- 3 nationalities: german, malaysian, nigerian
- 3 pets: cat, frog, snake
- 3 means of transport: bike, taxi, van


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 9 and Clue 12
The owner of the frog is on the far left (Clue 9), and the person driving the bike is also on the far left (Clue 12). This implies that the same person owns a frog and drives a bike.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 1, Clue 3, and Clue 5
The fan of hip-hop is on the far left or far right (Clue 1), but since the Nigerian is on the far right (Clue 3) and the fan of salsa is also on the far right (Clue 5), the hip-hop fan must be on the far left because both far right positions are taken.


## Step 3: Combining Information
From Steps 1 and 2, we know the person on the far left owns a frog, drives a bike, and likes hip-hop.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 6
The fan of jazz is between the German and the project-manager. This doesn't give us exact positions yet but indicates a relationship between these three elements.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 11
The engineer is on the left of the paramedic, which helps in understanding the job sequence but doesn't immediately provide specific column assignments without further information.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 4 and Clue 8
The person eating watermelon drives a van (Clue 4), and this person is on the left or right of the Malaysian (Clue 8). Since the Nigerian is on the far right, and if we consider Clue 5 that the salsa fan is also on the far right, it means the watermelon eater (van driver) cannot be on the far right because they must be adjacent to the Malaysian.


## Step 7: Analyzing Remaining Clues
Given the person drinking lemonade owns a cat (Clue 10), and considering all other information, we start piecing together possible combinations that fit all criteria.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
- From Clue 2, the person drinking juice is in an even position.
- Clue 7 states the cabbage eater is to the left of the van driver.
- Combining these clues with previous deductions helps finalize positions.

Lv4-7x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the preferences of each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The scientist eats grapefruit.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person driving the airplane is on the far right.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person whose sport is sailing eats grapefruit.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The mechanic is to the right of the person watching comedy movies.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 5
The person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person drinking water.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 6
The mechanic's sport is rugby.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 7
The person eating grapefruit drives the scooter.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 8
The Dutch person watches comedy movies.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 9
The person eating peach is in an even position (2 or not applicable since we have only three positions).


## Step 10: Apply Clue 10
The person eating grapefruit drinks iced-tea.


## Step 11: Apply Clue 11
The person driving the scooter is Colombian.


From Clue 1 and Clue 3, we know the scientist eats grapefruit and their sport is sailing. From Clue 7, this person also drives a scooter. From Clue 10, they drink iced-tea. From Clue 11, they are Colombian.


The Dutch person watches comedy movies (Clue 8), which means they cannot be in the first position because the mechanic must be to their right (Clue 4), and there needs to be a person watching documentary movies to the right of someone drinking water (Clue 5).


Given that the airplane driver is on the far right (Clue 2) and considering all other clues, we start building the table:


- The Colombian scientist eats grapefruit, drinks iced-tea, prefers sailing, and drives a scooter.
- The mechanic prefers rugby (Clue 6), must be to the right of comedy (Clue 4), and since the Dutch person watches comedy, they can't be in position 3 because then there wouldn't be space for the mechanic to their right unless we consider positions.


Let's place the Dutch person watching comedy in position 1 or 2. If in position 1, the mechanic would have to be in position 2 (to be to their right), and this leaves us with the scientist (who eats grapefruit and drives a scooter) for position 3, which contradicts since the airplane is on the far right.


So, we adjust based on clues: The person eating peach must be in an even position (Clue 9), meaning they can only be in position 2 because it's the only even position available that fits with other conditions.


If we place the Dutch comedy watcher in position 1 and consider the mechanic must be to their right, this puts the mechanic in position 2. However, Clue 9 says peach is eaten by someone in an even position (which would be 2), suggesting a potential conflict unless the mechanic also eats peach.


Let's resolve with knowns:
- Colombian scientist: grapefruit, iced-tea, sailing, scooter.
- Dutch person watches comedy.
- Mechanic: rugby, potentially eats peach if in position 2.


Given these constraints and considering all clues again for final placement:


The British person remains to be placed along with the documentary watcher, water drinker, and airplane driver.


Since the mechanic is associated with rugby (Clue 6) and must be to the right of comedy (Clue 4), and given that peach is in an even position (Clue 9), which would suggest position 2 for someone eating peach:


- Position 1: Dutch watching comedy, drinking water (because documentary needs to be to the right of water, Clue 5).
- Position 2: Mechanic, eating peach (to satisfy even position requirement), rugby as sport.
- Position 3: Scientist isn't here because they drive a scooter; this must be the airplane driver. Given clues about sports and food already assigned, we deduce the remaining preferences.


Finalizing based on given clues:
- The scientist is Colombian, eats grapefruit, drinks iced-tea, prefers sailing, and drives a scooter (must be in position 1 or 2 based on previous deductions).
- However, since the Dutch person watches comedy and must be followed by the mechanic (who is associated with rugby), and considering the need for someone to watch documentaries to the right of water, we adjust accordingly.


Given that the scientist eats grapefruit, drinks iced-tea, and drives a scooter, they can't be in position 3 because the airplane is there. So, they must fit into one of the first two positions.


Considering all constraints:
- Position 1 could be the Colombian scientist (since they drink iced-tea), but we need to account for everyone's preferences correctly.
- The Dutch person watches comedy and is likely in position 1 because it allows the mechanic (who likes rugby) to be in position 2, satisfying being to the right of comedy.


So, placing individuals with their preferences while respecting all constraints:

Lv4-7x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue carefully and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
The fan of classical music is on the far left or far right. This gives us two possible positions for classical music.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person whose hobby is singing is on the far right. This means that if classical music were on the far right, it would conflict with clue 1 because singing and classical could potentially be the same person, but we don't have enough information yet to confirm this. However, it's clear that classical cannot be in the middle based on its possible positions.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 7
The person watching spy movies is on the right of the pilot, and the project-manager watches spy movies. This means the project-manager must be to the right of the pilot.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The person watching spy movies (project-manager) is on the left of the fan of classical music. Since the project-manager is also on the right of the pilot, and considering clue 6, classical music must be on the far right because the project-manager cannot be on the far left given the constraints.


## Step 5: Determine Position of Classical Music
Given that classical music is on the far right (based on steps 2-4), and knowing from clue 1 that the person whose hobby is singing is also on the far right, we can infer that the fan of classical music and the singer are likely the same person.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 8
The person watching animation movies drives the bus. This clue doesn't give us a specific position yet but links an activity with a mode of transport.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 9
The person driving the tram is in an even position, meaning they can only be in position 2.


## Step 8: Analyze Nationality and Movie Preferences
From clue 11, the Indonesian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. We also know from clue 13 that the German is the fan of blues music.


## Step 9: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Clue 4 indicates the fan of metal is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is gardening. Clue 5 states the person whose sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person whose sport is soccer, and from clue 12, we know the pilot's sport is soccer.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Given all constraints:
- The fan of classical music (and thus the singer) must be on the far right.
- The project-manager (spy movies) is to the left of the classical music fan but to the right of the pilot, placing them in position 2 or 3 if we consider the pilot's placement relative to others.
- Since the tram driver is in an even position (clue 9), and considering other constraints about positions relative to each other, we start to see a pattern where certain activities and jobs can only fit specific slots.


## Step 11: Final Table Construction
Considering all clues:
1. The person who sings is on the far right.
2. Classical music fan is also on the far right (matches with singing).
3. Project-manager watches spy movies, is to the right of the pilot, and to the left of classical music.
4. Pilot's sport is soccer.
5. German is a fan of blues.

Let's construct the table based on these deductions:

From clue 5, we know the Chinese person is on the far left.


## Step 1: Place the Chinese person

## Step 2: Apply clue 4
The person drinking Sprite is the owner of the frog. We don't know where this person is yet.


## Step 3: Apply clue 9
The security-guard is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This doesn't give us enough to place anyone yet.


## Step 4: Apply clue 6
The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the scientist. Still not enough to place anyone.


## Step 5: Apply clue 10
The person whose hobby is dancing is in an even position. This means the dancer can only be in position 2.


## Step 6: Combine clues to start placing people
From clue 7, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person whose sport is parkour. Clue 1 says this person could be on either side, but clue 7 clarifies it's on the right. However, without knowing where parkour or the hedgehog's owner is, we can't place them yet.


## Step 7: Use clue 11
The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of blues. Clue 8 says the fan of blues is on the left or right of the Egyptian. Since we don't know where the Egyptian or the blues fan is, we'll have to come back to this.


## Step 8: Deduce from clue 3
The fan of country is between the person whose sport is golf and the person whose hobby is filmmaking. Without knowing where golf or filmmaking is, we can't place country yet.


## Step 9: Piece together what we have so far
Given that the Chinese person is on the far left (clue 5), and considering all other clues, let's try to fill in some gaps with what we know about positions and hobbies.


## Step 10: Final placement attempts
Let's place the security-guard (from clue 9) on the left since they have to be on the left of someone drinking iced-tea, but without knowing who drinks iced-tea or where they are relative to others, this is tricky. However, if we consider that the Chinese person must be a scientist, security-guard, or social-worker and combining with other clues:


Given clue 2 (the fan of pop is on the left or right of the scientist) and considering all positions, let's place the scientist in position 1 as it gives us flexibility for other placements.


Clue 6 places filmmaking to the right of the scientist. Since dancing must be in an even position (clue 10), and if we assume the scientist is not a dancer (given we have limited information on hobbies for each nationality), we can place dancing in position 2, which means position 3 could potentially be filmmaking.


However, given all these constraints and clues, let's solve it directly by combining the most restrictive conditions:


1. The Chinese person is on the far left.
2. The security-guard must be on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. Filmmaking is to the right of the scientist.
4. Dancing is in an even position.


Given these, a possible arrangement considering all clues could look like this (but we'll have to infer and deduce carefully):


If the Chinese person is a scientist (which fits with clue 2 for pop and gives us a starting point), and assuming they drink one of the beverages (let's say lemonade or iced-tea based on later clues), we can start building out.


However, without manually trying each combination which would be excessively long to detail step-by-step here, let's infer based on given clues:


- Chinese person is on the far left.
- Security-guard must be near someone drinking iced-tea.
- Scientist and filmmaking have a specific relationship.
- Dancing is in an even position.


Let's consider beverage, hobby, job, music-genre, nationality, pet, and sport together now for a final attempt at placement:


Given all constraints and manually trying to fit pieces, here's how it could look (though this step involves a lot of trial and error not fully detailed here due to complexity):

Lv4-7x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


1. The scientist is the person who's sport is skateboarding.
2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
3. The German is on the right of the person whose sport is rugby.
4. The dressmaker is the person watching disaster movies.
5. The person whose sport is rugby is the journalist.
6. The person drinking Mirinda is on the far right.
7. The German is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine.
8. The person whose sport is water-polo is on the far left or far right.
9. The French is between the person eating pineapple and the dressmaker.
10. The German is on the far left or far right.
11. This clue seems redundant as it states the same thing twice, so we'll ignore it for now.
12. The person whose sport is skateboarding is in an odd position.
13. The person drinking milk is the person driving the scooter.
14. The person watching animation movies is on the far left or far right.
15. The person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower.

Given clue 12, and since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), the odd position means the scientist (and thus skateboarding) must be in either position 1 or 3.


From clue 5 and 1, we know the journalist does rugby and is not the scientist (since the scientist does skateboarding). So, possible jobs for each position considering the scientist must be in an odd position are:
- Position 1: Scientist
- Position 2: ? (Could be dressmaker or journalist)
- Position 3: ? (Must be the other of dressmaker or journalist not in position 2)

Clue 6 tells us Mirinda is on the far right, which means position 3 drinks Mirinda.


Given clue 13, milk is associated with the scooter. Clue 11 was deemed redundant and provides no useful information for solving the puzzle, so we ignore it.


From clue 4, the dressmaker watches disaster movies. This helps narrow down movie preferences but doesn't directly place anyone yet.


Clue 9 indicates the French person is between pineapple and the dressmaker (who watches disaster movies). Since we don't know where these are relative to each other or the ends, we'll come back to this later.


Considering clue 10, the German must be on one of the ends. Clue 3 suggests the German is to the right of rugby (the journalist), which means if the German were on the far left, it would contradict the statement since rugby couldn't be to the left of the far left position. Thus, the German likely has to be in position 3 or at least on the right side of the person doing rugby.


However, clue 7 indicates the German is next to nectarine, and clue 15 says nectarine is next to cauliflower. This doesn't directly tell us where they are but suggests a pairing.


Clue 8 tells us water-polo is on one end. Given that skateboarding (scientist) must be in an odd position (1 or 3), and considering other clues, water-polo could potentially fit into the remaining end slot.


Given all these considerations, let's try to piece together a solution:


- Position 1: Skateboarding (Scientist)
- Position 2: ? 
- Position 3: ?


Since clue 8 says water-polo is on an end and considering skateboarding is also on an end (clue 12), if we place the scientist/skateboarding in position 1, water-polo could be in position 3. However, Mirinda is also supposed to be in position 3 (clue 6), which would mean whoever drinks Mirinda does water-polo.


Let's address the beverage issue with clue 13; milk is associated with the scooter. This doesn't directly tell us where the scooter or milk drinker is but gives a relation between transport and beverage.


Given that clue 2 says animation movies are to the right of the quad-bike, and considering other placements, let's try fitting in what we know about nationalities, foods, and jobs:


The French being between pineapple and the dressmaker (clue 9) helps with nationality placement but requires knowing where disaster movies (dressmaker) fit.


Since clue 5 identifies the journalist with rugby, and clue 3 places the German to the right of rugby, this implies a sequence for at least part of the table regarding jobs and nationalities.


Clue 14 suggests animation is on an end. If we place animation on one end, it must be next to either water-polo or skateboarding given those are the ends.


Let's summarize key points before finalizing:
- Scientist does skateboarding (clue 1) and is in position 1 or 3.
- Water-polo is on an end (clue 8).
- Mirinda is on the far right (clue 6), which could mean water-polo if in position 3.
- German is next to nectarine (clue 7) and likely on the far right given rugby's placement relative to them (clue 3).
- Milk is with the scooter (clue 13).


Given all clues, let's try a possible arrangement considering all restrictions:


|               |      1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      |  Milk      | Lemonade   |    Mirinda    |
| Food          | Pineapple  | Nectarine  |   Cauliflower |
| Job           | Scientist  | Journalist |  Dressmaker   |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation  | Disaster   |     Mystery   |
| Nationality   | French     | German     |      Polish    |
| Sport         | Skateboard | Rugby      |   Water-polo  |

Lv4-7x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 2
The person driving the subway is in an odd position. This means the subway can only be in positions 1 or 3.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 8
The person driving the subway is the person eating pineapple. This combines two pieces of information, telling us about both transport and food for one person.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 9
The Japanese is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the subway must be in an odd position (1 or 3), if it's in position 1, the Japanese could be in position 2, and if it's in position 3, the Japanese must be out of the given positions, which doesn't make sense since there are only three positions. Therefore, the subway is likely in position 1.


## Step 4: Combining Information
Given that the person driving the subway eats pineapple (Clue 8) and is in an odd position (likely position 1 from Clue 2 and our deduction), we can start filling in the table:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |           |             |         |

| Sport         |           |             |         |
| Transport     | subway    |             |         |


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 1
The person eating grapes is on the left of the fan of rock. This clue indicates that grapes and rock music are associated with two different people, with grapes being to the left.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 4
The firefighter is in an even position. Given our setup, this means the firefighter must be in position 2.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 11
The writer is on the right of the person driving the tram. This clue tells us about job and transport but doesn't give us a direct placement yet.


## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 6
The person whose sport is sailing is on the right of the Indian. Since we already have the Japanese in position 2, this means the Indian must be in either position 1 or 3 for sailing to be to their right. However, given our earlier deductions about the subway and pineapple being in position 1, and considering other clues, we need to carefully place these nationalities and sports.


## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 5
The person whose sport is sailing is on the right of the person whose sport is golf. This clue links two sports together but doesn't give us direct placements without combining with other information.


## Step 10: Analyzing Clue 3
The Japanese is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Given our current setup, if the Japanese is in position 2 (as deduced), then iced-tea must be either in position 1 or 3.


## Step 11: Combining More Information
From Clue 10, the person whose sport is parkour drinks juice. And since we know the firefighter is in an even position (2), and combining other clues about transport, food, and nationalities, let's try to finalize positions based on all given information.


## Step 12: Finalizing Positions
- The subway driver eats pineapple and is in position 1.
- The Japanese is in position 2 because they are on the right of the subway driver.
- Given the clues about sports (golf, sailing, parkour), nationalities (Dutch, Indian, Japanese), and other preferences, we need to fit these into our table while respecting all given conditions.


## Step 13: Final Deductions
Given that:
- The firefighter is in an even position, so position 2.
- The person driving the tram must be in position 1 or 3 for the writer to be on their right (but since position 1 is taken by the subway, the tram could potentially fit here if it aligns with other clues).
- Combining clues about sports and nationalities to place them correctly.

The person driving the taxi is in an even position.
Given that positions are counted from left to right starting with 1, the even positions are 2 and not applicable directly without further information.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 11
The person driving the taxi is the fan of classical.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 2
The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the social-worker.
Since we don't have direct information about the social-worker's position, we'll come back to this clue later.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 1
The librarian is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
Without knowing the positions of these individuals directly, we note that soy-milk cannot be in position 3 because the librarian needs to be to its right.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 6
The fan of country is the person who's hobby is dancing.
We don't have enough information yet to place this directly.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 7
The owner of the goldfish is between the owner of the frog and the person driving the motorbike.
Given the motorbike is on the far right, this means the goldfish must be in position 2, and either the frog or another pet (horse) could be on the left.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 4
The owner of the horse is on the far left or far right.
Since baseball (and thus chess) is on the far left, if the horse were here, it would conflict with other clues about pets and sports. Thus, the horse must be on the far right, but this conflicts with the motorbike's placement. Re-evaluation is needed considering all pet placements.

## Step 11: Re-evaluate Pet Placements
Given the goldfish is in position 2 (between frog and motorbike), and considering the horse's placement:
- The horse cannot be on the far left because baseball/chess is there.
- If the horse were on the far right, it would conflict with the motorbike.
Thus, our initial deduction about the horse needs adjustment. It seems we have to place pets and other preferences carefully around the motorbike and taxi.

## Step 12: Apply Clue 8
The librarian is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing.
This means skiing cannot be in position 3 because there's no space for the librarian to its right.

Given these steps, let's try to consolidate what we know into a coherent table.


Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, direct application without iterative guessing would lead to incomplete or inaccurate tables. However, based on the information provided:

Lv4-7x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


From clue 1, we know the person eating grapes is on the far right.
From clue 2, we know the architect is on the far right.
Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the architect eats grapes.

From clue 3, the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.
From clue 4, the security-guard is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
From clue 5, the person eating carrot is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
From clue 6, the american is on the left of the dutch.
From clue 7, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
From clue 8, the person drinking fanta is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is chess.
From clue 9, the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking milk.
From clue 10, the teacher is in an odd position (1 or 3).
From clue 11, the turkish is the teacher.
From clue 12, the person watching drama movies is the person eating carrot.
From clue 13, the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

Now let's start filling in the table based on these clues:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the architect and the person eating grapes
Given that the architect eats grapes and is on the far right (clue 2), we can place this information in the table for position 3.


## Step 2: Place the teacher
Since the teacher is in an odd position (clue 10) and must be either position 1 or 3, but position 3 is taken by the architect, the teacher must be in position 1. The teacher is also Turkish (clue 11).


## Step 3: Determine the movie genre for the person eating carrot
The person watching drama movies eats carrot (clue 12). This means the drama movie watcher cannot be in position 3 (already determined to be the architect who eats grapes), so they must be either in position 1 or 2.


## Step 4: Place the person drinking almond-milk, fanta, and milk
The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta (clue 7), and the person drinking fanta is between the person whose hobby is traveling and the person whose hobby is chess (clue 8). This sequence must fit within the constraints of the other clues.


## Step 5: Place the remaining preferences
Considering clue 13, the person whose hobby is traveling must be next to the drama movie watcher. Given the constraints about beverages, hobbies, jobs, and transportation, we will fill in the table accordingly.


Given all these steps and clues, let's attempt to construct the solution:
