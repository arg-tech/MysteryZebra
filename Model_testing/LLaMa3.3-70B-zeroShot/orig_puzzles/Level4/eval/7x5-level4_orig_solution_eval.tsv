#############

Note: The solution was obtained by carefully applying the given clues and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 9 states that the owner of the ferret is on the far left, so the ferret is placed in column 1.
* Clue 14 states that the person watching comedy movies is on the far left, so comedy is placed in column 1 of the Movie-Genre row.
* Clue 15 and 20 state that the dressmaker is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the videographer (from clue 11), the dressmaker must be on the far right, but then clue 1 would put the horse in column 4 or 5 which would contradict with other clues so it's more likely that the dressmaker is in column 2.
* Clue 13 states that the person drinking juice is the dressmaker, so juice is placed in column 2 of the Beverage row.
* Clue 17 states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is between the owner of the goldfish and the person drinking 7up. Since the dressmaker (juice) is already in column 2, hot-chocolate must be in column 3, with the goldfish in column 5 and 7up in column 4 or vice versa.
* Clue 23 states that the fisherman is the person drinking hot-chocolate, so fisherman is placed in column 3 of the Job row.
* Clue 5 states that the scientist is in the middle, so scientist is placed in column 3 of the Job row. However this would mean that there are two jobs for one person (fisherman and scientist) which isn't allowed, hence we need to swap the job of the person in column 2 with the person in column 3.
* Clue 4 states that the scientist is in the middle, so scientist is placed in column 3 of the Job row. 
* Clue 18 states that the person who's sport is parkour is the pakistani, and clue 8 states that this person is between the nigerian and the person who's sport is weightlifting.
* Clue 25 states that the person eating lettuce is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since water-polo is already in column 4 of the Sport row, lettuce must be in column 3 of the Food row.
* The rest of the table can be filled in using a combination of the remaining clues.

Note: This solution assumes that each person has a unique job, nationality, pet, sport, food, beverage and movie-genre. Also note that some clues may have been used implicitly or explicitly to derive the final solution. 

Also please note that this problem is quite complex, hence it's possible there might be another arrangement of the data which could also satisfy all conditions given in the question. The solution provided above is one such arrangement but there could be more."	{'beverage': ['comedy', 'juice', 'hot-chocolate', 'water', '7up'], 'food': ['onion', 'papaya', 'lettuce', 'orange', 'peas'], 'job': ['videographer', 'dressmaker', 'scientist', 'security-guard', 'fisherman'], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', 'martial-arts', 'horror', 'family', 'spy'], 'nationality': ['mexican', 'nigerian', 'pakistani', 'brazilian', 'japanese'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'horse', 'guinea-pig', 'rabbit', 'goldfish'], 'sport': ['cycling', 'parkour', 'weightlifting', 'water-polo', 'ice-hockey']}	True	12	False

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis and deduction to arrive at the correct answer. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used to solve the puzzle:

* Clue 3 states that the owner of the bird is on the far left, which means the bird is in position 1.
* Clue 14 states that the owner of the bird is drinking hot-chocolate, so hot-chocolate is in position 1.
* Clue 15 states that the canadian is on the far left, which means the canadian is in position 1.
* Clue 22 states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is watching disaster movies, so disaster movies are in position 1.
* Clue 2 states that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the owner of the goat, and clue 20 states that the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the ferret. This means the ferret and soy-milk are in positions 4 and 5 (since the goat must be to the left of the ferret).
* Clue 12 states that the person who's sport is cricket is drinking mirinda, so cricket and mirinda are in position 2 or 3.
* Clue 1 states that the person who's sport is biathlon is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person watching martial-arts movies. This means biathlon must be in position 3 (since cricket is in position 2 and martial-arts movies are in position 3 or 4).
* Clue 6 states that the person driving the boat is in an odd position, which means the boat is in position 1, 3, or 5. However, clue 17 states that the person driving the boat is on the right of the person eating cherry, and clue 19 states that the person driving the scooter is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. This means the boat must be in position 3 (since the scooter is in position 2 or 4).
* Clue 9 states that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person driving the motorbike, and clue 24 states that the person who's sport is snowboarding is the owner of the frog. This means snowboarding and the frog are in position 5 (since the motorbike must be to the left of the frog).
* Clue 16 states that the turkish is on the right of the person driving the scooter, which means the turkish is in position 4 or 5.
* Clue 7 states that the person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the turkish. This means romance movies are in position 3 or 4 (since the turkish is in position 4).
* Clue 10 states that the japanese is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means the japanese is in position 2 or 3 (since martial-arts movies are in position 3).
* Clue 11 states that the person who's sport is handball is on the far left or far right, which means handball is in position 1 or 5.
* Clue 21 states that the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person who's sport is handball. This means the ferret is in position 1 or 4 (since handball is in position 1).
* Clue 25 states that the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the ferret and is on the left of the person eating tomato. This means soy-milk and the ferret are in position 4, and tomato is in position 5.
* Clue 26 states that the person driving the scooter is on the right of the owner of the goat. This means the scooter is in position 2 or 3 (since the goat must be to the left of the scooter).

* Clues 15-20 further restrict the sport column and introduce constraints for the music-genre column.
* Clues 21-27 refine the placements in the food, movie-genre, and transport columns.

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis of each statement to arrive at the correct arrangement. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

* From clue 7, the paramedic is on the far right.
* Clue 14 states that the paramedic owns the fish, so the pet in column 5 is fish.
* Clue 11 says the videographer is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the paramedic (column 5) cannot be on the left of anyone, the videographer must be in column 4.
* Clue 12 states that the person eating watermelon drives the train, and clue 8 says this person is a fan of soul. So, the food in column 4 is watermelon, and the music-genre is soul.
* Clue 2 says the person eating watermelon (column 4) is on the left of the person eating cucumber. Therefore, the food in column 5 is cucumber.
* Clue 9 states that the fan of soul (column 4) is on the right of the person eating asparagus. So, the food in column 3 must be something other than asparagus or watermelon, and since zucchini is in an odd position (clue 10), it goes in column 3.
* Clue 1 says the bus driver is on the far left or far right. Since the paramedic is already on the far right, the bus driver must be on the far left (column 1).
* Clue 25 states that the person drinking cola is in the middle, which means they are in column 3.
* Clue 15 says the person whose hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person drinking cola. So, the hobby in column 4 is not woodworking, and since skydiving is on the left or right of the train driver (clue 5), it goes in column 4.
* Clue 3 states that the roller driver is on the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking. This means the transport in column 5 cannot be roller, so it must be bus.
* The remaining clues are used to fill in the rest of the table.

- Clue 4 and clue 15 confirm that the fan of soul is into swimming, and from clue 5, this person must be to the left of the country music fan. Given the arrangement, this places soul in position 5.
- Clue 2 places classical between water and lettuce. Considering other constraints, especially with clue 1 and the positions of sailing and soul, classical ends up in position 3.

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis of each statement to arrive at the final answer. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:

* Clue 26 places golf at position 1.
* Clue 10 places disco at an odd position (since bike is driven by the fan of disco), and clue 17 places iced-tea to the right of bike, which means disco must be at position 3.
* Clue 25 places baking at the boat, so baking must be at position 1.
* Clue 12 places badminton to the left of baseball, and clue 14 places baseball to the left of dressmaker. Since golf is already at position 1, this sequence must start from position 2.
* Clue 23 places electronic with doctor, and clue 20 places lizard near electronic. Clue 24 places hamster with dressmaker.
* Clue 5 places gardening to the left of roller, which means gardening cannot be at position 5 (since there's no one to the right). Gardening is placed at position 3 due to other constraints.
* Clue 11 places hiking to the left of gardening. With baking already at position 1 and golf at position 1 as well, hiking must be at position 2.
* Clue 13 places scientist between hiking and iced-tea. This means scientist must be at position 3 or 4 (but not 5 since there's no one to the right). However, clue 18 restricts hot-chocolate to near scientist, which can only fit if scientist is at position 2 and hot-chocolate is at position 1 or 3.
* Clue 19 places r&b near punk. Given other constraints, this means r&b must be at position 5 (to satisfy clue 6 as well).
* The remaining clues help to fill in the rest of the positions.

This explanation only scratches the surface of how each clue contributes to the solution, but it should give you an idea of how some of the initial placements were made."	{'beverage': ['milk', 'hot-chocolate', 'mirinda', 'sprite', 'iced-tea'], 'hobby': ['baking', 'hiking', 'gardening', 'cooking', 'dancing'], 'job': ['chef', 'scientist', 'mechanic', 'dressmaker', 'doctor'], 'music-genre': ['metal', 'electronic', 'disco', 'punk', 'r&b'], 'pet': ['guinea-pig', 'rabbit', 'hamster', 'snake', 'lizard'], 'sport': ['golf', 'badminton', 'baseball', 'lacrosse', 'swimming'], 'transport': ['boat', 'bike', 'roller', 'tram', 'ship']}	True	10	False
