Lv4-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. **Singing hobby is on the left of the goldfish owner.**
2. **Hip-hop fan is on the right of the disco fan.**
3. **Fanta drinker eats plum.**
4. **Sprite drinker is in an even position (which means position 2).**
5. **Social-worker's hobby is photography.**


From clue 4, we know the sprite drinker is in position 2.

| Pet           |         |               |


From clue 3, since the fanta drinker eats plum and the sprite drinker is in position 2, the fanta drinker must be in position 1 because there are only two positions.


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Sprite        |

| Pet           |         |               |


Clue 5 tells us the social-worker's hobby is photography. Since we don't know the jobs' positions yet, let's hold off on assigning jobs.


From clue 1, the person whose hobby is singing must be on the left of the goldfish owner. This means if the singer is in position 1, the goldfish cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to the left of position 1), so the goldfish must be in position 2, and thus the horse is in position 1.


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Sprite        |

| Music-Genre   |         |               |
| Pet           | Horse   | Goldfish      |


Now, let's deal with the jobs and music genres.


Clue 5 already told us the social-worker is into photography, so the doctor must be into singing (since there are only two hobbies).


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Sprite        |

| Music-Genre   |         |               |
| Pet           | Horse   | Goldfish      |


Clue 2 says the hip-hop fan is on the right of the disco fan. This means the disco fan must be in position 1, and the hip-hop fan in position 2.


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Sprite        |
| Food          | Plum    |               |
| Hobby         | Singing | Photography   |
| Job           | Doctor  | Social-Worker |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Hip-Hop       |
| Pet           | Horse   | Goldfish      |


The only thing left is to assign the food. We know from clue 3 that the fanta drinker (position 1) eats plum, so the sprite drinker (position 2) must eat blueberry.

Lv4-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position based on the hobby and food
From clue 4, we know the person eating broccoli is also into writing. This doesn't directly tell us their position but gives us a clear association between broccoli and writing.


## Step 2: Use clue 2 to establish a relationship between broccoli and rock music
Clue 2 tells us that the person eating broccoli is on the left or right of the fan of rock music. Since we have only two positions (1 and 2), this means the rock music fan cannot be in position 1 if the broccoli eater is in position 2, and vice versa.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1 regarding the Polish person's position relative to asparagus
The Polish person is on the right of the person eating asparagus. This implies that asparagus must be eaten by the person in position 1 because if it were in position 2, there would be no room for the Polish person to the right.


## Step 4: Determine the beverage based on clue 3
The person drinking juice is in an odd position, which means they must be in position 1 since that's the only odd position available.


## Step 5: Use clue 5 regarding the pets' owners
The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since we know from the table setup that ""gold"" (implying goldfish) is already in position 2 under Pet, this aligns with our deductions so far.


## Step 6: Combine all clues for a comprehensive solution
Given:
- Asparagus must be in position 1 because the Polish person is to the right of asparagus.
- Juice is also in an odd position (position 1).
- Broccoli and writing are associated, and since broccoli's position relative to rock music isn't fixed yet but we know it can't be next to itself, this pair must occupy one side of the table. Given that broccoli is eaten by someone who writes and considering asparagus is in position 1, broccoli must then be in position 2.
- Rock music fan must be next to broccoli, which places them potentially in either position but since we've established most other relationships, let's solidify based on remaining clues.


## Step 7: Final placement
Given all associations:
- Position 1 has asparagus and juice. Since the Polish person is to the right of asparagus, and considering our pet clue (goldfish on the right), the Dutch person must be in position 1.
- Position 2 then has broccoli, writing as a hobby, and since it's associated with rock music and the goldfish owner, we can place these items here. The Polish person is also on the right, so they must be in position 2.


Considering all clues:
- Position 1: Dutch, juice, asparagus, fish (to fit the clue about the goldfish being to the right of the fish), and by elimination, jazz music.
- Position 2: Polish, tea (since it's the remaining beverage), broccoli, writing, rock music, goldfish.


The final answer is:

| Beverage      | juice      | tea      |
| Food          | asparagus  | broccoli |

Lv4-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 4 - The fan of folk is on the far right.
This means that in the Music-Genre row, ""folk"" must be in column 2.


## Step 2: Apply clue 3 - The fan of folk is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
Given that folk is in column 2, gardening must be in column 1 (since folk has to be on the right of gardening).


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 - The Pakistani is on the left of the fan of folk.
Since folk is in column 2, and the Pakistani must be on the left of the fan of folk, the Pakistani must be in column 1.


## Step 4: Determine Nationality for column 2.
Given that there are only two nationalities (German and Pakistani) and the Pakistani is in column 1, the German must be in column 2.


## Step 5: Apply clue 5 - The person drinking Fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
This means golf cannot be in column 2 because there would be no one to the right of golf. Thus, golf must be in column 1, and since Fanta must be to the right of golf, Fanta is in column 2.


## Step 6: Determine Beverage for column 1.
Since Fanta is in column 2, and there are only two beverages (Cola and Fanta), Cola must be in column 1.


## Step 7: Apply clue 1 - The person driving the subway is in an odd position.
Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), an odd position means the subway must be in column 1. This leaves the bus for column 2.


## Step 8: Determine Sport for column 2.
Since golf is in column 1, tennis must be in column 2.


## Step 9: Determine Music-Genre for column 1.
Given that folk is in column 2, dubstep must be in column 1.


## Step 10: Determine Hobby for column 2.
Since gardening is in column 1, reading must be in column 2.


The final answer is:

Lv4-6x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
2. The person drinking mirinda is the person eating watermelon.
3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person watching sports movies.
4. The fan of country is in an odd position.


Let's start filling in the information:


- From clue 2, we know mirinda and watermelon go together.
- From clue 1, sudoku must be to the right of skateboarding.
- Clue 3 tells us juice is to the right of sports movies.
- Clue 4 indicates country music is in an odd position (1), meaning it can't be associated with person 2.


Given these clues, let's start with what we know for sure:


|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |               |         |
| Food          |               |         |
| Hobby         |               |         |
| Movie-Genre   |               |         |
| Music-Genre   |               |         |
| Sport         |               |         |


From clue 4, since country music must be in position 1 (as it's the only odd position available), let's place that first:


|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |               |         |
| Food          |               |         |
| Hobby         |               |         |
| Movie-Genre   |               |         |
| Music-Genre   | Country      | R&B     |
| Sport         |               |         |


Now, let's use clue 2 to place mirinda and watermelon together. Since we don't know the exact positions yet for beverages and food relative to other categories, let's keep this in mind for later.


Clue 3 tells us juice is to the right of sports movies. This means sports movies must be on the left (position 1), and since country music is already placed in position 1, we have a conflict unless we interpret ""right"" as being below in terms of category alignment but still adhering to the column rule for this specific clue.


Given the direct clues about positions:


- Country music is in position 1.
- The person drinking mirinda eats watermelon (clue 2).
- Sudoku is to the right of skateboarding (clue 1), suggesting skateboarding could be in position 1 if we're aligning hobbies and sports directly.


Let's place sports movies in position 1 for movie-genre since it has to be on the left, and thus juice must be in position 2 for beverages:


|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Mirinda     | Juice   |
| Food          | Watermelon | Kale    |
| Hobby         | Reading     | Sudoku  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     | Romance |
| Music-Genre   | Country    | R&B     |
| Sport         | Skateboard | Rugby   |


This arrangement satisfies all given conditions:


1. Sudoku (right) is indeed to the right of skateboarding (left).
2. Mirinda and watermelon are together.
3. Juice is to the right of sports movies in a category sense, considering our interpretation.
4. Country music is in an odd position.


Therefore, the final solution table, taking into account all clues provided and ensuring consistency across categories while respecting the specific instructions about positioning, is:


#############
|               |       1       |    2    |

## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person whose hobby is video-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is traveling. This means the left column must be for traveling and the right column for video-games.

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |               |             |

| Transport     |               |             |

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is odd, hot-chocolate must be associated with the first column.

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate|             |

| Transport     |               |             |

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the accountant. This clue doesn't directly tell us which column is for the accountant, but since it mentions ""on the right,"" and given that video-games are already determined to be in the right column (from Clue 1), the accountant must be in the left column because there's no one to the right of the right column.

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate|             |

| Transport     |               |             |

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the scooter is on the right of the fan of jazz. This means that jazz must be associated with the left column because the scooter (and thus its driver) is in the right column.

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate|             |

| Music-Genre   | Jazz          |             |
| Transport     |               | Scooter    |

## Step 5: Filling in the Remaining Information
Given that hot-chocolate is already assigned, mirinda must go to the right column. The lawyer hasn't been placed yet but since the accountant is in the left column and zombie movies are associated with someone on the right (from Clue 3), it implies the lawyer is in the right column because zombie movies were determined to be there.

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate| Mirinda     |

Lv4-6x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person watching disaster movies is in an even position.
   - This means the person who watches disaster movies must be in position 2 since it's the only even position.


2. The person whose hobby is baking is on the left of the person whose hobby is fishing.
   - This implies that baking is associated with person 1 and fishing with person 2.


3. The fan of country is on the left or right of the British.
   - Without knowing the exact positions of the nationalities yet, we note this for later use.


4. The fan of country is on the right of the person whose sport is baseball.
   - This clue, combined with clue 2 and considering the limited options, suggests that if baseball were associated with person 1 (baking), it would place country music in a position that contradicts other clues or forces an impossible arrangement. Thus, baseball must be with person 2 or another arrangement that fits all conditions.


5. The owner of the frog is the fan of disco.
   - This clue directly links two preferences but doesn't specify positions yet.


From clue 4 and considering the constraints:
- If country music's fan is on the right of the baseball enthusiast, and given baking (thus potentially baseball, if it were to fit here) is on the left, this suggests an order where country can't be on the left unless it's paired with a different set of preferences that still adhere to all rules.


Let's try fitting:
- Given clue 2 (baking on the left, fishing on the right), and clue 1 (disaster movies in position 2), we start with:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Movie-Genre|            | disaster |
  
- From clue 5, since the frog owner likes disco, and without loss of generality placing this combination in position 1 for now to see how it fits with other clues:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Movie-Genre|            | disaster |
  | Music-Genre| disco?     |          |
  
- Considering clue 4 (country music fan is on the right of baseball), if we place baseball in position 1, it contradicts our current setup unless country is in position 2. However, given the constraints and aiming for a coherent fit:
  - We know from clue 3 that country's fan must be next to the British person.
  
- Placing nationalities considering clue 3 (country music fan next to British) and the arrangement so far:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Movie-Genre|            | disaster |
  | Music-Genre| disco?     | country? |
  | Nationality| british?   | egyptian?|
  
- Since country must be on the right of baseball (clue 4), and if we consider baseball for position 1 to fit this, it might seem contradictory without directly placing sports. Let's correct our approach focusing on direct clues:
  - The fan of country is after baseball, and given baking is before fishing, a more straightforward path considering all clues together might involve setting the sports first based on clue 4.


Re-evaluating with sports in mind:
- Baseball must come before country music (clue 4), which suggests an order but doesn't directly tell us the positions without considering other preferences.


Let's place pets and music genres more precisely, given we know the frog owner likes disco (clue 5):
- If the frog is with person 1 (to satisfy the left/right conditions with other clues), then:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Pet        | frog       | fish      |
  | Music-Genre| disco      | country   |

Given this, and knowing disaster movies are in position 2:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Movie-Genre| mystery    | disaster |
  | Music-Genre| disco      | country   |
  | Pet        | frog       | fish      |

Now, placing nationalities with clue 3 (country fan next to British):
- Since country music is in position 2, the British person must be in position 2 as well to satisfy ""on the left or right"" condition directly.


And sports, knowing baseball comes before country:
- Baseball in position 1 and snowboarding in position 2 fits all given conditions when considering the need for country music to follow baseball.


Finalizing with nationalities and sports:
  | Hobby      | baking     | fishing   |
  | Movie-Genre| mystery    | disaster |
  | Music-Genre| disco      | country   |
  | Nationality| egyptian   | british   |
  | Pet        | frog       | fish      |
  | Sport      | baseball   | snowboarding|

The solution, therefore, considering all clues and their implications:

From clue 3, we know the project-manager's hobby is dancing.


Clue 1 tells us the project-manager is on the left of the person watching romance movies. This means the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 1 because there would be no one to their left.


Clue 2 states the person eating kiwi is in an odd position, which means they could be in either position 1 or 3 (since we only have two positions and both are odd).


Clue 4 says the person driving the boat is in an odd position. Given that our positions are labeled 1 and 2, this implies the boat driver must be in position 1 because it's the only odd-numbered position available.


From clue 5, we understand the Australian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli. Since there are only two positions, this means the Australian cannot be eating broccoli unless one of them is in position 1 and the other in position 2.


Let's start filling in based on what we know for sure:


- The project-manager (whose hobby is dancing) must be in position 1 to satisfy clue 1 that they are on the left of the romance movie watcher.
- The person eating kiwi is in an odd position, and since position 1 is taken by the boat driver (from clue 4), this means the kiwi eater could potentially be in either spot but given the boat driver must also be in an odd spot, we need to carefully consider other clues.


Given these constraints:


- If the project-manager is in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of the romance movie watcher and since their hobby is dancing), they cannot watch romance movies themselves. Thus, the person watching romance movies must be in position 2.
- The boat driver is in an odd position, which means they are in position 1. This aligns with the project-manager's placement because it doesn't conflict with any given information directly.


Considering nationalities and foods:


- Since the Australian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli (clue 5), and assuming one of these individuals could be the project-manager, we have to fit in the other clues around this.


Let's piece together what we know for sure now and fill in the rest logically:


1. The project-manager (dancing) is in position 1.
2. The person watching romance movies must then be in position 2.
3. The boat driver is also in an odd position, which means they are in position 1, aligning with the project-manager.


Given these points and filling in logically:


- **Position 1:** Project-manager (dancing), eats broccoli (since if they ate kiwi, it would conflict with other potential placements for kiwi given its odd positioning requirement), is Australian (to satisfy being next to someone eating broccoli without specifying which food the Australian eats directly), watches drama movies (since romance is taken by position 2), and uses a boat.


- **Position 2:** This leaves us with someone who is a doctor, eats kiwi (satisfying its odd positioning indirectly since it's in the only other spot), has chess as a hobby, prefers romance movies, is Pakistani, and uses a skateboard.


So, filling out our table:

Lv4-6x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


1. The person driving the car is the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person driving the car.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left.
4. The fan of dubstep is on the left of the dutch.
5. The owner of the lizard is in an odd position.


Given these clues, let's start filling out the table:


- From clue 3, we know the person who likes water-polo is on the far left. This means the arrangement for sport is already partially determined: Water-polo | ?


- Clue 1 tells us that the person whose hobby is video-games drives a car. Since clue 2 states the ship driver is to the right of the car driver, we have an initial transport arrangement: Car | Ship


- Combining this with clue 3, our table starts to look like this:
 
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         |             | video-games   |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |
| Nationality   |             |               |
| Pet           |             |               |
| Sport         | water-polo  |               |
| Transport     |             | car           |


Given the ship must be to the right of the car (clue 2), and considering our initial setup, we realize there might have been a misunderstanding in directly assigning video-games to column 2 without considering all clues. Let's correct this by applying the clues more systematically:


1. Water-polo is on the far left (Sport).
2. The person who drives the car has video-games as a hobby.
3. The ship is to the right of the car.


So, our corrected initial step should focus on placing water-polo and then figuring out how to arrange the other preferences around it, keeping in mind the transport clue.


- For Sport: Water-polo | ?
- Since water-polo is on the far left, let's consider hobby, music-genre, nationality, pet, and transport for both columns.


From clue 4, the fan of dubstep is to the left of the dutch. This doesn't directly tell us which column is which yet, but it helps with the relative positioning of music-genre and nationality.


Clue 5 tells us the lizard owner is in an odd position, meaning they can only be in column 1.


Let's summarize what we have so far without prematurely assigning positions:


- Water-polo on the left.
- Car and ship for transport, with car to the left of ship.
- Video-games hobby associated with the car.
- Dubstep fan to the left of the dutch person.
- Lizard owner in an odd (left) position.


Now, let's place these systematically:


1. **Sport**: Water-polo | Skateboarding (since water-polo is on the far left)
2. **Transport**: Car | Ship
3. Given video-games is associated with the car and thus likely on the left, but we must remember to fit all clues:
   - **Hobby**: ? | Video-games doesn't necessarily fit as we initially placed it without considering all other options.
4. Considering the lizard owner is in an odd position (thus column 1), and the relative positions of others:


Let's correct our approach by systematically applying each clue to ensure accuracy:


- The water-polo fan is on the far left, which means skateboarding must be on the right for Sport.
- The car driver has video-games as a hobby and must be to the left of the ship driver.
- Given the clues about music-genre, nationality, pet, and ensuring we fit all given preferences without contradiction:


Our corrected approach should align all clues accurately. Let's re-evaluate our steps with the clues in mind:


Given that water-polo is on the far left, and considering transport (car to the left of ship), hobbies (video-games with car), music-genre (dubstep fan to the left of dutch), nationality (dutch placement relative to dubstep), pets (lizard owner in an odd position), and sport (water-polo on the left, skateboarding on the right):


We can start by fixing water-polo and skateboarding for Sport, then use the transport clue to guide us on hobbies since video-games is tied to the car:


Given all clues and ensuring we don't contradict any information, let's place them systematically without jumping to conclusions:


1. Water-polo (left) and Skateboarding (right) for Sport.
2. Car (left) and Ship (right) for Transport, with video-games associated with the car driver.


Considering these placements and ensuring all clues fit without contradiction:


For Music-Genre: Blues and Dubstep
- The dubstep fan is to the left of the dutch person.


For Nationality: Brazilian and Dutch
- With the clue about the dubstep fan's position relative to the dutch, we can infer some nationality placements but must ensure it aligns with all given information.


For Pet: Lizard and Turtle
- The lizard owner is in an odd (left) position.


Given these clues, let's fill out the table accurately:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| video-games   |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep     | blues         |
| Nationality   | brazilian   | dutch         |
| Pet           | lizard      | turtle        |
| Sport         | water-polo  | skateboarding |
| Transport     | car         | ship          |


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:

|               |      1      |       2       |

Lv4-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the lizard is in an even position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means the lizard's owner must be in position 2 because position 2 is the only even position available.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person whose hobby is hiking is in an odd position, which means they must be in position 1 since it's the only odd position.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 3
The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This implies that the skateboard user cannot be in position 2 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in position 1, and thus, the martial-arts movie fan must be in position 2.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the fan of metal. Without knowing the exact positions of these preferences yet, we note that this clue links two categories but doesn't specify their order relative to each other directly.


## Step 5: Consider Clue 5
The fan of soul is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Given the martial-arts fan is in position 2 (from Step 3), and considering there are only two positions, this means the soul music fan must be in position 1.


## Step 6: Combine Information
From Steps 2 and 5, we know position 1 has the hiking hobbyist and the soul music fan. From Steps 1 and 3, position 2 is associated with the lizard owner and the martial-arts movie fan. Clue 4 indicates avocado's position relative to metal but doesn't specify which is on the left or right directly.


## Step 7: Deduce Food and Music Genres
Given that the soul music fan is in position 1 (from Step 5) and must be next to the martial-arts movie fan in position 2, we can infer from Clue 4 that avocado could either be in position 1 or 2 if metal were in the adjacent position. However, because the skateboard user (in position 1, as deduced) is also linked with being on the left of the martial-arts fan and considering the soul music fan's placement, we can infer that the person eating avocado must be associated with either the hiking or the collecting hobby indirectly through these relationships.


## Step 8: Finalize Placements
Given all previous steps:
- Position 1 has the skateboard user, the soul music fan, and is associated with the hiking hobby.
- Position 2 has the martial-arts movie fan, the lizard owner, and by deduction from previous clues, must be associated with collecting (as it's the only remaining hobby), metal (since soul is in position 1 and they need to be adjacent), and thus, avocado cannot be in position 1 because metal needs to be next to avocado (Clue 4) and soul is already there.
- The tram user, by elimination, must be in position 1 since the skateboard user is already placed.
- Strawberry, as the remaining food, must go with the lizard owner (who watches martial-arts movies).
- Goat, being the only pet left, goes with the hiking enthusiast.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1      |      2       |
| Food          | strawberry|   avocado    |
| Hobby         | collecting|   hiking     |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| adventure    |
| Music-Genre   | metal      | soul         |
| Pet           | lizard     | goat         |
| Transport     | tram       | skateboard   |

Lv4-6x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the hobby positions based on clue 1.
Given that the person whose hobby is skydiving is in an even position, and since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the skydiving enthusiast must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


## Step 2: Apply clue 2 to determine the sport and pet relationship.
The person who prefers ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the mouse. This means the ice-hockey fan cannot be in position 2 (since there would be no one to their right), so they must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Use clue 3 to establish the transport and nationality relationship.
The person driving the airplane is on the left of the Thai. Since the airplane driver must be on the left, they are in position 1.


## Step 4: Apply clue 4 to find the music genre and pet relationship.
The fan of techno is the owner of the mouse. This means that whoever owns a mouse prefers techno music.


## Step 5: Combine all clues to fill out the table.
- From step 1, skydiving is in position 2.
- From step 2, ice-hockey is in position 1, and since the mouse owner is to the right of the ice-hockey fan (clue 2), the mouse must be in position 2.
- From step 3, the airplane is in position 1, implying the bus is in position 2 because each means of transport is unique to a person.
- From step 4, techno music corresponds with the mouse owner, who we've determined is in position 2.


## Step 6: Fill in the remaining gaps based on process of elimination and given clues.
- Since the Thai must be to the right of the airplane user (clue 3), and knowing the airplane user is in position 1, the French nationality must be associated with position 1, leaving Thai for position 2.
- Given that chess hasn't been assigned yet, it must go to position 1 because skydiving is already assigned to position 2.
- The cat, being the only pet left, goes to position 1, as the mouse is in position 2.
- Surfing, the remaining sport, must be in position 2 since ice-hockey is in position 1.
- Pop music, the last genre, goes to position 1 because techno is in position 2.
