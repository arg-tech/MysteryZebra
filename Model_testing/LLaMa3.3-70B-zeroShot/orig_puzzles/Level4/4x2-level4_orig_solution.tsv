Lv4-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues one by one and fill in the information as we get it.


## Step 1: Determine the beverage for the spy movie fan
From clue 3, we know the person watching spy movies drinks coffee.

## Step 2: Figure out the position of the Fanta drinker
Clue 2 tells us that the person drinking Fanta is in an even position, which means this person can only be in position 2 since it's the only even position available.

## Step 3: Determine the transport for each position based on clue 4
Clue 4 states that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the jet-ski must be associated with position 1, and the taxi with position 2.

## Step 4: Combine information from previous steps to start filling in the table
- Position 1 (odd) can't be Fanta due to clue 2, so it must be coffee.
- Since the spy movie fan drinks coffee (clue 3), this person must also be in position 1 because that's where coffee is.

## Step 5: Use clue 1 to determine the sport for each position
Clue 1 says the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person whose sport is surfing. Given our current setup, if taxi (position 2) is next to surfing, and considering taxi is on the right of jet-ski (from clue 4), surfing must be in position 1 because taxi can't be on the left of anyone else due to its fixed position as determined by the transport clues.

## Step 6: Finalize sports based on previous deductions
Given that surfing has to be next to taxi and we've established taxi is in position 2, surfing should actually be associated with position 1 (to fulfill clue 1's requirement of being next to taxi, considering our setup). This means cycling must go with the person using the taxi.

## Step 7: Finalize movie-genres
Since spy movies are associated with coffee (clue 3) and thus position 1, crime movies must be in position 2 with Fanta.

## Step 8: Compile all information into a table


|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta   |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy    | Crime   |
| Sport         | Surfing| Cycling |
| Transport     | Jet-ski| Taxi    |



The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta   |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy    | Crime   |
| Sport         | Surfing| Cycling |
| Transport     | Jet-ski| Taxi    |

Lv4-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The owner of the rat is in an odd position.
2. The person watching action movies is the person driving the tram.
3. The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.

Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and from clue 1, we know the rat owner must be in position 1 because it's the only odd position available.

From clue 2, we understand that action movies are associated with the tram. 

Clue 3 tells us cabbage is to the right of documentary movies, meaning documentary movies must be in position 1 (since cabbage has to be on its right, placing cabbage in position 2).

Let's start filling in the table based on these deductions:

- Position 1 must have documentary movies because it's the only way cabbage can be to its right.
- The tram is associated with action movies (clue 2), and since documentary movies are in position 1, action movies (and thus the tram) must be in position 2.

Now, let's deal with the food:
- Cabbage is on the right of documentary movies, so it must be in position 2.
- Avocado, by elimination, must then be associated with documentary movies in position 1.

For pets:
- The rat owner is in an odd position (position 1), as per clue 1.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Documentary movies, avocado, rat
- Position 2: Action movies, cabbage, tram

The only thing left to figure out is the pet for position 2. Since the rat is in position 1, and there are only two pets (dog and rat), the dog must be in position 2.

Thus, our completed table looks like this:

#############
|               |      1      |    2    |
| Food          | avocado    | cabbage |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary| action  |
| Pet           | rat        | dog     |
| Transport     | motorbike  | tram    |
#############

Note: The motorbike had to be placed with the documentary/avocado/rat combination by process of elimination since the tram was already associated with action movies."
Lv4-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the entrepreneur.
2. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur.
3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.

From clue 3, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering an ""even position"" refers to position 2 in this context (as position 1 is odd, and position 2 is even when counting starts from 1), the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.

Given clue 2, the owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur. This means the entrepreneur cannot be in position 2 because there's no one to the right of position 2. Thus, the entrepreneur must be in position 1, and the lizard's owner (who drinks soy-milk, as hot-chocolate is already assigned to position 2) must be in position 2.

Now, considering clue 1 and knowing the entrepreneur is in position 1, the helicopter driver must be in position 2 since it has to be on the left or right of the entrepreneur, and there's no one to the left of position 1. This means the transport method for position 1 must be a bike.

The job for position 2 is already determined as not being the entrepreneur (since that's in position 1), so position 2's job is that of an accountant or another job, but since we only have two jobs and one (entrepreneur) is taken by position 1, the remaining job (accountant) goes to position 2. However, this step was about placing jobs based on previous deductions, but let's correct the process:

- The entrepreneur is in position 1.
- The lizard owner is in position 2, which means they drink soy-milk because hot-chocolate is assigned to an even position (which we've determined to be position 2). However, this conflicts with our interpretation. Let's correct this based on clue 3: since the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in an even position, and there are only two positions, it indeed confirms that hot-chocolate is for position 2.

Correcting our approach:
- Entrepreneur is in position 1 (because if they were in position 2, the lizard's owner would have no one to their right).
- Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position (position 2), and considering clue 2 that the lizard's owner is on the right of the entrepreneur, it aligns with our placement.
- The helicopter driver being next to the entrepreneur means the transport for position 1 must be the bike (since the helicopter can't be driven by someone not next to the entrepreneur).

Thus, we have:
- Position 1: Entrepreneur, drinks soy-milk (since hot-chocolate is in an even position), has a frog as a pet (because the lizard's owner is in position 2 and must be on the right of the entrepreneur), uses a bike for transport.
- Position 2: Accountant (as it's the remaining job), drinks hot-chocolate, owns a lizard, uses a helicopter.

Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|             |      1       |       2       |
| Beverage    | soy-milk    | hot-chocolate|
| Job         | entrepreneur| accountant   |

Lv4-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   - This means the left column has card-games and the right column has cooking.

2. The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
   - Since the person eating zucchini must be on the left, this means zucchini is associated with column 1, and by extension, almond-milk is in column 2 because it's to the right of zucchini.

3. The fan of pop is in an even position.
   - Given that positions are numbered starting from 1 (odd), the second position (2) is even. This means pop music must be associated with column 2.


Given these clues, let's fill out what we can:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |            | almond-milk |
| Food          | zucchini   |             |
| Hobby         | card-games | cooking     |
| Music-Genre   |            | pop         |


From the information provided and the constraints:


- The beverage in column 1 must be sprite because almond-milk is already assigned to column 2.
- The food in column 2 must be strawberry since zucchini is in column 1.
- Classical music must be in column 1 because pop is in column 2.


So, the completed table based on the given clues and deductions is:


#############
|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | sprite     | almond-milk |
| Food          | zucchini   | strawberry  |

Lv4-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means that hot-chocolate must be in position 1 since disaster movies have to be in a position to the right of hot-chocolate, which would be position 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The owner of the frog is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and both are odd or even depending on how you count (but typically, in such puzzles, ""odd"" refers to the first position when counting starts from 1), this means the frog can be in either position but given other constraints might have a more specific placement.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The engineer is in an odd position. This implies that the engineer must be in position 1 because, similar to clue 2, we are dealing with only two positions, and if ""odd"" typically means first when counting from 1, then position 1 is where the engineer should be.


## Step 4: Combining Clues
Given clue 3, the engineer is in position 1. From clue 1, hot-chocolate must also be in position 1 because disaster movies (which are to the right of hot-chocolate) would then logically fit into position 2. Since the engineer and hot-chocolate are both in position 1 according to our deductions so far, this suggests that one person has multiple attributes (engineer who drinks hot-chocolate). The frog's owner being in an odd position (clue 2) could imply the frog is also with the engineer, given the engineer is already deduced to be in position 1.


## Step 5: Finalizing Attributes
- Position 1: Engineer, hot-chocolate, and since it's an odd position, potentially the frog.
- Position 2 (by elimination for each category): Dancer (job), milk (beverage), disaster (movie-genre), and thus chinchilla (pet) because the other pet (frog) is deduced to be with the engineer in position 1.


## Step 6: Constructing the Solution Table
Given the above analysis, we construct our solution table:

#############
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate |    milk    |
| Job           |   engineer    |   dancer   |
| Movie-Genre   |    mystery    |  disaster  |
| Pet           |     frog      | chinchilla |

The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{vmatrix} & 1 & 2 \\ Beverage & hot-chocolate & milk \\ Job & engineer & dancer \\ Movie-Genre & mystery & disaster \\ Pet & frog & chinchilla \end{vmatrix}}$"
Lv4-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person who's sport is soccer is in an even position.
   - Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 2 is the only even position, the person who prefers soccer must be in position 2.


2. The Egyptian is on the far left or far right.
   - Given the table has positions 1 and 2, the Egyptian can either be in position 1 (far left) or position 2 (far right).


3. The electrician is the Dutch.
   - This clue tells us about the nationality of the electrician but doesn't specify the position.


4. The owner of the cat is on the left of the Egyptian.
   - If the Egyptian were in position 2, there would be no one to the left of them, making it impossible for someone to own a cat and be to their left. Therefore, the Egyptian must be in position 2 (as the far right), and the owner of the cat must be in position 1.


From clue 3, we know the electrician is Dutch. Since there are only two jobs, the other job must be the coach, which would then belong to the Egyptian if the electrician is in position 1, or vice versa.


Given that soccer is in an even position (position 2), and assuming the Egyptian could potentially like soccer (since we don't have information directly linking a sport to the Egyptian yet), let's try to piece together the rest:


- The cat owner is on the left of the Egyptian (clue 4), so the cat must be in position 1.
- If the electrician (who is Dutch, clue 3) were in position 2, it would contradict clue 1 because soccer needs to be in an even position, and we can't have two different people in the same position. Thus, the Dutch electrician must be in position 1, owning the cat.
- The Egyptian then must like climbing (since soccer is taken by someone who must be in position 2), but from clue 1, we know soccer is in an even position, which means it has to be paired with either the coach or the electrician's counterpart in terms of job. Since the electrician is Dutch and likes the cat, and is in position 1 (odd), the Egyptian in position 2 must have a different job (coach) and sport (but we determined soccer must be here due to clue 1).
- This means our setup might initially seem incorrect based on direct assignments without considering all clues together. Let's correct this by properly applying all clues:
  - The Dutch electrician is in position 1 with the cat.
  - The Egyptian, being on the far right (position 2), cannot own the cat but must be involved with soccer as per clue 1 indicating soccer's position.


Correcting our thought process and directly filling in based on the most restrictive clues first:


- Position 1: Dutch (electrician), Cat
- Position 2: Egyptian, Soccer


Now, let's assign jobs and sports correctly based on all clues:


- Since the electrician is Dutch (clue 3) and must be with the cat (from our deductions), the electrician is in position 1.
- The job left for the Egyptian is coach because the electrician job is taken by the Dutch person.


The sport for position 1 (Dutch, electrician, cat owner) must then be climbing since soccer is assigned to position 2 (Egyptian).


Given this analysis, the final table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |    2     |
| Job           | Electrician| Coach    |
| Nationality   | Dutch      | Egyptian|
| Pet           | Cat        | Horse    |

Lv4-4x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step:


1. The person eating avocado is in an odd position.
   - This means the person eating avocado can only be in position 1 because there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is the only odd one.


2. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
   - Since the person watching crime movies must be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, this means the crime movie watcher can only be in position 1 if iced-tea is in position 2.


3. The dancer is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.
   - Given that avocado is in an odd position (position 1), and there's no one to the left of position 1, the dancer must be to the right of the avocado eater, which places the dancer in position 2.


Now, let's assemble the information:


- Avocado is in position 1.
- The person watching crime movies is also in position 1 (because they have to be on the left of iced-tea).
- Since the dancer must be next to the avocado eater and can only be in position 2, this means the dancer is drinking iced-tea (as per clue 2, which places iced-tea in position 2).


For beverages:
- Position 1 has lemonade because iced-tea is already determined to be with the dancer in position 2.


For food:
- Avocado is in position 1.
- Grapefruit must then be in position 2.


For jobs:
- Dancer is in position 2 (as deduced).
- Electrician, by elimination, is in position 1.


For movie-genres:
- Crime movies are watched by the person in position 1 (because they're to the left of iced-tea).
- Family movies must then be preferred by the person in position 2.


So, the table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade   | iced-tea   |

Lv4-4x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The fan of trance is in an odd position.
2. The coach is on the left or right of the fan of classical.
3. The person drinking Fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), the odd position for the trance fan must be position 1, as position 2 is even.

So, we start with:
- Position 1: Trance

Now, let's apply rule 2. Since the coach must be on the left or right of the classical music fan, and given that position 1 is already taken by the trance fan, the classical fan cannot be in position 1 (because then the coach would have to be either in a non-existent position 0 or in position 2, but we don't know yet if position 2 is for the coach or not). Therefore, the classical music fan must be in position 2.

Now, applying rule 3:
- The person drinking Fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane.
- Since the trance fan is in position 1 and must drink either Fanta or Sprite (and we don't know which yet), and considering that Fanta's drinker must be to the left of the airplane user, if the airplane were in position 2, then Fanta would have to be in position 1. But this still leaves us with figuring out who drinks what and uses what transport.

Let's piece together what we know:
- Position 1: Trance (and thus must drink one of the beverages)
- Position 2: Classical

Given rule 3, if Fanta is on the left of the airplane, and considering our current setup:
- If the airplane were in position 2, then Fanta would be in position 1. This fits because the trance fan could also be the Fanta drinker.

Now, let's assign jobs based on rule 2 (the coach is on the left or right of the classical fan). Since classical is in position 2:
- The coach cannot be in a position to the right of classical (because there isn't one), so the coach must be in position 1. This means the architect is in position 2, with classical music.

For transport, since Fanta's drinker is on the left of the airplane user, and if we consider Fanta to be in position 1 (with trance and now also with the coach), then:
- Position 1: Coach, Trance, Fanta
- Position 2 must have the Architect, Classical music, and since the airplane user cannot be in position 1 (because Fanta is on the left of the airplane), the airplane user must be in position 2. This leaves the van for position 1.

So, the final table looks like this:

#############
|               |   1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Fanta  | Sprite    |
| Job           | Coach  | Architect |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | Classical |
| Transport     | Van    | Airplane  |
#############

This setup satisfies all the given conditions:
- The trance fan is in an odd position (1).
- The coach is on the left of the classical music fan.
- The person drinking Fanta is on the left of the person driving the airplane."
Lv4-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


Given:
1. The person whose hobby is skydiving owns a bird.
2. The person drinking 7up is in an odd position (which means they are in position 1).
3. The person driving the roller is to the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.

Let's fill out the table based on these clues:


## Step 1: Apply clue 2
Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position, and there's only one odd position (position 1), we place 7up in the beverage column of row 1.


|             |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage    |   7up     |         |
| Hobby       |           |         |
| Pet         |           |         |
| Transport   |           |         |

## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The person whose hobby is skydiving owns a bird. This does not directly tell us the position, but since we know from clue 3 that the roller driver is to the right of the skydiver, and given the constraint of clue 2, the skydiver cannot be in position 2 (because then the roller would have to be to their right, which is not possible since there are only two positions). Thus, the skydiver must be in position 1.


|             |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage    |   7up     |         |
| Hobby       | Skydiving |         |
| Pet         |   Bird    |         |
| Transport   |           |         |

## Step 3: Apply clue 3
The person driving the roller is to the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving. Since the skydiver is in position 1, the roller driver must be in position 2.


|             |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage    |   7up     |         |
| Hobby       | Skydiving |         |
| Pet         |   Bird    |         |
| Transport   |           | Roller  |

## Step 4: Fill in the remaining options
Given that we have used 7up, skydiving, bird, and roller, the remaining options for each category must go into position 2. This means milk for beverage, drawing for hobby, lizard for pet, and van for transport.


|             |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage    |   7up     |  Milk   |
| Hobby       | Skydiving | Drawing |
| Pet         |   Bird    | Lizard  |
| Transport   |    Van    | Roller  |

Lv4-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we get it.


Given:
- 2 favourite beverages: 7up, lemonade
- 2 types of food: banana, papaya
- 2 jobs: architect, writer
- 2 movie-genres: action, spy


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The architect is in an even position. Since the positions are numbered 1 and 2, and 2 is the only even number among them, the architect must be in position 2.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The architect is on the right of the person eating banana. This means the person eating banana must be in position 1 because the architect is in position 2.


## Step 3: Use Clue 2
The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since there are only two positions and the architect (who could potentially watch any movie genre) is already determined to be in position 2, this clue implies that the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1, as they have to be to the left of someone watching action movies.


## Step 4: Fill in the Remaining Information
- Position 1 has banana and lemonade.
- The architect (in position 2) cannot watch action movies if the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies, because then the architect would have to be watching action movies. Therefore, the architect must watch spy movies.


## Step 5: Determine the Remaining Preferences
- Since the architect watches spy movies and is in position 2, the person in position 1 (who eats banana and drinks lemonade) must watch action movies.
- The job for position 1, therefore, must be the writer because the architect is already assigned to position 2.


## Step 6: Finalize Food Preferences
- We've established that the person in position 1 eats banana.
- Therefore, by elimination, the architect (position 2) eats papaya.


The final answer is:
