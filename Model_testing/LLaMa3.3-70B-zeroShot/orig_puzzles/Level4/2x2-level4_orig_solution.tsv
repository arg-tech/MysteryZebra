Lv4-2x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues given:


1. The mechanic is in an even position.
2. The teacher is the person whose hobby is collecting.


Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and based on clue 1, the mechanic must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


From clue 2, we know the teacher collects things, so since the teacher cannot be the mechanic (as per clue 1 which implies a distinct person for each job due to the even position requirement), the teacher must be in position 1, and their hobby is collecting.


The remaining hobby (card-games) must then belong to the mechanic, who we've determined is in position 2.


So, the final arrangement looks like this:


#############
|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Collecting | Card-games |
| Job     | Teacher    | Mechanic   |

Lv4-2x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The person whose sport is sailing is in an odd position.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking coffee.

Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and an odd position means position 1, we can deduce the following:

- Sailing must be in position 1 because it's the only odd position available.
- Since soy-milk is to the left of coffee, soy-milk must also be in position 1, and coffee in position 2.

Now, let's fill out the table based on these deductions:


|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | soy-milk |    coffee     |
| Sport      | sailing  | weightlifting |

Thus, the final solution table is:


#############
|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   | soy-milk |    coffee     |

Lv4-2x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:

1. The Canadian is in an odd position.
   - Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is the only odd position, the Canadian must be in position 1.

2. The fan of house is on the left of the fan of ambient.
   - This means the fan of house must be in position 1, and the fan of ambient in position 2.

Given these clues:

- Position 1 must be a Canadian who likes house music because it's the only way to satisfy both conditions (being Canadian and liking house music).
- Position 2, therefore, must be the Turkish person who likes ambient music, as there are no other options left.

So, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | House    | Ambient |

Lv4-2x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the positions based on the beverages.
Given that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking 7up, we can assign the beverage positions as follows:
- Position 1 (left): 7up
- Position 2 (right): lemonade

## Step 2: Apply the condition regarding the food.
The person eating mango is in an even position. Since there are only two positions and position 2 is an even position, mango must be associated with position 2.


## Step 3: Deduce the remaining associations by elimination.
- Beverage for position 1: 7up
- Beverage for position 2: lemonade
- Food for position 2 (even position): mango
The only food left to associate is broccoli, which by default must be associated with position 1.


## Step 4: Construct the final solution table.
Given the associations determined:
- Position 1: 7up and broccoli
- Position 2: lemonade and mango

The final answer is: 
#############
|            |    1     |    2     |

Lv4-2x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:


1. The Dutch person is in an even position.
2. The social worker is to the right of the fisherman.


Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering clue 1, the Dutch person must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


Now, let's fill in what we know based on the clues:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Job           |           |               |
| Nationality   |           |               |


From clue 2, since the social worker is to the right of the fisherman, and considering there are only two positions, the fisherman must be in position 1, and the social worker in position 2.


So, we have:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Job           | Fisherman | Social-worker |
| Nationality   |           |               |


Now, to fill in the nationalities: We know from clue 1 that the Dutch person is in position 2. Therefore, the Polish person must be in position 1.


So, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |

Lv4-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


1. The person driving the motorbike is in an even position.
2. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.


From clue 1, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the motorbike driver must be in an even position, the motorbike driver must be in position 2.


|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       |       |           |
| Transport   |       | Motorbike |


From clue 2, since the ship driver is to the left of the climber, and considering the motorbike is already placed in position 2, the ship must be in position 1. This also means climbing cannot be in position 1 because the ship needs to be to the left of climbing, so climbing must be in position 2, but since motorbike is already there, this creates a conflict with the initial interpretation.


Re-evaluating clue 2 with the correct understanding that positions are fixed as per the table (left and right), and knowing the motorbike's position from clue 1:


- The ship cannot be in position 2 because it needs to be on the left of climbing, so it must indeed be in position 1.
- Climbing then has to be in position 2 to satisfy clue 2.


This leaves rugby for position 1 since climbing is in position 2.


So, the corrected table based on transport first:


|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       | Rugby | Climbing  |
| Transport   | Ship  | Motorbike |


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:


#############
|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       | Rugby | Climbing  |

Lv4-2x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify the positions and hobbies/jobs
We have two people with different hobbies (gardening, sudoku) and different jobs (firefighter, journalist). The positions are labeled as 1 and 2.


## Step 2: Apply the first clue
The journalist is in an even position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 2 is the only even position, the journalist must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Apply the second clue
The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the journalist. Given that the journalist is in position 2, the person with the gardening hobby must be in position 1.


## Step 4: Determine the remaining hobby and job
Since the person in position 1 has the gardening hobby, and there are only two hobbies (gardening and sudoku), the person in position 2 must have the sudoku hobby. For jobs, we've already determined the journalist is in position 2. Thus, the firefighter must be in position 1.


## Step 5: Construct the final table
Based on the analysis:
- Position 1: Gardening as a hobby and Firefighter as a job.
- Position 2: Sudoku as a hobby and Journalist as a job.

The final answer is:

## Step 1: Identify Nationalities and Their Positions
Given that there are two nationalities (Australian and Pakistani) and the Australian is to the left of the Pakistani, we can start filling in the ""Nationality"" row of our table. The first column must be Australian, and the second column must be Pakistani.


## Step 2: Apply the Second Clue to Pets
We know there are two pets (dog and frog) and from clue 1, ""the owner of the frog is in an odd position."" Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is odd, the frog must be in position 1. This means the dog must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Combine Nationality and Pet Information
Now we combine the information from steps 1 and 2 to fill out our table completely.


The final answer is:

Lv4-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The Canadian is in an even position.
2. The electrician is to the right of the doctor.


Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering the rules:


- Since the Canadian must be in an even position, and the only even position available is position 2, the Canadian must be in position 2.
- The electrician being to the right of the doctor means the doctor cannot be in position 2. Thus, the doctor must be in position 1, and the electrician in position 2.


Now, considering nationalities:


- We've established the Canadian is in position 2. Given that there are only two nationalities (Canadian and German), the person in position 1 must be German.
- Since the electrician is in position 2 and so is the Canadian, it means the electrician is Canadian.
- The doctor, being in position 1, must then be German.


So, the final solution table looks like this:


#############
|               |   1    |      2      |
| Job           | Doctor | Electrician|

Lv4-2x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the given clues:

1. The fan of folk music is the person eating corn.
2. The fan of country music is in an even position.

Given that there are two positions (1 and 2), and considering clue 2, the fan of country music must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these clues:

- Since the folk fan eats corn (clue 1), and we know one person is eating blueberry and the other corn, we can start by placing corn with folk. But first, we need to determine who is in which position based on their music preference.
- The country fan must be in position 2 (from clue 2).
- Therefore, the folk fan, who eats corn, must be in position 1 because that's the only place left.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Folk and Corn
- Position 2: Country and Blueberry (since blueberry is the only food left)

Here's the solution table:


#############
