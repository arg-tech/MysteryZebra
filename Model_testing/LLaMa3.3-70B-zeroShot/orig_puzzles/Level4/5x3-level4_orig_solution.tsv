Lv4-5x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


From clue 2 and 4, we know the person driving the bus is on the far left, and the Chinese person is also on the far left. Therefore, the Chinese person drives the bus.


Clue 5 tells us the librarian drives the taxi. Clue 1 indicates the person driving the taxi is to the left of the person whose hobby is traveling. Since the taxi driver cannot be on the far left (because the bus driver is), and there are only three positions, the taxi driver must be in position 2, and the traveler must be in position 3.


Clue 6 states the rock-climber is in an even position, which means the rock-climber can only be in position 2. However, clue 1 and the deduction about the taxi driver's position conflict with this unless we reconsider the positions based on further clues.


Given clue 7 (the scientist is to the right of the Mexican) and clue 8 (the person watching scientific movies is the scientist), we can start piecing together more information.


Clue 3 suggests the librarian is next to the person who watches documentary movies. Since the librarian drives the taxi and must be in position 2 (to be to the left of the traveler, as per clue 1), the documentary watcher cannot be in position 1 (because then the librarian would not be next to them). This means the documentary watcher is likely in position 3.


Considering all clues:
- The Chinese person drives the bus and is on the far left (position 1).
- The librarian drives the taxi, so they must be in position 2 to be next to someone watching documentaries or another hobby.
- Given clue 6 and re-evaluating for consistency with other clues: if the rock-climber is in an even position, it means they could only be in position 2. However, this conflicts with our earlier deduction that places the taxi driver (librarian) in position 2 based on clue 1 and the need for them to be next to the traveler.


Let's place the clues more precisely:
- Position 1: Chinese, drives bus.
- The scientist watches scientific movies and is to the right of the Mexican (clue 7), meaning if the Mexican were in position 1 or 2, the scientist would have to be in a position that allows this. But given the constraints about hobbies and jobs, we need to ensure all fit.


Given clue 8 and the fact that the scientist must watch scientific movies:
- If the scientist is in position 3 (to satisfy being to the right of the Mexican if the Mexican were in position 2 or 1), they could fulfill watching scientific movies as per clue 8.


Reconciling positions with clues:
1. The Chinese person drives the bus and is on the far left.
2. Given that the taxi driver (librarian) must be to the left of the traveler, and considering other constraints, let's correctly place hobbies, jobs, movie genres, nationalities, and transport means.


Based on clue 6, if the rock-climber is in an even position, they could only fit into position 2 since we've established a need for specific placements based on other clues.


Let's solve it step by step with all considerations:


1. Chinese, bus (Position 1)
2. Since the librarian drives the taxi and must be next to someone who watches documentaries (clue 3), and considering the rock-climber's placement:
- If the Mexican is in position 2 or 3, the scientist must be to their right.
- The traveler can only be in position 3 if the taxi driver (librarian) is in position 2.


Finalizing based on all clues:

Lv4-5x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue carefully and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 1, we know the American is on the far right, so the nationality for column 3 is American.


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |

| Nationality   |             |          | American    |


From clue 4, the Nigerian is in an even position, which means column 2 since it's the only even position left.


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |

| Nationality   |             | Nigerian | American    |


From clue 2, the person whose hobby is fishing watches sports movies.


From clue 8, the person watching sports movies is between the person eating orange and the mechanic. Since the person eating orange has gardening as a hobby (clue 5), we can start building some connections:


- The person with the hobby of fishing watches sports movies.
- This person must be in column 1 or 2 because they need to be between the person eating orange (gardening) and the mechanic, but we don't know their exact position yet.


From clue 3, the person eating lemon is on the right of the person whose hobby is fishing. If the fisher were in column 2, then the lemon eater would have to be in column 3, which means the American (column 3) eats lemons.


From clue 5, we know the person whose hobby is gardening eats orange.


Considering clue 7, the pilot is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Clue 6 tells us the person watching comedy movies has woodworking as a hobby.


Given these clues, let's start piecing together more information:


- The Nigerian (column 2) cannot be the fisher because if they were, and given that the lemon eater is to their right (thus in column 3), it would conflict with other conditions since we'd have limited space to place everyone according to their hobbies and preferences.


Since the Nigerian is in column 2 and considering clue 8 (the person watching sports movies is between the person eating orange and the mechanic), let's assume:


- Column 1 could be the fisher because they need to watch sports movies, and this allows for flexibility with the other clues.
- If the fisher is in column 1, then according to clue 3, the lemon eater must be in column 2. However, we've established the Nigerian is in column 2, so the Nigerian eats lemons.


Now, placing the gardener (orange eater) and considering the remaining clues:


- The gardener cannot be in column 3 because that's the American, and if the gardener were also in column 1 or 2, it would conflict with our current setup regarding the fisher and the sports movie watcher.
- However, we need to fit the mechanic, pilot, and the person watching comedy movies (woodworker) into our scheme.


Let's try placing the woodworking hobbyist (comedy movie watcher) in column 3 since this gives us flexibility for the pilot's placement according to clue 7:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          |             |          |             |
| Hobby         |             |          |             |
| Job           |             |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |             |
| Nationality   |             | Nigerian | American    |


Given the clues and trying to fit them together without direct contradictions, we realize there are a few ways to interpret some of the clues. However, the critical path involves:


1. Identifying fixed positions based on nationality (American in column 3, Nigerian in column 2).
2. Using hobby and movie preferences to narrow down possible job assignments.
3. The fisher watches sports movies and must be placed so that the lemon eater is to their right.


Let's assign the fisher to column 1 for simplicity, which means they watch sports movies:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          |             | Lemon    |             |
| Hobby         | Fishing    |          |             |
| Job           |             |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     |          |             |
| Nationality   |             | Nigerian | American    |


The person eating orange (gardener) must be in a position that allows for the fisher to watch sports movies between them and the mechanic. Given our setup, if we place the gardener in column 1, it conflicts with the fisher's placement for watching sports movies. Thus, considering clue 8 and our current setup:


- The gardener (orange eater) could fit into column 3 or must be in a configuration that respects all given clues.


However, since we have the American in column 3, and assuming the American is also the woodworker (to satisfy clue 6 about comedy movies), we can start to fill in more details:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          |             | Lemon    | Orange     |
| Hobby         | Fishing    | Gardening| Woodworking|
| Job           |             |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports     |          | Comedy     |
| Nationality   |             | Nigerian | American    |


Now, considering the jobs and remaining clues:


- The pilot must be on the left or right of the woodworker (clue 7), which means the pilot could either be in column 1 or column 2. However, given that we have a fixed setup for hobbies and nationalities now, the pilot's placement will dictate where the mechanic can go.


Given clue 8 (the person watching sports movies is between the orange eater and the mechanic), and since the fisher watches sports movies, we must adjust our understanding to fit all clues without contradiction:


- The fisher cannot be directly next to the mechanic if they are in column 1 because there needs to be a configuration that allows for the orange eater (gardener) to also fit into this arrangement.


Re-evaluating and considering all clues again with careful attention to possible misinterpretations and ensuring each clue fits without contradiction:


The person eating potato must be placed, but given our current setup and clues, we have to ensure each hobby, job, movie preference, food, and nationality aligns correctly without breaking any rules.


Given the constraints and re-evaluating for clarity and correctness in placement according to all provided clues:


We know:
- The American is on the far right (column 3).
- The Nigerian is in column 2.
- The fisher watches sports movies.
- The lemon eater is to the right of the fisher.
- The gardener eats orange.
- The woodworker watches comedy movies.


Let's place the remaining items correctly, ensuring all clues are respected:


The correct placement, considering all clues and avoiding direct contradictions, requires us to fit each piece of information carefully. However, upon re-evaluation for a precise step-by-step solution that perfectly aligns with each clue without assuming incorrect placements:


Given the complexity and the need to adhere strictly to the format and instructions provided, let's clarify the correct table based on all given clues and logical deductions:

Lv4-5x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The Japanese is on the far right.
2. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person eating kiwi.
3. The person drinking Fanta is on the far left.
4. The person eating grapes is the person driving the bike.
5. The Australian is on the left or right of the Japanese.
6. The Japanese is in an odd position, which confirms clue 1 since the far right is position 3, an odd number when counting positions as 1, 2, 3 from left to right.
7. The person whose hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.
8. The person whose hobby is baking is in an odd position.
9. The person driving the boat is between the person whose hobby is magic-tricks and the person drinking Fanta.


From clue 3, we know the far left column (1) drinks Fanta.

From clue 6 and 1, we confirm the Japanese person is on the far right, in position 3.

Given clue 4 and 2, since the bike rider eats grapes and is to the right of the kiwi eater, and considering clue 9 which places the boat between magic-tricks and Fanta (and thus not directly next to Fanta on the left), we can start building some connections.


Let's denote each person by their beverage, food, hobby, nationality, and transport in that order. Since there are multiple clues about positions relative to others, let's use them to fill out the table step by step:


- Clue 3 places Fanta on the far left (1).
- Clue 4 and clue 2 together suggest a sequence where kiwi is followed by grapes (bike), but we don't know their exact positions yet except that grapes (bike) can't be on the far left because of clue 3.
- Clue 9 places boat between magic-tricks and Fanta, suggesting a possible arrangement for these elements.


Given the Japanese is in position 3 (clue 1), let's fill in what we know:


|               |    1    |      2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   |             |              |
| Food          |         |             |              |
| Hobby         |         |             |              |
| Nationality   |         |             | Japanese     |
| Transport     |         |             |              |


Clue 8 says baking is in an odd position, which could be either 1 or 3. However, since the person drinking almond-milk must be next to the baker (clue 7), and considering other constraints, we have limited configurations.


Given clue 5, Australian must be either in position 1 or 2 because they are on the left or right of Japanese.


Considering all these clues together:


- The Fanta drinker is on the far left (clue 3).
- Given clue 9, and that boat must be between magic-tricks and Fanta, one possible arrangement could have magic-tricks in position 2, with boat also in position 2, which doesn't fit because then there's no space for all other activities. So, magic-tricks likely precedes Fanta or follows it directly but given the direct placement of boat between them, we infer a sequence.


Given that clues are complex and interrelated:


- Clue 7 places baking next to almond-milk.
- Since Japanese is in position 3 (and an odd position as per clue 6), and considering Australian's placement relative to Japanese (clue 5), if Australian were on the left of Japanese, they'd be in position 2.


Let's fill out what we know with some educated guesses based on constraints:


If Australian is next to Japanese and given that clues about food, hobbies, and transport are interlinked, let's consider a possible arrangement where all clues fit:


Given that boat must be between magic-tricks and Fanta (clue 9), and considering other placements, one feasible arrangement starts to emerge.


However, directly solving this with the information provided requires making some connections based on the given constraints without violating any rules. Let's attempt to finalize based on the direct clues:


- The person drinking Fanta is on the far left.
- Japanese is on the far right.
- Bike rider eats grapes and is to the right of kiwi eater.


Given these direct placements and constraints, one possible arrangement considering all interlinked clues could be as follows (though it requires careful consideration of each clue's impact on overall placement):


#############
|               |    1    |      2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Iced-Tea    | Almond-Milk  |
| Food          | Kiwi    | Plum        | Grapes       |
| Hobby         | Magic   | Baking      | Camping      |
| Nationality   | British | Australian  | Japanese     |
| Transport     | Boat    | Bike        | Ship         |

This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given conditions. Note that solving these puzzles often requires trial and error with the clues provided, ensuring each condition is met without contradiction. The final solution table provided above represents one possible configuration based on the constraints outlined in the puzzle."
Lv4-5x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the entrepreneur and the implications for other jobs.
From clue 3, we know the entrepreneur is on the far right. This means column 3 is occupied by the entrepreneur.

## Step 2: Figure out the position of the person watching fantasy movies and its implications.
Clue 1 states that the person driving the quad-bike watches fantasy movies. Clue 7 indicates the person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position, which means they can only be in column 1 or 3.

## Step 3: Analyze the possible positions based on previous steps and other clues.
Given clue 2 (the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies) and considering the entrepreneur's fixed position, if the quad-bike/fantasy movie person were in column 3, there would be no space to the left for the pineapple eater. Thus, the quad-bike/fantasy movie person must be in column 1.

## Step 4: Determine the eating habits based on positions.
With the fantasy movie fan in column 1 and knowing from clue 2 that the pineapple eater is to their left (which is not possible since there's no space to the left of column 1), we infer the pineapple eater must actually be in column 2, as there seems to have been a misunderstanding in interpreting ""on the left"" directly without considering the actual layout and available spaces. This means our initial interpretation needs adjustment: given the quad-bike/fantasy movies person is indeed in an odd position (column 1), the pineapple eater being on their left doesn't fit the standard left-right model due to spatial constraints, suggesting a need for reevaluation of clue placements.

## Step 5: Re-evaluate and correct the interpretation based on available information.
Considering the misinterpretation in step 4, let's correctly apply clue 2 with the understanding that ""on the left"" implies adjacent positioning within the given layout. If the fantasy movie watcher is in column 1 (as per clue 7), the pineapple eater should indeed be next to them but since they are at the start, this implies a misunderstanding in applying spatial relationships directly without accounting for all clues.

## Step 6: Apply other clues to narrow down possibilities.
From clue 4, the police-officer is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Clue 8 indicates volleyball is between quad-bike and artichoke, suggesting specific arrangements that need to be considered with all other clues for a coherent solution.

## Step 7: Synthesize information from all clues.
Given the complexity and the direct implications of each clue on possible arrangements, it's clear we must consider all statements together. The person eating pineapple is next to the fantasy movie watcher (clue 2), but given our quad-bike/fantasy fan in column 1, this suggests a close relationship between these preferences and jobs.

## Step 8: Finalize positions based on integrated clue analysis.
The synthesis of clues indicates specific patterns:
- The entrepreneur (column 3) limits job placements.
- Fantasy movies with the quad-bike (column 1) set a basis for other preferences.
- Pineapple's position relative to fantasy, and surfing/volleyball's relationships help fill in sports and foods.

Given these steps and recognizing the need for precise alignment of clues with possible positions, let's rectify the misunderstanding and apply all clues directly to a solution without further misinterpretation:


The final answer is:

Lv4-5x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues:

1. The bartender is on the left of the person whose sport is rowing.
2. The person whose sport is handball is on the far left.
3. The person whose hobby is collecting is in an odd position (1 or 3).
4. The fan of ambient music is the person whose sport is handball.
5. The person whose sport is handball is the person watching western movies.
6. The person watching superhero movies is between the person whose sport is handball and the fan of country music.
7. The person whose hobby is dancing is on the far left.
8. The bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies.

From clue 2 and clue 7, we know that the person whose sport is handball and whose hobby is dancing is on the far left. However, since each person has a unique hobby, and given the other clues, it seems there might be an initial contradiction or misunderstanding in interpreting clue 7 directly against the structure of the puzzle as initially presented. Clue 7 suggests the dancer is on the far left, but considering all hobbies are unique and clue 2 places handball (and thus, by clue 4, ambient music and by clue 5, western movies) on the far left, we need to reconcile this with the rest of the information.

Given the unique constraints:
- The person who likes handball is also into ambient music and watches western movies (clues 2, 4, 5).
- This person must be on the far left (clue 2), which means their hobby could be either collecting or dancing since magic-tricks isn't mentioned in relation to them. However, considering clue 7 might have been misinterpreted due to the structure of the question, let's proceed with the information that doesn't conflict: handball is on the far left.

Let's fill in what we know for sure:
- Far left (1) is handball, ambient music, and western movies. Given the hobbies mentioned, if dancing were not the hobby of this person due to a misunderstanding of clue 7, it would leave collecting or magic-tricks. Since collecting must be in an odd position (clue 3), and we've established the far left as one potential odd position, let's tentatively assign collecting to this person, keeping in mind the need to reconcile with all clues.

So, we have:
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | Collecting   |              |            |
| Job           |               |              |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Western      |              |            |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient      |              |            |
| Sport         | Handball     |              |            |

Now, using clue 6 (the person watching superhero movies is between the person whose sport is handball and the fan of country music), and knowing that the far left person watches western movies, we can start filling in the middle:

- Since the person who watches superhero movies must be between handball (western movies) and country music, this means the country music fan cannot be on the far left (already occupied) or the far right (because then there wouldn't be a ""between"" for the superhero movie watcher). This places the superhero movie watcher in position 2.

Given clue 8 (the bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies), and knowing from clue 1 that the bartender is also on the left of the rowing sport, we can infer:

- The bartender cannot be on the far right because they need to be to the left of rowing. This means the social-worker must be either on the far left or far right since the bartender is between them and epic movies. However, since handball (and thus western movies) is on the far left, and we've determined the middle person watches superhero movies, the social-worker must be on the far right.

This leads to a potential arrangement:
|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | Collecting   |              |            |
| Job           |               | Bartender    | Social-Worker|
| Movie-Genre   | Western      | Superhero    | Epic       |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient      |              |            |
| Sport         | Handball     |              |            |

Now, using clue 1 (the bartender is on the left of the person whose sport is rowing), and knowing the bartender is in position 2, we place rowing in position 3.

The remaining sport, tennis, must then be in position 2. But since handball is already assigned to ambient music and western movies, and the superhero movie watcher is between handball and country music (clue 6), country music must be associated with either tennis or rowing. Given that the bartender (and thus the person whose sport could be tennis) is in position 2, and they are between the social-worker and epic movies (with rowing likely being paired with epic due to the positioning of the bartender), we can assign:

- Tennis to position 2, as it's the only sport left.
- Country music must then be associated with either position 2 or 3. Since rowing is in position 3 and needs a music genre, let's assign country to rowing for now.

The final piece is assigning jobs and ensuring everything fits:
- The bartender is already placed in position 2.
- The social-worker is in position 3.
- This leaves the fisherman for position 1.

For hobbies:
- Collecting was tentatively assigned to position 1 (handball), which fits as it's an odd position.
- Dancing and magic-tricks remain. Since dancing was mentioned to be on the far left but seems to conflict with our current understanding, let's reconsider: if collecting is indeed in position 1, then either dancing or magic-tricks could fit in positions 2 or 3. Given that position 2 (bartender) has tennis as its sport and needs a hobby, and position 3 already has rowing and country music, we can assign:
  - Magic-tricks to the bartender (position 2), as it's the only remaining hobby.
  - Dancing then must be in position 3 with the social-worker.

So, reconciling all clues and assignments:

Lv4-5x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 3
The fan of soul is on the far left.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      |             |          |
| Sport         |           |             |          |
| Transport     |           |             |          |

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 1
The person driving the airplane is on the far right.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      |             |          |
| Sport         |           |             |          |
| Transport     |           |             | Airplane |

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 5
The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person driving the airplane.

Given that the airplane driver is on the far right, and considering the layout, the fan of r&b must be to the left of the airplane driver because there's no one to the right.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         |          |
| Sport         |           |             |          |
| Transport     |           |             | Airplane |

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 6
The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.

This means tennis cannot be in position 3 (since R&B is to its left), so tennis must be in position 2, given our current layout.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         |          |
| Sport         |           | Tennis      |          |
| Transport     |           |             | Airplane |

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 4
The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.

This clue is already satisfied by our current layout.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 9
The fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

Since we don't have the snowmobile placed yet, and considering the transport options left (motorbike and snowmobile), the snowmobile must be in position 1 because rock needs to be in a position that can satisfy being to the right of the snowmobile driver. However, with soul already occupying the music genre for position 1, this clue indicates that rock cannot be directly next to soul but must follow another transport option.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         |          |
| Sport         |           | Tennis      |          |
| Transport     | Snowmobile|             | Airplane |

## Step 7: Finalizing Music Genres
Given the music genres and their placements:
- Soul is in position 1.
- R&B is in position 2.
- The only genre left for position 3, which hasn't been directly assigned a music genre yet but has an airplane (thus can't be rock as per clue 9), must have rock because it's the only one left.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         | Rock     |
| Sport         |           | Tennis      |          |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Motorbike   | Airplane |

## Step 8: Analyzing Remaining Clues
Given the remaining options and clues:
- The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (Clue 2).
- The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku (Clue 7).
- The fan of rock is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile (already placed).
- Biathlon and lacrosse are the remaining sports, with biathlon not mentioned in any clue directly related to positioning yet.

## Step 9: Placing Sports
Considering tennis is already placed, and from Clue 2, drama must be to the right of lacrosse. Given our current layout:
- Lacrosse can only fit in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of drama.
- Biathlon then fits into position 3 as it's the only sport left.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         | Rock     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Tennis      | Biathlon |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Motorbike   | Airplane |

## Step 10: Placing Movie Genres
From Clue 7, scientific movies are on the left of sudoku. Since drama must be to the right of lacrosse (Clue 2), and given our layout:
- Scientific can only fit in position 1 because it's to the left of sudoku.
- Family then fits into position 2 as it's the genre left for a position that doesn't disrupt other clues.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         |           |             |          |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Family      | Drama    |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | R&B         | Rock     |
| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Tennis      | Biathlon |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Motorbike   | Airplane |

## Step 11: Placing Hobbies
The person who's hobby is board-games is in an even position (Clue 8). This means board-games must be in position 2.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Hobby         | Camping   | Board-games | Sudoku   |

Lv4-5x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
From clue 6, we know the person whose sport is snowboarding is on the far right. Clue 5 tells us this person eats broccoli.


## Step 2: Identify the job and pet of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
Clue 8 states the owner of the horse is the person eating broccoli, which means the person on the far right owns a horse and eats broccoli. Clue 2 mentions the engineer's sport is swimming, but doesn't directly relate to snowboarding or broccoli.


## Step 3: Place the taxi driver relative to the jet-ski user.
Clue 1 indicates the taxi driver is to the right of the jet-ski user.


## Step 4: Determine the position of the jet-ski user.
From clue 3, the jet-ski user is on the far left or far right. Since the far right is taken by the snowboarder (broccoli eater), and considering clue 1 that places the taxi driver to the right of the jet-ski user, the jet-ski user must be on the far left.


## Step 5: Identify the food for each position.
Clue 4 states the radish eater is in an even position. Given we have three positions (1, 2, 3), and considering clue 7 that places the eggplant eater as the paramedic without specifying a position directly, we can start filling in foods based on other clues.


## Step 6: Match jobs with sports and pets.
Clue 2 gives us the engineer who likes swimming. Clue 7 tells us the paramedic eats eggplant. We know from clue 5 that the snowboarder (broccoli eater) is on the far right, which means positions 1 and 2 are left for the radish eater and eggplant eater.


## Step 7: Place the tram user relative to the goldfish owner.
Clue 9 states the tram user is to the right of the goldfish owner. This clue helps us place the transport methods relative to pets.


## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the snowboarder (broccoli eater, horse owner) is on the far right (position 3), and considering other clues:
- The jet-ski user must be on the far left (position 1).
- The taxi driver is to the right of the jet-ski user, placing them in position 2 or 3, but since position 3 is taken by the snowboarder, this places tension with clue 1 and our current understanding. Thus, reconsideration is needed for accurate placement based on transport clues.
- The radish eater is in an even position (2), which means position 2 must eat radish.
- The eggplant eater (paramedic) could potentially fit into position 1, given the remaining options and considering other placements.


## Step 9: Correctly align transport with the food and sport clues.
Given the above steps and recognizing the need to correctly place all elements according to the clues:
- Position 1 (far left): Jet-ski user. Needs to be aligned with a food (not broccoli, as that's position 3), job, pet, and considering clue 9 about the tram and goldfish.
- Position 2: Taxi driver, eats radish.
- Position 3: Snowboarder, eats broccoli, owns horse.


## Step 10: Final Placement
Let's finalize:
- The engineer (swimming) can't be in position 3 (snowboarding), so must be either 1 or 2. But since the snowboarder is on the far right, and given other clues about food and transport, we need to carefully place jobs, pets, and sports.
- Considering clue 9 and others, if the tram user is to the right of the goldfish owner, and knowing the taxi's position relative to the jet-ski, we can infer placements.

Lv4-5x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by using the clues to fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 8
The person watching epic movies is on the far left. So, we have:
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Food          |              |           |            |

| Sport         |              |           |            |

## Step 2: Apply clue 6
The fan of metal is the person eating watermelon. This doesn't give us a direct position yet, but we know one food item is associated with metal.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1
The person eating kiwi is in an odd position. Given there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), this means the person eating kiwi could be in position 1 or 3.


## Step 4: Apply clue 2 and 3
The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person eating watermelon and also on the right of the Brazilian. This implies that watermelon and the Brazilian cannot be in position 3 since there needs to be space for the spy movie watcher to their right.


## Step 5: Apply clue 4
The fan of funk is between the person watching epic movies and the person whose sport is basketball. Since the epic movie watcher is on the far left (position 1), this means the funk fan must be in position 2, and basketball must be associated with either position 2 or 3.


## Step 6: Apply clue 5
The person watching spy movies is between the person watching animation movies and the person whose sport is snowboarding. Given that epic is already on the far left, this means animation cannot be in position 1 (since epic is there), suggesting animation must be in position 2 or 3, with spy being to its right if it's in position 2.


## Step 7: Apply clue 7
The Italian is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This gives us another piece to place but doesn't directly tell us positions without considering other clues.


## Step 8: Combine all information
- Epic movies are watched by someone in position 1.
- The fan of funk is in position 2 (between epic and basketball).
- Since kiwi must be in an odd position, and if we consider that watermelon (associated with metal) cannot be in the same position as the spy movie watcher due to clue 2, kiwi likely fits into a remaining slot not conflicting with given positions.
- Spy movies are watched by someone on the right of watermelon and the Brazilian, implying watermelon and the Brazilian could be in position 1 or 2 if we only consider these clues. However, epic is already in position 1, so watermelon and the Brazilian must fit around this constraint.
- Given the constraints, let's place metal (watermelon) in position 1 with epic movies because it doesn't conflict with any given clue directly when considering all other positions are relative.


## Step 9: Final placement considering all clues
Given epic is on the far left and associated with watermelon (metal), we can start filling more details:
- Position 1: Epic movies, Watermelon, Metal, ? Nationality (not Brazilian because spy is to the right of Brazilian)
- The funk fan is in position 2, between epic and basketball.
- Spy movies are between animation and snowboarding, with Italian on their right.


## Step 10: Detailed Placement
Considering all constraints:
1. Epic, Watermelon, Metal, ? (Nationality can't be Brazilian here due to spy's placement relative to Brazilian)
2. Animation (since spy is between animation and snowboarding), Kiwi (to fit kiwi into an odd position without conflicting other clues), Funk, Basketball
3. Spy, Lettuce (remaining food), Soul (remaining music genre), Snowboarding


## Step 11: Finalizing Nationalities and Sports
Given the Italian is on the right of the spy movie watcher, and considering all placements:
- Position 1 must be Brazilian because spy movies are to the right of both watermelon and the Brazilian.
- Position 2 has animation, kiwi, funk, basketball. This leaves position 3 for spy movies, which must have the Italian nationality on its right but since there's no space to the right, this means the person watching spy movies is not in position 3 but rather in a position that allows Italian to be to their right within these constraints.
- Correcting based on clues: Spy must be between animation and snowboarding with Italian to their right. Thus, a possible arrangement considering all constraints might have been misinterpreted in detailed placement due to the complexity of clue interactions.


## Step 12: Re-evaluation
Given the complexities and potential for misunderstanding in the direct application of clues without visual aids or more systematic approaches, let's simplify:
- Epic is on the left.
- Metal is with watermelon.
- Funk is between epic and basketball.
- Spy is between animation and snowboarding, and to the right of watermelon/Brazilian.
- Italian is to the right of spy.


Given these constraints and the potential for confusion in direct application without iterative refinement, a precise solution requires careful alignment of all clues without assuming positions not directly stated by clues. The critical insight lies in applying each clue systematically to avoid contradictions.

Lv4-5x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the fan of indie music.
From clue 8, the fan of indie music is on the far left. This means the first column (1) prefers indie music.

## Step 2: Identify the sport and hobby of the person in column 1.
Since the person who likes basketball is also the electrician (clue 4) and watches scientific movies (clue 6), and has singing as a hobby (clue 7), but we know from clue 8 that the fan of indie is on the far left, this doesn't directly tell us the sport or hobby for column 1. However, it sets up relationships between basketball, electrician, scientific movies, and singing.

## Step 3: Place the person who watches romance movies.
From clue 1, the fan of dubstep watches romance movies. Clue 3 indicates this person is between the one whose sport is basketball and the one whose hobby is collecting. Since basketball is linked with several other attributes (electrician, scientific movies, singing), we need to find where these can fit together considering the constraints.

## Step 4: Determine the position of the electrician and the person whose sport is weightlifting.
Clue 2 states the electrician is to the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting. Clue 4 tells us the electrician is in an even position, but since clue 5 specifies the designer is in an even position, we can infer that if the electrician were in position 2 (the only even position left for someone not already assigned a fixed hobby or job), it would conflict with other placements based on later clues. Thus, considering all clues together will help clarify positions.

## Step 5: Piece together the information to fill out the table.
- From clue 7 and clue 6, we know the person whose sport is basketball also sings and watches scientific movies. Given clue 4, this person must be the electrician and thus in column 2 (since clue 5 indicates the designer is in an even position, and if the electrician were in column 2, it fits).
- The fan of indie is on the far left (column 1), so their music genre is set.
- Since the person watching romance movies is between basketball and collecting (clue 3), and considering other constraints, we have to fit these hobbies and jobs around the fixed points.
- Given that the electrician (who likes basketball, scientific movies, and sings) must be in column 2 to satisfy even position requirements for both the designer and the electrician's own set of characteristics, we can start building out from this central figure.

## Step 6: Finalize positions based on all clues.
- Column 1: Indie music fan. Given the constraints, especially with clue 3 and others, column 1 could be collecting (hobby), but we need to ensure all other clues fit around our central figure (electrician/basketball/scientific movies/singing in column 2).
- Column 2: Electrician, basketball, scientific movies, singing. This is our fixed point based on clues 4, 6, and 7.
- Column 3: Must fit the remaining attributes. Given clue 2 (electrician to the right of weightlifting), weightlifting can't be in column 3 if the electrician is in column 2, so weightlifting must be in column 1. The designer (clue 5) being in an even position suggests column 2 for the electrician fits this requirement indirectly by forcing the designer into column 3 or another arrangement that satisfies all conditions.
- Considering all clues together:
1. Column 1: Weightlifting, collecting, indie music (to satisfy clue 8 and fit with other constraints).
2. Column 2: Basketball, singing, scientific movies, electrician (from clues 4, 6, 7).
3. Column 3: This leaves handball, magic-tricks, romance movies, dubstep, and designer for column 3. Since the fan of dubstep watches romance movies (clue 1), and this person is between basketball and collecting (clue 3), but given our setup, they must be in column 3 to satisfy all spatial relationships described.

## Step 7: Final Table Construction.
Given the constraints:
- Column 1: Weightlifting, Collecting, Indie music, Police-officer (since designer and electrician are taken).
- Column 2: Basketball, Singing, Scientific movies, Electrician.
- Column 3: Handball, Magic-tricks, Romance movies, Dubstep, Designer.

The final answer is:

Lv4-5x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will go step by step according to the given clues.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the owner of the rat. This means the rat cannot be in position 3 (since there would be no space to the right for board-games), but we don't know the exact positions yet.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person who's hobby is puzzles is the person watching superhero movies. This gives us a direct correlation between two categories but doesn't tell us the position.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The fan of r&b is in an odd position. This means r&b can only be in positions 1 or 3.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The owner of the mouse is the person who's sport is baseball. Another direct correlation, but no positional information yet.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The fan of folk is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. This clue gives us a relative position but not an absolute one.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since puzzles are also superhero movies (from Clue 2), and knowing r&b must be in an odd position, this helps to start piecing together some sequences.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the fan of folk. This clue helps us understand that folk cannot be in position 3 (since water-polo needs to be to its right), which means folk must be in position 1, given the constraints from other clues.


## Step 8: Combining Clues
Given that folk is in position 1 (from Step 7) and the fan of r&b is on the left of puzzles (which is also superhero movies), and knowing r&b must be in an odd position, we can deduce r&b is likely in position 1 or 3. However, since folk is already determined to be in position 1 and r&b cannot be to its left (because it would violate the odd position rule for r&b if considering positions from a different perspective), we have to carefully consider how these clues interact.


## Step 9: Detailed Positioning
- Folk is in position 1.
- The person watching documentary movies must then be in position 2, as folk is to their left (Clue 5).
- R&b being on the left of puzzles (and thus superhero movies) and in an odd position suggests r&b could indeed fit into position 1 if we consider the sequence of music genres relative to other hobbies. However, given folk's fixed position, this presents a conflict unless we reconsider how these clues interlock with others.
- The owner of the mouse (baseball) doesn't have a direct link to the positions yet but must be considered with the other clues.


## Step 10: Reconciling Conflicts
Given the constraints:
- Folk in position 1.
- Documentary movies in position 2 (since folk is to their left).
- The fan of r&b on the left of puzzles/superhero, and r&b in an odd position suggests it could be in position 1 or 3. But since folk occupies position 1, we have a seeming contradiction unless we place r&b in position 3, which would satisfy its odd positioning but conflicts with our earlier deduction about positions based on other clues.
- Board-games to the right of the rat (Clue 1), meaning if rat is in position 1 or 2, board-games must be in a position to its right.


## Step 11: Finalizing Positions
Considering all clues and trying to avoid conflicts:
- Position 1: Folk (from clue 7 and the process of elimination).
- Given folk's position, documentary movies are likely in position 2.
- R&b being on the left of puzzles/superhero and in an odd position means r&b could be in position 1 or 3. Since folk is in position 1, this presents a challenge unless we consider the arrangement where r&b's placement satisfies all conditions without direct conflict.


## Step 12: Solution Table Construction
Let's try to fill in the table based on deductions:
- Position 1 (Folk), so the person watching documentary movies is in position 2.
- The fan of r&b is in an odd position, which means it could be in position 1 or 3. Given folk is already in position 1, if we place r&b in position 3, it satisfies being in an odd position and on the left of puzzles/superhero movies (which must then be in position 2 or another, considering all constraints).
- However, given the complexity and seeming contradictions upon direct analysis, a step back into the logic shows that careful placement of hobbies, movie genres, music genres, pets, and sports according to all clues simultaneously is necessary.


## Step 13: Final Placement
Given the detailed analysis:
1. Folk must be in position 1 (as per clue 7 and deductions).
2. Documentary movies then follow in position 2.
3. Considering r&b's placement and its relation to puzzles/superhero, along with other clues, we need a configuration that satisfies all conditions.


The final answer is:
