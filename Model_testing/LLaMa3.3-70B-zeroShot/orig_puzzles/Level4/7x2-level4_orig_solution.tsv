Lv4-7x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the person driving the bus.
2. The person whose sport is volleyball is in an odd position (which means it can only be position 1 since there are only two positions).
3. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the accountant.
4. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the fan of classical music.


From clue 2, we know volleyball must be at position 1 because it's the only odd position available.


Given:
- Volleyball is at position 1 (from clue 2).
- Gardening cannot be at position 2 because then there would be no one to the left of the bus driver if the bus were at position 2 (considering clue 1). Therefore, gardening must also be at position 1.


Since volleyball and gardening are both associated with position 1 based on our deductions so far, let's try to place other items:


- From clue 3, sprite is to the left of the accountant. If we consider the arrangement where volleyball (and thus possibly sprite) is at position 1, then the accountant must be at position 2.


Now, combining all clues and trying to fit them into our table, let's deduce further:


Given that:
- The person drinking hot chocolate is not specified yet but must be in the remaining slot.
- Camping must fill the hobby slot for the second person since gardening is taken by the first.
- Engineer is the job left to fill the second slot because accountant is already placed.


For movie-genre and music-genre, we know from clue 4 that sports movies are on the left of classical music. Since volleyball (and thus possibly sports movies) is at position 1, it fits that documentary would be associated with position 2 because sports must precede classical.


Lastly, considering transport: since gardening is to the left of the bus driver (clue 1), and assuming the person enjoying volleyball also enjoys gardening (based on our odd positioning requirement for volleyball and the fact we have only two positions), this implies the taxi must be associated with position 1 because the bus cannot be driven by someone to their own right.


Putting it all together, we get:

Lv4-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 3, the person watching romance movies is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1.


Clue 5 states that the person drinking cola is in an even position, meaning they must be in position 2.


Given clue 4, the Turkish person is to the left of the manager. Since there are only two positions and the romance movie watcher (who could be either nationality but has to be in an odd position) is already determined to be in position 1, if the Turkish person were in position 1, the manager would have to be in position 2, which fits this clue.


Clue 6 tells us that the van driver is on the left of the ship driver. This means the van must be associated with position 1 and the ship with position 2.


From clue 2, the owner of the rat is on the left of the person eating strawberry. If we assume the rat owner could potentially be in either position based solely on this clue, we'd need more information to definitively place them. However, since the van (position 1) and ship (position 2) are already determined by clue 6, and considering other clues about food and pets, we'll have to cross-reference with other information.


Clue 1 says the person watching adventure movies is on the far left or far right. Given that romance movies are watched in an odd position (thus position 1), adventure movies must be associated with position 2.


Let's summarize what we know so far and fill in the blanks:


- Position 1: Romance movie, van, Turkish (because they're to the left of the manager)
- Position 2: Adventure movie, ship, cola


Now, let's deal with the remaining information:


The manager must be in position 2 since the Turkish person is to their left. Thus, the job for position 1 is not specified directly from previous clues but can be inferred as ""not manager,"" which leaves us with police-officer for position 1.


For food: Since the rat owner is on the left of the strawberry eater (clue 2) and we have determined the leftmost person (position 1) to be associated with several characteristics, if this person eats avocado or strawberry, they must eat it in a way that the rat's owner is to the left of the strawberry eater. Given no direct clue links food directly to position except through the pet clue, and knowing the van (thus likely the rat, given its odd positioning clue) is with the Turkish person in position 1, we can infer that avocado could be more flexibly placed but must fit with the remaining clues about pets and transport.


Given this, let's try to piece together a coherent solution based on all clues:


- Position 1: Romance movies (clue 3), van (clue 6), Turkish (clue 4 implies they're before the manager), police-officer (by deduction since manager is in position 2), rat owner (because they must be to the left of strawberry eater, clue 2), and by process of elimination for food and drink, likely avocado (since it hasn't been directly linked to a specific position yet) and sprite (as cola is taken by position 2).


- Position 2: Adventure movies (clue 1), ship (clue 6), manager (clue 4), strawberry eater (by clue 2, implying the rat owner eats something else), cat owner (by elimination since rat is in position 1), and cola drinker.


So, the final table looks like this:


#############
|               |       1        |     2      |
| Beverage      |      Sprite    |    Cola    |
| Food          |     Avocado    | Strawberry|
| Job           | Police-officer|   Manager  |
| Movie-Genre   |     Romance    | Adventure |
| Nationality   |      Thai      |   Turkish  |
| Pet           |       Rat      |     Cat    |
| Transport     |       Van      |     Ship   |
#############


However, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in the nationality placement based on the clues given. The correct interpretation should align with clue 4 (the Turkish is on the left of the manager), which means the Turkish person cannot be in position 2 as initially concluded but must indeed precede the manager. Thus, the correct alignment considering all clues properly would actually have the Turkish person in position 1 and the manager in position 2, with other attributes adjusted accordingly to fit the clues provided.


Correcting for this oversight and ensuring adherence to the format instructions:


The corrected final table should align with the clues more accurately as follows:


Given the constraints and focusing on correcting the nationality and associated attributes while keeping the rest of the logic intact:


- The Turkish person must be in position 1, preceding the manager (in position 2), which corrects the initial misunderstanding.


Thus, ensuring all clues are respected:

Lv4-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues and apply them step by step to fill out the table.


From clue 3: The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
- This implies that ""musical"" must be in column 1 since it has to be to the left of someone, and there's no one to the left of column 1.


From clue 5: The paramedic is on the left of the person driving the car.
- Since we know from clue 2 that the owner of the hamster is in an odd position (which means they can only be in position 1), we also understand that positions are counted starting from 1 as an odd position.


Given these initial deductions, let's fill out what we can:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         |             |            |
| Job           |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical     |            |
| Pet           | Hamster     |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     |             | Car        |


From clue 4: The paramedic is on the left or right of the journalist.
- Since we've determined that column 1 has a ""musical"" movie genre and considering other clues, let's place the paramedic in column 1 for now to see how it fits with other information. This means our journalist would have to be in column 2 because the paramedic needs to be on the left or right of them.


Now, looking at clue 2 again: The owner of the hamster is in an odd position.
- We've already placed the hamster in column 1 (an odd position), which fits this requirement.


From clue 1: The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
- Given that ""rowing"" has to be on the right and assuming ""video-games"" could fit into the remaining spots, let's place ""video-games"" in column 1 for now because we need a hobby there, and ""rowing"" would then logically go into column 2.


However, considering clue 3 again (the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee) and our previous setup, if ""musical"" is in column 1, it suggests that the beverage in column 2 should be ""coffee"". Also, given that we have a hamster in column 1, and knowing there are only two pets (hamster and horse), the pet for column 2 must be a horse.


Let's now integrate all these deductions into our table:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Water      | Coffee    |
| Hobby         | Video-games| Reading   |
| Job           | Paramedic  | Journalist|
| Movie-Genre   | Musical    | Zombie    |
| Pet           | Hamster    | Horse     |
| Sport         | Cycling    | Rowing    |
| Transport     | Snowmobile | Car       |


Given all clues, this setup seems to satisfy all conditions:
- The person who likes ""musical"" is on the left of the coffee drinker (clue 3).
- The rowing sport is on the right of the video-games hobbyist (clue 1), which fits if we consider positions relatively.
- The hamster owner is in an odd position (column 1, clue 2).
- The paramedic is indeed on the left or right of the journalist and also to the left of the car driver (clues 4 and 5).


Therefore, the completed table, considering all given conditions and logic deductions, looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |

Lv4-7x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the R&B fan and the volleyball enthusiast
From clue 1, the R&B fan is in an even position, which means they can only be in position 2.
From clue 2, the volleyball enthusiast is also in an even position, meaning they too can only be in position 2.


## Step 2: Identify the sport and movie genre of the person in position 2
Clue 5 states that the person who prefers volleyball as their sport also watches action movies.


## Step 3: Determine the hobby of each person
Clue 6 tells us that the person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is video-games. Since there are only two positions, this means the video-game enthusiast must be in position 1, and the card-game enthusiast in position 2.


## Step 4: Identify the beverage for each person
Clue 4 indicates that the person drinking soy-milk is in an odd position, meaning they can only be in position 1. Therefore, the person in position 2 must drink lemonade.


## Step 5: Determine the pet for each person
Clue 3 states that the owner of the bird is on the left of the person driving the boat. We don't know who drives the boat yet, but since there are only two positions and the bird's owner must be on the left, the bird's owner must be in position 1.


## Step 6: Figure out the transport for each person
Given that the bird's owner is in position 1 and must be to the left of the boat driver (Clue 3), it implies the boat driver cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the boat driver must be in position 2, leaving the van for position 1.


## Step 7: Determine the music genre for each person
We already know from clue 1 that the R&B fan is in an even position (position 2). Since there are only two music genres and the R&B fan is in position 2, the soul fan must be in position 1.


## Step 8: Identify the movie genre for each person
From clue 5, we know the volleyball enthusiast (in position 2) watches action movies. Therefore, the sports movie fan must be in position 1.


## Step 9: Determine the sport for each person
Clue 2 and clue 5 have already established that the volleyball enthusiast is in position 2. Thus, the swimming enthusiast must be in position 1.


The final answer is:

Lv4-7x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given and fill in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 6
The fisherman is on the far right. This means the job of the person in column 2 is a fisherman.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 4
The British person's sport is volleyball. Since there are only two nationalities and the fisherman (who must be either British or Russian) is on the far right, we can deduce that if the British person were on the right, they would have to be the fisherman, which doesn't directly conflict with any given clue but let's see how other clues fit.


## Step 3: Using Clue 1
The owner of the lizard is on the right of the Russian. This implies the Russian cannot be on the far right because there needs to be someone (the lizard owner) to their right. Given the fisherman is on the far right, this means the fisherman could either be British or Russian, but since the British person plays volleyball and we don't know their job yet, let's keep options open.


## Step 4: Applying Clue 3
The person driving the car watches mystery movies. This clue doesn't directly tell us which column the car driver is in, but it links two categories.


## Step 5: Considering Clue 2
The person watching romance movies is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means the romance movie watcher must be in position 1 because if they were in position 2, it would not satisfy the ""odd position"" criteria based on a standard interpretation where positions are numbered starting from 1.


## Step 6: Integrating Clue 5
The fan of rock music is on the left or right of the person whose sport is skateboarding. This clue links music genre with sport but doesn't specify which column the rock fan or the skateboarding enthusiast is in.


## Step 7: Finalizing Positions Based on All Clues
Given the clues, let's start filling in what we know for sure:
- The fisherman is on the far right (column 2).
- The British person plays volleyball.
- The romance movie watcher is in column 1.

Let's assume the Russian is in column 1 since the lizard owner must be to their right, and given the constraints, this seems like a necessary step to accommodate all clues.


## Step 8: Combining Jobs with Nationalities and Other Preferences
Since the fisherman is on the far right and must be either British or Russian, but we've placed the Russian in column 1 to satisfy the lizard owner clue, the fisherman could potentially be British. However, this doesn't directly conflict with any given information.


## Step 9: Final Table Construction
Let's construct a possible final table based on deductions:


|               |       1       |     2      |

Lv4-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 3
Given that the person driving the jet-ski is in an even position, this means the jet-ski user must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The Spanish person is on the left of the firefighter. This implies the Spanish person cannot be in position 2 since the firefighter needs to be to their right, and there's no one to the right of position 2. Therefore, the Spanish person must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Determine Nationality
Since the Spanish person is in position 1, by elimination, the Australian must be in position 2.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 1
The firefighter is on the right of the fan of pop. Given that the firefighter cannot be in position 1 (because of clue 5), and knowing from clue 3 that the jet-ski user is in position 2, we can deduce the firefighter must also be in position 2 because there's no other ""right"" position for them to occupy in relation to the pop fan. This means the pop fan must be in position 1.


## Step 5: Determine Music Genre
Given that the pop fan is in position 1, and by elimination, the salsa fan must be in position 2.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 2
The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since we have determined positions for nationalities and music genres, this clue helps us place movie genres. The action movie watcher must be in position 1 (to the left of the spy movie watcher), and thus the spy movie watcher is in position 2.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 4
The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person whose sport is climbing. This clue, combined with previous deductions, means the climber must be in position 1 (because the kiwi eater needs to be to their right), and thus the kiwi eater is in position 2.


## Step 8: Determine Food
Given that the kiwi eater is in position 2, by elimination, the avocado eater must be in position 1.


## Step 9: Apply Remaining Clues for Sport and Transport
- The person whose sport is climbing is in position 1 (from step 7).
- The skateboarder, then, must be in position 2.
- For transport, since the jet-ski user is in an even position (position 2 from clue 3), and by elimination, the skateboard user must be in position 1.


## Step 10: Determine Job
Given that the firefighter is on the right of the pop fan (from clue 1) and knowing the pop fan is in position 1, this places the firefighter in position 2. By elimination, the engineer must be in position 1.


The final answer is:

## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 - The American is in an odd position.
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and an odd position means position 1, the American must be in position 1.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 4 - The person eating pear is in an odd position.
This also means the person eating pear is in position 1, as it's the only odd position available.


## Step 3: Use Clue 5 - The person driving the tram is in an odd position.
This implies the tram is associated with position 1.


## Step 4: Examine Clue 2 - The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person drinking juice.
Since the guinea-pig's owner must be on the right, and given our current setup where position 1 is filled by someone eating pear, American, and using the tram, the person drinking juice cannot be in position 1 (because there would be no one to the right for the guinea-pig owner). Thus, the person drinking juice is in position 2, making the guinea-pig owner also in position 2, which seems contradictory. However, re-evaluating, if the person with juice is in position 1, then the guinea-pig owner must be in position 2.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1 - The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
This means rock-climbing cannot be in position 2 (since there's no one to the right for animation), placing rock-climbing in position 1 and thus animation in position 2.


## Step 6: Synthesize Information
- Position 1: American, eats pear, uses tram, drinks juice (from step 4 correction), hobby is rock-climbing.
- Position 2: Watches animation, owns guinea-pig.

Given these deductions:
- Beverage for position 1 is juice (because the guinea-pig owner is on the right of the person drinking juice, implying the other beverage, milk, must be in position 2).
- Food for position 1 is pear.
- Hobby for position 1 is rock-climbing, making traveling the hobby for position 2.
- Movie genre for position 1 cannot be animation (from clue 1), so it's satire for position 1 and animation for position 2.
- Nationality for position 1 is American, making Dutch for position 2.
- Pet for position 1 must then be frog (since guinea-pig is in position 2).
- Transport for position 1 is tram, leaving snowmobile for position 2.

Lv4-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


From clue 4, ""the person watching mystery movies is in an odd position,"" we know that the person who watches mystery movies must be in either position 1 since those are the only odd positions available.


## Step 1: Determine the Position of the Mystery Movie Fan
Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering clue 4, the mystery movie fan could be in position 1. This is because if they were in position 2, it would contradict the statement since 2 is an even position.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1 - Broccoli Eater's Position
Clue 1 states that ""the person eating broccoli is on the right of the librarian."" This means the librarian must be in position 1, and the broccoli eater in position 2, as the broccoli eater needs to be to the right of the librarian.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 - Chinchilla Owner's Position
Clue 2 says ""the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the fan of soul."" Since we've determined the librarian (and thus potentially other preferences) must be in position 1, and considering the need for the chinchilla owner to be on the left of the soul music fan, this clue will help us place the soul music fan and the chinchilla owner.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3 - 7up Drinker's Position
Clue 3 states ""the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku."" This means the 7up drinker must be in position 1, as they need to be to the left of the sudoku enthusiast.


## Step 5: Compile Information
- From Step 1 and Step 2 are contradictory regarding the placement based on initial analysis. The correct approach should reconcile all clues without assuming fixed positions prematurely.
- Clue 1 indicates the librarian is in position 1 if we consider the broccoli eater to be in position 2, as it's the only way for the broccoli eater to be ""on the right"" of the librarian.
- Clue 4 suggests the mystery fan could be in position 1 since it's an odd position.


## Step 6: Reconcile Contradictions and Apply Remaining Clues
Given the clues:
- The person watching mystery movies is in position 1 (to satisfy clue 4 directly).
- The librarian must be in a position that allows the broccoli eater to be on their right, suggesting the librarian could indeed be in position 1 if we reconsider our approach based on all clues.
- However, clue 3 indicates the 7up drinker is to the left of the sudoku enthusiast, which means if the mystery fan (who could also be the librarian) is in position 1, the 7up drinker must also be in position 1 or this clue needs to be aligned with other preferences.
- Clue 2 places the chinchilla owner on the left of the soul music fan, which can help determine the music genre preference for each person.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions
Let's correctly apply all clues without premature assumptions:
1. Mystery movies are watched by someone in an odd position (Position 1).
2. The librarian is in position 1 (to allow broccoli to be on their right, in position 2).
3. The 7up drinker is to the left of the sudoku player, which aligns with the librarian being in position 1 if we consider other preferences.
4. The chinchilla owner is on the left of the soul fan.


Given these steps and clues, let's finalize:

Lv4-7x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2
The Dutch person is in an odd position, meaning they can only be in position 1.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person whose sport is sailing is the dressmaker. This means the dressmaker cannot be in position 2 if we consider the arrangement of sports and jobs together, but we don't have enough information yet to place them definitively.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 1
The fan of R&B is on the left of the dressmaker. Since we know the Dutch person is on the left (and thus in position 1), and assuming the dressmaker could potentially be in position 2 based on later clues, this suggests the R&B fan could indeed be in position 1.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left of the person eating tomato. This clue doesn't give us direct positions yet but indicates a relationship between hobbies and food.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 4
The electrician is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. This gives another relationship but doesn't specify positions without considering other clues.

## Step 6: Combine Information
From clue 3, we know the dressmaker sails. If the R&B fan (who must be on the left of the dressmaker) is also Dutch and in position 1 (from clue 2), then the dressmaker must be in position 2 because there are only two positions.

## Step 7: Further Deductions
- Since the dressmaker is in position 2 and sails, and considering clue 4 (electrician on the left of the goldfish owner), if the electrician were in position 1, it would contradict clue 1 unless the R&B fan and the electrician are the same person. However, we need to place the card-games hobbyist relative to tomato and consider nationalities.

## Step 8: Placing Nationality and Music
Given the Dutch is in position 1 (odd), and if we assume the dressmaker is not Dutch but rather the R&B fan is Dutch (to satisfy clue 2 directly with our current information), then:
- The Chinese person must be the dressmaker, as there are only two nationalities.

## Step 9: Finalizing Positions
Let's place known elements:
- Position 1: Dutch, R&B, ? (food, hobby, pet)
- Position 2: Chinese, Dressmaker, Sailing

Considering clue 5 and knowing the dressmaker's position:
- Card-games must be on the left of tomato. If the dressmaker is in position 2 and eats zucchini (since there are only two foods), then the card-games enthusiast must eat tomato and thus be Dutch.

## Step 10: Placing Remaining Elements
Given the electrician is on the left of the goldfish owner, and if the dressmaker (Chinese) is with sailing in position 2:
- The electrician cannot be in position 2; thus, the electrician must be Dutch in position 1.
- This means the goldfish owner is in position 2, which fits because the dressmaker (sailing) can own a pet.

## Step 11: Final Placements
Considering all clues:
- Position 1 (Dutch): Electrician, R&B, Card-games, Tomato, Bird (since the dressmaker has sailing and likely the goldfish to fit with clue 4)
- Position 2 (Chinese): Dressmaker, Sailing, Dubstep (by elimination), Zucchini, Goldfish

The final answer is:

Lv4-7x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The American is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games.
2. The person watching scientific movies is in an odd position.
3. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
4. The mechanic is in an even position.
5. The person whose hobby is reading is the person drinking 7up.


From clue 5, we know the person with the hobby ""reading"" drinks 7up.


Given clue 2, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and it mentions an odd position for scientific movies, this means scientific movies must be at position 1 because 1 is the only odd position available.


From clue 4, we know the mechanic is in an even position, which means the mechanic can only be in position 2 since it's the only even position available.


Clue 3 tells us that the person driving the subway is on the right of the person whose sport is basketball. This implies basketball must be at position 1 (since subway, being on the right, has to be at position 2), and thus, swimming (the other sport) must also be associated with position 2 because there are only two positions.


From clue 1, knowing the American is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games, if we place card-games at position 1, then the American can be at position 2, fitting the requirement that the American is to the right of card-games. This also means the Nigerian must be at position 1 because there are only two nationalities.


Now, combining all clues:


- Position 1 has scientific movies (from clue 2), basketball (deduced from clue 3 and the arrangement of sports), card-games (to allow the American to be on the right), and Nigerian nationality.
- The hobby at position 1 is card-games (since reading is associated with 7up, and we don't have enough information yet to directly link it to a specific beverage for card-games).
- At position 2, we have the mechanic (from clue 4), American nationality (from clue 1), subway transport (because it's on the right of basketball), and since reading is linked with 7up (clue 5), this means hot-chocolate must be at position 1.


So, the final arrangement considering all clues would look something like this:


#############
|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | 7up      |
| Hobby         | card-games   | reading  |
| Job           | coach        | mechanic |
| Movie-Genre   | scientific   | sports   |
| Nationality   | nigerian     | american |
| Sport         | basketball   | swimming |
| Transport     | scooter      | subway   |
