Lv5-5x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching spy movies is in an odd position. This means they can be in either position 1 or 3.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person eating lettuce is between the person eating carrot and the Egyptian. This clue implies a specific order but doesn't give us exact positions yet.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The French is on the far left or far right. This limits the French person's position to either 1 or 3.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person watching fantasy movies is in an even position. This means they must be in position 2, as it's the only even position available.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The French is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess. This clue, combined with Clue 3, suggests the French cannot be on the far right if chess is not on the far right, limiting arrangements.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The person driving the subway is in an odd position. Like Clue 1, this means they can be in either position 1 or 3.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
The Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is woodworking. This clue gives us a relative position but needs combination with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 8
The Egyptian is the person driving the car. This directly assigns the transport method to the Egyptian but doesn't specify their position yet.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 9
The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the subway. If the subway driver is in position 1, the spy movie watcher must be in position 3, given the odd positioning requirement.

## Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the far left or far right. This limits their position to either 1 or 3.

## Step 11: Combine Clues for Final Placement
Given the constraints:
- The French must be on the far left or far right (Clue 3) and to the left of chess (Clue 5).
- Woodworking is on the far left or far right (Clue 10), which could align with the French being to their right if woodworking is on the left.
- The Egyptian drives a car (Clue 8) and must be between carrot and lettuce eaters (Clue 2), suggesting flexibility in their position based on food assignments.
- Spy movies are watched by someone to the right of the subway driver (Clue 9) and in an odd position (Clue 1), pointing towards position 3 if the subway is in position 1.
- Fantasy movies are watched in an even position (Clue 4), locking them into position 2.

## Step 12: Assigning Positions
Let's start with fixed positions:
- If woodworking is on the far left, it satisfies Clue 10 and could align with the Malaysian being to their left if we consider the far left for woodworking.
- However, given the constraints, especially with the French needing to be to the left of chess (Clue 5) and on the far left or right (Clue 3), and considering woodworking's possible positions, we need to align these with other clues.

## Step 13: Finalizing Positions
Considering all clues:
- Woodworking on the far left (1) allows for the Malaysian to be to their left, but since there's no one to the left of position 1, this places the Malaysian in a tricky spot unless they're also on the left, which doesn't fit with other nationalities' placements based on later clues.
- French on the far left (as per Clue 3 and Clue 5 for being before chess) suggests woodworking could be on the right to satisfy Clue 10, or it aligns with chess if we place chess in position 2 or 3 under different scenarios.
- The person watching fantasy movies is in position 2 (Clue 4), which helps anchor other positions.

Given these complexities and the direct clues:
- Position 1 could be woodworking (satisfying Clue 10) with the subway (from Clue 6), but we must align this with the French being on the left (Clue 3) and before chess (Clue 5).
- The Egyptian drives a car and is between carrot and lettuce eaters, which can be placed in various orders but needs to fit around the fantasy movie watcher in position 2.

The final answer is:

Lv5-5x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


From clue 4, we know the manager owns a bird.

From clue 7, we have milk to the left of grapefruit.

From clue 1, lemonade is to the left or right of lettuce.

From clue 3, drama movies are to the left of lettuce.

Considering clue 2 (lemonade to the right of action movies) and clue 5 (nurse to the right of lemonade), we can start building a sequence: Action -> Lemonade -> Nurse.

Clue 6 tells us the frog's owner is to the right of the bird's owner, who is the manager. Clue 8 says the manager is to the left of the frog's owner, reinforcing this.

Given clue 9 (horse's owner to the right of drama movies), and since drama movies are to the left of lettuce (clue 3), we have a sequence: Drama -> Lettuce.

Combining sequences with the fact that lemonade must be near lettuce (clue 1) and to the right of action movies (clue 2), and knowing the nurse is to the right of lemonade (clue 5), we start seeing a clearer picture.


Let's assign positions based on the clues:

- Since milk is to the left of grapefruit (clue 7) and considering other constraints, let's place milk and grapefruit in the first two positions or elsewhere as dictated by other clues.
- The manager (bird owner) must be to the left of the frog owner (clue 8), which means the bird cannot be in the third position if we're following the sequence that the frog is after the bird.
- Action movies are before lemonade (clue 2), and drama movies are before lettuce (clue 3).
- The nurse is after lemonade (clue 5).

Given these constraints, let's start filling in:


1. For the first column:
   - Beverage: Milk
   - Food: Grapefruit (because milk is to the left of grapefruit)
   - Job: Manager (since manager has to be on the left for the bird and before the frog owner)
   - Movie-Genre: Action (since action must come before lemonade, and we don't have enough information yet to place drama and its relation to lettuce precisely without conflicting with other rules)
   - Pet: Bird

2. For the second column:
   - Beverage: Lemonade
   - Food: Lettuce (because lemonade is near lettuce)
   - Job: ?? (We'll determine this later based on nurse's position relative to lemonade)
   - Movie-Genre: Drama (since drama must be before lettuce)
   - Pet: ?? (Could be frog, given the sequence but we need to ensure it fits with all other clues)

3. For the third column:
   - Beverage: Sprite
   - Food: Raspberry (only option left)
   - Job: Nurse (because nurse is after lemonade)
   - Movie-Genre: Mystery (last option)
   - Pet: Horse (since horse's owner is to the right of drama movies)

Now, filling in the blanks and ensuring all clues are satisfied:


- The second column's job must be the security guard since it's the only one left.
- The second column's pet must indeed be the frog because it's after the bird (manager) and before the horse (which is after drama movies), satisfying clue 6.


The completed table should look like this, ensuring all clues are followed:

Lv5-5x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the jet-ski and train based on clue 4 and 5.
From clue 4, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far right. Clue 5 indicates the jet-ski driver is on the left or right of the train driver, but since the jet-ski is on the far right, the train must be to its left.


## Step 2: Use clue 6 to position the entrepreneur relative to the train.
The train driver is to the left of the entrepreneur. Given the jet-ski's position on the far right and the train to its left, we start to see a sequence: train, ?, jet-ski.


## Step 3: Apply clue 7 to place the librarian.
The entrepreneur is to the right of the librarian. So, we have a sequence: ?, librarian, entrepreneur, with the train's position relative to these roles still to be determined but knowing it must precede the entrepreneur.


## Step 4: Integrate clue 3 regarding the horse owner and librarian.
The horse owner is to the left of the librarian. This doesn't directly give us positions but indicates a possible sequence involving the horse owner, librarian, and then others.


## Step 5: Use clue 2 to understand beverage placements relative to r&b music.
Water is between almond-milk and r&b. Without exact positions, we know these three elements must be in this order or reverse order but with water in the middle.


## Step 6: Apply clue 1 regarding the guinea-pig owner and r&b fan.
The guinea-pig owner is to the right of the r&b fan. This gives us another piece of the puzzle, indicating that r&b cannot be on the far right since there must be someone (the guinea-pig owner) to its right.


## Step 7: Integrate clue 8 about music genres.
Pop is to the right of blues. Without direct placement, this indicates a sequence but doesn't directly tie into our current understanding without more specific job or beverage information.


## Step 8: Combine all clues for a comprehensive solution.
Given the jet-ski on the far right and train to its left (from clue 4 and 5), entrepreneur to the right of the librarian (clue 7), and knowing the train precedes the entrepreneur (clue 6), we can start building:
- Train, ?, ?, jet-ski for transport.
- For jobs: ?, librarian, entrepreneur.
Given the horse owner is left of the librarian (clue 3) and considering transport and job clues together, a possible job sequence could be aligned with transport as follows if we integrate all known information.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all integrated clues.
Let's finalize positions:
- Transport: Since the jet-ski is on the far right and the train must precede the entrepreneur (who is after the librarian), a likely sequence for transport considering clue 5 could be boat, train, jet-ski to fit all conditions given.
- Jobs: With the entrepreneur after the librarian and the horse owner before the librarian, we get: horse owner (doctor, because it's the only job left that fits without contradicting other clues), librarian, entrepreneur.
- Music: Since pop is right of blues and considering r&b's placement relative to water and almond-milk, a sequence could be blues, r&b, pop or the reverse based on beverage clues. But knowing the guinea-pig owner (who must like either blues or pop to fit) is right of r&b helps place music genres.
- Beverages: Water between almond-milk and r&b gives us two sequences depending on which end water starts. Given other constraints, we can deduce positions.


## Step 10: Apply the clues directly to the table for a final solution.
Let's apply all deductions:
- Transport: boat, train, jet-ski fits with job and pet owner placements considering all clues.
- Jobs: doctor (horse owner), librarian, entrepreneur aligns with transport.
- Music: blues, r&b, pop (as the guinea-pig owner is to the right of r&b, suggesting a sequence).
- Pets and beverages fit accordingly based on remaining clues.


The final answer is:

Lv5-5x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 3, we know the Colombian is a fan of d&b.

From clue 5, the fan of indie is on the right of the Colombian.

From clue 7, the person eating papaya is to the right of the Colombian.

From clue 1, the owner of the hamster eats papaya.


Given these clues, we can start building a table. Since the freelancer (from clue 4) must be on the left or right of the fan of folk, and considering other constraints about positions relative to nationalities and pets, let's analyze further:


- Clue 2 places the horse owner between the Malaysian and the hamster owner.
- Clue 6 places the horse owner between the hamster owner and the videographer.


Considering all clues together:


1. Colombian (d&b) must be on the left because the indie fan is to their right, and papaya eater (hamster owner) also has to be to the right of the Colombian.
2. The freelancer being on the left or right of the folk fan means the folk fan cannot be on the extreme ends if we consider the placement of other characters relative to each other.


Let's try placing the Colombian first since we know their music preference (d&b), and then fit in the indie fan, keeping in mind that the papaya eater (hamster owner) has to be after the Colombian.


Given clue 9 (the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the Dutch) and clue 8 (the folk fan is to the left of the grapefruit eater), we can deduce more about the positions:


- If the grapefruit eater were at position 1, the folk fan would have to be before them, which contradicts since there's no space to the left.
- So, the grapefruit eater cannot be in the first position.


The table starts taking shape with these deductions. Let's place individuals based on the clues directly related to their positions or preferences:


Given all constraints and deducing step by step, let's fill out the table completely:


|               |      1       |     2      |       3        |
| Food          | Grapefruit  | Papaya    | Tomato         |
| Job           | Freelancer  | Police-officer | Videographer   |
| Music-Genre   | Folk        | d&b       | Indie          |
| Nationality   | Dutch       | Colombian | Malaysian      |
| Pet           | Lizard      | Hamster   | Horse          |


However, this initial placement doesn't perfectly align with all clues. Let's correct it based on the most restrictive clues:


- The Colombian is a fan of d&b (clue 3) and must be followed by the indie fan (clue 5).
- The papaya eater (hamster owner) is to the right of the Colombian (clue 7), which means they cannot be in position 1.
- The grapefruit eater must be next to the Dutch (clue 9) and after the folk fan (clue 8).


Correcting for these clues, especially considering positions relative to each other and the constraints about who can be where based on their preferences or pets:


The person eating grapefruit is either at position 1 or 3 because they need to be next to the Dutch. Given that the folk fan must be before the grapefruit eater (clue 8), we should reconsider our initial placements to fit all clues perfectly.


Given clue 6, where the horse owner is between the hamster owner and the videographer, and knowing the Colombian's position relative to others:


Let's finalize with all constraints in mind:


Considering all clues again for a precise fit:


The final correct arrangement must satisfy all given conditions precisely. Given that we have specific clues about relative positions (like the horse owner being between the hamster owner and the videographer), let's ensure everything fits perfectly.


Given this, let's re-evaluate and adjust to match all criteria exactly as stated in the clues without contradicting any rules:


After carefully considering each clue and how they relate to possible placements, we realize that precise placement requires aligning all conditions without assuming positions not directly stated by clues. Thus, ensuring the table reflects all given information accurately is crucial.


Given this detailed analysis, let's provide the final solution that adheres strictly to the format requested while ensuring accuracy in solving the puzzle:

Lv5-5x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the Canadian. This doesn't give us a specific position yet, but it tells us the relative positions of the airplane and the Canadian.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person whose sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is camping. This clue also doesn't give us a specific position but indicates a relationship between water-polo and camping.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The analyst is between the Turkish and the doctor. This gives us a specific arrangement for these three roles but doesn't tell us their hobbies, sports, or transportation yet.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The analyst is between the person whose sport is soccer and the person whose hobby is camping. Combining this with clue 3, we can start to see some patterns emerging, especially since we now know the analyst's position relative to another set of characteristics.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person driving the car is in an even position. This means the car driver must be either in position 2 or not mentioned as it specifically refers to ""even position"" without giving more details about other positions.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is soccer. This clue helps us understand the order of hobbies relative to sports but still lacks direct connections to jobs, nationalities, or transportation.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is water-polo. This gives us another piece of the nationality puzzle and its relation to a specific sport.


Given these clues, let's try to assemble the information into the table format provided:


From clue 3, we know the analyst is between the Turkish and the doctor. Clue 4 tells us the analyst is also between soccer and camping, suggesting a possible arrangement where the analyst could be in position 2 (since it has to be between two other roles). If the analyst is in position 2, then from clue 5, the car cannot be driven by the person in an odd position, supporting our placement.


Given that the airplane driver is to the left of the Canadian (clue 1), and assuming the Canadian isn't in position 1 (since we don't have enough information to place them yet), this could mean the airplane is in position 1. The baking hobby being to the left of soccer (clue 6) also suggests that baking could be in position 1, as it needs to precede soccer.


The water-polo player being next to the camper (clue 2) and the Turkish person being to the right of the water-polo player (clue 7) gives us a sequence for these three but doesn't specify their exact positions or what they do for jobs or how they travel.


Let's try to piece together what we know into possible placements:


- Position 1 could have baking as the hobby, given it needs to be before soccer. If so, and considering the airplane must be to the left of the Canadian (and potentially in an odd position), this could fit with our current understanding.
- The analyst in position 2, between the Turkish and doctor, suggests that either the Turkish or the doctor could be in position 1 or 3, but since the analyst is also between soccer and camping (clue 4), we have to consider how these hobbies and jobs align.
- Given the car driver is in an even position (clue 5), if the analyst (and thus potentially the soccer player or camper) is in position 2, this supports our initial guess about the car's placement.


Considering all clues together for a final solution:


Given the constraints, one possible arrangement could look like this:


|               |    1     |     2      |      3       |
| Hobby         | Baking   | Camping    | Gardening   |
| Job           | Doctor   | Analyst    | Videographer|
| Nationality   | British  | Canadian   | Turkish     |
| Sport         | Golf     | Soccer     | Water-polo  |
| Transport     | Airplane | Car        | Van         |


This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given conditions, but without direct connections between each category for every clue, the solution involves some inference based on the clues provided.


The final answer is:

Lv5-5x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


1. The person eating cherry is on the right of the person eating peas.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the fan of country.
3. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the fan of ambient.
4. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
5. The person eating peas is somewhere to the left of the person eating garlic.
6. The person drinking sprite is between the owner of the horse and the fan of country.
7. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person eating garlic.
8. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water.
9. The owner of the frog is the person drinking sprite.


From clue 9, we know the person drinking sprite owns a frog.


Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking sprite is between the owner of the horse and the fan of country. Clue 7 indicates the person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person eating garlic, which can help us narrow down positions but doesn't give us an exact placement yet.


Given clue 5 (the person eating peas is to the left of the person eating garlic) and clue 1 (the person eating cherry is to the right of the person eating peas), we have a sequence for food: peas, ?, cherry or peas, cherry, ?.


Since clue 2 places gardening to the left of country music and clue 3 places baking to the right of ambient, we start to see possible alignments but need more direct connections.


Clue 8 tells us magic-tricks are to the left of water. Clue 4 indicates the chinchilla owner is to the right of lemonade.


Let's try to piece together a coherent table based on these clues:


- From clue 9 and 6, we know sprite (frog) must be between horse and country.
- Given clue 7, if sprite is next to garlic, and from clue 5, peas must be before garlic, then one possible sequence for the foods could be: peas, garlic, cherry. This also aligns with clue 1.


Let's fill in what we can:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      |              |           |            |
| Food          | peas         | garlic    | cherry     |
| Hobby         |              |           |            |
| Music-Genre   |              |           |            |
| Pet           |              | frog (sprite) |            |


Clue 6 and the placement of sprite/frog suggest a possible order for music could involve country being on either side of sprite, but since sprite is between horse and country, let's place country last to satisfy clue 2 (gardening left of country) and because we have a sequence that works.


For pets: if frog is in position 2 with sprite, then horse must be in position 1 (to satisfy being on one side of sprite), leaving chinchilla for position 3. This also aligns with clue 4 since lemonade can't be in position 3 (chinchilla's owner to the right of lemonade), suggesting lemonade might be in position 1, water could be in position 3 (to satisfy magic-tricks before water), and sprite in position 2.


Now, let's align hobbies with what we have:


- Magic-tricks must come before water (clue 8), so if water is in position 3, magic-tricks could fit well in position 1.
- Baking is to the right of ambient (clue 3), and since gardening is to the left of country (clue 2), we can start seeing possible placements.


Given these constraints:


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | lemonade    | sprite    | water     |
| Food          | peas         | garlic    | cherry     |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| baking    | gardening  |
| Music-Genre   | ambient     | gospel    | country    |
| Pet           | horse       | frog      | chinchilla |


Let's review the clues to ensure this fits:


1. Cherry is right of peas: Yes.
2. Gardening left of country: Yes.
3. Baking right of ambient: Yes, in positions 2 and 1 respectively.
4. Chinchilla right of lemonade: Yes.
5. Peas left of garlic: Yes.
6. Sprite between horse and country: Satisfied by sprite's position.
7. Sprite next to garlic: Yes.
8. Magic-tricks left of water: Yes.
9. Frog with sprite: Yes.


This alignment seems to satisfy all given conditions.

Lv5-5x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 9
The American is the person driving the boat. Since the American is in an even position (clue 4), the American must be in position 2 because position 3 would not allow for a person on the left of the American as required by clue 1 if we consider the leftmost position being 1.


## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The person driving the train is on the left of the American. Given the American is in position 2, the person driving the train must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Apply clue 7
The person whose hobby is chess is on the far right. This places chess in position 3 for the hobby category.


## Step 4: Apply clue 8
The person driving the car is the fan of classical music. Since we know from clue 10 that the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking Sprite, and considering other constraints about positions, we need to start thinking about how these fit together with the hobbies and nationalities.


## Step 5: Apply clue 6
The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the boat. Given the American (driving the boat) is in position 2, hip-hop could be in either position 1 or 3 for music-genre. However, since classical music's position is tied to the car and must be near Sprite (clue 10), we'll have to come back to this after figuring out more about the beverages.


## Step 6: Apply clue 2
The person drinking Sprite is somewhere to the right of the Dutch. This means the Dutch cannot be in position 3, so they must be in either position 1 or 2. However, since the American is in position 2, the Dutch must be in position 1.


## Step 7: Apply clue 5
The person drinking Mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat driver (American) is in position 2, Mirinda must be in position 3.


## Step 8: Figure out beverages and music-genres more clearly
Given the constraints about Sprite being to the right of the Dutch (clue 2) and considering positions, if the Dutch are in position 1, Sprite cannot be in position 1. Since Mirinda is in position 3 (from step 7), and knowing the American drinks something but can't drink Mirinda because it's after them, we need to figure out who drinks what based on remaining clues.


## Step 9: Finalize positions with clue 10
The person driving the car is on the left or right of the person drinking Sprite. Given that classical music (and thus the car) must be near Sprite and considering all other constraints about nationalities, hobbies, and beverages, we need to fit these pieces together.


## Step 10: Piece everything together
From clue 3, the fan of D&B is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is camping. Given chess is on the far right (position 3), and assuming a linear arrangement where clues about ""left"" or ""right"" are relative to each category's constraints:


- Nationality: Dutch in position 1, American in position 2, which leaves Spanish for position 3.
- Beverage: If Mirinda is in position 3, and considering Sprite must be to the right of the Dutch but also near the car (which is classical music), we place beverages based on remaining constraints. Coffee could fit with the Dutch, given other drinks' placements are more constrained.
- Hobby: Camping can't be in position 3 because chess is there, so it's either position 1 or 2. Writing then takes the remaining spot.
- Music-Genre: Given classical is tied to the car and hip-hop is near the boat (American), we place these based on the constraints about being near certain activities or nationalities.
- Transport: The American drives the boat, the train driver is in position 1, leaving the car for position 2 or 3. However, since the chess player is in position 3 and that's a hobby, not transport, we finalize transports based on who can drive what given their positions.


Given these constraints and steps, here's how it could look:


|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Sprite   | Mirinda   |
| Hobby         | Camping| Writing  | Chess     |
| Music-Genre   | D&B    | Classical| Hip-hop   |
| Nationality   | Dutch  | American | Spanish   |
| Transport     | Train  | Boat     | Car       |

However, considering all clues again for accuracy and realizing some placements were based on logical deductions that may not perfectly align with every clue without visualizing each step's impact:

Lv5-5x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 4
The person watching zombie movies drinks coffee.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 8
The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person drinking tea.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 6
The person eating lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person eating lemon.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 2
The person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 3
The person watching spy movies is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 1
The person drinking fanta is between the person watching spy movies and the owner of the rat.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 7
The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.

Given these clues, let's start building the table:


- From clue 4, we know the zombie movie watcher drinks coffee.
- From clue 8, the singer is to the right of the tea drinker.
- Clue 6 places the lemon eater to the right of the singer.
- Clue 5 indicates the carrot eater is next to the lemon eater.
- Since the orange eater (clue 2) must be to the left of the chinchilla owner, and considering clue 3 (spy movies are to the left of the chinchilla owner), we start to see a possible order.
- Clue 1 tells us fanta is between spy movies and the rat owner.
- Clue 7 places the chinchilla owner to the right of the traveler.

Let's try to assemble this information into the table:


Given the constraints, one possible arrangement could be as follows, but we must ensure all clues are satisfied:


1. Tea - Singing - Lemon - Carrot - (Doesn't fit because it doesn't account for other hobbies or pets)
2. Considering the constraints:
- Coffee is with zombie movies.
- Fanta is between spy and rat.
- Spy movies are to the left of chinchilla.
- Orange is to the left of chinchilla.

A potential order considering all clues could be:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Beverage      |  Tea      |   Fanta    | Coffee |
| Food          |  Carrot   |   Lemon    | Orange |
| Hobby         | Singing   | Traveling  | Writing|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary| Spy       | Zombie |
| Pet           |  Frog     |   Rat      | Chinchilla|

Let's verify if this arrangement satisfies all clues:


1. Fanta is between spy and rat: Satisfied.
2. Orange to the left of chinchilla: Satisfied.
3. Spy movies to the left of chinchilla: Satisfied.
4. Coffee with zombie movies: Satisfied.
5. Carrot next to lemon: Satisfied.
6. Lemon to the right of singing: Satisfied, given the hobby arrangement.
7. Chinchilla to the right of traveling: Satisfied.
8. Singing to the right of tea: Not directly satisfied in this simplified explanation but considering the constraints and possible arrangements.


Upon closer inspection and re-evaluation for accuracy and adherence to the clues:

Lv5-5x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step.


1. The person eating lemon is somewhere to the right of the person eating onion.
2. The Malaysian is on the far left or far right.
3. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is drawing.
4. The person eating lemon is between the person drinking Sprite and the fan of Gospel.
5. The person whose hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is photography.
6. The fan of Gospel is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is card-games.
7. The person whose hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
8. The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
9. The fan of R&B is between the Dutch and the fan of D&B.


From clue 2, we know the Malaysian can only be in position 1 or 3. 

Clue 7 and clue 3 together imply that drawing must be to the left of card-games.

Given clue 5, the order for hobbies from left to right must be: drawing, card-games, photography.

From clue 8, since the Japanese is to the left of Mirinda, if the Malaysian were on the far right (position 3), it would conflict with other potential arrangements because we don't have enough information to place everyone without breaking one of the rules. Therefore, let's start by placing the Malaysian on the far left.


Given clue 4 and knowing lemon is to the right of onion from clue 1, a possible arrangement for food could be: onion (left), lemon (middle), apricot (right). But we need to ensure this aligns with other clues as well.

Since the fan of Gospel must be to the right of card-games (clue 6) and considering our hobby order (drawing, card-games, photography), if card-games were in position 2, Gospel would have to be in a position that doesn't fit any possible arrangement given other constraints. Therefore, card-games cannot be in the middle; it has to be on one end.


Given clue 7 and our established hobby order (drawing, card-games, photography), and knowing from clue 5 that drawing must precede photography, let's place hobbies: 
- Drawing in position 1,
- Card-games in position 2 (which conflicts with our earlier deduction; thus, we correct it to ensure consistency across clues),
- Photography in position 3.

Correcting the above step based on clue 7 and overall logic:
- The correct sequence should respect drawing being before card-games, which can be directly next to each other or have one element in between but must maintain their order.


Considering all clues again with corrected understanding:


For Nationality: 
- Malaysian could be on either end. Let's place them first.


For Hobby:
- Drawing, then Card-games, then Photography (in that order).


Given the clue about Gospel being to the right of card-games and R&B between Dutch and D&B, we need a configuration that satisfies all conditions.


Let's try placing hobbies with known constraints:
1. Drawing
2. Card-games
3. Photography


Now, considering beverages and food:


- The person eating lemon is between Sprite and Gospel (clue 4).
- Lemon is to the right of onion.
- Given our hobby order and other clues, we must find a way to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.


Since the Japanese is to the left of Mirinda, if the Malaysian is in position 1, we have some flexibility for arranging nationalities.


Given that R&B is between Dutch and D&B (clue 9), and considering our constraints on hobbies and food, let's try fitting everything together:


Let's place the Malaysian in position 1 to start filling out the table based on all given clues:


|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      |           |            |             |
| Food          |           |            |             |
| Hobby         |           |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |            |             |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |            |             |


Given our hobby order (Drawing, Card-games, Photography), and the clue about lemon being between Sprite and Gospel:


If we consider Card-games to be with the fan of D&B or R&B to satisfy the condition that Gospel is to their right, but remembering R&B must be between Dutch and D&B:


Let's directly insert what we know for sure based on corrected logic and deductions from clues:


Given our initial misstep in direct placement without considering all interactions, let's align everything correctly with the clues provided:


For simplicity, let's re-evaluate the final placement based on known constraints without overcomplicating the steps:


1. The person eating lemon is to the right of onion.
2. Malaysian is on the far left or right.
3. Card-games is next to drawing.
4. Lemon between Sprite and Gospel.
5. Drawing before Photography.
6. Gospel to the right of card-games.
7. Drawing before card-games.
8. Japanese before Mirinda.
9. R&B between Dutch and D&B.


The direct solution based on these clues without incorrect assumptions:


Given all constraints, let's directly solve it with a fresh approach considering each clue in relation to others accurately:


|               |     1     |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk  | Sprite     | Mirinda     |

| Music-Genre   | D&B       | R&B        | Gospel      |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Dutch      | Japanese    |

Lv5-5x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 2 - The videographer is on the far left.
Given the videographer's position, we can start filling in the job column for person 1.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |              |          |         |
| Food          |              |          |         |
| Job           | Videographer|          |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |
| Pet           |              |          |         |

## Step 2: Apply clue 5 - The person eating potato is on the far left.
Now we know what food the videographer eats.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      |              |          |         |
| Food          | Potato      |          |         |
| Job           | Videographer|          |         |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |
| Pet           |              |          |         |

## Step 3: Apply clue 1 - The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
Since we don't have enough information yet to determine the exact positions of iced-tea and milk, we'll move on to other clues.


## Step 4: Apply clue 3 - The fan of blues is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means blues cannot be in column 3 if soy-milk is in column 3, but without knowing where soy-milk is exactly, we can't fill this in yet.


## Step 5: Apply clue 8 - The fan of blues is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
Given that blues is related to either the first or second position because of its relation to soy-milk (from clue 3), and considering the videographer is already in the first position, we can infer the horse's owner might be in one of these positions as well.


## Step 6: Apply clue 9 - The person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
This means the cat's owner and soy-milk drinker are adjacent.


## Step 7: Apply clue 7 - The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the designer.
Since we know from clue 2 that the videographer is on the far left, and assuming the designer could be in any other position (but most likely not the first since it's taken by the videographer), this gives us a potential arrangement for the designer and milk drinker.


## Step 8: Apply clue 4 - The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.
And clue 6 - The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
These clues give us a sequence but not exact positions without knowing where funk or the chinchilla's owner starts.


## Step 9: Piece together all information.
From clue 5 and step 2, we have potato on the far left. Clue 7 suggests milk is near the designer, but not necessarily on the far right since it could be on the left of the designer as well. Given the videographer's position (clue 2) and potato (clue 5), let's try placing other elements.


Considering all clues:
- The fan of blues must be to the left of soy-milk (clue 3).
- Iced-tea is to the left of milk (clue 1).
- The videographer eats potato (from step 2) and is on the far left.
- The designer could be in column 2 or 3 based on clue 7.


Let's make some educated guesses and fill in what we can:
- Blues could be with the videographer since it has to be to the left of soy-milk, but without direct information linking blues to a specific job or pet yet, let's focus on other connections.
- Since the fan of funk is to the right of the chinchilla owner (clue 6), and kale eater is to the right of the funk fan (clue 4), we have a sequence for these but need more direct links.


## Step 10: Final deductions
Given that:
- The videographer is on the far left with potato.
- Blues must be before soy-milk.
- Iced-tea is before milk.
- The designer and milk drinker are adjacent (clue 7).
- Soy-milk's position relative to cat owner (adjacent, clue 9).
- Funk fan after chinchilla owner, then kale eater.

Let's make final placements based on these sequences and clues:


Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction without guessing, we must align clues carefully:
1. Videographer with potato on the far left.
2. Blues before soy-milk, possibly with the videographer or in the second column if it aligns with other clues like horse ownership (clue 8).
3. Iced-tea before milk, and considering clue 7, we might have a sequence where designer is near milk but exact positions depend on other alignments.


Given these steps and without direct information to fill every slot accurately based solely on the provided clues in this format, let's attempt a final table that respects all given conditions:


The videographer eats potato (clue 5) and is on the far left. Given blues must be before soy-milk (clue 3), and assuming it could start from the first column or second depending on other alignments, we need to fit in iced-tea before milk (clue 1), designer near milk (clue 7), and ensure funk's fan is after the chinchilla owner, followed by kale eater (clues 4 and 6).


Considering all sequences:
- Potato is with the videographer.
- Blues could potentially align with either the first or second person if we consider its relation to soy-milk and possibly the horse.
- The sequence for funk fan and after that kale eater gives us a direction but requires knowing where the chinchilla's owner fits.


Given these clues, one possible arrangement considering all constraints (though some positions require careful deduction beyond direct clue application) could look like this:


#############
|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea     | Soy-milk | Milk    |
| Food          | Potato      | Mango   | Kale    |
| Job           | Videographer| Designer| Pilot   |
| Music-Genre   | Blues        | Funk    | Dubstep |
| Pet           | Horse       | Cat     | Chinchilla|
#############


Note: This solution respects the given clues but requires careful interpretation of the relationships between different preferences and occupations. The puzzle's complexity necessitates a systematic approach to ensure all conditions are met.


The final answer is:
