Lv5-5x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the Turkish person.
From clue 14, we know the Turkish person is on the far left. So, column 1 is Turkish.

## Step 2: Determine the beverage for the far right person.
From clue 15, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the far right. So, column 4's beverage is almond-milk.

## Step 3: Identify the food and beverage of column 1.
Given that clue 9 states the person drinking hot-chocolate is eating nectarine, and from clue 6, we know the person eating nectarine is to the left of the person eating pepper. Since the Turkish person is on the far left (column 1), and considering other clues about food positions relative to each other and sports, we can't directly place foods yet but note that hot-chocolate and nectarine are paired.

## Step 4: Apply clue 9 to understand the beverage and food pairing.
The person drinking hot-chocolate eats nectarine. This is a direct pairing from clue 9.

## Step 5: Use clues about sports positions relative to beverages and foods.
From clue 1, surfing is on the left or right of hot-chocolate. Clue 10 says surfing is to the right of the Russian. Since we don't have the Russian's position yet, we note that surfing can't be in column 1 because it needs to be next to hot-chocolate, which could potentially be in any column except the far right (since almond-milk is there).

## Step 6: Determine positions based on job clues.
From clue 3, the musician is to the right of the electrician. Clue 8 says the project-manager is to the right of the dressmaker. These give us relative positions but not exact columns yet.

## Step 7: Analyze nationalities and their possible positions.
Clue 11 states the German is to the right of the Turkish, and clue 13 says the Pakistani is to the right of the electrician. Given the Turkish person is in column 1, the German must be in one of the columns to the right.

## Step 8: Piece together information from all clues.
Considering clue 5 (pepper is on the left or right of sailing), clue 6 (nectarine is to the left of pepper), and clue 7 (nectarine is on the left or right of cauliflower), we start seeing possible arrangements for foods. Since hot-chocolate is paired with nectarine, and knowing that surfing must be next to hot-chocolate, we can start building a potential arrangement.

## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all given clues.
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, let's summarize what we know:
- Turkish is in column 1.
- Almond-milk is in column 4.
- Hot-chocolate is paired with nectarine (clue 9).
- Surfing is next to hot-chocolate (clue 1) and to the right of the Russian (clue 10).
- The musician is to the right of the electrician (clue 3), and the project-manager is to the right of the dressmaker (clue 8).
- German is to the right of Turkish (clue 11), and Pakistani is to the right of the electrician (clue 13).

To satisfy all conditions, a possible arrangement could be:
- Column 1: Turkish, hot-chocolate, nectarine, ice-hockey (since surfing needs to be next to hot-chocolate and ice-hockey's position is flexible as long as it's not next to pepper without satisfying other conditions).
- Column 2: Russian, juice, cauliflower, surfing (satisfies clue 10 and allows for flexibility with other clues).
- Column 3: German, soy-milk, pepper, sailing (fits with the German being to the right of Turkish and satisfies the condition of pepper being next to sailing).
- Column 4: Pakistani, almond-milk, broccoli, snowboarding (Pakistani is to the right of the electrician, which could be in column 2 or 3, but given the arrangement, this fits).

Jobs:
- Dressmaker could fit with Turkish (column 1), considering other clues about job positions relative to each other.
- Electrician then could be in column 2 (Russian), fitting with the Pakistani being to their right.
- Musician is to the right of the electrician, potentially in column 3 (German).
- Project-manager is to the right of the dressmaker, which could fit in column 4 (Pakistani).

The final answer is:

Lv5-5x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the correct arrangement of beverages, foods, hobbies, jobs, and sports for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The person whose sport is volleyball is the librarian. This gives us a direct association but does not specify the position.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The architect is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding. This clue starts to give us some positional information but still lacks specifics without additional context.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person drinking water. This introduces a relationship between food and drink but does not specify positions relative to the other clues yet.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the designer. This clue links sports with jobs but still needs more context for precise placement.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 5
The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the accountant. This clue starts to give us a positional relationship between beverages and jobs.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 6
The person whose hobby is card-games is on the far left or far right. This gives us a potential anchor point for hobbies.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 7
The person whose hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is card-games. Combined with Clue 6, this starts to build a sequence for hobbies.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 8
The person whose sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is video-games. This links sports with hobbies but needs more specific positional information.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 9
The person whose hobby is video-games is somewhere to the right of the architect. This clue starts to build a relationship between hobbies and jobs, helping with placement.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 10
The person whose hobby is video-games is somewhere to the right of the person eating carrot. This further refines the relationship between hobbies and food.

## Step 11: Apply Clue 11
The person eating radish is on the right of the person whose sport is climbing. This clue gives us a specific relationship between food and sports.

## Step 12: Apply Clue 12
The accountant is between the person whose hobby is magic-tricks and the person whose sport is climbing. This clue provides crucial positional information, linking jobs with hobbies and sports.

## Step 13: Apply Clue 13
The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person whose hobby is video-games. Given that we already know the architect drinks soy-milk (from the initial setup), this helps place the architect relative to video-games.

## Step 14: Apply Clue 14
The accountant is on the left of the person eating apple. This clue links jobs with food, providing more positional information.

Given these clues and the process of elimination and direct association:
- The librarian plays volleyball (Clue 1).
- The architect drinks soy-milk and is to the left of snowboarding (Clues 2 and 13).
- Card-games are on the far left or right (Clue 6), and since photography is to the right of card-games (Clue 7), and considering other constraints, card-games must be on the far left.
- The person drinking 7up is to the left of the accountant (Clue 5), which helps in placing the accountant.
- The architect is to the left of snowboarding (Clue 2) and video-games is to the right of the architect (Clue 9), which starts to build a sequence.
- Climbing is linked with carrot and radish (Clues 8, 11), and the accountant is between magic-tricks and climbing (Clue 12).
- Given that soy-milk is on the left of video-games (Clue 13) and the architect drinks soy-milk, we can start building a sequence: Architect (soy-milk) -> Video-games.

Combining all clues and deducing:
1. The person who likes card-games must be at one end. Given the constraints, let's place card-games at position 1 for now, as it fits with being on the far left or right and satisfies other conditions when combined with subsequent clues.
2. Since the architect is to the left of snowboarding (Clue 2) and drinks soy-milk (initial setup), and considering video-games' position relative to the architect (Clue 9) and soy-milk's position relative to video-games (Clue 13), we can infer the architect is likely at position 2, given the need for snowboarding to be after the architect and video-games after soy-milk.
3. The accountant must be between magic-tricks and climbing (Clue 12) and is on the left of apple (Clue 14), helping place the accountant relative to other elements.

Given these deductions and the necessity to satisfy all clues simultaneously:
- Position 1: Card-games, 7up (to satisfy Clue 5 and being on the far left), radish doesn't fit here due to climbing's placement needs, so let's consider apple or carrot for food here, but carrot is more likely due to its relationship with water.
- Position 2: Architect, soy-milk, snowboarding doesn't fit directly after architect without violating other clues, so magic-tricks could fit here as a hobby, satisfying the sequence and allowing for climbing to be near video-games.
- Position 3: This needs to satisfy the accountant being between magic-tricks and climbing (Clue 12), and with video-games to the right of the architect (Clue 9), it suggests a placement where the accountant can be central, allowing for climbing and its associated elements (like radish) to fit.
- Position 4: Volleyball (librarian) must be here or at another position that satisfies all clues, considering card-games' potential far-right placement and other constraints.

Finalizing based on deductions:
- Card-games at position 1 or 4. Given the need for photography to be to the right of card-games and other constraints, let's finalize card-games at position 1.
- The architect at position 2 with soy-milk.
- The sequence for sports and hobbies suggests a specific order that satisfies all clues when considering jobs and foods.

Lv5-5x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and start filling in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The person eating kale is the person watching animation movies.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 8
The person watching animation movies is the fan of country. Combining with Clue 2, we know the person who eats kale watches animation movies and likes country music.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the fan of funk.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 13
The fan of funk is on the right of the person eating spinach. This means we have a sequence: spinach, funk, mystery (in terms of food and music genre).

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 3
The person watching drama movies is on the left of the fan of blues.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 7
The person who's hobby is puzzles is between the person watching drama movies and the person who's hobby is dancing. This gives us a sequence for hobbies but not yet tied to specific foods or sports.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 4
The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 5
The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 6
The person eating lemon is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.

## Step 10: Combine Information
From Clue 11, the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating spinach. And from Clue 12, the person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

## Step 11: Finalize Positions
Given all clues, we start building the table:
- Kale is with animation and country (from Clues 2 and 8).
- Spinach must be to the left of funk (Clue 13), which is to the left of mystery (Clue 1).
- Since kiwi is to the right of spinach (Clue 11) and lemon is to the right of lacrosse (Clue 6), we can start placing foods: spinach, kale (with animation), kiwi, lemon.
- For sports, weightlifting is to the left of singing (Clue 4), soccer is to the right of climbing (Clue 5), and considering funk is to the left of climbing (Clue 10), we have a possible sequence for sports: weightlifting, lacrosse, climbing, soccer.
- Given drama is to the left of blues (Clue 3) and puzzles are between drama and dancing (Clue 7), and knowing animation is with country, we can fill in movie genres and music genres based on the clues provided.

## Step 12: Complete Table
Based on all clues:
1. The person eating kale watches animation movies and likes country music.
2. Spinach is to the left of funk (which is to the left of mystery), so a possible sequence starts with spinach.
3. Kiwi is to the right of spinach, and since lemon is to the right of lacrosse, we place kiwi and lemon accordingly.
4. Weightlifting is to the left of singing; soccer is to the right of climbing, which helps place sports.

Given all these steps and clues, let's construct a possible table:

#############

Lv5-5x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through the clues step by step, deducing information about each position in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 11
The person who's sport is baseball is in an even position. This means baseball can only be in positions 2 or 4.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 9
The photographer is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, and the photographer is the person who's sport is baseball. Since baseball must be in an even position (Clue 11), and considering the restrictions from other clues that will come into play, we start building our table with potential positions for baseball (and thus the photographer) being in either the 2nd or 4th column.

## Step 3: Consider Clues 1 and 2
The person watching comedy movies is between the person who's sport is swimming and the freelancer. Also, this person is on the left or right of the person whose sport is swimming. This indicates a close relationship between these three individuals but does not specify their exact positions without considering other clues.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 7
The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. This clue starts to give us an order for some sports.

## Step 5: Use Clue 6
The freelancer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. Given that biathlon is to the right of basketball, we start getting a sequence: Freelancer -> Basketball -> Biathlon.

## Step 6: Incorporate Clue 14
The person who's sport is basketball is the fan of folk music. This starts to fill in some specifics about the individuals.

## Step 7: Apply Clues 3 and 5
The videographer is on the left of the Japanese, and the videographer is somewhere to the right of the British. This means we have a sequence for nationalities that includes British -> Videographer -> Japanese, but we need more information to place them exactly.

## Step 8: Consider Clue 10
The Spanish is the person watching horror movies. This gives us a specific movie genre linked to a nationality.

## Step 9: Apply Clues 12 and 8
The person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the mechanic, and the photographer is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the photographer's sport is baseball (and must be in an even position), this starts to solidify some positions.

## Step 10: Use Clue 13
The fan of country music is between the freelancer and the fan of reggae. This clue helps us place music genres relative to jobs.

## Step 11: Synthesize All Information
Given all clues, we must synthesize them into a coherent table. The critical steps involve placing individuals based on job, movie genre, music genre, nationality, and sport, ensuring that all conditions are met.

Lv5-5x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 1, the American is on the far right, so:


|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Nationality   |           |         |         | American   |
| Pet           |           |         |         |            |
| Transport     |           |         |         |            |


From clue 10, the person driving the jet-ski is on the far right. Since the American is already on the far right (from clue 1), we combine these:


|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Nationality   |           |         |         | American   |
| Pet           |           |         |         |            |
| Transport     |           |         |         | jet-ski    |


From clue 5, the person driving the bike is on the left of the American. Given the jet-ski's position (from clue 10), we adjust our understanding: the bike must be to the left of the American but considering the jet-ski is at position 4, it means the bike cannot be in position 4. Clue 8 says the bike is between the subway and dubstep, so it likely occupies either position 1 or 2 since it has to be on the left side.


From clue 2, the Italian is in an even position, which could mean positions 2 or 4. However, given that the American (and thus the jet-ski) is at position 4, and considering other clues about positions, the Italian must be in position 2 to satisfy being in an even position and not conflicting with the Spanish being to their right.


From clue 3, the Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is likely in position 2 (to satisfy the conditions), the Spanish could be in either position 3 or 4 but given that the American is at position 4 and there are specific movie preferences associated with nationalities, we need to place them carefully.


From clue 11, the Spanish watches romance movies. Knowing this doesn't directly tell us their transport or music preference yet, but it helps narrow down options for movie-genre distribution.


Given these clues and considering the bike's position relative to the American (clue 5) and the jet-ski at position 4, a likely early setup could be:


|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Nationality   |           | Italian |         | American   |
| Pet           |           |         |         |            |
| Transport     | bike      |         |         | jet-ski    |


However, we must integrate all clues. Clue 8 indicates the bike is between the subway and dubstep. This means position 1 could have the subway (since it's on the left of the bike), which fits with our setup:


|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |           | dubstep |         |            |
| Nationality   |           | Italian |         | American   |
| Pet           |           |         |         |            |
| Transport     | subway    | bike    |         | jet-ski    |


Clue 9 says the owner of the rat is on the right of the person driving the bike, suggesting position 3 for the rat. Clue 4 indicates the dog's owner is to the right of the blues fan, and clue 6 says the cat's owner is to the right of the hamster's owner. These pet clues need careful placement considering the nationalities and transports.


Clue 12 states the blues fan is to the right of the indie fan. This, combined with clue 8 (bike between subway and dubstep), starts to give us a clearer picture for music-genre distribution.


Given all these considerations and knowing we have to place epic, romance, scientific, disaster movies; blues, dubstep, indie, punk music; American, Colombian, Italian, Spanish nationalities; cat, dog, hamster, rat pets; and bike, jet-ski, subway, trike transports, let's integrate the information step by step with the clues.


Since the Spanish is to the right of the Italian (clue 3) and watches romance movies (clue 11), but considering the American is at position 4, we deduce:


- The Italian must be in an even position not occupied by the American, which means position 2.
- The Spanish, being to the right of the Italian, could fit into position 3 if we adjust for all other clues.


For movie genres:
- Clue 11 places romance with the Spanish.
- Clue 13 indicates epic is between punk and disaster.


Given these clues, a more detailed approach to each category while ensuring consistency across all clues is necessary. Let's try to fill in based on direct information first:


1. **Nationality**: Italian (2), ?, American (4). The Spanish must be in position 3 because they are to the right of the Italian.
2. **Transport**: Subway (1) seems a good fit for being before the bike, given clue 8 and the need for the bike to be on the left side but after the subway.


Considering all clues for music, pets, and ensuring each category has a unique entry per row:


- **Music-Genre** needs distribution based on clues like blues being to the right of indie (clue 12), and dubstep's relation to the bike (clue 8).
- **Pet**: The rat is to the right of the bike (clue 9), suggesting it could be with the Spanish or American, but since pets must match unique nationalities, careful placement is needed.
- **Movie-Genre**: With romance known (Spanish), and epic between punk and disaster (clue 13), we distribute these based on nationality clues.


Let's place the remaining information carefully:


|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         | Romance|            |
| Music-Genre   | indie     | dubstep |        |            |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Italian | Spanish| American   |
| Pet           | hamster   | cat     | rat    | dog        |
| Transport     | subway    | bike    | trike  | jet-ski    |


This distribution seems to fit many clues, but let's correct it based on all given information:


- The Italian is correctly in position 2.
- The Spanish watches romance movies and is correctly placed in position 3.
- The American is at position 4 with the jet-ski.
- The bike is between the subway and dubstep (clue 8), fitting our current setup.
- The rat's owner is to the right of the bike, which could fit if adjusted for other clues.


Given these considerations and ensuring each clue is satisfied:


The final distribution considering all clues might need slight adjustments for complete accuracy. However, given the complexity and the information provided:


############## Final Answer ##############
The solution that fits all given conditions precisely requires a careful match of all categories with their respective clues. Given this, let's ensure we've correctly applied each rule.


Given the constraints and clues:

Lv5-5x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.


From clue 11, we know the Colombian is watching Western movies.

From clue 9, we know the Turkish person is watching Thriller movies.

From clue 1, the Turkish person is to the right of the person drinking Soy-milk.

From clue 5, the Turkish person is to the left of the Colombian.

So, we have an order for these three: Soy-milk, Turkish (Thriller), Colombian (Western).

From clue 8, the person drinking Lemonade is to the right of the Colombian.

From clue 6, the person watching Martial-arts movies is a fan of Trance.

From clue 16, the fan of Trance has Hiking as their hobby.

From clue 12, the fan of Trance is on the left or right of the person watching Thriller movies (Turkish).

Given that the Turkish person watches Thrillers and is to the left of the Colombian, and considering clue 15 (the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance), we can start building a possible arrangement.


Clue 3 tells us the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking Hot-chocolate.

Clue 4 indicates the person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.


Let's place the known elements in the table based on these clues:


|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk    |            |               | Lemonade   |
| Hobby         |             |            |               |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             | Thriller   | Western       |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |               |            |
| Nationality   |             | Turkish    | Colombian     |            |

From clue 10, the person watching Thriller movies (Turkish) is to the right of the Polish.

So, the Polish must be in position 1, and since the Turkish is already placed in position 2 based on previous deductions:


|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk    |            |               | Lemonade   |
| Hobby         |             |            |               |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             | Thriller   | Western       |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |               |            |
| Nationality   | Polish      | Turkish    | Colombian     |            |

From clue 2, the person watching Musical movies is to the right of the fan of Blues.

Clue 14 tells us the fan of Blues is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is gardening.


Given that we have placed the Turkish (Thriller) and Colombian (Western), and knowing the order must accommodate all clues:


The French nationality hasn't been mentioned yet, so it must be in position 1 or another available spot. However, given the constraints about nationalities and hobbies, let's solidify what we can with beverages and music genres first.


From clue 13, the fan of Electronic is to the right of the person whose hobby is traveling.

Since the fan of Trance (clue 6) watches Martial-arts movies and has Hiking as their hobby (clue 16), and considering the constraints:


Let's place Filmmaking next to Hot-chocolate (clue 3) and remember Gardening must be after Filmmaking (clue 4).


Given these clues, a possible arrangement starts to emerge, but we need to carefully fit in the remaining pieces.


Since the Turkish person watches Thrillers and is also a fan of Trance (from clue 6 and clue 9), this means our initial placement needs adjustment because the Turkish cannot watch both Thriller and Martial-arts. The correct interpretation should align with all clues, including clue 12 which places Trance near Thriller.


Re-evaluating:


- Soy-milk is in position 1.
- Turkish watches Thrillers (position 2).
- Colombian watches Westerns (position 3 or 4).
- Lemonade is after Colombian.


Considering all clues again with careful attention to the constraints on hobbies, movie genres, and nationalities:


The only arrangement that fits all given conditions requires precise placement based on each clue. Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction that adheres strictly to the provided format without iterative guessing, let's finalize based on key clues:


1. **Turkish is to the right of Soy-milk**, and to the left of Colombian.
2. **Colombian watches Westerns**.
3. **Thriller watcher (Turkish) is to the right of Polish**.


With these points, and ensuring all other conditions are met (like the placement of Trance with Martial-arts and its relation to Thriller, and the order of hobbies), we can deduce:


The fan of Trance watches Martial-arts and has Hiking as a hobby. Given the constraints on nationalities and movie genres, we adjust our understanding to fit all clues.


However, without explicit step-by-step deductions for each clue in this condensed explanation, the final table that meets all conditions, given the complexity and interrelation of clues, requires meticulous alignment of each piece of information provided.


Given the instructions and the need for clarity in each step, which was not fully achieved in this response due to the complexity of directly solving without showing each intermediate logical deduction explicitly, let's focus on the critical pieces that were deduced:


The final solution must account for all clues provided. Based on the deductions made and the process outlined:

Lv5-5x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 15
The Italian is in an even position. This means the Italian can be in either position 2 or 4.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The Italian is on the right of the person driving the car. If the Italian is in position 2, there's no one to their left to drive a car, so the Italian must be in position 4, and the car driver must be in position 3 or less.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 16
The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right. This means writing could be in position 1 or 4.


## Step 4: Analyze Clues 4, 10, and 14
The person whose hobby is video-games drives the boat (Clue 4), eats cherry (Clue 10), and drinks water (Clue 14). Since the Italian is in position 4 and considering other constraints, we can start building a picture.


## Step 5: Apply Clues 3 and 11
The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the American, and the American's hobby is traveling. Given the video-games person drinks water and drives a boat, they are likely not American but could be near them.


## Step 6: Consider Clue 9
The Australian is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. This helps in placing the Australian relative to others.


## Step 7: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Considering all clues together:
- The video-games person (drinks water, eats cherry, drives boat) can't be Italian (position 4), so they might be in position 1 or 3.
- Given Clue 6 (fishing hobby between writing and boat driving), we need to fit these hobbies around the fixed positions.


## Step 8: Finalize Positions
Given all constraints:
- Position 1 could have the person whose hobby is writing, which would place video-games in position 3 or another spot that fits all clues.
- The Australian must be on the left of the cola drinker and near the Chinese (Clue 8).
- We fit the hobbies and nationalities around the transport means while adhering to food and beverage constraints.


## Step 9: Place Remaining Items
With the Italian in position 4, we place the car driver, considering all other clues about beverages, foods, and hobbies to ensure a coherent solution that respects all given conditions.


The final answer is:

From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left.
|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |

| Transport     |           | motor       |            |             |

From clue 2, the musician is on the left of the Canadian.
This doesn't give us enough information to fill in any specific positions yet.


From clue 6, the British is the architect.
Still not enough to fill in a position.


From clue 12, the person watching epic movies is the American.
And from clue 4, the person driving the car is the American.
So, we can combine these:

From clue 5, the analyst is in an odd position.
This could be positions 1 or 3.


From clue 9, the musician is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
And from clue 11, the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person watching action movies.
Given that the skydiving person is on the far left and considering other constraints, let's place the action movie watcher in position 2 for now, as it gives us more flexibility:
|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |

| Transport     |           | motor       |            | car         |

From clue 7, the person who's hobby is video-games is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the German.
And from clue 3, the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the British.
Considering clue 8 (the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies) and other placements, let's finalize some positions.


Given that the musician must be to the left of the Canadian (clue 2), and knowing the American is in position 4, the Canadian could fit into position 3. But since the British is the architect (clue 6) and must be somewhere, we need to place the British, considering clue 3 about the helicopter.


Let's try placing the British in position 2 or 3, given that the skydiving person is already on the far left. However, the British cannot be in position 4 because the American is there, and if the British were in position 1, it would conflict with clue 10 about skydiving being on the far left.


Considering all constraints, let's place the video-games hobbyist and finalize some nationalities and jobs:
- Since the skydiving person is on the far left (position 1), and considering the video-games person must be between the skydiver and the German, we could place the video-games person in position 2 or 3. But given the current setup with action movies in position 2, let's adjust our earlier assumption to fit all clues.


Let's correct the approach based on clue 7 (video-games between skydiving and German) and other constraints:
- If we place video-games next to skydiving (to satisfy being ""between"" the skydiver and the German), it would go in position 2, pushing action movies. However, given our earlier setup had baking with action, let's reconsider placements for hobbies, jobs, and nationalities.


Given that the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the British (clue 3) and other constraints:
- We must fit in the architect (British), the analyst (in an odd position), the musician (to the left of the Canadian), and ensure all other clues are satisfied.


Let's finalize with a corrected approach considering all clues systematically:


1. Skydiving is on the far left.
2. The person watching thriller movies is on the far right.
3. Epic movies are watched by the American, who drives a car.
4. The musician is to the left of the Canadian and to the right of action movies.


Given these constraints, let's place everything correctly:


|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |

Lv5-5x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 16 and its implications
From clue 16, we know the designer is the Pakistani. This immediately helps us with nationality but doesn't give us a direct position yet.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 1 for positioning
Clue 1 tells us the designer (Pakistani) is to the left of the American. Since we don't have exact positions, we'll keep this in mind for later use.


## Step 3: Utilizing Clue 14 for a fixed position
The owner of the fish is on the far right (position 4). This gives us our first fixed piece of information.


## Step 4: Considering Clue 2 and its implications for the hamster's owner
Clue 2 states the designer is to the right of the hamster's owner. Given the designer is in position 3 or less (because they are to the left of the American, and there must be space for the American), the hamster's owner cannot be in position 4 (since the fish owner is there), likely placing them in an earlier position.


## Step 5: Examining Clue 7 for the coach's nationality
The coach is Mexican. This doesn't give us a direct position but helps with nationalities.


## Step 6: Using Clues 10 and 11 to narrow down positions
Clue 10 says the Mexican (coach) is to the left of the guinea-pig owner, and clue 11 states the Pakistani (designer) is to the left or right of the pilot. Given the designer's (Pakistani) relation to other elements, we start to see a possible order.


## Step 7: Integrating Clue 12 for electrician and hamster owner
The electrician is on the left or right of the hamster owner. This clue, combined with others about positions relative to the designer and nationalities, starts to give us a clearer picture.


## Step 8: Considering food clues (3, 8) for radish and cabbage
Clue 3 says the person eating radish is to the left of the person eating cabbage, and clue 8 states this person is also to the left of the turtle owner. This helps with the food order but requires integration with other clues for exact positions.


## Step 9: Analyzing movie genre clues (4, 9, 15, 17)
Clues about movie genres give us relative positions: comedy to the left of the designer, zombie to the right of the guinea-pig owner, and satire's relation to cabbage and the designer. These help in finalizing the order.


## Step 10: Finalizing positions based on all clues
- The turtle owner is in an odd position (clue 5), likely position 1 or 3.
- Given the radish eater is to the left of both the cabbage eater and the turtle owner, and considering other constraints, we can start placing people:
1. Radish must be before cabbage, and since the turtle owner is in an odd position, let's place the turtle in position 3 for now, which would put radish in position 1 or 2.
- The guinea-pig owner must be after the Mexican (coach) but before the zombie movie watcher. The Pakistani (designer) being to the left of the American and after the satire movie watcher helps narrow down positions.


## Step 11: Placing individuals based on cumulative clues
Given all constraints:
- Position 1 could be the radish eater, which aligns with being before cabbage.
- The coach (Mexican) likely precedes the guinea-pig owner, fitting with clue 10.
- The hamster's owner must precede the designer (Pakistani), and since the electrician is near the hamster's owner, we place them accordingly.
- Zombie movies are watched by someone near the pilot, and given the Pakistani (designer) is also near the pilot or possibly is the pilot, this helps finalize positions.


## Step 12: Final placement considering all clues
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions:
1. The radish eater is before cabbage, and since turtle is in an odd position, let's finalize with the turtle not being first due to the radish eater needing to be before both turtle and cabbage.
2. The Mexican (coach) precedes the guinea-pig owner.
3. The hamster's owner precedes the designer (Pakistani), who is also the pilot or near them, considering clue 11 and others about relative positions.


The final answer is:

Lv5-5x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching fantasy movies
From clue 8, the person watching fantasy movies is on the far left or far right. We will initially place them in position 1 to start building our table.

## Step 2: Identify the sport and beverage of the person watching fantasy movies
From clue 10, we know the person whose sport is tennis drinks soy-milk. Clue 9 tells us that biathlon is to the right of tennis, but we don't have enough information yet to place them. We'll come back to this.

## Step 3: Place the animation movie watcher
Clue 4 states the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. Given the constraints and starting with fantasy on one end, let's tentatively place animation in position 3 for now, as it must be between zombie and gospel (clue 1), but we don't know where those are yet.

## Step 4: Position scientific and zombie movie watchers relative to each other
From clue 2, the person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Clue 1 places animation between zombie and gospel, but since animation could be in position 3 (as per our tentative placement), we can start building around it.

## Step 5: Position the hamster owner relative to the classical music fan
Clue 3 states the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical. This clue, combined with others, will help us determine specific placements later on.

## Step 6: Finalize the positions based on additional clues
- Clue 10 and 13 give us a sequence for soy-milk (tennis), goat, but we need more to finalize.
- Clue 14 places metal between almond-milk and handball. This gives us another piece of the puzzle but requires fitting with other constraints.
- Clue 12 says the mouse owner is on the far left or right, which might conflict with fantasy's placement if not considered carefully.

## Step 7: Synthesize all clues for a coherent solution
Considering all clues:
- Fantasy must be on one end (clue 8).
- Animation is in an odd position and between zombie and gospel (clues 1 and 4).
- Scientific is to the right of fantasy (clue 2), which means if fantasy is on the far left, scientific could potentially be in any position to its right.
- The person drinking soy-milk (tennis) must be on one end or the other due to biathlon being to their right (clue 9) and goat's owner being to their right as well (clue 13).
- Given these constraints, we can start placing:
1. Fantasy on the far left seems a good starting point.
2. Since tennis (soy-milk) must be on an end or next to biathlon, and considering fantasy is on one end, let's place tennis (and thus soy-milk) on the other end for now, as it gives us more flexibility with the remaining clues.

## Step 8: Place remaining preferences
Given the complexity and interrelation of all clues, we must ensure each clue is satisfied:
- The tea drinker is to the left of the coffee drinker (clue 7).
- Metal is between almond-milk and handball (clue 14), which will help us finalize sports placements.
- Considering fantasy on the far left, animation in an odd position (let's say 3 for simplicity), and scientific to the right of fantasy but also considering the need for zombie to be placed relative to animation and gospel, we adjust accordingly.

## Step 9: Final placement
Given all constraints:
1. Fantasy is on one end.
2. Animation is between zombie and gospel in an odd position.
3. Scientific is to the right of fantasy.
4. Tennis (soy-milk) and biathlon are on the ends or near each other, with goat's owner after soy-milk.
5. The hamster owner is before classical, which influences pet placements.
