Lv5-7x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 1
The owner of the rabbit is the chef.

## Step 2: Analyze clue 20
The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the rabbit.
From clues 1 and 20, we know the chef drinks almond-milk and owns a rabbit.


## Step 3: Apply clue 19
The person drinking almond-milk is in an odd position.
Given that there are 4 positions (1, 2, 3, 4), the odd positions are 1 and 3. Since the chef owns a rabbit and drinks almond-milk, the chef must be in either position 1 or 3.


## Step 4: Apply clue 13
The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the paramedic.
Since the rabbit's owner (the chef) is in an odd position and must be to the left of the paramedic, the chef cannot be in position 4. If the chef were in position 4, there would be no room for the paramedic to the right. Thus, the chef must be in position 1 or 3.


## Step 5: Apply clue 15
The person drinking sprite is the paramedic.
And from clue 18:
The person who's hobby is dancing is the person drinking sprite.
So, the paramedic drinks sprite and has dancing as a hobby.


## Step 6: Determine positions for chef and paramedic
Given that the chef (rabbit owner, almond-milk drinker) must be to the left of the paramedic (sprite drinker), and considering clue 19, the most likely scenario is:
- Chef in position 1 (since it's an odd position and allows for the paramedic to be to the right).
- Paramedic in position 2 or further to the right.


## Step 7: Apply clue 14
The person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's hobby is dancing and the person who's hobby is photography.
Since the paramedic (dancing, sprite) is likely in position 2 (to fit with other clues about positioning relative to others), this means:
- Position 1: Chef (almond-milk, rabbit, unknown hobby and sport)
- Position 2: Paramedic (sprite, dancing, unknown sport but not basketball since it's between dancing and photography)
Given the paramedic is in position 2, and considering clue 8 (basketball to the left of romance movies), we can start building more connections.


## Step 8: Apply clue 9
The person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is parkour.
And from clue 12:
The colombian is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the argentine.
This gives us a sequence but not yet fixed positions.


## Step 9: Analyze clues for nationality positioning
Clue 3 (argentine on the left or right of colombian), clue 6 (brazilian on the left or right of argentine), and clue 16 (brazilian on the left or right of superhero movies) help us understand the relative positions but require more information to pin down exact spots.


## Step 10: Piece together remaining clues
With so many interconnected clues, we must consider them all to find a solution that fits. Clue 21 places tennis to the left of rock-climbing, clue 2 has rock-climbing to the left of milk, and clue 7 has milk to the right of guinea-pig owner.


## Step 11: Finalize positions
Given the complexity and interconnectivity of all clues, let's summarize key findings:
- Chef (almond-milk, rabbit) in position 1.
- Paramedic (sprite, dancing) likely in position 2, given the chef's placement and need for the paramedic to be to the right.
- The guinea-pig owner must be before milk (clue 7), and rock-climbing is before milk (clue 2).
- Considering all clues about hobbies, sports, nationalities, and pets, we have to fit each person into a category that satisfies all conditions.

Lv5-7x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 8
The person eating pomegranate is on the far right. This means the fourth column will have pomegranate as its food choice.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. Since we don't know where water is yet, we'll keep this in mind for future steps.

## Step 3: Use Clue 13
The person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person eating tomato. Given that water-polo is already placed in column 2 (from the initial table), tomato must be to its left, which means tomato has to be in column 1.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 21
The person eating artichoke is the person who's sport is water-polo. This confirms that artichoke will be paired with water-polo in column 2.

## Step 5: Consider Clue 20
The person eating cherry is the person who's sport is surfing. Since we know water-polo is in column 2, and given the constraints about other sports and foods, we'll need to place surfing and cherry accordingly, keeping in mind that surfing's position will also affect where water can be placed due to Clue 7.

## Step 6: Examine Clue 3
The person whose sport is golf is in an odd position. This means golf can only be in columns 1 or 3.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 16
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person whose sport is golf. Since we're trying to place golf, and knowing that there are restrictions on other positions due to other clues, we'll have to see where golf can fit with its neighboring hot-chocolate.

## Step 8: Use Clue 1
The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the engineer. This clue will help us determine the placement of the boat and engineer once we have more information about their potential neighbors.

## Step 9: Consider Clue 4
The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile. Given that the boat's position is tied to both the engineer and the snowmobile, we need to find a spot where it can satisfy both conditions.

## Step 10: Synthesize Information
- Column 1: Tomato (from Step 3), which means water must be in column 3 or 4 (Clue 5).
- Column 2: Water-polo and artichoke.
- Given the restrictions, let's try to place golf. If golf is in an odd position and hot-chocolate is next to it (Clue 16), we need to consider where these can fit with other clues.

## Step 11: Place Golf and Hot-Chocolate
Given that column 1 has tomato and column 2 has water-polo, if golf is in column 3 (an odd position), hot-chocolate could be in either column 2 or 4. But since water-polo is already in column 2, and considering the need to place surfing and water appropriately due to Clue 7, we have to strategically decide where golf and its associated beverage can go.

## Step 12: Finalize Positions Based on Remaining Clues
- Column 1: Tomato (and thus not water), so it could be paired with a sport that isn't specified yet like surfing or golf indirectly through other clues.
- Column 2: Water-polo, artichoke.
- Column 3: Could potentially have golf if we place surfing in column 4 (since the person drinking water is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing).
- Considering all clues about positions relative to each other and the constraints provided:
1. The owner of the rat drinks milk (Clue 2), and since the person eating cherry surfs, cherry must be with surfing.
2. The journalist is to the right of the analyst (Clue 6), which helps in placing jobs.
3. The engineer is to the right of skydiving (Clue 15), affecting job placements.

## Step 13: Piece Together Remaining Information
- Given that pomegranate is on the far right, and combining all clues about relative positions:
- Column 1 could have tomato with a sport like golf or another not yet ruled out.
- Column 2 has water-polo and artichoke.
- Column 3 must have a setup that allows for the boat to be next to either the engineer or snowmobile (Clues 1 and 4), and considering surfing needs to be placed with cherry, we have to fit these elements together.

## Step 14: Determine Final Placements
Given all constraints:
- The person drinking soy-milk is in column 1 (initial table).
- Tomato is in column 1.
- Water-polo and artichoke are in column 2.
- Surfing must be with cherry, which could fit in column 4 given the need for water to be to its right (Clue 7), but since pomegranate is in column 4, surfing and cherry should actually be in column 3 to satisfy all conditions including golf being in an odd position.
- This means golf could indeed be in column 1 or column 3, but given that surfing is in column 3 with cherry, golf would fit better in column 1, paired with tomato.

## Step 15: Finalize All Positions
Considering the clues about hobbies, jobs, pets, sports, and transport:
- Column 1: Soy-milk, Tomato, Golf.
- Column 2: ?, Artichoke, Water-polo.
- Column 3: ?, Cherry, Surfing.
- Column 4: ?, Pomegranate, ?.

Given the constraints and synthesizing all information:
- The owner of the rat drinks milk (Clue 2), which helps place milk.
- The person eating cherry surfs (Clue 20).
- The journalist is to the right of the analyst (Clue 6).
- Engineer to the right of skydiving (Clue 15).

Let's finalize based on direct clues and deductions:
- Milk with rat, and since the owner of the bird is to the left of the person drinking milk (Clue 11), we can start placing these elements.
- Boat next to engineer or snowmobile, and considering all transport and job clues.

The final answer is:


Here is a simplified version based on deductions and direct clues:
1. Column 1: Soy-milk, Tomato, Golf, Skydiving, Bird.
2. Column 2: Hot-chocolate, Artichoke, Water-polo, Engineer, Boat.
3. Column 3: Milk, Cherry, Surfing, Journalist, Snowmobile.
4. Column 4: Water, Pomegranate, ?, Analyst, ?.

However, this simplified version doesn't directly solve all placements without considering each clue's impact on overall arrangements. The critical step is ensuring that each placement satisfies multiple clues simultaneously.


Given the complexity and the need for precise placement based on relative positions described in clues:
- It seems a detailed step-by-step deduction for every single element (beverage, food, sport, job, pet, transport) considering all given conditions is necessary to avoid confusion.
- Each clue affects multiple categories, making it essential to cross-reference constantly.

Lv5-7x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 10
The person eating potato is on the far right. This means the fourth column will have ""potato"" under Food.


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 6 and 10
Since the person eating potato is the Italian (Clue 6) and is on the far right (Clue 10), we can fill in the Nationality for column 4 as ""italian"".


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 17
The person eating kale is the person drinking water. This means that wherever ""kale"" is under Food, ""water"" will be under Beverage for the same person.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 5
The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person eating kale. Since we don't know where ""kale"" is yet, we'll have to come back to this clue later.


## Step 5: Analyze Clues 1 and 19
The person drinking water is on the left or right of the Italian. Given that the Italian is in column 4 (from Step 2), ""water"" must be in either column 3 or column 5, but since there are only four columns, it must be in column 3.


## Step 6: Determine Position of Water and Kale
From Steps 3 and 5, we know ""water"" is in column 3, which means ""kale"" must also be in column 3 under Food.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 5 Again
Now that we know where ""kale"" is (column 3), the person drinking 7up must be to the right of column 3, which places ""7up"" in column 4 under Beverage. However, since the Italian (who eats potato) is already determined to be in column 4 and can't drink water (because water is with kale in column 3), there seems to be a conflict based on our initial interpretation. Re-evaluating Clue 5 with all information, ""7up"" should indeed follow ""kale,"" but given the constraints about the Italian and potato, we might have misunderstood how to apply some clues directly without considering all interactions.


## Step 8: Correct Understanding of Clues
Given the complexity and potential for misunderstanding in direct clue application without visual aids or a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities, let's correct our methodology. We need to systematically eliminate possibilities based on all given clues simultaneously.


## Step 9: Systematic Approach
1. From Clue 10, potato is on the far right.
2. Clue 6 says the person eating potato is Italian, so column 4 is Italian and eats potato.
3. Clue 17 states kale = water, but we need to place them correctly considering all clues.


## Step 10: Apply All Relevant Clues Systematically
Given the constraints:
- The scientist is in an odd position (Clue 13), which could be columns 1 or 3.
- The Argentine is to the right of the scientist (Clue 12).
- Cycling is to the left of the Argentine (Clue 16).
- Considering Clues 1, 19, and 7 about water's position relative to Italian and American, water must be in column 3 because it has to be next to the Italian, and there are only four columns.


## Step 11: Final Placement
Given all clues and correcting our approach for systematic elimination:
- Column 4 is fixed as Italian, potato.
- Water (and thus kale) should be in column 3 due to its relation with the Italian and other constraints.
- The American can then be placed next to water, fitting Clue 7.


## Step 12: Movie Genre, Job, Sport, Transport
With these placements, we can start filling in movie genres, jobs, sports, and transports based on their respective clues, ensuring each clue is satisfied.

Lv5-7x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply each clue step by step, starting with those that provide the most specific information about positions and relationships between categories.


Given:
- The hobbies are magic-tricks, rock-climbing, traveling, writing.
- The jobs are coach, mechanic, scientist, software-developer.
- The movie genres are crime, fantasy, romance, western.
- The music genres are dubstep, indie, jazz, r&b.
- The nationalities are Australian, Colombian, Egyptian, Nigerian.
- The sports are cricket, skateboarding, tennis, water-polo.
- The transports are car, jet-ski, quad-bike, scooter.

## Step 1: Analyzing Positional Clues
From clue 2, the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the far right (position 4).
From clue 6, the fan of dubstep is also on the far right, which means this person's hobby must be rock-climbing because they occupy the same position.

## Step 2: Applying Hobby and Music Genre Clues
Clue 1 states the person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches western movies.
Clue 10 indicates the fan of indie music also watches western movies, implying the person with the hobby of magic-tricks likes indie music.

## Step 3: Utilizing Nationality and Job Clues
From clue 5, the Australian is in an odd position (1 or 3).
Given clue 11, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is between the person whose sport is skateboarding and the software-developer. This means magic-tricks cannot be on the far right (since rock-climbing is there), placing it likely in position 2 or 3 to accommodate being between two other categories.

## Step 4: Further Analysis with Movie Genre Clues
Clue 7 states the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car.
Clue 12 says the person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the person driving the car, giving us a potential sequence but not enough for a direct placement without considering other clues.

## Step 5: Integrating Sport and Transport Clues
From clue 9, the person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the person watching crime movies.
Clue 17 indicates the person driving the car is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter, suggesting these two modes of transport are adjacent.

## Step 6: Synthesizing Information for Placement
Considering clue 3 (writing hobby is to the right of tennis sport), clue 14 (indie fan is to the left of skateboarding sport), and knowing the dubstep fan is on the far right with rock-climbing as their hobby, we can start building a more comprehensive picture.

## Step 7: Detailed Placement
Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, let's deduce step by step:
- Rock-climbing (hobby) and dubstep (music) are in position 4.
- Magic-tricks (hobby), because it's associated with western movies and indie music, needs to be placed considering its relation to skateboarding (sport) and software-developer (job). Given the constraints, it likely fits into position 2 or 3.
- The Australian being in an odd position helps to narrow down nationalities but requires cross-referencing with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Let's place based on direct clues and deductions:
1. For magic-tricks (indie, western) not being on the far right, it could be in position 2 or 3. Considering it needs to be between skateboarding and software-developer, and given other constraints, we'll have to fit pieces around it.
2. With rock-climbing (dubstep) on the far right, and considering all clues about relative positions, we start filling in categories.

Given the detailed step-by-step analysis above and integrating all clues provided:

14. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the airplane.
15. The owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the snake.
16. The person eating spinach is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
17. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the fan of hip-hop.
18. The analyst is the Mexican.
19. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person driving the airplane.
20. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person eating papaya.


From clue 11, we know the Indonesian likes hip-hop and from clue 5 that the person who likes hip-hop eats carrot. So, the Indonesian eats carrot.


Clue 1 tells us the reggae fan is between the mouse owner and the Indonesian, but since the Indonesian likes hip-hop (not reggae), this means the reggae fan cannot be the Indonesian.


Given clue 9, the chef must be in either position 1 or 3. But we also know from clue 13 that the chef is to the right of the trike driver, and from clue 14 that the trike driver is to the right of the airplane driver. Thus, the airplane driver must be in position 1 (since the chef cannot be in an even position), making the chef's possible positions limited.


Clue 8 says the rat owner drinks cola, and clue 15 states this person is to the left of the snake owner.


Let's start filling in what we know for sure based on these clues:


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |    4    |
| Beverage      |            |               |          |         |
| Food          |            |               |          |         |
| Job           |            |               |          |         |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |         |
| Nationality   |            |               |          |         |
| Pet           |            |               |          |         |
| Transport     |            |               |          |         |


From clue 18, the Mexican is the analyst, and from clue 12, the analyst drives a bike.


Given that the Indonesian eats carrot (from clue 11 and 5), let's place them for now without assigning a position since we need more information to accurately place everyone.


We also know from clue 4 that the British person is next to the one eating carrot (Indonesian), but we don't have enough to place them yet.


Since the chef must be in an odd position and after the trike driver, let's think about how this limits our options for the chef's job and others.


Clue 2 tells us the Russian is to the right of the Fanta drinker, which doesn't give us much without knowing who drinks Fanta or where they are relative to others.


However, clue 10 indicates the mouse owner is after the airplane driver, and clue 7 says the social-worker is next to the mouse owner. This gives a sequence but not specific positions yet.


Clue 6 tells us reggae's fan is before iced-tea drinker, and from clue 3, we know this person is also before spinach eater.


Let's think about how these clues fit together:


1. Airplane driver (position 1) because the trike and chef must be after.
2. Possible positions for the reggae fan are limited since they must be between the mouse owner and Indonesian but also before the spinach eater and iced-tea drinker.


Since we know so much about relative positions but not absolute ones, let's try to place some based on what must come first:


Airplane in position 1 (due to clues about its relation to trike and chef), followed by bike (analyst/Mexican) doesn't have to be immediately after but for simplicity, let's start with this.


Given the constraints, a possible arrangement starts to emerge when considering all clues together:


For instance, if we place the airplane driver in position 1 and consider that the mouse owner must come after them but before the Indonesian (to satisfy clue 1), and knowing the chef is in an odd position after the trike driver, we can start piecing things together.


However, directly solving this puzzle step by step without assuming positions that aren't directly stated would require a systematic approach to ensure all clues are considered. Given the complexity and the interconnectivity of the clues, let's simplify our strategy:


- Start with fixed points like the airplane driver being in position 1.
- Place the Indonesian (carrot/hip-hop) relative to others based on their constraints.
- Position the reggae fan between the mouse owner and Indonesian, ensuring they're before the spinach eater and iced-tea drinker.


Directly solving this without visual aids or a more systematic step-by-step elimination process for each clue would be cumbersome. However, let's finalize a possible arrangement considering all given clues:


Given the complexity of directly calculating each step in text form without iterative refinement based on all constraints, we acknowledge that a precise solution requires cross-referencing each clue against the emerging pattern until all pieces fit.


Considering all clues and attempting to minimize assumptions, here is one way to fill out the table, keeping in mind this puzzle's complexity might allow for multiple interpretations or require further clarification:

Lv5-7x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply each clue step by step to deduce the arrangement of characteristics for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 10
The person whose sport is surfing watches fantasy movies, and this person is also a writer.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The security-guard is to the left of the person whose sport is surfing.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 7
The person whose hobby is writing is to the right of the security-guard. Since the writer (from Clue 10) is also into fantasy movies and surfing, and given the security-guard's position from Clue 5, we have a preliminary arrangement for these two individuals.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The person driving the tram is to the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Given that the fantasy movie watcher is also the writer and into surfing, this places the tram driver further to the right.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 14
The person watching time-travel movies is on the far right. This clue helps us anchor one end of our arrangement.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 1
The person eating watermelon is to the left of the person whose sport is badminton. Since we don't know the positions of these individuals relative to others yet, we'll have to come back to this after more information is deduced.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 15
The person whose sport is badminton is the pilot.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 20
The person watching epic movies is the person whose sport is ice-hockey. This connects two categories.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 9
The person watching epic movies is to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Given that epic movies are associated with ice-hockey (from Clue 20), and knowing from Clue 13 that martial-arts movies are watched by the ship driver, we start to see a connection between movie genres and other activities.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 2
The person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. This clue links another activity (movie genre) with a mode of transport.


## Step 11: Apply Clue 6
The person eating eggplant is in an odd position.


## Step 12: Apply Clue 8
The person whose hobby is filmmaking is the person whose sport is skiing.


## Step 13: Apply Clue 16
The person eating eggplant is to the left of the person watching epic movies. Given that epic movies are associated with ice-hockey, this clue helps in placing eggplant relative to other categories.


## Step 14: Apply Clue 11
The fan of indie is on the far left or far right.


## Step 15: Apply Clue 12 and Clue 17
These clues link the sport of ice-hockey with eating orange and singing, providing more connections between categories.


## Step 16: Apply Clue 18
The person eating orange is to the left of the fan of techno. This provides another connection between food and music genres.


## Step 17: Apply Clue 19
The security-guard is the fan of trance. This gives us a specific music genre for the security-guard, who we already know is to the left of the surfer (from Clue 5).


Given all these clues, let's assemble what we can:


- Security-guard (trance) is to the left of Surfer (fantasy movies, writer).
- The arrangement from Clue 3 and others suggests: Security-guard, ?, Surfer/Writer, ?, ?.
- Since Surfer is also a Writer (Clue 10), and knowing the Surfer's position relative to the Security-guard and Tram driver, we have a base to build upon.
- Martial-arts movies are watched by the Ship driver (Clue 13), who must be near the Taxi driver (Clue 2).
- Epic movies (ice-hockey) are to the right of Martial-arts (ship) but also connected through other clues.
- Given that Time-travel movies are on the far right (Clue 14), and connecting all other dots:
1. We start with the Security-guard (to the left of Surfer) as a potential starting point, but we need to fit in all other categories.


Considering the placements and connections made through the clues:


- The fan of indie is either on the far left or far right (Clue 11).
- Given that Time-travel movies are on the far right (Clue 14), and epic movies (ice-hockey) are also placed relatively far to the right due to their connection with other categories, we can start piecing together a possible arrangement.


Let's attempt to finalize based on deductions:


1. Security-guard (trance, left of Surfer) - Given Clue 19.
2. Surfer (fantasy movies, writer) - From Clues 4 and 10.
3. Since the person eating eggplant is in an odd position (Clue 6), and to the left of epic movies (ice-hockey) from Clue 16, we can consider placing eggplant relative to these positions.


Given all connections:


The solution must align with all given clues, ensuring each category matches up correctly across the different preferences and activities. Let's finalize the arrangement considering all deductions:


Given the complexity and the necessity of applying each clue methodically to avoid errors in deduction, let's summarize key points for a final table assembly:


- Security-guard is to the left of Surfer.
- Surfer is also a Writer and watches Fantasy movies.
- Martial-arts (Ship driver) is near Taxi driver.
- Epic movies (Ice-hockey) are to the right of Martial-arts.
- Time-travel movies are on the far right.


Considering all clues for a coherent assembly:


The final answer is:
