Lv5-2x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person who's hobby is baking is the person eating asparagus. This gives us a direct correlation between a food and a hobby but does not specify their position yet.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 2 and 3
Clue 2 states the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating lemon, and Clue 3 states the person eating plum is somewhere to the left of the person eating kale. This gives us a partial order: lemon -> plum -> kale.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clues 4 and 9
Clue 4 says the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing, and Clue 9 states the person eating artichoke is on the left of the person eating cranberry. This gives another partial order: artichoke -> cranberry, with writing's position relative to cranberry but not yet fixed.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clues 5, 6, and 8
Clue 5 is a repeat of Clue 1. Clue 6 states the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, and Clue 8 says the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. This gives us another relationship but does not directly relate to specific foods yet.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clues 10 and 16
Clue 10 states the person eating lemon is the person who's hobby is hiking, and Clue 16 says the person eating kale is the person who's hobby is board-games. Now we have direct correlations between foods and hobbies for lemon/hiking and kale/board-games.

## Step 6: Analyzing Remaining Clues
From Clue 7, the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Given that kale/board-games must be to the right of gardening (from Clue 8), and knowing lemon/hiking comes before plum (from Clue 2), we start building a sequence.

## Step 7: Combining Information
Given the clues about baking/asparagus, hiking/lemon, and board-games/kale, along with the orderings, we can start placing people:
- Baking must be next to writing (Clue 13) and is asparagus.
- Lemon/hiking comes before plum (Clue 2), and since lemon is also hiking, this gives us a fixed point.
- Kale/board-games follows plum (from the sequence lemon -> plum -> kale).
- Artichoke precedes cranberry (Clue 9), and cranberry must be after writing (Clue 4).

## Step 8: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
1. Lemon/hiking (10)
2. Plum's position relative to lemon (2) and before kale (3)
3. Kale/board-games (16)
4. Asparagus/baking next to writing (13), with baking on the left or right of plum (18)
5. Artichoke before cranberry (9), with cranberry after writing (4)

Given these relationships, we can deduce the order must accommodate all conditions simultaneously.


The final answer is:

Lv5-2x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The person eating cabbage is in an odd position. This means cabbage can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 6
The person eating carrot is in an odd position. This means carrot can also be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 8
The person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right. This limits zucchini to either position 1 or 7.


## Step 4: Combine Clues 3, 6, and 8
Considering cabbage and carrot must be in odd positions and zucchini must be at one of the ends, we start seeing some restrictions but need more specific clues to place them accurately.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 7
The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. If zucchini is in position 1, then almond-milk must be to its right, meaning it could start from position 2 onwards.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 11
The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating radish. This means radish cannot be in position 1 and must be to the right of zucchini.


## Step 7: Analyze Clues 9 and 12
Mirinda is to the left of hot-chocolate, and hot-chocolate is to the right of mirinda. This creates a direct sequence but doesn't specify their positions relative to other foods or drinks yet.


## Step 8: Analyze Clue 15 (and 16)
The person drinking hot-chocolate is also eating broccoli. This directly links hot-chocolate with broccoli, giving us one complete pair.


## Step 9: Analyze Clue 4
Water is on the right of broccoli. Since broccoli is paired with hot-chocolate, water must be to the right of this pair.


## Step 10: Combine All Information
Given all clues, let's try to construct a possible arrangement:


- Zucchini is at one end (let's start by placing it in position 1 since it has to be on the far left or right).
- Radish is to the right of zucchini.
- Almond-milk is to the right of zucchini but doesn't have to be directly next to it.
- Cabbage and carrot are in odd positions, but their exact placement depends on other clues.
- Mirinda and hot-chocolate (which is paired with broccoli) form a sequence where mirinda is before hot-chocolate.
- Water is after broccoli (and thus hot-chocolate).
- Iced-tea is to the right of cabbage.
- Asparagus is to the right of almond-milk.


## Step 11: Final Placement
Let's place zucchini in position 1 and start building from there:

Lv5-2x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we gather it.


## Step 1: Apply clue 1
The person driving the bike is the person who's hobby is camping.

## Step 2: Apply clue 8
The person driving the bike is in an odd position. This means the bike can be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2
The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position. This limits skydiving to positions 2, 4, or 6.

## Step 4: Apply clue 9
The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

## Step 5: Apply clue 7
The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

## Step 6: Apply clue 4
The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since the bike must be in an odd position, and considering other constraints, we start to see possible arrangements but need more information to finalize positions.

## Step 7: Apply clue 5
The person driving the trike is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. This starts to give us a sequence but requires integration with transport and hobbies.

## Step 8: Apply clue 6
The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Given that skydiving must be in an even position, and the bike in an odd, this helps narrow down their possible positions relative to each other.

## Step 9: Integrate clues for a coherent picture
- From clue 15, magic-tricks is with airplane.
- Clue 12 places tram to the left of magic-tricks, and clue 13 places tram to the right of card-games. This gives us a sequence but requires careful placement considering other clues.

## Step 10: Finalize positions based on all clues
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach to integrate all clues without overlooking any detail, let's summarize key points:
- Bike is with camping (clue 1) in an odd position (clue 8).
- Skydiving is in an even position (clue 2), and rock-climbing is next to it (clue 9).
- Board-games are to the left of bike (clue 4).
- Trike is to the left of rock-climbing (clue 5), which also helps place tram relative to magic-tricks and card-games.
- Scooter is between motorbike and writing (clue 3), with specific placement depending on other hobby and transport positions.

Given these clues, let's construct a possible solution:


|             |    1    |     2      |       3       |     4     |      5       |      6      |    7    |
| Hobby       |         |            |               |           |              |             |         |
| Transport   |         |            | motor         |           |              | quad-       |         |

From clue 15, magic-tricks is with airplane. Clue 12 and 13 suggest a sequence of card-games, tram, magic-tricks (with airplane). Considering all other clues for hobbies and transports:


A possible arrangement considering the constraints could be:


|             |    1    |     2      |       3       |     4     |      5       |      6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | board-games | skydiving | card-games   | rock-climbing | writing      | magic-tricks| camping|
| Transport   | trike      | airplane  | scooter      | motorbike   | quad-bike    | bike        | tram    |


However, we must ensure this arrangement satisfies all given clues:


1. Bike with camping: Satisfied.
2. Skydiving in even position: Satisfied (position 2).
3. Scooter between motorbike and writing: Not directly satisfied as written but considering the final placements and relative positions, adjustments might be needed for a perfect fit of all clues.
4. Board-games to the left of bike: Satisfied.
5. Trike to the left of rock-climbing: Satisfied (trike in position 1).
6. Bike to the right of skydiving: Satisfied.
7. Rock-climbing to the right of card-games: Satisfied.
8. Bike in odd position: Not satisfied as initially placed; adjustments needed.
9. Rock-climbing next to skydiving: Satisfied.
10. Motorbike with motorbike: Redundant clue.
11. Trike next to scooter: Not directly satisfied; requires adjustment for consistency.
12. Tram to the left of magic-tricks: Satisfied.
13. Tram to the right of card-games: Satisfied.
14. Tram next to rock-climbing: Could be adjusted but not directly relevant given other placements.
15. Magic-tricks with airplane: Satisfied.


Upon reviewing, there seems to have been an oversight in directly applying all clues without visualizing the direct relationships and potential conflicts between hobby and transport placements. The correct approach involves systematically applying each clue to ensure a coherent and consistent solution that respects all constraints provided.


Given the complexity of integrating all clues accurately within this format and ensuring no step or clue is overlooked, let's refine our understanding:


The final answer is:

Lv5-2x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify fixed positions from the clues.
From clue 6, drama movies are on the far right (position 7). Clue 7 places the owner of the fish in the middle (position 4). Clue 16 states the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position.


## Step 2: Determine possible positions for the chinchilla and western movies.
Given clue 16, the chinchilla could be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, since the fish (clue 7) is already in position 4, and considering other constraints about relative positions, we need to consider where the chinchilla can fit with respect to other clues.


## Step 3: Use clue 4 to associate western movies with the chinchilla.
Since the owner of the chinchilla watches western movies (clue 4) and must be in an even position (clue 16), we have to find a spot that fits with other given conditions, especially considering its relation to the snake (clue 5).


## Step 4: Place the mouse.
Clue 15 suggests the owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right. Given drama movies are already on the far right (position 7), and considering other constraints, we'll have to see which end the mouse can fit.


## Step 5: Apply clue 10 regarding the rabbit's position.
The rabbit is between comedy and drama movies (clue 10). Since drama is in position 7, this gives us a possible sequence for part of the table.


## Step 6: Integrate information about the mystery movie watcher and rat owner.
Clues 1 and 14 indicate the mystery movie watcher is to the left of the rat owner. This needs to be considered alongside other positional clues.


## Step 7: Combine all relevant clues for a comprehensive solution.
Given the constraints:
- Drama movies are in position 7 (clue 6).
- The fish owner is in position 4 (clue 7).
- The chinchilla owner watches western movies and is in an even position (clues 4 and 16).
- The mouse owner is on the far left or right (clue 15), but since drama is on the far right, the mouse could potentially be on the far left if not conflicting with other clues.
- The rabbit is between comedy and drama movies (clue 10), suggesting a possible order for these genres.
- The mystery movie watcher is to the left of the rat owner (clues 1 and 14).
- The satire movie watcher is to the right of the snake owner and to the left of the mystery movie watcher (clue 12).

Let's piece together a solution considering all constraints.


## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the complex interrelations, we need to ensure each clue is satisfied:
- The chinchilla (western movies) being in an even position and near the snake helps narrow down its possible spots.
- The fish in the middle (position 4) serves as a pivot for other placements.
- With drama on the far right and considering the rabbit's placement between comedy and drama, we can start building a sequence.

Given these constraints and working through each clue systematically:

Lv5-2x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the Brazilian and the Classical music fan.
From clue 2, the Brazilian is on the far left. Clue 7 states that the fan of classical music is also on the far left. Therefore, the Brazilian must be a fan of classical music.


## Step 2: Position the Dutch based on the Brazilian's position.
Clue 3 indicates the Brazilian is to the left of the Dutch. Since the Brazilian is at position 1, the Dutch can be at any position to the right of the Brazilian but must be before position 5 (as per clue 3), considering other clues might restrict positions further.


## Step 3: Place the Chinese and Mexican.
Clue 4 states the Chinese is to the left of the Mexican. Without specific positions yet, we note this for later use.


## Step 4: Determine the French's position and music preference.
Clue 5 says the French is in an odd position, and clue 8 indicates the French likes country music. Given the constraints, possible positions for the French are 1, 3, or 5, but since position 1 is taken by the Brazilian, the French could be at 3 or 5.


## Step 5: Position the fan of Soul.
Clue 6 states the fan of soul is to the right of the Chinese, and clue 12 says the fan of soul is on the far right. This means the Chinese cannot be in the last two positions since the Mexican must be to the right of the Chinese (clue 4) and there needs to be space for the soul fan.


## Step 6: Position the Gospel fan.
Clue 1 indicates the Japanese is to the right of the gospel fan, and clue 11 suggests the gospel fan is on the left or right of the Brazilian. Given the Brazilian's position at 1, if the gospel fan were at 2, it would fit with clue 11.


## Step 7: Position the Salsa fan.
Clue 9 says the salsa fan is to the left or right of the Japanese. This will be considered after placing the Japanese.


## Step 8: Place the Indie fan.
Clue 10 indicates the indie fan is to the right of the Dutch. This means the Dutch cannot be in the last two positions since there must be space for the indie fan.


## Step 9: Compile all clues for a possible solution.
Given all constraints:
- Brazilian (Classical) at position 1.
- Gospel's position relative to the Brazilian and Japanese.
- French (Country) in an odd position, possibly 3 or 5.
- Chinese to the left of Mexican, with Soul on the far right.
- Dutch before position 5, with Indie to their right.
- Japanese to the right of Gospel, with Salsa nearby.


## Step 10: Attempt a solution based on all clues.
Let's start filling in:
1. Brazilian (Classical)
2. ?? (Gospel) - To fit clue 11 and considering other positions, let's place Gospel here for now.
3. French (Country) - Fitting clue 5.
4. Dutch
5. Japanese - Must be after Gospel to satisfy clue 1.
6. Mexican - Since Chinese must be before Mexican and there needs to be space for the Soul fan at the end.
7. ?? (Soul)

Considering all constraints:
- The Chinese must fit before the Mexican, so let's adjust:
1. Brazilian (Classical)
2. Gospel
3. French (Country)
4. Chinese
5. Dutch
6. Japanese
7. Mexican doesn't fit here because Soul needs to be on the far right, so let's correct this with the final placement considering Salsa and Indie must also fit.


## Step 11: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the constraints:
1. Brazilian (Classical)
2. Gospel
3. French (Country)
4. Chinese
5. Dutch
6. Japanese - Must be after Gospel, so let's correct the Gospel's position considering it must be next to the Brazilian or after.
7. ?? (Soul)

Let's correctly place the remaining:
- The fan of Indie is to the right of the Dutch (clue 10), so Indie could fit at 6 if we adjust other positions accordingly.
- Salsa is near the Japanese, and since Soul is on the far right, let's place the remaining genres and nationalities.


## Step 12: Correct and finalize all positions.
Given the need to satisfy all clues:
1. Brazilian (Classical)
2. ?? - Considering clue 11, Gospel could be here or at another position that satisfies being next to the Brazilian.
3. French (Country)
4. Chinese
5. Dutch
6. ?? - This needs to fit with the Indie fan being after the Dutch and before considering the positions of Japanese, Salsa, and Soul.

Final adjustments:
- The Gospel fan can't be at 2 if we consider all other placements, so let's adjust accordingly.
- The Japanese must be after the Gospel fan but before or after Salsa.
- The Soul fan is on the far right.

## Step 1: Determine the position of almond-milk and cola
From clue 2, almond-milk is in an odd position, and from clue 3, cola is in an even position.


## Step 2: Place coffee, lemonade, and singing hobby
Clue 4 states that coffee is between lemonade and singing. This doesn't give us exact positions yet but provides a relationship.


## Step 3: Position singing and iced-tea
From clue 5, singing is on the left or right of iced-tea.


## Step 4: Place board-games relative to almond-milk
Clue 6 indicates that board-games is to the left of almond-milk.


## Step 5: Determine drawing's position relative to 7up and rock-climbing
From clue 7, drawing is to the left of 7up. Clue 1 suggests drawing is on the left or right of rock-climbing.


## Step 6: Place writing relative to rock-climbing
Clue 8 states that writing is to the left of rock-climbing.


## Step 7: Position coffee and gardening
From clue 9, coffee is on the left or right of gardening.


## Step 8: Finalize singing's position relative to collecting
Clues 10 and 11 together mean singing must be directly to the left of collecting.


## Step 9: Determine gardening's position relative to collecting
Clue 13 indicates that gardening is somewhere to the right of collecting.


## Step 10: Combine all clues for a solution
Given the complex relationships, let's start with what we know:
- Almond-milk is in an odd position.
- Cola is in an even position.
- Coffee is between lemonade and singing.
- Singing is next to iced-tea.
- Board-games is left of almond-milk.
- Drawing is left of 7up and next to rock-climbing.
- Writing is left of rock-climbing.
- Coffee is next to gardening.
- Singing is directly left of collecting.
- Gardening is right of collecting.

To satisfy all conditions, let's try placing them:
1. Board-games (can't be 1 since almond-milk needs an odd spot and there must be space for other activities).
2. Since coffee is between lemonade and singing, and given the constraints, a possible arrangement could start with lemonade or singing on one end.
3. Considering gardening's relation to collecting and coffee's position next to gardening, we can infer that gardening cannot be too far left due to its relation with collecting and coffee.

Given these constraints:
- Let's assume 7up is at the end (since drawing must be to its left), which places drawing in the 6th spot.
- Rock-climbing could then be in the 5th or 7th, but since writing must be to its left, it suggests rock-climbing is more towards the right.
- Since singing is directly to the left of collecting and coffee must be next to gardening, we have to fit these pieces together carefully.

Given all constraints:
A possible arrangement could look like this (though there are many steps to consider and placements can vary based on initial assumptions):
1. Lemonade
2. Singing
3. Iced-tea
4. Cola
5. Coffee
6. Gardening
7. Collecting doesn't fit here due to gardening's placement; reconsideration needed.

Reconsidering the clues with correct logic:
- Board-games must be left of almond-milk, and almond-milk is in an odd position.
- The person who drinks coffee is between lemonade and singing, suggesting a sequence like: lemonade, coffee, singing or singing, coffee, lemonade.
- Given that cola is in an even position and considering the other placements, we must adjust our strategy to fit all clues accurately.

Let's correct and simplify our approach focusing on key clues:
1. Almond-milk is odd, so positions 1, 3, 5, or 7.
2. Cola is even, so positions 2, 4, or 6.
3. Board-games left of almond-milk helps place them but depends on where almond-milk is.
4. Since coffee must be between lemonade and singing, this trio needs consecutive spots.

Given the complexity and my inability to draw the table directly here, let's clarify:
- The final positions will depend on satisfying all given conditions simultaneously.

From clue 6, we know the person watching horror movies is also the person driving the bike.

## Step 2: Identify the possible positions for the scooter based on clue 2 and its relation to the bike (horror movies) from clue 7.
The scooter must be in an even position, and since the bike (horror movies) must be to the left of the scooter, possible positions can start being narrowed down.

## Step 3: Place the trike according to clue 4.
The person driving the trike is in the middle, which means they are at position 4.

## Step 4: Determine the position for western movies and roller based on clues 16 and 5.
Since the person watching western movies is also driving the roller and must be in an odd position, we can start to place them relative to other positions.

Lv5-2x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of zucchini based on clue 4.
The person eating zucchini is in an even position. This means zucchini can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

## Step 2: Use clue 19 to further refine zucchini's position and its neighbors.
Zucchini is between the helicopter and radish. Since zucchini must be in an even position, it can only fit in position 4 (because if it were in 2, there would be no room for another food item before radish, and if it were in 6, there wouldn't be space after it for radish).

## Step 3: Apply clue 18 to determine the subway's position relative to zucchini.
The person driving the subway is on the right of the person eating zucchini. Given that zucchini is in position 4, the subway must then be in a position to its right.

## Step 4: Use clue 2 to further place the subway and its relation to the person eating blueberry.
The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person driving the subway, which we've established. The subway being on the right of zucchini (in position 5 or 6) means that if it's directly next to zucchini, then blueberry must be after the subway.

## Step 5: Determine the placement of radish using clue 10.
Radish is somewhere to the right of zucchini. Given zucchini's placement in position 4 and considering the possible placements of other foods and transports, radish could potentially fit into positions 5 or later if space allows.

## Step 6: Apply clue 9 to place blueberry relative to mango.
Blueberry is somewhere to the right of mango. This gives us a sequence but doesn't specify exact positions yet.

## Step 7: Use clues 1 and 7 together to start placing plum, bus, and quad-bike.
Plum is to the left of lemon (clue 5), and the person driving the bus is on the left of the person eating plum. The quad-bike is somewhere to the right of plum.

## Step 8: Combine information from clues 3, 12, and 14 to place train, peas, ship, and their relations.
The train is on the right of radish and to the left of peas. Ship is to the right of peas. This gives us a sequence but requires careful placement considering other clues.

## Step 9: Synthesize all information for final placements.
Given zucchini in position 4, we can start filling in:
- Helicopter must be before zucchini (position 3 or earlier), and radish after (5 or later).
- Subway is likely in position 5 given its relation to zucchini and the need for blueberry to follow.
- Considering plum's placement relative to lemon and the bus being on the left of plum, we place plum, then lemon, ensuring quad-bike is after plum.
- Mango must precede blueberry, fitting them into available slots that respect all relationships.

Given these complex interrelations, let's attempt a solution table:


|             |     1      |    2     |   3    |     4     |  5   |  6   |     7     |
| Food        | mango     | peas     | plum   | zucchini  | radish| lemon| blueberry |
| Transport   | bus        | ship     | helicopter| quad-bike| subway| train| van       |

| Food        | mango     | peas     | plum   | zucchini  | radish| lemon| blueberry |

Lv5-2x7-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan of trance.
2. The engineer is somewhere to the right of the bartender.
3. The electrician is the fan of folk.
4. The fan of hip-hop is between the bartender and the videographer.
5. The bartender is the fan of indie.
6. (Duplicate of 1, ignored)
7. The fan of techno is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
8. The paramedic is on the left of the fan of folk.
9. The paramedic is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
10. The fan of folk is on the left or right of the librarian.
11. The bartender is on the far left.
12. The social-worker is the fan of blues.
13. The librarian is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
14. The fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.
15. The fan of punk is on the right of the electrician.


Given the bartender is on the far left (11) and is a fan of indie (5), we start with:


|               |     1     |    2     |      3       |     4     |      5      |     6     |       7       |
| Job           | Bartender|          |              |           |             |           |               |
| Music-Genre   | Indie    |          |              |           |             |           |               |


From (4), the fan of hip-hop is between the bartender and the videographer, so the order for these three must be: Bartender, Hip-Hop fan, Videographer.


Since the engineer is to the right of the bartender (2) and considering the positions we have so far, possible positions for the engineer could be after the videographer or in place of one of the jobs if they align with other clues.


The electrician is a fan of folk (3), and from (10), the fan of folk is on the left or right of the librarian. Also, the paramedic is to the left of the fan of folk (8) and blues (9), which means the paramedic cannot be in position 1 (since it's taken by the bartender) but must be before the folk fan.


Considering (14) that the fan of trance is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno, and knowing from (7) that techno is to the left of blues, we have a sequence for these genres: Trance, Techno, Blues. Given (12), the social-worker is the fan of blues.


Also, considering (15), the fan of punk is on the right of the electrician (who likes folk), which helps in placing some genres relative to each other.


Let's try to piece together what we know about the music-genres and jobs:


- The paramedic must come before the folk fan (electrician).
- The social-worker likes blues, so they are after techno.
- Since trance is before techno (14) and techno is before blues (7), we have a sequence but need to fit in hip-hop, which is before trance (1).


The only genre not placed with a job directly or indirectly through other genres is punk. Given it's on the right of the electrician (15), who likes folk, and considering all other placements:


Given these clues and the known positions:


- Bartender (Indie) is at position 1.
- Hip-Hop fan must be between the bartender and the videographer (4).
- The paramedic is before the folk fan (electrician) (8).


Let's fill in what we can with jobs and genres, considering all clues:


1. Since the paramedic is to the left of folk (and thus electrician), and given other constraints, a possible arrangement starts to emerge.


Given all these considerations and filling in the gaps based on the provided information:


The final table looks like this:


#############
|               |     1     |    2     |      3       |     4     |      5      |     6     |       7       |
| Job           | Bartender| Paramedic| Electrician  | Hip-Hop   | Engineer    | Videographer| Social-Worker|
| Music-Genre   | Indie    | Folk     | Punk         | Trance    | Techno      | Blues      |               |

However, upon re-evaluation for accuracy and adherence to the format requested without the table directly provided in the explanation but following instructions precisely for the final answer:


Given the constraints and ensuring each clue is respected, a precise arrangement considering jobs and music genres as per clues provided would be more accurately reflected with correct genre-job matching throughout. The initial analysis aimed to dissect the problem based on given clues but might have prematurely concluded without fully integrating all possible job-genre combinations respecting every constraint.


Upon careful reconsideration of the constraints for both jobs and music genres, ensuring each clue is correctly applied:


1. Bartender (Indie) starts.
2. Paramedic's placement before folk/electrician.
3. Hip-Hop between bartender and videographer.
4. Engineer after bartender.
5. Electrician likes folk, with punk on its right.

Lv5-2x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 5
The person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right. This means Coffee can only be at position 1 or 7.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, Skydiving and Coffee are together, either at position 1 or 7.


## Step 3: Use Clue 6
The person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. This means Photography must be next to Coffee/Skydiving.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 9
The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking coffee. If Coffee is at position 1, Mirinda cannot be to its right because there's no space for other beverages and hobbies as per the clues. So, Coffee must be at position 7.


## Step 5: Determine Position of Coffee and Skydiving
Given Clue 5 and our deduction, Coffee/Skydiving is at position 7.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 1
The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person drinking cola, and the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. This means Cola must be to the left of Gardening, which in turn is to the left of Card-games.


## Step 7: Use Clue 13
The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person drinking cola. This gives us a sequence: Board-games, Cola, Gardening, Card-games.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 11 and Clue 14
Milk is to the left of Board-games and to the left of Water. So, Milk must be at position 1, followed by Board-games.


## Step 9: Deduce Position of Water
From Clue 2, Water is to the left of Card-games. Given the sequence from Step 7 and knowing Milk and Board-games occupy positions 1 and 2, Water cannot be directly next to Card-games without violating other conditions.


## Step 10: Apply Remaining Clues
- Clue 7: Traveling is to the right of 7up.
- Clue 10: Milk is to the left of Traveling.
- Clue 12: Sprite is to the right of 7up.
- Clue 15: Card-games is to the right of Water.


## Step 11: Piece Together Remaining Information
Given all deductions, let's place the remaining hobbies and beverages:
- Milk is at position 1 (from Step 8).
- Board-games must be next to Cola (Step 7), so likely positions are 2 and 3 for these two.
- Water must be before Card-games but after Milk and Board-games, suggesting a possible placement around position 4 or 5.
- Since Coffee/Skydiving is at position 7, and Mirinda is to the right of Coffee (but there's no space), our initial assumption about Coffee's position needs adjustment considering all other clues.


## Step 12: Re-evaluate Initial Assumptions
Given the complexity and potential contradictions in previous steps due to the strict format and misinterpretation of some clues, let's directly construct a solution based on key clues without violating any rules:
1. Milk (1), because it must be before Water and Traveling.
2. Board-games (2), as it is next to Cola and after Milk.
3. Cola (3), following the sequence.
4. Gardening (4), to the right of Cola.
5. Card-games (5), to the right of Gardening.
6. Water (6), because it must be before Card-games but the direct sequence was misinterpreted due to format constraints.
7. Coffee/Skydiving (7), fulfilling the far-left or far-right condition for Coffee.


The final answer is:
