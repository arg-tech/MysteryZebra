Lv5-7x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we can deduce it.


1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
2. The fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk.
3. The manager is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli.
4. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.


From clue 1, we know surfing is on the left and skydiving is on the right in terms of hobbies.

From clue 2, soul music is to the left of punk music.

Clue 3 tells us the manager is to the right of broccoli.

Clue 4 places milk to the right of ship.


Given these clues, let's start with what we know for sure and can place directly:


- Surfing must be on the left (from clue 1), which means skydiving must be on the right.
- Soul music is to the left of punk (clue 2), so soul could potentially match with surfing or another category on the left, but since we don't have direct associations yet, we'll keep this in mind.
- The manager is to the right of broccoli (clue 3), suggesting broccoli might be on the left and manager on the right.
- Milk is to the right of ship (clue 4), so if ship is on the left, milk must be on the right.


Let's start filling in based on these deductions:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              |            |
| Food          |              |            |
| Hobby         | Surfing     | Skydiving  |
| Job           |              |            |
| Music-Genre   |              |            |
| Sport         | Surfing     | Water-polo |
| Transport     | Ship        | Roller     |


Now, we need to fit in the remaining pieces:


- Beverage: Cola and Milk. Given milk is to the right of ship (and assuming ship is on the left based on our initial placement), milk should be associated with person 2.
- Food: Broccoli and Cabbage. Since the manager is to the right of broccoli, broccoli must be associated with person 1, leaving cabbage for person 2 or associated with another category that allows the manager to be to its right.
- Job: Entrepreneur and Manager. The manager is on the right (based on clue 3), so the entrepreneur could potentially fit with person 1 if it aligns with other clues.
- Music-Genre: Punk and Soul. Given soul is to the left of punk, soul should be associated with person 1.


Given these considerations:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola        | Milk       |
| Food          | Broccoli    | Cabbage    |
| Hobby         | Surfing     | Skydiving  |
| Job           | Entrepreneur| Manager    |
| Music-Genre   | Soul        | Punk       |
| Sport         | Surfing     | Water-polo |
| Transport     | Ship        | Roller     |


This arrangement respects all the given conditions:


1. Surfing is to the left of skydiving.
2. Soul music fan is to the left of punk music fan.
3. The manager is to the right of broccoli.
4. The person drinking milk is to the right of the person driving the ship.

Lv5-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The French person is to the left of the person whose sport is basketball. This doesn't give us a specific position yet but indicates a relationship between two categories.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person eating raspberry is to the left of the person watching family movies. This clue also establishes a relationship but does not specify positions.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person driving the van is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means the van driver must be in position 1 because it's the only odd number available.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The owner of the cat is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. This clue helps us understand the relative positioning concerning preferences but doesn't give us exact positions without considering other clues.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. This gives us flexibility in placing these categories but indicates they should be adjacent.


## Step 6: Combining Clues for Positioning
Given that the van driver is in position 1 (from clue 3), and considering clue 4, if the cat owner were in position 2, it would contradict clue 4 since mirinda would have to be after them. Thus, we can deduce some initial placements:


- The van must be with person 1 because of clue 3.
- Since the French is to the left of basketball (clue 1), and if we consider the van's placement and other restrictions, we start building possible arrangements.


## Step 7: Finalizing Positions
Considering all clues together:
- Van in position 1 (odd position).
- French to the left of basketball.
- Raspberry eater to the left of family movie watcher.
- Cat owner to the left of mirinda drinker.
- Raspberry and snake owners adjacent.

Given these constraints, let's fill out a possible arrangement:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | mirinda    |
| Food          | raspberry     | spinach    |
| Movie-Genre   | satire        | family     |
| Nationality   | french        | russian    |
| Pet           | cat           | snake      |
| Sport         | biathlon      | basketball |
| Transport     | van           | skateboard |

This arrangement respects all given clues.


The final answer is:

Lv5-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement and apply it step by step to our table.


## Step 1: Apply Statement 2
The person driving the airplane is on the far right. This means column 2 is for the airplane.


## Step 2: Apply Statement 1
The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian. This doesn't give us exact positions yet, but it tells us the relative position of the superhero movie watcher and the Nigerian.


## Step 3: Apply Statement 5
The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since we know from statement 2 that the airplane (and thus one of the columns) is fixed on the far right, this starts to give us a sequence but still not enough for exact placement.


## Step 4: Apply Statement 3
The person whose sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is basketball. This gives another relative position but doesn't specify which column each is in yet.


## Step 5: Apply Statement 4
The owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since there are only two foods, and assuming each person eats one type of food, this statement along with others will help narrow down positions.


Given these steps, we can start filling out our table based on the clues provided:


- Airplane must be in column 2 (from statement 2).
- Superhero movies are watched by someone to the right of the Nigerian (statement 1), and since airplane is already fixed on the far right, superhero cannot be in column 2 unless the Nigerian is also in column 2, which contradicts other conditions when trying to fit all pieces together. Thus, superhero must be associated with column 2's person indirectly through another clue.
- Collecting hobby is to the left of superhero movies (statement 5), suggesting a sequence but not direct placement without considering other clues.


Let's directly apply what we know about each category and their restrictions:


1. **Food**: Carrot, Cherry
2. **Hobby**: Chess, Collecting
3. **Movie-Genre**: Family, Superhero
4. **Nationality**: Mexican, Nigerian
5. **Pet**: Dog, Ferret
6. **Sport**: Basketball, Cricket
7. **Transport**: Airplane, Trike


From statement 2, the airplane is on the far right (column 2). Statement 1 implies the Nigerian cannot be in column 2 if we are to satisfy all conditions with superhero movies being watched by someone to their right.


Considering all statements together and trying to fit them into our table without violating any rules:


- If the person watching superhero movies must be to the right of the Nigerian, and considering other constraints, a possible arrangement starts to emerge.
- The collecting hobby being to the left of superhero movies helps in fixing positions once we consider the implications of all statements together.


Given these clues and steps, let's assemble the solution table directly based on logical deductions from the given statements:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | Cherry    | Carrot   |
| Hobby         | Collecting| Chess    |
| Movie-Genre   | Family    | Superhero|
| Nationality   | Mexican   | Nigerian |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Dog      |
| Sport         | Basketball| Cricket  |
| Transport     | Trike     | Airplane |

Lv5-7x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we can.


Given:
- Beverages: iced-tea, lemonade
- Hobbies: filmmaking, puzzles
- Movie-Genres: comedy, fantasy
- Music-Genres: house, r&b
- Pets: chinchilla, fish
- Sports: badminton, weightlifting
- Transport: airplane, boat

Clues:
1. The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
3. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person driving the boat.
4. The fan of r&b is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.

Let's start filling in based on the most restrictive clues first.


From clue 4, we know:
- Badminton must be to the left of R&B.

Given this and clue 1, if comedy is next to R&B, it could either be on the left or right. But since badminton has to be to the left of R&B, and considering other constraints, let's try placing comedy in relation to badminton and R&B while keeping flexibility for other options.


Considering clue 3:
- Puzzles must be to the left of boat.

And from clue 2:
- Iced-tea is to the right of chinchilla.


Since we have multiple constraints and limited information about direct placements except for relative positions, let's deduce step by step without assuming too much:


1. Badminton is to the left of R&B (from clue 4).
2. The person who likes comedy could be on either side of R&B but given badminton must precede R&B, comedy might follow R&B or be placed with consideration of other clues.
3. Puzzles are to the left of boat.
4. Iced-tea is to the right of chinchilla.


Given these constraints and without direct references for some categories (like direct associations between hobbies, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, sports, and transport), let's analyze possible placements considering all clues:


Since ""the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the fan of r&b"" and knowing badminton precedes R&B, if comedy follows R&B, it fits. But we also need to consider where filmmaking (the other hobby), fantasy (the other movie genre), house (the other music genre), fish (the other pet), weightlifting (the other sport), and airplane (the other transport) fit.


Given puzzles are to the left of boat, if puzzles were associated with badminton (to satisfy being on the left of boat, assuming boat is not with badminton directly but could be with another activity), this leaves flexibility for other combinations.


A direct solution requires making some educated guesses based on the constraints. Since there's no straightforward step without considering multiple factors at once, let's try combining information:


If we consider that each person has a unique set of preferences (one hobby, one movie genre, one music genre, one pet, one sport, and one transport), and given the clues:


- Badminton is before R&B.
- Comedy could be next to R&B but must also consider other placements based on hobbies, pets, etc.


Let's attempt a possible combination considering all factors:


Given the complexity and without making assumptions beyond the provided clues, here's an attempt at combining the information into a coherent table. However, note that multiple solutions might exist without more specific constraints.


Considering we have to place:
- 2 beverages
- 2 hobbies
- 2 movie genres
- 2 music genres
- 2 pets
- 2 sports
- 2 transports


And clues provided:


A possible arrangement (considering the need for a logical and step-by-step deduction based on given clues) could look like this, though it requires some inferential leaps without direct associations for each category pair:


#############
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | lemonade  | iced-tea     |
| Hobby         | puzzles   | filmmaking   |
| Movie-Genre   | fantasy   | comedy       |
| Music-Genre   | house     | r&b          |
| Pet           | chinchilla| fish         |
| Sport         | badminton| weightlifting|
| Transport     | airplane  | boat         |
#############


This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given conditions:
- Badminton is before R&B (considering the music genre placement).
- Comedy is next to R&B, in this case, following it.
- Puzzles are to the left of boat, which fits if we consider puzzles with airplane or another activity not directly stated but implied through elimination.
- Iced-tea is to the right of chinchilla.


Please note, without more direct associations between categories (e.g., which hobby goes with which movie genre or pet), this solution makes some educated guesses while attempting to adhere strictly to provided clues. Other arrangements might also satisfy all conditions given the constraints."
Lv5-7x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2 - The owner of the turtle is in an even position.
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 2 is the even position, the turtle must be in position 2.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 5 - The fan of reggae is the owner of the turtle.
Since the turtle is in position 2, the fan of reggae music must also be in position 2.

## Step 3: Determine the Music-Genre for Position 1.
Given there are only two music genres (punk and reggae) and reggae is already assigned to position 2, punk must be in position 1.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 1 - The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies.
This clue implies that the person watching action movies cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no one to the right of them for the lawyer. Thus, action movies must be associated with position 1, and scientific movies with position 2.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 3 - The polish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
This means weightlifting cannot be in position 2 (since there would be no one to the right), so weightlifting must be in position 1, and parkour in position 2.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 4 - The person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
Given parkour is in position 2, sudoku must be in either position 1 or 2. Since collecting and sudoku are the hobbies and we have not yet assigned a hobby to a specific position, but know that parkour (and thus its associated elements) is in position 2, sudoku could initially seem to fit either slot based on this clue alone. However, considering other clues that have already determined some positions, we need to find a combination that fits all given information.

## Step 7: Determine the Hobby for Each Position.
Given the information from previous steps and knowing there are two hobbies (collecting and sudoku), we must assign one hobby to each position. Since we've established parkour is in position 2, and considering clue 4, if sudoku were in position 1, it would satisfy being next to parkour. However, without direct clues linking hobbies to specific positions yet, we look at the remaining information.

## Step 8: Finalize Job Assignments.
From Clue 1, since action movies are associated with position 1 and the lawyer must be to the right of the person watching action movies, the lawyer must be in position 2. Therefore, the software developer is in position 1.

## Step 9: Determine Nationality.
Given that the Polish person is to the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting (Clue 3), and knowing weightlifting is in position 1, the Polish person must be in position 2. Thus, the Pakistani person is in position 1.

## Step 10: Assign Remaining Elements.
- Hobby: Since sudoku's placement wasn't directly determined by previous steps but we know collecting and sudoku are the hobbies, and considering all other assignments, we can deduce that if parkour (position 2) is next to sudoku, then sudoku could indeed be in position 1 based on clue 4, leaving collecting for position 2. However, direct assignment based on given clues was not fully determinate without assuming the remaining elements fit around these placements.
- Pet: Already determined with turtle in position 2 and thus mouse in position 1.

The final answer is:

Lv5-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


From clue 4, we know the person drinking iced-tea is the fan of salsa. Let's start by placing ""salsa"" under Music-Genre for person 2 since we don't have enough information yet to determine their beverage or any other preferences:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |           |            |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Music-Genre   |           | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

From clue 1, the person eating plum is to the right of the person eating cranberry. This doesn't give us specific placements yet.


Clue 2 tells us the person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Again, not enough for direct placement.


Clue 3 states the fan of dubstep is to the left of the person driving the boat. Since we have salsa in column 2, dubstep must be in column 1:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |           |            |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

Clue 4 already told us the person drinking iced-tea is a fan of salsa, which we've placed in column 2. Now, from clue 5, the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea must be with salsa (column 2), disaster movies must be in column 1:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |           |            |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

Given that the person drinking iced-tea is a fan of salsa (clue 4), and knowing from clue 5 that disaster movies are to the left of iced-tea, we place iced-tea in column 2:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade | iced-tea   |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

Since lemonade is the only beverage left, it goes to column 1.


Now, considering clue 2 (camping to the right of surfing) and clue 3 (dubstep to the left of boat), we can start placing hobbies and sports. Given dubstep is in column 1, the boat must be in column 2 (because dubstep is to the left of the boat). This means quad-bike must be in column 1.


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade | iced-tea   |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     | quad-bike | boat       |

From clue 1, plum is to the right of cranberry. Given that we have a structure now, we can place cranberry in column 1 and plum in column 2:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade | iced-tea   |
| Food          | cranberry| plum       |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         |           |            |
| Transport     | quad-bike | boat       |

Now, for the hobbies and sports: We know from clue 2 that camping is to the right of surfing. Since plum (and thus salsa and iced-tea) are in column 2, we place surfing in column 1 and camping in column 2.


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade | iced-tea   |
| Food          | cranberry| plum       |
| Hobby         |           | camping    |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         | surfing   |            |
| Transport     | quad-bike | boat       |

The only sport left for column 2 is basketball, which goes well with clue 2 since camping (in column 2) is to the right of surfing (in column 1).


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade | iced-tea   |
| Food          | cranberry| plum       |
| Hobby         |           | camping    |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster  |            |
| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |

| Transport     | quad-bike | boat       |

Lastly, for the movie genre in column 2, we have horror left. It fits well since disaster (in column 1) is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea (column 2), and now horror can be associated with iced-tea.


|               |     1     |     2      |

| Music-Genre   | dubstep   | salsa      |
| Sport         | surfing   | basketball |
| Transport     | quad-bike | boat       |

The hobby ""puzzles"" is placed in column 1 as it's the only one left, and all other conditions are met.


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle, surrounded by '#############', is:

Lv5-7x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


1. The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dancer.
2. The fan of classical is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird.
3. The person drinking water is in an odd position (which means either position 1, 3, 5, etc., but since we only have two positions, it must be position 1).
4. The person whose sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
5. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the Spanish.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking water is in position 1.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water     |             |

| Sport         |            |             |
| Transport     |            |             |

From clue 1, the electrician must be to the right of the dancer. This means the dancer is in position 1 and the electrician is in position 2.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water     |             |

| Transport     |            |             |

From clue 4, since lacrosse is to the left of swimming and considering our current setup, lacrosse must be in position 1 (with the dancer) and swimming in position 2.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water     |             |

| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Swimming    |
| Transport     |            |             |

From clue 5, the helicopter driver is to the left of the Spanish. This means the helicopter must be in position 1 (since it has to be to the left of the Spanish person), and thus, the motorbike is in position 2.


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water     |             |
| Job           | Dancer    | Electrician |
| Music-Genre   |            |             |

| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Swimming    |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Motorbike   |

Now, considering clue 2 and the fact that classical must be to the left of the bird owner, and knowing that position 1 has water (dancer), lacrosse, and helicopter, we can infer that classical music belongs to the dancer in position 1 because it's the only way for classical to be to the left of the bird.


The bird cannot be with the dancer since classical needs to be to the left of the bird owner. So, the bird must be in position 2 (with the electrician), and by elimination, the rat is in position 1 (with the dancer).


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Water     |             |

| Sport         | Lacrosse  | Swimming    |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Motorbike   |

Given the remaining information:
- Fanta is left for position 2.
- The Spanish nationality must be in position 2 because the helicopter driver (in position 1) is to the left of the Spanish person.
- This leaves British for position 1.


|               |     1      |      2      |

Lv5-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 3, the van driver can be in either column 1 or 2. Since the ambient fan drives a van (clue 1), they must be in one of these positions.


Clue 2 tells us the software developer is to the left of the musical movie fan. This means if the software developer were in column 2, there would be no space for the musical fan to their right, so the software developer must be in column 1.


Given clue 5, the dancing hobbyist is to the left of the jazz fan. If the ambient fan (van driver) is also a software developer and in column 1, this setup allows for all conditions to be met without contradiction, as it satisfies clues 1, 2, and 3 directly and provides flexibility for the rest.


Clue 4 indicates the asparagus eater is to the left of the water drinker. This means the person eating lettuce must drink water because there are only two types of food and two beverages, implying a one-to-one correspondence.


Considering all clues together:


- The ambient fan drives a van (clue 1) and can be on the far left or far right (clue 3), but given other constraints, placing them on the far left (column 1) makes more sense to satisfy other conditions.
- The software developer must be to the left of the musical fan (clue 2), suggesting they are in column 1 if we consider the van driver's placement and other constraints.
- Dancing is to the left of jazz (clue 5), which can fit with the software developer being a dancer or another hobby, but given the direct information about the ambient fan and van, it suggests flexibility in arranging hobbies.


Given these considerations, let's construct a table that fits all clues:


|               |         1          |     2     |
| Beverage      |       7up          |   water   |
| Food          |    asparagus       |  lettuce  |
| Hobby         |     dancing        | traveling |
| Job           |  software-developer|   lawyer  |
| Movie-Genre   |      western        |  musical  |
| Music-Genre   |      ambient        |    jazz   |
| Transport     |        van          |    bus    |


This setup satisfies all given conditions:
1. The fan of ambient drives a van.
2. The software developer is to the left of the person watching musical movies.
3. The van driver is on the far left.
4. The asparagus eater is to the left of the water drinker.
5. The dancing hobbyist is to the left of the jazz fan.


Therefore, the solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:

Lv5-7x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Canadian.
2. The chef is the person driving the car.
3. The person watching western movies is the person whose hobby is collecting.
4. The fan of R&B is the chef.
5. The fan of R&B is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.


From clue 2 and 4, we know the chef drives a car and likes R&B.


Clue 3 tells us that the person whose hobby is collecting likes western movies.


Clue 1 places the puzzle enthusiast to the left of the Canadian. Since there are only two nationalities (Canadian and Nigerian), this means the puzzle enthusiast cannot be Canadian, as they must be to the left of the Canadian, implying the puzzle enthusiast is Nigerian.


Given clue 5, since the R&B fan (who is also the chef) must be to the left of the volleyball player, and considering the placements so far, we can start filling in the table:


- The chef likes R&B, drives a car, and cannot have puzzles as a hobby because then they wouldn't be to the left of the Canadian based on clue 1. This means the chef's hobby must be collecting (since it's the only other option), which aligns with liking western movies from clue 3.


- The person whose hobby is puzzles must like soul music (as R&B is taken by the chef), watch time-travel movies (since western is taken by the collector), and their sport cannot be volleyball because they are to the left of the Canadian, and given the chef's placement in relation to volleyball from clue 5.


- Skateboarding must then be paired with puzzles because volleyball is already determined to be on the right based on clue 5, and since the chef (who likes R&B) is to the left of volleyball, this places the volleyball enthusiast as likely not being the chef but the other person.


- The only transport left for the puzzle enthusiast (Nigerian) is the trike, as the car is taken by the chef.


Given these deductions, let's fill in the table:


#############
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | puzzles      | collecting |
| Job           | teacher      | chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel  | western    |
| Music-Genre   | soul         | R&B        |
| Nationality   | Nigerian     | Canadian   |
| Sport         | skateboarding| volleyball |
| Transport     | trike        | car        |
#############


This arrangement satisfies all given conditions. The chef (who likes R&B and western movies) is driving a car, to the left of the volleyball player, with their hobby being collecting. The puzzles enthusiast is to the left of the Canadian, fitting the Nigerian nationality, and the remaining preferences are allocated accordingly."
Lv5-7x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will go step by step through the clues provided.


1. The police-officer is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
2. The Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies.
3. The person whose sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa.
4. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
5. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.

From clue 5, we know the person on the far left drives a scooter.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 5
|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           |                |              |
| Movie-Genre   |                |              |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   |                |              |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Since the scooter is on the far left, let's start filling in other information.


## Step 2: Consider Clue 1
The police-officer must be next to the person watching musical movies. However, without knowing which column the musical movie fan is in, we can't place the police-officer yet.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. This means the person watching scientific movies cannot be in the second column (since there's no one to the right of them), so they must be in the first column, and the Indian must be in the second column.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           |                |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    |              |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   |                | Indian      |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Now, let's consider the movie genres and nationalities.


## Step 4: Deduce Movie Genre for Column 2
Given that the person watching scientific movies is in column 1, the person in column 2 must watch musical movies because there are only two movie genres mentioned.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           |                |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   |                | Indian      |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Next, we consider the job of each person.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1 Again
Since the police-officer must be next to the person watching musical movies and that person is in column 2, the police-officer must be in column 1 because there's no one to the right of column 2.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   |                | Indian      |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

The only job left is entrepreneur, which must go to column 2.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    | Entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   |                | Indian      |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Now, let's fill in the nationality for column 1.


## Step 6: Fill Nationality for Column 1
Since the Indian is in column 2, and there are only two nationalities (Argentine and Indian), the person in column 1 must be Argentine.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    | Entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    | Musical     |
| Music-Genre   |                |              |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Indian      |
| Pet           |                |              |
| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Next, consider the music genres.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 3
The person whose sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since we don't know the sports yet, let's first figure out the music genres.


Given there are only two music genres (classical and salsa), and without direct clues linking them to specific columns or jobs, we need to consider how they might fit with other clues.


## Step 8: Deduce Music Genre
Since clue 3 mentions cycling is to the right of salsa, and considering column 2 must have a music genre that allows for someone to be to its right (which isn't possible since it's the last column), we deduce that salsa cannot be in column 2. Thus, classical must be in column 2 because it doesn't conflict with any given clues about positioning.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    | Entrepreneur|

| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Now, let's figure out the pets.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 4
The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog. This means the dog must be in column 1 because if it were in column 2, there would be no one to the right of it for the hedgehog owner to be.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    | Entrepreneur|

| Sport         |                |              |
| Transport     | Scooter        |              |

Lastly, let's determine the sport.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 3 Again
The person whose sport is cycling is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since salsa is in column 1, cycling must be in column 2.


|               |       1        |      2       |
| Job           | Police-Off    | Entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific    | Musical     |

| Nationality   | Argentine    | Indian      |
| Pet           | Dog           | Hedgehog   |
| Sport         | Rowing        | Cycling    |
| Transport     | Scooter        | Helicopter |

The only sport left for column 1 is rowing, and the only transport left for column 2 is helicopter.


The final solution table is:
