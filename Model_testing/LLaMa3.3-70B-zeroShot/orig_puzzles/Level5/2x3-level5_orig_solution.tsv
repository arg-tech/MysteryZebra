Lv5-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the person who likes baseball is on either the far left (column 1) or the far right (column 3).


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the dog is to the right of the person who likes badminton. This means badminton cannot be in column 3, and since baseball must be on one of the ends, badminton has to be in either column 1 or 2.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 3
The owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the dog. This means if the dog is in column 2, the turtle must be in column 3, and if the dog were in column 1 (which would require badminton also to be in column 1 or left of it, which isn't possible given our constraints), this scenario cannot happen because badminton has to be before the dog.


## Step 3: Piece Together Information
Given that baseball must be on an end and considering clue 2 and clue 3 together:
- Badminton can't be in column 3.
- The dog's owner is after badminton, meaning if badminton were in column 1, the dog could be in column 2, which would place the turtle (and thus baseball) in column 3 to satisfy all conditions.


## Step 4: Finalize Arrangement
Considering all clues:
- If baseball were on the far left, we'd have a hard time satisfying clue 2 and clue 3 together without contradicting each other or the constraints given.
- Thus, baseball is likely on the far right (column 3), which would mean badminton could be in column 1 (to allow dog to be after it) or column 2 (but this creates a problem with where to place the turtle and still satisfy all conditions).
- Given the clues again:
    - Badminton must precede the dog.
    - The dog must precede the turtle.
    - Baseball is on one end, likely the right given our analysis.


## Step 5: Apply Logic Directly
Given baseball's placement possibilities (far left or far right) and other constraints:
- Let's consider badminton in column 1. This allows for a clean progression from badminton to dog to turtle (or any order that satisfies all conditions), with baseball being on the end.
- Baseball cannot be in column 1 if we follow this logic because it forces an impossible arrangement given the other clues.


## Step 6: Final Table Setup
Given our analysis:
- Badminton is likely in column 1 to allow for a straightforward progression that satisfies all conditions.
- The dog's owner follows badminton, placing them in column 2.
- The turtle's owner follows the dog, placing them in column 3. However, considering baseball must be on an end and our arrangement so far (badminton-dog), we see that baseball being at either end forces us to adjust based on satisfying all clues simultaneously.


## Step 7: Re-evaluate Baseball Placement
Given our constraints:
- If badminton is in column 1, the dog in column 2, and considering clue 3 (turtle after dog), this means turtle must be in column 3. Given baseball's requirement to be on an end, it seems most logical that baseball would indeed be at one of the ends, but let's correctly place all items.


## Step 8: Correct Placement
Given all clues:
- Badminton in column 1 allows for a straightforward progression.
- Dog after badminton places dog in column 2.
- Turtle after dog places turtle in column 3.
- Baseball, needing to be on an end and with the other spots filled, must fit into the remaining slot that satisfies all conditions.


The final answer is:

Lv5-2x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the person watching satire movies.
3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking cola.
4. The person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies.


Given these clues, we can start filling in the table based on the constraints:


- From clue 2 and considering the arrangement, satire cannot be in column 3 because then juice would have to be to its right, which contradicts other beverage placements. 
- Clue 4 tells us family is to the left of scientific, so a possible arrangement for genres could be Family-Satire-Scientific or Family-Scientific-Satire.
- However, since the person drinking hot-chocolate must be to the right of juice (clue 1) and considering clue 3 (juice is on the right of cola), we have an order for beverages: Cola-Juice-Hot-Chocolate.


Considering these points:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   |        |        |               |


For the movie genres, given that family must be to the left of scientific and combining this with our beverage order:


The satire movies cannot be in column 1 because then juice would not be to its right. Thus, a plausible arrangement considering all clues could be Family-Satire-Scientific for the genres.


So, we fill in the genres based on the given constraints and the already determined beverage order:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | family | satire | scientific    |


Therefore, the solution table is:

|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Beverage      | cola   | juice  | hot-chocolate |

Lv5-2x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat. This means the rat cannot be in column 3 because there's no position to the right for the hamster.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. Given that we already know the rat can't be in the third position, this means the rat must be in the second position because if it were in the first, there would be no space to the left for the mouse.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The Chinese is somewhere to the right of the Nigerian. This clue doesn't specify pets but tells us about the relative positions of nationalities.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The Russian is on the left of the Chinese. Combining this with Clue 3, we can infer a sequence for nationalities: Nigerian (if present), Russian, Chinese, or just Russian, Chinese if Nigerian is not part of the sequence due to other constraints.


## Step 5: Integrating All Clues
Given that the rat must be in the second position and considering the nationality clues:
- If we place the Nigerian in position 1, it satisfies Clue 3 (since Chinese can still be to the right) but doesn't directly help with pet placement.
- The Russian must then be in position 2 or 3 based on the sequence needed for nationalities. However, since the rat is in position 2 and we need a position for the hamster that's to the right of the rat (from Clue 1), it implies the rat's owner could potentially be Russian if the sequence allows.
- Given the mouse must be to the left of the rat (Clue 2) and assuming Nigerian is in column 1 (to fit the nationality order from Clues 3 and 4), we can place the mouse with the Nigerian, as it fits all given conditions.


## Step 6: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
- Column 1 must be Nigerian with a mouse to satisfy the mouse being left of the rat.
- Column 2 is Russian with a rat because it allows for the required sequence and placement.
- Column 3 then has Chinese, which can only pair with the hamster since the other pets are taken.


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv5-2x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person eating plum.
2. The person whose sport is biathlon is in the middle (position 2).
3. The person eating plum is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
4. The person eating corn is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is golf.


From statement 2, we know the biathlon is in the middle. Statement 3 tells us that plum must be to the right of biathlon, which places plum in position 3 since biathlon is in position 2.


Given statement 1 (corn is to the left of plum) and knowing plum is in position 3, corn cannot be in position 3. Since plum is already determined to be in position 3 based on its relation to biathlon, and considering statement 4 (corn is to the right of golf), we can deduce that corn must be in position 2 or 1 to satisfy being to the left of plum. However, since biathlon is fixed in the middle (position 2) by statement 2, corn cannot be in position 2, placing it in position 1 as the only viable option that satisfies all conditions given so far.


With corn in position 1 and biathlon in position 2, we have:


- Position 1: Corn, unknown sport
- Position 2: Unknown food, Biathlon
- Position 3: Plum, unknown sport


Given statement 4 (corn is to the right of golf), and knowing corn is in position 1, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the direct application of this rule because if corn is in position 1, it implies golf must be in a position that doesn't exist to its left. However, considering the constraints provided:


- Golf cannot be in position 2 (biathlon's position), so for corn to be ""to the right"" of golf in a logical sense given our arrangement, golf would have to be associated with plum or biathlon indirectly through the food assignments.


However, re-evaluating statement 4 with the current understanding and realizing there might have been an initial misinterpretation due to the constraints provided:


- If corn is to the right of golf, and considering the fixed positions based on other clues (biathlon in the middle), it suggests a misunderstanding since corn is already placed in position 1. Given this, let's correct our approach focusing strictly on the clues without overcomplicating them:


Given corn must be to the left of plum (statement 1) and plum is to the right of biathlon (statement 3), with biathlon fixed in the middle, we indeed have a direct placement for plum as position 3. However, considering golf's relation to corn, if corn were directly next to biathlon or on the other side, it would conflict with our established positions based on misinterpreting the ""to the right"" and ""to the left"" conditions without correctly aligning sports with foods.


Correctly interpreting statement 4 (corn is somewhere to the right of golf) implies that if corn is in position 1, golf cannot be directly associated with it but must precede it in some form. However, given our fixed positions, we should look at the sport-food combinations more flexibly:


- Corn in position 1
- Biathlon (and thus its food) in position 2
- Plum in position 3


Given these constraints and re-evaluating for clarity and simplicity in solving without overcomplicating the rules:


The sports are biathlon, golf, and soccer. The foods are corn, plum, and tomato.


If corn is in position 1 and plum in position 3, with biathlon in the middle (position 2), we can fill in the remaining spots based on the clues provided:


- Since biathlon is in position 2, its corresponding food must also be determined. Given plum is already placed to the right of biathlon, tomato becomes a candidate for position 2 or 1 since corn and plum are already assigned positions.


Given statement 4 might have been misleadingly interpreted due to the direct placements based on other clues:


- If golf must precede corn in some manner but all spots are filled with foods, we need to correctly align sports with these foods while respecting the given conditions.


Since biathlon is fixed and plum follows it, and considering corn's placement before plum (thus in position 1), we have a potential arrangement where tomato could fit with either golf or soccer since those are the remaining options not directly assigned yet.


Given the constraints:


- Position 1: Corn
- Position 2: Biathlon
- Position 3: Plum


And knowing the sports and foods must match up uniquely, let's finalize based on logical deductions from given clues without further overcomplication:


For corn being to the right of golf (if considering positions linearly), but with biathlon fixed in the middle, a direct interpretation could suggest golf is not directly next to corn if we're strictly adhering to given placements and conditions.


The final arrangement respecting all given conditions would thus consider unique pairings of sports and foods:


Given plum must follow biathlon and corn precedes plum, with biathlon fixed in position 2:


- Position 1 (Corn) could be paired with golf to satisfy ""corn is to the right of golf"" if we interpret the statement as needing golf to be associated with a different food or position indirectly.
- Position 2 (Biathlon) must then pair with tomato since plum follows biathlon, placing it in position 3.


This leaves soccer for plum, which fits all conditions without further contradiction:


###########
|         |   1    |    2     |   3    |

Thus, the puzzle's solution respects the given constraints and conditions."
Lv5-2x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze the given clues
We have three nationalities (Egyptian, Spanish, Turkish) and three means of transport (quad-bike, scooter, trike). The clues are:
1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. The person driving the trike is the Egyptian.
3. The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the Egyptian.


## Step 2: Apply the first clue
Given that the person driving the scooter is on the far left, we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   |         |          |           |
| Transport     | Scooter |          |           |


## Step 3: Apply the second clue
The person driving the trike is the Egyptian. This does not necessarily tell us the position of the Egyptian, but since the scooter is already placed on the far left, and considering clue 3, the Egyptian cannot be on the far left (since the Turkish must be to the right of the Egyptian). So, we have two possibilities for where the Egyptian could be: in the middle or on the far right.


## Step 4: Combine clues 2 and 3
Since the Turkish person must be to the right of the Egyptian, if the Egyptian were in the middle, the Turkish would have to be on the far right. If the Egyptian were on the far right, there would be no space for the Turkish to be to their right.


## Step 5: Determine the positions based on clues
Given that the scooter is on the left and its rider cannot be Turkish (since Turkish must be to the right of Egyptian), and considering the trike's rider is Egyptian, we have:
- The scooter on the far left.
- The Egyptian (on a trike) must then be in position 2 or 3. But since the Turkish needs to be to their right, they can only fit if the Egyptian is in position 2 (middle).
- This means the Spanish person must be driving the scooter (since it's on the far left and cannot be Turkish or Egyptian based on other clues).


## Step 6: Finalize the table
Given all the above:
- Position 1 (far left): Scooter, driven by a Spanish person.
- Position 2 (middle): Trike, driven by an Egyptian person.
- Since the Turkish must be to the right of the Egyptian and there's only one spot left, the Turkish person must be in position 3. The only transport left for them is the quad-bike.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |    2     |     3     |
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Turkish   |

Lv5-2x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is a fan of techno.
2. The fan of dubstep is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is dancing.
3. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is dancing.

From clue 1, we know:
- Rock-climbing is paired with techno.

From clue 2, we can infer that since dubstep must be to the left of dancing, and given there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), dubstep cannot be in position 3 because then it wouldn't be to the left of any other hobby if dancing were also at position 3. This implies:
- Dubstep is either at position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, knowing rock-climbing (and thus techno) must be to the right of dancing, we can conclude that:
- Dancing cannot be in position 3 because then rock-climbing wouldn't have a position to its right. This means dancing must be in either position 1 or 2.

Considering all clues together:
- If dancing were at position 1, dubstep would have to be at position 1 as well (to be to the left of dancing), which is impossible since they can't occupy the same space.
- Therefore, dancing must be at position 2. This means dubstep has to be at position 1 because it needs to be to the left of dancing.

Now we know:
- Position 1: Dubstep (and thus cannot be rock-climbing or techno's corresponding hobby).
- Position 2: Dancing.
- Position 3: Rock-climbing (with techno).

The only hobbies left are gardening and rock-climbing, with music genres dubstep, metal, and techno. We've established the following pairs:
- Dubstep with a hobby at position 1.
- Techno with rock-climbing at position 3.

Given dancing is at position 2, and we need to pair it with either metal (since dubstep and techno are taken), we get:
- Dancing paired with metal at position 2.

The only hobby left for position 1 (dubstep) is gardening, as rock-climbing is taken by techno at position 3.

So, the final solution table looks like this:

#############
|               |     1     |    2    |       3       |

Lv5-2x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is badminton.
2. The security-guard is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is volleyball.
3. The software-developer is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is volleyball.

From clue 2, we know the security-guard cannot be in column 3 because the person who likes volleyball must be to their right, and there's no space for another person to the right of column 3.


## Step 1: Determine possible positions based on clue 2.
Given that the security-guard must be to the left of the volleyball enthusiast, possible positions for the security-guard are columns 1 or 2. However, since skiing is to the right of badminton (clue 1), and considering the constraints, we can start building a possible arrangement.


## Step 2: Apply clue 1.
Badminton must be to the left of skiing. This means badminton could be in column 1 or 2, but since skiing has to be to its right, if badminton is in column 2, skiing must be in column 3.


## Step 3: Combine clues to narrow down possibilities.
- If the security-guard is in column 1 and likes badminton (to satisfy clue 1 and 2), then volleyball cannot be in column 1 or 2 because it needs to be to the right of the security-guard, placing it in column 3. However, this creates a conflict with clue 3 since the software-developer must be to the right of volleyball, which is impossible if volleyball is in column 3.


## Step 4: Consider all possible job and sport combinations.
Given the constraints:
- Badminton must be before skiing.
- The security-guard must be before volleyball.
- The software-developer must be after volleyball.

A feasible arrangement considering these points could be:
- Column 1: Security-guard, badminton (satisfies clue 2 and starts to satisfy clue 1).
- Column 2: Volleyball can't be here if the security-guard is in column 1 because it violates clue 2. So, this spot must be for either skiing or another sport/job combination that fits.
- Column 3: Must have a sport that is to the right of badminton (skiing) and considering volleyball's placement relative to the security-guard and software-developer.


## Step 5: Finalize based on clue 3.
The software-developer must be after volleyball. If volleyball is in column 2, then the software-developer must be in column 3, which aligns with having skiing (which must be after badminton) in column 3 as well. However, this means we need to adjust our understanding based on the direct clues.


## Step 6: Reconcile all clues.
Given that:
- The security-guard is before volleyball.
- Badminton is before skiing.
- The software-developer is after volleyball.

A solution could be:
- Column 1: Security-guard, badminton (because it has to be before skiing and allows for the guard to be before volleyball).
- Column 2: Teacher or software-developer can't be here with volleyball if we're trying to satisfy all conditions directly. Volleyball needs to be after the security-guard but before the software-developer.
- Column 3: Software-developer, skiing (since it must be after badminton and allows for the developer to be after volleyball).


## Step 7: Apply the final logic check.
Given all constraints:
- Security-guard in column 1 with badminton fits.
- Volleyball in column 2, with its corresponding job, satisfies being after the security-guard.
- Software-developer in column 3 with skiing satisfies all conditions.


The final answer is:

Lv5-2x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


From clue 2, we know the person whose hobby is drawing is on the right of the person whose hobby is reading.
This means the order for hobbies so far is: reading, drawing, ? (since drawing cannot be on the leftmost or rightmost position due to this clue).


Clue 1 tells us that the person whose hobby is drawing is on the left of the fisherman. This implies the fisherman's hobby must be baking because it's the only one left after reading and drawing are placed.


Now, combining clues 1 and 2, we have: reading, drawing, baking as the hobbies from left to right.


Clue 3 tells us that the designer is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is reading. Since reading is already determined to be on the leftmost position based on our deductions so far, this means the designer must be next to the person who reads (either directly to their left or right), but given our current arrangement (reading, drawing, baking), the only place for the designer that fits all other clues as well is to the left of reading or between reading and drawing. However, clue 4 indicates the designer is somewhere to the left of the fisherman, which means the designer cannot be to the right of reading if we consider the arrangement deduced so far.


Considering clue 4 (the designer is to the left of the fisherman), and knowing the fisherman has baking as a hobby and is on the rightmost side, it supports our earlier deduction that the designer must be associated with either the first or second position since they have to be to the left of the fisherman.


Given all clues, let's place jobs:


- The person who reads cannot be a fisherman (since the fisherman is on the right), and given the constraints about the designer being next to the reader and to the left of the fisherman, we deduce:
  - The reader could potentially be a designer if they were in the first position because it satisfies clue 3 (designer is on the left or right of the person who reads) by having them together, but this seems initially inconsistent with needing the designer to the left of the fisherman unless the designer and reader are one and the same.
  - However, considering our final arrangement for hobbies (reading, drawing, baking), if we place jobs according to the clues:
    - The designer being on the left or right of the reader, combined with the need for them to be to the left of the fisherman, suggests a configuration where the reader could indeed be the designer, satisfying both conditions directly.


Given these deductions and to satisfy all conditions without contradiction:


The final arrangement that fits all clues is:
- The person who reads is also the designer (to satisfy being on the left or right of themselves trivially and being to the left of the fisherman).
- The person whose hobby is drawing must then be a pilot, as it's the only job left that hasn't been directly associated with another hobby yet.
- The person whose hobby is baking is the fisherman.


So, the table looks like this:

Lv5-2x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person driving the airplane. This means the airplane cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space to the right for lemonade.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This implies the quad-bike must be in either position 1 or 2, as it needs to have the scooter to its right.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking coffee. This means 7up cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space to its right for coffee.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the scooter is in an odd position. Given there are three positions (1, 2, 3), this means the scooter can only be in position 1 or 3 since these are the odd positions.


## Step 5: Combining Clues for Initial Placement
From clue 2 and clue 4, if the scooter is in an odd position and must be to the right of the quad-bike, it creates a conflict because the scooter cannot be to the right of the quad-bike if it's in position 1. Therefore, the scooter must be in position 3 (the only other odd position), which means the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 2.


## Step 6: Finalizing Placement Based on Clues
Given clue 1 (lemonade is to the right of the airplane) and considering the placements from step 5, if the scooter is in position 3, the airplane cannot be in position 3. Since lemonade must be to the right of the airplane, the airplane could potentially be in position 1, but this would not work because then there's no room for lemonade to its right without conflicting with other conditions.


## Step 7: Solving for Beverages and Transport
Given that:
- The scooter is in position 3 (from step 5).
- The person drinking lemonade must be to the right of the airplane, suggesting the airplane could be in position 1 if we consider a linear arrangement without violating other rules.
- 7up is to the left of coffee.

Let's place the quad-bike in position 2 since it needs to be before the scooter (position 3), and this satisfies clue 2.


## Step 8: Final Placement
If the airplane is in position 1, lemonade could be in position 2 or 3. But given that the scooter must be in an odd position (and is in position 3), lemonade cannot be there. Thus, lemonade must be associated with the transport in position 2, which we've determined should be the quad-bike based on the order needed for the scooter and quad-bike.


## Step 9: Finalizing Beverage Placement
With lemonade in position 2 (associated with the quad-bike), the airplane can indeed be in position 1. This leaves coffee and 7up to be placed in positions that satisfy clue 3 (7up to the left of coffee). Thus, 7up must be associated with the airplane (position 1), and coffee must be associated with the scooter (position 3).


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |     1     |    2     |    3     |
| Beverage    |   7up     | lemonade | coffee   |

Lv5-2x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the mechanic based on clue 1.
The mechanic can be either on the far left (position 1) or the far right (position 3). This gives us two initial possibilities for the mechanic's job placement.


## Step 2: Analyze clue 4 to further determine the positions.
Clue 4 states that the freelancer is to the left of the mechanic. If the mechanic is in position 1, there would be no space for the freelancer to the left, so this scenario is impossible. Thus, the mechanic must be in position 3.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 to determine the relative positions of salsa and house music fans.
The fan of salsa is to the right of the fan of house. Given that the mechanic (now known to be in position 3) could be a fan of any genre, we have two main scenarios for the music genres based on this clue alone: House-Salsa or Salsa being after another genre but still to the right of House.


## Step 4: Integrate clue 3 into our analysis.
Clue 3 states that the fan of house is between the fan of salsa and the fan of reggae. Given that salsa must be to the right of house (from clue 2), this means reggae must be to the left of house because house acts as a buffer between salsa and reggae.


## Step 5: Combine all clues for final placement.
Since the mechanic is in position 3, and considering clue 4 that the freelancer must be to the left of the mechanic, we can start building our table. The engineer then must be in position 1 because it's the only job left.


Given the music genres:
- Reggae must be on one end (because house is between reggae and salsa).
- House is in the middle.
- Salsa is on the other end.

And given the jobs:
