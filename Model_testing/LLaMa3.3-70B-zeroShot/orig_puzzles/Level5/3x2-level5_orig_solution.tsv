Lv5-3x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
- There are two types of food: peas and plum.
- Two pets are kept: goldfish and pony.
- Two means of transport: bike and motorbike.
- The owner of the goldfish is to the right of the owner of the pony.
- The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas.


## Step 2: Applying the First Clue
Given that the owner of the goldfish is to the right of the owner of the pony, we can start by placing the pony on the left (1) and the goldfish on the right (2).


## Step 3: Applying the Second Clue
The person driving the motorbike is to the right of the person eating peas. Since ""motor"" is already associated with position 2 in the transport row, we can infer that the motorbike is at position 2.


## Step 4: Determining Food and Transport Associations
- If the motorbike (associated with ""motor"") is at position 2, then the bike must be at position 1.
- Since the person driving the motorbike is to the right of the person eating peas, and given that the motorbike is at position 2, peas cannot be at position 2. Therefore, peas must be at position 1.


## Step 5: Finalizing Associations
- With peas at position 1 and the bike also at position 1 (because motorbike is at position 2), we can conclude:
- Position 1 has peas (food), pony (pet), and bike (transport).
- Position 2, having the motorbike for transport, must have plum for food since peas are taken, and goldfish for the pet.


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |  1   |     2     |
| Food        | peas |    plum   |
| Pet         | pony |  goldfish |
| Transport   | bike |  motorbike|

Lv5-3x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we can follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position based on the first clue.
The person watching family movies is to the left of the person eating plum. This means the left column must be either family or martial-arts for the movie genre since it has to be next to plum (but we don't know which food or nationality yet, just that family movies are on the left and next to plum).


## Step 2: Use the second clue to determine nationality positions.
The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the Japanese. This means the Japanese person must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no space to the right for the Indonesian.


## Step 3: Combine clues to start filling in information.
Given that the family movie watcher is to the left of the plum eater and considering the positions of nationalities from clue 2, we can deduce possible combinations. Since Japanese must be on the left (column 1), if they watch family movies, then plum cannot be their food because the person eating plum would have to be further right than the family movie watcher.


## Step 4: Determine the specific foods and nationalities.
Given that there are only two options for each category, we can start eliminating based on what we know. If Japanese (in column 1) watches family movies and is next to someone who eats plum (meaning plum must be in column 2 because it's to the right of family), then Japanese in column 1 cannot eat plum.


## Step 5: Finalize food, movie-genre, and nationality for each column.
- For column 1 (Japanese), since they watch family movies (as deduced from steps before) and cannot eat plum (because plum is next to them on the right), they must eat raspberry. 
- Column 2, therefore, contains an Indonesian who eats plum and watches martial-arts movies because these are the only options left.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | Raspberry |    Plum     |
| Movie-Genre   | Family    | Martial-Arts|
| Nationality   | Japanese  | Indonesian  |

Lv5-3x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Jobs: nurse, software-developer
2. Movie genres: family, thriller
3. Sports: cricket, skateboarding

Given clues:
- The software-developer watches family movies.
- The person whose sport is skateboarding is to the right of the person who watches thriller movies.

Let's start filling in the table based on the clues:

|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           |          |                    |
| Movie-Genre   |          |                    |
| Sport         |          |                    |

From clue 1, we know the software-developer watches family movies. This doesn't tell us which column the software-developer is in yet.

|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           | ?       | Software-developer |
| Movie-Genre   | ?       | Family             |
| Sport         | ?       | ?                  |

Or, the software-developer could be in column 1:

|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           | Software-developer | ?       |
| Movie-Genre   | Family             | ?       |
| Sport         | ?       | ?                  |

Now, let's apply clue 2. The person who prefers skateboarding is to the right of the person who watches thriller movies. This means the person watching thriller movies cannot be in column 2 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in column 1.

Given this, and knowing from clue 1 that the software-developer watches family movies, we can deduce:

- If the software-developer is in column 1, then the person watching thriller movies must also be in column 1, which contradicts our setup since only one person can be in each column. Therefore, the initial assumption that places the software-developer in column 1 with family movies must be incorrect based on how we're trying to fit the pieces together.

Let's correct the approach and directly apply what we know without assuming the software-developer's position prematurely:

- The thriller movie watcher cannot be in column 2 (because skateboarding has to be to their right), so they are in column 1.
- This means family movies (and thus the software-developer) must be in column 2, as there are only two options for movie genres.

So, we have:

|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           | ?       | Software-developer |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller| Family             |
| Sport         | ?       | ?                  |

Now, since skateboarding is to the right of thriller movies, and given our current setup:

- Skateboarding must be in column 2 (to the right of thriller).
- Cricket, therefore, must be in column 1.

And finally, knowing the jobs are nurse and software-developer, and that the software-developer watches family movies (thus is in column 2), the nurse must watch thriller movies and be in column 1.

Thus, the completed table looks like this:

#############
|               |    1     |         2          |
| Job           | Nurse   | Software-developer |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller| Family             |

Lv5-3x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person whose hobby is baking is on the left of the person drinking water.
2. The person whose hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the fan of electronic music.
3. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.


From clue 1, we know the order for two items: Baking hobby is to the left of Water drinker.


Clue 2 tells us that the Baking hobby is also to the left of Electronic music fan, but it doesn't specify if Electronic music fan drinks water or cola. However, since Baking is already determined to be to the left of Water (from clue 1), and considering all combinations, we can deduce possible positions.


Clue 3 indicates Water and Cola drinkers are adjacent, which helps us place the remaining items.


Given these clues:


- Baking must be on the left.
- Water must be to the right of Baking but also next to Cola (from clue 3).
- Electronic music fan cannot be on the left since Baking is to their left (clue 2), placing them likely on the right, given that Baking and Water are already determined to have a specific relationship.


Considering all options and knowing there are only two positions:


1. The person who bakes cannot drink water because they must be to the left of the water drinker.
2. Since Electronic music fan is to the right of Baking (and considering clue 3 where Water and Cola drinkers are next to each other), it makes sense that the Electronic music fan drinks cola, as this allows Water to be adjacent to Cola while keeping Baking to the left.


The only arrangement satisfying all conditions would have Baking paired with Classical music (since Electronic is on the right) and Cola, or Water could be on either side of Cola but given Baking's placement relative to Water:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |   Cola    |     Water     |
| Hobby         |  Baking   | Rock-climbing |
| Music-Genre   | Classical |  Electronic   |


This satisfies all conditions: 
- The baker is to the left of the water drinker.
- The baker is to the left of the electronic music fan.
- The person drinking water is next to the person drinking cola.


Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############

Lv5-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.
2. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

Given these two clues:


- Since there are only two columns, ""somewhere to the left"" means the person eating grapefruit must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no one to their left.
- The person watching epic movies and the person whose hobby is singing cannot be in column 1 (since grapefruit is to their left), which means they must both be in column 2.


Now, let's fill out what we know:


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Food          | Grapefruit| Broccoli|

| Movie-Genre   |            |          |

Given the clues, the person eating grapefruit (in column 1) cannot be watching epic movies or have singing as a hobby because both of those are in column 2. This leaves reading as the only possible hobby for the person eating grapefruit and drama as their movie genre since epic is already determined to be in column 2.


For column 2, we know the person's food is broccoli, their hobby is singing (because it's to the right of grapefruit), and their movie genre is epic (also because it's to the right of grapefruit).


So, the completed table looks like this:

Lv5-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The mouse owner is to the left of the guinea-pig owner.
2. The person whose hobby is cooking is to the right of the person driving the scooter.

Given hobbies: cooking, reading
Given pets: guinea-pig, mouse
Given transport: scooter, train

From clue 2, we know the person who cooks cannot be driving the scooter because they are to the right of the scooter driver. This implies the scooter driver's hobby could be reading since it's the only other option left for a hobby that hasn't been directly linked to another activity.

So, if we start with transport:
- Since cooking is to the right of the scooter, and assuming the scooter is not on the far right (because then there would be no one to its right), the scooter must be on the left. This leaves the train for the right side.

|             |    1    |     2      |
| Transport   | Scooter | Train      |

Now, considering hobbies and knowing cooking is to the right of the scooter:
- The person driving the scooter cannot have cooking as a hobby (because cooking is to their right), so their hobby must be reading.
- This means cooking is associated with the train.

|             |    1    |     2      |
| Transport   | Scooter | Train      |
| Hobby       | Reading | Cooking    |

Lastly, considering pets and knowing the mouse owner is to the left of the guinea-pig owner:
- Since the scooter (and thus its owner) is on the left, the mouse must be with the scooter owner.
- The guinea-pig then goes with the train, as it's to the right.

|             |    1    |     2      |

Lv5-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person whose hobby is baking. This means in the table, the comedy movie genre must be associated with column 1 because it has to be to the left of baking, regardless of where baking is placed.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 2
The Egyptian is to the left of the Polish. Since we don't have direct associations yet between nationalities and hobbies or movie genres, we'll keep this in mind for further deductions.


## Step 3: Deduction from Clues
From Clue 1, since comedy must be to the left of baking, if we assume baking is in column 2 (because it has to be after comedy), then comedy can only fit in column 1. Western movies would then go into column 2 as it's the only option left.


## Step 4: Placing Nationalities
Given that Egyptian must be to the left of Polish, and considering our current setup where comedy is likely associated with column 1, Egyptian would logically fit into column 1, making Polish fit into column 2.


## Step 5: Finalizing Hobbies
With the placement of nationalities and movie genres somewhat established (Egyptian with Comedy in column 1, and Polish with Western in column 2), we can finalize hobbies. Since baking must be after comedy according to Clue 1, and considering our current setup, baking would logically fit into column 2 (associated with Polish). This leaves puzzles as the hobby for column 1, associated with Egyptian.


The final answer is:

From clue 1: The person whose hobby is singing owns a hedgehog.


From clue 2: The person whose hobby is cooking is to the left of the person whose sport is rowing.


Given hobbies: cooking, singing
Given pets: hedgehog, pony
Given sports: rowing, water-polo

| Sport   |            |          |


From clue 1, since the person who sings has a hedgehog, and considering the arrangement above based on clue 2 (cooking to the left of rowing), we can start filling in more details:


If the singer has a hedgehog, then:

| Hobby   | Cooking    | Singing  |
| Pet     | Pony       | Hedgehog |
| Sport   |            |          |


Now, using clue 2 that cooking is to the left of rowing, and knowing the hobbies and pets:


The person who cooks must be involved in a sport other than rowing because they are to the left of rowing. Given the sports options (rowing, water-polo), this means the person who cooks must enjoy water-polo, and thus, the singer enjoys rowing.

1. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the scientist.
2. The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the Pakistani.


From statement 2, we know the order of nationalities is Spanish then Pakistani.


Given the constraints and the table structure, we have two columns (1 and 2), which means each piece of information (Job, Nationality, Sport) will be matched with one of these two columns.


Let's start filling in what we know based on statement 2:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Job           |            |           |
| Nationality   | Spanish    | Pakistani |
| Sport         |            |           |


Now, considering statement 1 and knowing the nationalities' order, we have to place ""surfing"" to the left of the scientist. Since the Spanish is already on the left, ""surfing"" must be associated with the Spanish, and therefore, ""scientist"" cannot be on the left (because surfing needs to be to the left of the scientist). This implies the freelancer is on the left.


So, we fill in the jobs based on this logic:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Job           | Freelancer| Scientist |
| Nationality   | Spanish    | Pakistani |
| Sport         |            |           |


Given that surfing must be to the left of the scientist and since the scientist is on the right, surfing cannot be on the right. Thus, surfing must be associated with the Spanish freelancer.


Now, we know rugby must be associated with the scientist because it's the only sport left for the right column.


So, we fill in the sports:

From statement 1, we know that the person watching disaster movies owns a frog.

From statement 2, we know that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

Now, let's analyze the possibilities:

* If the person drinking almond-milk is in column 1, then the owner of the snake must be in column 2.
* The person watching disaster movies owns a frog, so they can't own a snake. Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be drinking either lemonade or almond-milk.

Let's try to place the person watching disaster movies in column 1:

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | lemonade   |          |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster   |          |
| Pet           | frog       |          |

Now, we know that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person in column 1 is drinking lemonade, the person in column 2 must be drinking almond-milk, and they can't own a snake (because the snake owner is to their right). Therefore, this placement doesn't work.

Let's try to place the person watching disaster movies in column 1, drinking almond-milk:

|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk|          |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster   |          |
| Pet           | frog       |          |

Now, we know that the owner of the snake is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means that the person in column 2 owns a snake and drinks lemonade (since almond-milk is already taken). The only remaining movie genre is fantasy.
