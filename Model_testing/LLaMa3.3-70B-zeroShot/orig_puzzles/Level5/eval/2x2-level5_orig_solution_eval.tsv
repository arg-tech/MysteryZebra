Lv5-2x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The people have 2 different jobs: designer, dressmaker.
2. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: dubstep, reggae.
3. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the fan of dubstep.


Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2), ""to the left"" in this context means the dressmaker must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no one to their left. Thus:


- The dressmaker is in column 1.
- Since the dressmaker cannot like dubstep (because then they wouldn't be to the left of someone who likes dubstep), they must like reggae.


Now, let's fill out what we know so far:


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Dressmaker|          |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae    |          |


Given that there are only two jobs and the dressmaker is already assigned to column 1, the remaining job (designer) must go in column 2.


Also, since the music genres are dubstep and reggae, and reggae has been assigned to column 1, dubstep must be in column 2.


Thus, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|               |     1      |    2     |
| Job           | Dressmaker| Designer|

Lv5-2x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Understand the Clues
We have two pets (goat and lizard) and two means of transport (airplane and motorbike). The clue states that ""the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat."" This implies the person with the airplane cannot be in column 2 if the goat's owner is in column 1, or they must be in column 1 if the goat's owner is also in column 1 but below them.


## Step 2: Apply the Clues to the Table
Given that there are only two rows and two columns, we can deduce the following:
- If the airplane (and thus its driver) is in column 1, then the goat must be in column 2 because the airplane's driver must be ""somewhere to the left"" of the goat.
- Conversely, if the airplane were in column 2, there would be no space for it to be to the left of the goat since they'd both have to occupy different columns based on the first clue alone.


## Step 3: Determine Pet and Transport Combinations
Based on the above reasoning:
- The person driving the airplane must be in the first column (1), and thus, the owner of the goat must be in the second column (2).
- Since there are only two means of transport and pets mentioned, this implies that the motorbike's driver must then be paired with either the lizard or the remaining pet if not already determined.


## Step 4: Finalize Pet Assignments
Given:
- Airplane is in column 1.
- Goat is in column 2 (because it has to be to the right of the airplane based on clue 1).
This leaves us with the motorbike and lizard. Since there's no direct clue about the position of the lizard relative to the means of transport, we can deduce its placement by elimination:
- The person driving the airplane is in column 1.
- The goat is owned by someone in column 2 (to be to the right of the airplane).
- Thus, the motorbike and lizard must pair with these placements.


## Step 5: Create Solution Table
Based on our deductions:
|             |    1     |     2     |
| Pet         | Lizard   | Goat      |
| Transport   | Airplane | Motorbike |

The final answer is: 
#############
|             |    1     |     2     |

Lv5-2x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: R&B and Rock.
2. The people use 2 different means of transport: Boat and Subway.
3. The fan of R&B is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.

Given that we have only two columns (1 and 2) for both music genres and transportation methods, and considering the third point:


- If the person driving the boat is in column 1, then the R&B fan must be in column 2 because they are to the right of the boat user.
- Since there's no other position for the Rock fan (given that we only have two positions), the Rock fan must be in the same row as either the boat or the subway, but since the boat is already associated with a person who cannot be the R&B fan due to the positioning rule, it leaves us with limited configurations.

Let's try to place the information into the table based on these rules:


Given that we have two people and thus need to fill both rows, let's start with what we know for sure from point 3: The R&B fan is to the right of the boat user. This means if the boat user is in column 1 (for transport), then R&B must be associated with column 2 (for music-genre).


## Step-by-step placement


- Place the boat in column 1 for Transport because the R&B fan needs to be to its right.
- Since there are only two options for Music-Genre and we've established one of them (R&B) must be in column 2, Rock must be associated with column 1.


Now, considering transport:


- We have Boat in column 1, so Subway must go in column 2 for Transport to satisfy the condition that both transports are used.


However, we need to align this with our initial placement logic and correct any oversight. The critical clue is that R&B's fan is to the right of the boat user, which suggests a specific spatial relationship but doesn't directly dictate the row; it was an error in the logical progression to not initially account for the fact that both music genres and transports are being used by two individuals.


Correcting this oversight and clarifying:


- The clue indicates R&B is to the right of the boat user, suggesting if we consider rows as individual entities, each row represents a person's preference. Therefore, in one row (let's say for Person 1), we have the Boat, and in the other row (for Person 2), we should align the preferences correctly based on the clue.


The final corrected logic considering both clues properly:


If the boat user is in column 1 (which would be an incorrect assumption since it doesn't directly match our table structure for solving this puzzle correctly with given constraints), we need to reconsider how these fit into two distinct individuals' preferences without mixing up rows and columns.


Let's place them correctly based on our clues and the available information:


Given that each row represents a person, one likes R&B and uses the subway (since they must be to the right of the boat user in some configuration), and the other likes Rock and uses the boat.


This leads us to two configurations that fit the given rules when considering rows represent individual preferences:


|               |  1   |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Rock| R&B    |
| Transport     | Boat| Subway |


Therefore, aligning with the clue that the fan of R&B is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat (considering ""to the right"" in a logical sense rather than strictly spatial within this table format), we see that:


#############
|               |  1   |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Rock| R&B    |
| Transport     | Boat| Subway |

Lv5-2x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down the information given and apply it step by step.


Given:
- Two movie genres: Musical, Zombie
- Two music genres: Classical, Gospel
- The fan of gospel is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies.

Let's start filling in the table based on the clues:


Since there are only two options for each genre and the clue mentions the gospel fan being to the right of the musical movie fan, we can deduce the following:

1. If the Musical movie fan is in column 1, then the Gospel music fan must be in column 2 (to be to the right).
2. This leaves Classical for column 1, as it's the only option left for Music-Genre that hasn't been placed yet.
3. Zombie movies would then go with Gospel music in column 2 because Musical is already paired with Classical.

So, our table looks like this:


|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical  | Zombie |
| Music-Genre   | Classical| Gospel |

Lv5-2x2-5	"Let's break down the information:

* There are 2 nationalities: German and Mexican.
* There are 2 means of transport: Bus and Ship.
* The German is somewhere to the right of the person driving the Ship.

From clue 1, we know that the German cannot be driving the Ship, because they are to the right of the person driving the Ship. This means the Mexican must be driving the Ship, and the German must be using the Bus.

So, the completed table is:

Lv5-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions based on the clue about the beverage and job.
Given that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the pilot, there are two possible scenarios:
- If the pilot is in position 1, then the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2.
- The jobs and beverages can be combined in a few ways based on this clue.

## Step 2: Apply the given information to the table.
We have two jobs (pilot, project-manager) and two beverages (almond-milk, milk). Since there are only two positions and we know the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the pilot, let's place the pilot first.


## Step 3: Place the pilot in position 1.
If the pilot is in position 1, then the project-manager must be in position 2 because there are only two jobs. Now, considering the beverages:


## Step 4: Determine the beverage for each job based on the clue.
Since the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the pilot and we've placed the pilot in position 1, the person in position 2 (the project-manager) must drink almond-milk.


## Step 5: Fill in the remaining information.
The only beverage left for the pilot in position 1 is milk.


The final answer is:

Lv5-2x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the given information:


1. There are 2 different favourite beverages: iced-tea and tea.
2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: crime and romance.
3. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.


Given that we have only two options for each category and only two positions (1 and 2), let's analyze the information:


- Since the person drinking tea must be to the left of the person watching romance movies, this means the person who watches romance movies cannot be in position 1 if the tea drinker is also in one of these positions.


Let's consider the possibilities based on the third clue:


If the tea drinker is in position 1, then:
- Position 1 must have ""tea"" as its beverage.
- Since the tea drinker is to the left of the romance movie watcher, the romance movie watcher must be in position 2. This leaves crime for position 1.


However, let's correctly apply the clue that the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies without assuming specific positions prematurely:


The correct approach should consider all possible combinations while respecting the given clues:


Given we only have two positions and two options for each category, the arrangement considering the clue would be:


- Tea drinker must be to the left of the romance movie watcher. This implies tea cannot be in position 2 if romance is in position 1 (which doesn't apply since romance can't be in position 1 according to our initial analysis). Thus, if tea is in position 1, romance must be in position 2.


Let's fill out the table correctly based on this logic:


|               |   1   |    2     |
| Beverage      | Tea  | Iced-Tea |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime| Romance  |


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:

Lv5-2x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are 2 different favourite beverages: 7up and lemonade.
2. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: techno and trance.
3. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the fan of techno.

Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2) in the table, ""somewhere to the left"" directly implies the lemonade drinker must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no one to their left. Therefore, we can start by placing lemonade in column 1.

Now, since lemonade is in column 1 and the person who likes techno must be to the right of the lemonade drinker, techno goes into column 2.

The only music genre left is trance, which then must go into column 1 because each column can only have one beverage and one music genre associated with it.

Lastly, since lemonade is in column 1 and there are only two beverages (lemonade and 7up), 7up must be in column 2.

So, the completed table based on the given clues would look like this:

Lv5-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two favourite beverages: soy-milk and water.
2. There are two pets: fish and hedgehog.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish.

Given the table structure:


|            |   1   |    2     |
| Beverage   |       |          |
| Pet        |       |          |

Let's fill in the information based on clue 3.


Since the person drinking soy-milk must be to the right of the owner of the fish, and considering there are only two columns (1 and 2), the owner of the fish must be in column 1. This means the soy-milk drinker can only be in column 2 because that's the only position to the right of column 1.


Therefore:


- Column 1 has the fish as a pet.
- The beverage for column 1 cannot be soy-milk (because soy-milk is to the right of the fish owner), so it must be water.
- Column 2, being to the right of the fish owner, must have soy-milk as its beverage.
- Since column 1 has the fish, and there are only two pets, column 2 must have the hedgehog.


The completed table based on these deductions is:

Lv5-2x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


1. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike.
2. The fan of country is somewhere to the right of the fan of disco.

Given that we have two people (implied by ""the people"" in the puzzle statement), two music genres (country and disco), and two means of transport (bike and bus), we can deduce the following:


- From clue 1, since the bus driver is to the left of the bike rider, the arrangement for transport must be: Bus | Bike.
- From clue 2, since the country fan is to the right of the disco fan, the arrangement for music genres must be: Disco | Country.


Therefore, combining both clues, we get:
