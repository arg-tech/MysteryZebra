Lv5-1x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
2. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
3. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the helicopter.

From clue 3, we know the order must be either Taxi - Airplane - Helicopter or Helicopter - Airplane - Taxi because the airplane is between the taxi and the helicopter.

Given clue 1, the airplane must be to the right of the taxi. So, the possible order considering just this clue would start with Taxi, followed by Airplane.

Clue 2 tells us the airplane is to the left of the ship. This means Ship cannot be in the first position since Airplane needs to be to its left.

Combining these clues:

- The sequence must include Taxi, then Airplane (because Airplane is to the right of Taxi).
- Then comes Helicopter because Airplane is between Taxi and Helicopter.
- Finally, Ship must come last since Airplane is to the left of Ship.

So, the order from 1 to 4 is: Taxi, Airplane, Helicopter, Ship.

Lv5-1x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is to the right of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. The person whose hobby is writing is to the right of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
3. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left or far right.
4. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is to the right of the person whose hobby is reading.

From clue 2, we know the order for writing and filmmaking is: filmmaking, writing.

From clue 1, since rock-climbing is to the right of writing, and considering clue 2, we have: filmmaking, writing, rock-climbing as a possible sequence for these three hobbies.

Clue 3 tells us that rock-climbing must be on either end. Given the information from clues 1 and 2, if rock-climbing were on the far left, it would contradict those clues because writing (and thus filmmaking) would have to be to its right, but then there wouldn't be room for reading to fit into this sequence in a way that satisfies all conditions. Therefore, rock-climbing must be on the far right.

Clue 4 indicates that rock-climbing is to the right of reading. This means reading cannot be last (since rock-climbing is last), and given our sequence so far (filmmaking, writing, rock-climbing), reading must fit before filmmaking or between filmmaking and writing to satisfy all conditions.

However, if reading were between filmmaking and writing, it would violate clue 4 because rock-climbing needs to be to the right of reading. Thus, the only position for reading that satisfies all clues without contradiction is the first position: reading, filmmaking, writing, rock-climbing.

So, the solution table with the hobbies filled in according to the given conditions is:

Lv5-1x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The dressmaker is on the right of the librarian.
2. The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
3. This statement about the architect being the architect doesn't give us any useful information for solving the puzzle.
4. The architect is somewhere to the right of the writer.


Given these clues, let's start with clue 2 since it gives us a clear starting point: the dressmaker can only be in position 1 or 4.


## Step-by-step solution:


- From clue 1, if the dressmaker is on the far left (position 1), the librarian must be to the left of the dressmaker, but this contradicts the possibility of the dressmaker being on the far left since there's no one to the left of the first position. Therefore, the dressmaker cannot be in position 1 based on clue 2 and must be in position 4.
  
- Knowing the dressmaker is in position 4 from our deduction, we use clue 1: the librarian must then be in a position to the left of the dressmaker. Possible positions for the librarian are 1, 2, or 3 since the dressmaker is in position 4.

- Clue 4 tells us the architect is to the right of the writer. This means the writer cannot be in position 4 (since there's no one to the right of position 4), and the architect also cannot be in position 1 because then there would be no space for the writer to the left of the architect.

- Considering all jobs must be filled and we have already determined the dressmaker is in position 4, let's try placing the librarian. If the librarian were in position 3, it satisfies clue 1 (dressmaker to the right of the librarian), leaving positions 1 and 2 for the writer and architect.

- Given the architect must be to the right of the writer (clue 4) and we've determined possible placements based on previous clues, a feasible arrangement could have the writer in position 1 or 2. However, since the architect needs to be to the right of the writer, and considering our need to satisfy all conditions including the dressmaker being on the far right, a viable solution starts to emerge.


## Possible Arrangement:


Given these deductions and constraints, let's place the jobs:


- Dressmaker in position 4 (as deduced).
- Librarian must be to the left of the dressmaker; if we place the librarian in position 3, it fits well with our other clues.
- Writer cannot be in position 4, so let's consider positions 1 and 2. If the writer is in position 1, the architect (being to the right of the writer) could fit into position 2, which satisfies all given conditions.


## Final Solution:


Given these constraints, a possible solution that fits all clues could be:


|       |   1    |     2     |     3     |     4      |
| Job   | Writer | Architect | Librarian | Dressmaker |


This arrangement satisfies:
- The dressmaker is on the right of the librarian.
- The dressmaker is on the far right.
- The architect is to the right of the writer.


Thus, the final solution table is:


#############
|       |   1    |     2     |     3     |     4      |

Lv5-1x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Apply the second condition
The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. This means the order for these two hobbies is: video-games, skydiving.


## Step 2: Apply the first condition
The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Combining this with the result from step 1, we get: video-games, skydiving, sudoku.


## Step 3: Apply the third condition
The person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since sudoku is already at the third position, baking must be at the fourth position.


## Step 4: Construct the final table
Given the order derived from the steps above (video-games, skydiving, sudoku, baking), we fill in the hobbies into the table:


|         |      1      |     2     |   3    |   4    |
| Hobby   | video-games | skydiving | sudoku| baking |


The final answer is:

Lv5-1x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to consider all the given conditions:


1. The person watching crime movies is between the person watching scientific movies and the person watching epic movies.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
3. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.


From condition 3, we know the order must be Epic, Scientific, ... (since Scientific is to the right of Epic).


From condition 2, we have: ..., Scientific, Action


Combining these, and considering all four spots, we can start filling in:


- Epic must come before Scientific.
- Scientific comes before Action.


Given condition 1, Crime must be between Scientific and Epic. However, since Epic must come before Scientific (from condition 3), Crime cannot be to the left of both; it must be to the right of Epic but also before or after Scientific in a way that satisfies all conditions.


Considering all conditions together:


The only arrangement that fits is: Epic, Crime, Scientific, Action


Because:
- Epic comes before Scientific (condition 3).
- Scientific is to the left of Action (condition 2).
- Crime is between Epic and Scientific, satisfying condition 1 when considering the placement from left to right as Epic-Crime-Scientific-Action.


Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

Lv5-1x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The person whose hobby is chess is in an even position.
   - This means the chess player can be in either position 2 or 4.

2. The person whose hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.
   - This places the writer in either position 1 or 4.

3. The person whose hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
   - If chess is in position 2, then sudoku must be in position 3 or 4. However, if chess is in position 4, there's no space to the right for sudoku, so this scenario doesn't work given the constraints.

4. The person whose hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
   - This statement indicates that baking must come before sudoku but does not specify their exact positions relative to chess and writing.


Given these conditions:


- From (1) and (3), if chess were in position 4, there would be no room for sudoku to its right. So, chess must be in position 2.
- With chess in position 2, sudoku can only fit in positions 3 or 4 because it needs to be to the right of chess.
- Considering (2) and that writing must be on one of the ends, if writing were on the left (position 1), it would conflict with our current arrangement for chess and sudoku. So, writing should be at the far right, which places it in position 4. However, this conflicts with the placement of sudoku based on statement (3). Therefore, we need to reconsider based on the strict interpretation of all rules.


Reconsidering the constraints:


- Chess must be in an even position: 2 or 4.
- Writing is at one end: 1 or 4.
- Sudoku is to the right of chess.
- Sudoku is also to the right of baking.


Given these, let's correct our approach and place the hobbies according to all rules without assuming positions prematurely:


If writing is in position 1 (far left), we can start building from there:
- Writing: 1
- Since chess must be even and sudoku to its right, let's consider placing chess next:
  - Chess: 2
  - Sudoku then has to be after chess, so it could be in position 3 or 4.
    - But baking also needs to be before sudoku (from statement 4), which means if sudoku is in position 4, baking must be in position 3.


This setup seems to fulfill all conditions:
- Writing is on the far left (position 1).
- Chess is in an even position (2).
- Sudoku is after chess and also after baking, placing it in position 4.
- Baking fits into the remaining slot before sudoku, which is position 3.


So, the final arrangement based on all given conditions would be:

Lv5-1x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


1. The Indian is somewhere to the left of the British.
2. The French is somewhere to the left of the Nigerian.
3. The British is between the French and the Nigerian.

From statement 3, we know the order must be: French, British, Nigerian (since the British is between the French and the Nigerian).

Now, incorporating statement 1, which says the Indian is to the left of the British, and knowing the French must also be to the left of the British but not necessarily directly next to them due to the presence of the Indian, we have a few possibilities for where the Indian can fit relative to the sequence given by statement 3.


However, since statement 2 requires the French to be to the left of the Nigerian and statement 3 places the British between the French and the Nigerian, we must find a spot for the Indian that respects all rules. Given that the Indian must be to the left of the British (statement 1), and considering the fixed sequence of French-British-Nigerian from statements 2 and 3, the only place the Indian can fit without disrupting this order is either before the French or between the French and the British.


But since statement 3 explicitly places the British between the French and the Nigerian, introducing the Indian into this sequence while respecting all given conditions means the Indian cannot be placed after the French if we are to maintain the integrity of the sequence required by statements 2 and 3. Therefore, considering all possibilities:


- If the Indian were directly before the French, it would respect statement 1 (Indian to the left of British) but we must ensure it also respects statement 2 (French to the left of Nigerian).
- The only configuration that respects all conditions is: Indian, French, British, Nigerian.


Thus, the final solution table should look like this:

Lv5-1x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
2. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the train.
3. The person driving the boat is in an odd position.
4. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the boat.


From clue 3, we know the boat can only be in positions 1 or 3 since those are the odd positions.


Considering clue 2 and knowing the boat must be in an odd position, if the boat were in position 1, there would be no room for the train to its left. Thus, the boat cannot be in position 1; it must be in position 3.


With the boat in position 3, according to clue 2, the train must be in position 1 or 2 since the boat is to the right of the train. However, given that the boat is in position 3 and considering clue 4 (the bike is to the left of the boat), and knowing we have to fit in a roller which is next to the boat (clue 1), we need to figure out how these can be arranged.


If the train were in position 2, there would be no space for the bike to be to the left of the boat without also being to the left of the train. Therefore, the train must be in position 1.


Now, with the train in position 1 and the boat in position 3, we need to place the bike (which is to the left of the boat) and the roller (which is next to the boat). The only configuration that satisfies all conditions is having the bike in position 2 (since it must be to the left of the boat and there's no space for it before the train without violating other rules), the boat in position 3, and this leaves us with positions 4 for both the roller and the remaining transport. However, clue 1 specifies that the roller is next to the boat, so it must be in position 4.


Thus, we have:


|             |  1   |   2   |  3   |   4    |
| Transport   | Train| Bike | Boat | Roller |

The final answer is:

Lv5-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down each statement and apply it to the table step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Statement 1
The person whose hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles. This means traveling can be in columns 1, 2, or 3 since puzzles must be to its right.


## Step 2: Apply Statement 2
This statement reinforces the first one, indicating that puzzles must be after traveling. So, we have a sequence where traveling precedes puzzles but doesn't tell us about their exact positions yet.


## Step 3: Apply Statement 3
The person whose hobby is hiking is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. This means hiking can be in columns 1, 2, or 3 if magic-tricks is after it.


## Step 4: Apply Statement 4
The person whose hobby is traveling is on the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. This gives us a crucial piece of information that helps place traveling and magic-tricks relative to each other.


From statements 1, 2, and 4, we can deduce:
- Traveling must be after magic-tricks (Statement 4).
- Traveling must be before puzzles (Statements 1 and 2).

Considering all statements together:
- Hiking is before magic-tricks (Statement 3).
- Magic-tricks is before traveling (Statement 4).
- Traveling is before puzzles (Statements 1 and 2).

So, the sequence that fits all conditions is: hiking, magic-tricks, traveling, puzzles.


The final answer is:

Lv5-1x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
2. The person drinking water is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice.
3. The person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking 7up and the person drinking water.

From clue 2, we know the order for juice, water, and thus by extension, since iced-tea must be to the right of water (clue 1), the order for these three is: juice, water, iced-tea.

Clue 3 tells us that iced-tea is between 7up and water. However, from clue 1 and the deduced order, we understand that iced-tea cannot be directly next to 7up if water is also involved in this sequence because iced-tea must be to the right of water. Thus, considering all clues, the correct sequence that respects all conditions given is: juice, 7up, water, iced-tea.

This order satisfies all conditions:
- Juice is to the left of water (clue 2).
- Water is to the left of iced-tea (clue 1).
- Iced-tea is between 7up and water in a broader sense, considering the entire sequence must include juice as well, which fits when we consider that ""between"" in clue 3 means within the sequence that includes all drinks, not necessarily directly adjacent to both.

Therefore, the final solution table with the correct order of beverages is:

#############
