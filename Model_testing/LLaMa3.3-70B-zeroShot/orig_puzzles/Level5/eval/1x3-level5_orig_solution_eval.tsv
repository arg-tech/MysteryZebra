Lv5-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the information given:

1. The person watching epic movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies.

Given there are three positions (1, 2, and 3) and three genres (epic, romance, superhero), we can start by placing the epic genre in position 3 since it's on the far right:

|               |     1     |    2    |  3   |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         | epic |

Next, knowing that the person watching superhero movies is to the left of the person watching romance movies, and since epic is already placed at position 3, we have two possible arrangements for superhero and romance:

1. Superhero in position 1, Romance in position 2
2. This arrangement satisfies the condition that superhero is to the left of romance.

So, the final table should look like this:

#############
|               |     1     |    2    |  3   |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero | romance | epic |
#############

This solution adheres to both conditions given in the puzzle."	{'movie-genre': ['superhero', 'romance', 'epic']}	True	3	True
Lv5-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of blues.
2. The fan of blues is somewhere to the right of the fan of soul.

From statement 2, we know the order must be: soul, blues, (and then rock because of statement 1).

So, the only possible arrangement that fits both conditions is:

|               |  1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | soul | blues | rock |

Thus, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |  1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | soul | blues | rock |

Lv5-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating grapes is on the right of the person eating broccoli.
2. The person eating raspberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.

Given these clues, we can deduce the following:

- Broccoli cannot be in column 3 because then there would be no space to the right for grapes (clue 1).
- Grapes also cannot be in column 3 because there needs to be space to the right for raspberry (clue 2).

So, broccoli must be in column 1, and grapes must be in column 2. This leaves raspberry for column 3.

Therefore, the solution is:


#############
|        |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Food   | Broccoli | Grapes | Raspberry |

Lv5-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step:


1. The person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies.
2. The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies.


From point 2, we know the order for two of the genres: Scientific, then Sports.


From point 1, since Thriller must be to the left of Scientific, and considering the constraints from both points, the only possible arrangement that respects both conditions is:


Thriller, Scientific, Sports


Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it is:


#############
|               |    1     |     2      |   3    |

Lv5-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding the Conditions
First, let's understand what each condition tells us:
1. The person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating carrot.
2. The person eating banana is between the person eating watermelon and the person eating carrot.


## Step 2: Applying the First Condition
Given that there are three positions (1, 2, 3) and the person eating watermelon must be to the left of the person eating carrot, we can start by placing watermelon in position 1, as it has to be to the left of carrot.


## Step 3: Applying the Second Condition
With watermelon in position 1, banana must be between watermelon and carrot. This means banana cannot be in position 1 (since watermelon is there), so banana must be in position 2. Carrot, then, must be in position 3 because it has to be to the right of both watermelon and banana.


The final answer is: 
#############
|        |     1      |   2    |   3    |
| Food   | Watermelon| Banana | Carrot |

Lv5-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
2. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
3. The person drinking milk is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking tea.

From clue 2, we know that tea must be to the left of milk. Combining this with clue 1, it's clear that tea cannot be on the right of milk because then it wouldn't satisfy clue 2. So, tea must be to the left of milk.

Clue 3 tells us that milk is between juice and tea. Given that tea is to the left of milk (from clue 2), this means juice must be on the other side of milk, which would be to the right of milk since tea is already on the left.

Thus, the order from left to right based on these clues is: Tea, Milk, Juice.

Here's the solution table:


#############
|            |  1  |  2   |   3   |
| Beverage   | Tea | Milk | Juice |

Lv5-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
2. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.


From (1), we know the order must be Rabbit -> Hamster (with possibly other pets in between, but since there are only three pets and no other pets are mentioned, it simplifies our scenario).


From (2), we understand the order must also satisfy Hamster -> Goat.


Combining both pieces of information, we can deduce the order is: Rabbit -> Hamster -> Goat.


Therefore, the solution table with the pets in their respective positions based on the clues provided would look like this:


#############
|       |   1    |    2    |  3   |
| Pet   | Rabbit | Hamster | Goat |
#############"	{'pet': ['rabbit', 'hamster', 'goat']}	True	3	True
Lv5-1x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person eating raspberry.
2. The person eating apple is to the left of the person eating raspberry.

From point 2, we know the order for apple and raspberry is Apple -> Raspberry (since Apple is to the left of Raspberry).

Given that there are three positions and considering point 1, the only way Asparagus can be to the right of Raspberry is if Raspberry is in the second position. This means Apple must be in the first position because it has to be to the left of Raspberry.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Apple
- Position 2: Raspberry
- Position 3: Asparagus

This order satisfies both conditions given in the puzzle.


#############
|        |   1   |     2     |     3     |
| Food   | Apple | Raspberry | Asparagus |

Lv5-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to follow the clues given:


1. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is chess.
2. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.


Given these clues, let's fill in the table step by step:


- From clue 2, we know hiking must be to the left of filmmaking.
- From clue 1, we know filmmaking must be to the left of chess.


So, the order from left to right must be: hiking, filmmaking, chess.


Here is the solution table:

Lv5-1x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching satire movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
2. The person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.

From clue 2, we know the order for comedy and satire is: Comedy -> Satire.

From clue 1, since Satire must be to the left of Martial-arts, and Comedy is to the left of Satire, the overall order must be: Comedy -> Satire -> Martial-arts.

So, the solution table with the genres filled in according to their positions from left to right is:


#############
