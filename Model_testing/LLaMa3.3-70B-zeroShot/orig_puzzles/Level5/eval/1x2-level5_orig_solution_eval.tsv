Lv5-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to consider the statement given:


1. The Dutch person is somewhere to the right of the British person.


Given there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two nationalities (British and Dutch), we can deduce the following:


- If the British person were in position 2, there would be no space to the right for the Dutch person.
- Therefore, the British person must be in position 1, and the Dutch person must be in position 2.


The solution table looks like this:


#############
|               |    1    |   2   |

## Step 1: Understand the Clue
The clue states that ""the person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies."" This means in a layout where two people are side by side, if one is watching time-travel movies and the other is watching adventure movies, the time-travel movie watcher must be on the left.


## Step 2: Apply the Clue to the Table
Given there are only two columns (1 and 2), and based on the clue that the person watching time-travel movies must be to the left of the person watching adventure movies, we can deduce the following:


- Column 1 must represent the time-travel movie genre because it is to the left.
- Column 2 must represent the adventure movie genre because it is to the right.

Lv5-1x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the order of the two nationalities based on the given clue.


## Step 1: Understand the Clue
The clue states that ""the british is somewhere to the right of the malaysian."" This means in a sequence or arrangement where both nationalities are mentioned or represented, British must appear after Malaysian.


## Step 2: Apply the Clue to the Table
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two nationalities (British and Malaysian), we apply the clue directly. Since the British nationality must be to the right of the Malaysian, this means the Malaysian can only occupy position 1, and the British must then occupy position 2.

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   |             |         |


And the clue:
1. The person whose hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.


This means the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in column 2, and the person with the hobby ""video-games"" must be in column 1, since the puzzle enthusiast has to be to the right of the video-game enthusiast.


Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv5-1x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the order of the jobs based on the given clue.


## Step 1: Understanding the Clue
The clue states that ""the writer is somewhere to the right of the firefighter."" This means in a sequence from left to right, the firefighter must come before the writer.


## Step 2: Applying the Clue to the Table
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two jobs (firefighter and writer), we can deduce that:


- The firefighter cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no space to the right for the writer.
- Therefore, the firefighter must be in position 1.
- Consequently, the writer must be in position 2, as it is the only remaining position and satisfies the condition of being to the right of the firefighter.


The final solution table should look like this:


#############
|       |      1      |   2    |
| Job   | Firefighter | Writer |

Lv5-1x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Understand the given hobbies and their positions.
We have two hobbies: gardening and magic-tricks. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.


## Step 2: Apply the given condition to the table.
Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2) for hobbies, if the person who likes gardening is in column 1, then the person who likes magic-tricks must be in column 2, as it's the only position to the right.


## Step 3: Fill in the table based on the analysis.
Since we don't have specific names but are dealing with positions and hobbies, we can deduce that:


- Column 1 (hobby) must be gardening because if it were magic-tricks, there would be no space to the right for gardening as per the given condition.
- Column 2 (hobby) must then be magic-tricks.


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |     1     |      2       |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Magic-tricks |

Lv5-1x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which food corresponds to each number based on the given condition.


Given:
- There are two types of food: pepper and raspberry.
- The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating raspberry.

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and the person eating pepper must be to the right of the person eating raspberry, it means:


- Position 1 must be raspberry because if pepper were in position 1, there would be no one to its left eating raspberry.
- Position 2 must be pepper because it is to the right of position 1.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:
