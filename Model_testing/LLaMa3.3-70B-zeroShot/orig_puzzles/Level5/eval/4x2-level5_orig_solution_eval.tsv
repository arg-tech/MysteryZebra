Lv5-4x2-1	"Let's break down the information and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 2, we know the Pakistani watches satire movies.

From clue 1, the Pakistani is to the right of the person eating pumpkin.

From clue 3, the skydiver is to the right of the filmmaker.


Given these clues:


- The person watching satire movies is the Pakistani (clue 2).
- The Pakistani must be in column 2 because they are to the right of someone eating pumpkin (clue 1), meaning pumpkin cannot be in column 2, so blueberry must be in column 2.
- Since the Pakistani watches satire and is in column 2, the person in column 1 must watch musicals.
- The skydiver is to the right of the filmmaker (clue 3), which means filmmaking must be in column 1 and skydiving in column 2.


Now, let's fill in the table with this information:


|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | pumpkin   | blueberry |
| Hobby         | filmmaking| skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | musical   | satire    |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each statement given:


1. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
2. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.


Given information:
- Foods: pomegranate, zucchini
- Movie Genres: comedy, epic
- Pets: cat, rabbit
- Transport: bus, snowmobile


From statement 1, we know that if pomegranate is in column 1, then the snowmobile must be in column 2. This implies that the bus would have to be in column 1.


From statement 2, since epic movies are to the left of the rabbit owner, and considering there are only two columns (1 and 2), if the rabbit is in column 2, then epic must be in column 1. Conversely, this means comedy would be in column 2 because it's the only other option for movie genre.


Now, let's try to piece together a possible arrangement based on these deductions:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | pomegranate | zucchini   |
| Movie-Genre   | epic        | comedy     |
| Pet           | cat         | rabbit     |
| Transport     | bus         | snowmobile |


This arrangement meets all the given conditions:
- The person eating pomegranate is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (condition 1).
- The person watching epic movies is to the left of the owner of the rabbit (condition 2).


Therefore, the solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:

Lv5-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
   - This means the person with puzzles as a hobby must be in column 1, and the person with chess as a hobby must be in column 2.

2. The entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
   - Since the entrepreneur has to be to the left of the house music fan, and considering clue 1, the entrepreneur must be associated with puzzles (in column 1), which means the house music fan could either be in column 1 or 2. However, given that the chess player (who is in column 2) could also potentially like house music, we can't determine the music preference yet based solely on this clue.

3. The mechanic is the person driving the ship.
   - This directly tells us the transport method for the mechanic but doesn't give us a direct column assignment without considering other clues.


From clue 1, we have:
- Column 1: Puzzles
- Column 2: Chess

From clue 3, since the mechanic drives the ship, and we don't know which hobby or music genre they are associated with yet, let's consider their job and transport:


Given that the entrepreneur must be to the left of the house fan (clue 2), if the entrepreneur were in column 1 (which seems likely given the first clue about hobbies), then the house fan could potentially be in either column but considering the arrangement, it makes sense for the entrepreneur to like a music genre that allows the house fan to be in column 2 or associated with chess.


However, since we know the mechanic drives the ship and must have a unique hobby (puzzles or chess), job (entrepreneur or mechanic), music genre (house or trance), and transport (motorbike or ship), let's try fitting these pieces together considering all clues:


If the mechanic is in column 1 with puzzles, it conflicts with clue 1 which places the chess player to the right of the puzzle player. Therefore, the mechanic cannot be with puzzles if we consider typical left-to-right interpretations of ""to the right."" However, this interpretation might have been too hasty without considering all permutations.


Let's place the jobs and transports first based on what we know for sure:


- Mechanic is with the ship (from clue 3).
- Entrepreneur must be to the left of the house fan (clue 2), suggesting but not definitively placing them in column 1.

Given this, a plausible arrangement considering all clues could be:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         | Puzzles     | Chess    |
| Job           | Entrepreneur| Mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | Trance      | House    |
| Transport     | Motorbike   | Ship     |

This arrangement satisfies all given conditions:
- The chess player is to the right of the puzzle player.
- The entrepreneur is to the left of the house music fan.
- The mechanic drives the ship.


Therefore, the solution table, taking into account a strict interpretation of the clues provided and assuming no additional information, could look like this:

Lv5-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the jet-ski cannot be on the right side since 7up must be to its right.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 2
The person whose hobby is collecting is on the far right. This clue directly places ""collecting"" in the second column.


## Step 3: Integrating Clue 3
The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since we know from Clue 2 that ""collecting"" is on the far right, and considering Clue 1 about the jet-ski's placement relative to 7up, we need to figure out how these can be arranged.


## Step 4: Combining All Information
From Clue 1, since 7up must be to the right of the jet-ski, and considering Clue 2 where ""collecting"" is on the far right, it suggests that ""jet-ski"" cannot be on the right. Thus, ""jet-ski"" must be in the first column for 7up to be to its right.


## Step 5: Finalizing Placement
Given the constraints:
- The person who prefers 7up is to the right of the jet-ski.
- The collector is on the far right.
- Considering movie genres and hobbies, we know ""epic"" must be next to 7up (from Clue 3), but since ""collecting"" is on the far right, it means ""7up"" cannot be directly next to ""collecting"" unless they share the same column or row for one of the categories.


## Step 6: Assembling the Table
Given that:
- Jet-ski must be in the first column.
- Collector (thus drawing in the other column) is on the far right.
- 7up to the right of jet-ski, suggesting coffee with jet-ski.
- Epic movies next to 7up.

Let's assemble the table based on these deductions:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      | Coffee |    7up     |
| Hobby         | Drawing| Collecting |
| Movie-Genre   | Western|    Epic    |
| Transport     | Jet-ski|    Bus     |

This arrangement respects all given conditions.


The final answer is:

Lv5-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The firefighter is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
2. The person whose sport is surfing is in an odd position.
3. The scientist is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.


From clue 2, since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and an odd position means position 1, the person who prefers surfing must be in position 1.


Given clue 1, if the firefighter is to the right of the person eating asparagus, and considering the firefighter could either be in position 2 (since it has to be to the right of asparagus), we can start forming our table:


|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus|             |
| Job           |           | Firefighter|
| Nationality   |           |             |
| Sport         | Surfing   |             |


Now, applying clue 3, the scientist must be to the left of the Colombian. This means the scientist cannot be in position 2 because there would be no one to the right for a Colombian to be. Thus, the scientist must be in position 1.


However, we've already placed asparagus and surfing in position 1. So, our initial assumption about asparagus being in position 1 might need adjustment based on further analysis of all clues together:


- The person who likes surfing is indeed in an odd position (position 1), which fits.
- If the scientist is to the left of the Colombian, and considering the firefighter's placement relative to asparagus, we have to adjust our understanding.


Let's correct our approach by directly applying all known information accurately:


1. Since the person who prefers surfing is in position 1, and given that the firefighter must be to the right of the person eating asparagus (clue 1), let's assume the arrangement considering jobs and sports first.


|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Job           | Scientist | Firefighter|
| Nationality   |           |             |
| Sport         | Surfing   | Cycling    |


Given this setup, asparagus must be on the left (because the firefighter is to its right), and tomato would then be on the right.


2. Since the scientist is to the left of the Colombian (clue 3), and considering our current job arrangement:


|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus| Tomato     |
| Job           | Scientist| Firefighter|
| Nationality   | Canadian | Colombian |
| Sport         | Surfing   | Cycling    |


This setup respects all given conditions:
- The firefighter is to the right of asparagus.
- The person whose sport is surfing is in an odd position (position 1).
- The scientist is to the left of the Colombian.


Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv5-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
2. The firefighter is the person drinking sprite.
3. The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 1, we know the music genre for person 1 is hip-hop.

|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |             |                 |
| Food          |             |                 |
| Job           |             |                 |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     |                 |

From clue 2, we know the firefighter drinks sprite. We don't know yet which column the firefighter is in, but since the fan of hip-hop is on the far left and there's no indication that hip-hop and being a firefighter are directly related, we have to wait for more information to place the firefighter and sprite correctly.

From clue 3, the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means if mirinda is in column 2, cucumber must be in column 1 because there's no other position to the left of column 2.


Given these clues, let's try to fill out the table with what we know:


- Column 1 has hip-hop as its music genre.
- Cucumber cannot be in column 2 (because it must be to the left of mirinda), so it could potentially be in column 1.

Now, combining all information and trying to fit the pieces together:


Since the firefighter drinks sprite (clue 2) and there are only two jobs, two beverages, etc., we have limited options. If hip-hop is on the far left, that means its corresponding beverage, food, and job must also be determined based on the other clues.


If we assume the person who likes hip-hop also eats cucumber (because cucumber has to be to the left of mirinda), then:


|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |             |                 |
| Food          | cucumber   |                 |
| Job           |             |                 |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     |                 |

The firefighter drinks sprite, so if the firefighter were in column 1, it would conflict with clue 3 (since we've tentatively placed cucumber there and don't know yet about mirinda's placement). Thus, we should consider placing the firefighter in column 2.


But remember, the person eating cucumber is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means if we place mirinda in column 2, cucumber must indeed be in column 1, which fits our current setup.


So, let's finalize based on all clues:


- Column 1 has hip-hop and cucumber.
- The firefighter drinks sprite, so the firefighter could potentially be in column 2 (since we need to place the firefighter and sprite together).
- Given that the firefighter is in column 2 with sprite, and knowing the person who likes metal must also be placed, we deduce that the fan of metal goes with mirinda because all other options are taken.


Therefore, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |        2        |
| Beverage      | sprite     | mirinda         |
| Food          | cucumber   | tomato          |
| Job           | firefighter| project-manager |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop     | metal           |
#############


However, this initial conclusion seems to misplace the beverage based on an incorrect assumption about the firefighter and the beverages. Let's correct that with a careful reevaluation of the clues:


1. The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.
2. The firefighter drinks sprite.
3. The person eating cucumber is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda.


Given these, we correctly place hip-hop on the left and know the firefighter drinks sprite, but we must correctly align the jobs with the beverages and music genres while respecting the food clue.


Correcting our approach based on the clues:


- Hip-hop is on the far left.
- The firefighter drinks sprite, which could be in either column, but since hip-hop's fan is already determined to be on the left, if we place the firefighter here, it conflicts with needing to determine the beverage independently. Hence, let's correctly place the firefighter and sprite based on the clues without assuming their position prematurely.


Let's correctly fill out the table now:


The person who likes hip-hop is on the far left, so they could be eating cucumber (since cucumber must be to the left of mirinda), and they cannot be drinking mirinda if the setup is to be consistent with clue 3. Thus, we have two options for beverages but need to align them correctly with jobs and music genres.


Since the firefighter drinks sprite, and considering all other clues:


- If hip-hop is on the left, and assuming it's paired with cucumber (to fit clue 3), then mirinda must be on the right.
- The firefighter, therefore, cannot be on the left if they drink sprite because we've already established hip-hop's fan is there, and their beverage isn't specified yet but can't conflict with other clues.


Given this analysis, let's finalize:


The fan of hip-hop likes cucumber (to satisfy clue 3 about being to the left of mirinda) and must be on the left. The firefighter drinks sprite, so they go on the right since we have to pair jobs with beverages correctly without conflicting with music genres or foods.


Thus, the correct table should respect all given conditions:


- Hip-hop is on the left.
- Cucumber is to the left of mirinda.
- The firefighter drinks sprite.


So, the solution that fits all clues without contradiction is:

Lv5-4x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
2. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the coach.
3. The person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is camping.

From clue 3, we know that the person who drinks coffee has a hobby of camping. 

Given clue 1 and clue 3 together, we can start filling in the table as follows:

- Since the coffee drinker likes camping and must be to the left of the fish owner, this means the coffee drinker cannot own the fish (because they have to be to the left of the fish owner).

From clue 2, the fish owner is to the right of the coach. This implies that if we consider the positions from left to right as 1 and 2 respectively, the coach must be in position 1 because the fish owner has to be to their right.

Now, combining all clues:

- The coach cannot drink coffee because, according to clue 1, the coffee drinker is to the left of the fish owner, and from clue 2, we deduced that the coach must be in position 1. However, this actually aligns with our initial deduction since the coach being in position 1 doesn't conflict with the coffee drinker being to the left of the fish owner if we consider the coach could potentially be the coffee drinker or not. But given clue 3 directly links coffee drinking with camping, and considering all other constraints:
  
- The person who drinks coffee is a camper (clue 3), so they cannot own the fish because they must be to the left of the fish owner (clue 1). 

Given these deductions:

- If the coach were in position 1, and assuming the coach could drink either beverage but has to be to the left of the fish owner (which aligns with clue 2), then the coffee drinker, who is also a camper, would fit into this slot perfectly because they have to be to the left of the fish owner.

- This leaves us with:
  - Position 1: Coach, Coffee, Camping
  - Position 2 must then have Sprite (since it's the only other beverage), Photography (as it's the only other hobby), and since the coach is in position 1, this person cannot be a coach but must own a horse (because fish has to be with someone who is to the right of the coach, implying if coach is in position 1, fish cannot be with them but could be with the paramedic or the setup could adjust so that the actual jobs and pets align differently based on direct clues).

However, we know:
- The owner of the fish must be to the right of the coach (clue 2), which means if the coach is in position 1, the fish cannot be in position 1. This was our basis for deduction.

So, aligning all clues without contradiction and ensuring each piece of information fits:

- Position 1 has Coffee, Camping, Coach (as this setup doesn't violate any given clue directly).
- Position 2 then logically would have Sprite, Photography, Paramedic (since it's the only job left), and must own a horse because if coach is in position 1, fish cannot be with them due to clue 2, but since we've placed coffee and camping together as per clue 3, and considering all other clues for placement.

The final solution table, ensuring each clue is respected without contradiction, would look like this:

#############
|            |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage   | Coffee | Sprite     |

Lv5-4x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the positions based on nationality.
Given that ""the polish is on the right of the british,"" we can start by placing the nationalities in the table:

|               |      1      |       2       |
| Job           |             |               |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |
| Nationality   | British     | Polish        |
| Sport         |             |               |

## Step 2: Consider the music genre and sport preferences.
From clue 2, ""the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting,"" we know that gospel and weightlifting must be adjacent. However, without specific jobs assigned yet, we'll have to come back to this after considering other clues.


## Step 3: Analyze the clue about electronic music and the firefighter.
Clue 3 states ""the fan of electronic is somewhere to the right of the firefighter."" This means the firefighter cannot be on the right side since there needs to be a position to the right of them for the electronic music fan. Thus, we can tentatively place the firefighter:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Job           | Firefighter|               |
| Music-Genre   |             |               |
| Nationality   | British     | Polish        |
| Sport         |             |               |

## Step 4: Combine the information to fill in the music-genre and sport.
Given that the firefighter is on the left, the electronic music fan must be on the right (because they are to the right of the firefighter). Also, considering clue 2, if gospel is next to weightlifting, and since the polish person is on the right, it makes sense that the polish person could either like gospel or have a sport that's not weightlifting if we consider all possibilities. However, the direct adjacency requirement from clue 2 means we need to ensure that weightlifting and gospel are together.


## Step 5: Finalize the table with the remaining information.
Since electronic is on the right (polish side), and considering the firefighter's placement, the only way to satisfy all conditions while ensuring the polish person is on the right of the british is to place the music genres and sports accordingly. Given the clues:


- Electronic must be on the right of the firefighter.
- Gospel must be next to weightlifting.
- The polish person is on the right.

Let's assign jobs, music-genres, and sports that fit all given conditions:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Job           | Firefighter| Fisherman     |
| Music-Genre   | Gospel     | Electronic    |
| Nationality   | British     | Polish        |
| Sport         | Weightlifting| Baseball     |

This setup satisfies all the given conditions: the polish person is on the right of the british, gospel and weightlifting are adjacent (on the left), electronic is to the right of the firefighter, and each category has unique entries.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Job           | Firefighter| Fisherman     |

Lv5-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


1. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
2. The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the Malaysian.

From clue 1, we can deduce that since the fantasy movie watcher is to the right of the milk drinker, and there are only two positions (1 and 2), the milk drinker must be in position 1, and the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 2.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   |           |           |

Now, let's apply clue 2. The fan of funk is to the right of the Malaysian. This means the Malaysian cannot be in position 2 because there would be no one to the right of them for the funk fan to be. Thus, the Malaysian must be in position 1.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |           |

Given that the Malaysian is in position 1 and drinks milk (as deduced earlier), and knowing the funk fan must be to the right of the Malaysian, the funk fan must be in position 2.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |           |
| Movie-Genre   |           |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |           |   funk    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |           |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks. The beverage left is 7up, which must be in position 2.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |    7up    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |           |   funk    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |           |

The movie genre left is action, which must be in position 1 because the fantasy watcher is already determined to be in position 2.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |    7up    |
| Movie-Genre   |  action   |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   |           |   funk    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |           |

The music genre left is hip-hop, which must be in position 1.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |    7up    |
| Movie-Genre   |  action   |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop   |   funk    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian |           |

Finally, the nationality left is Pakistani, which must be in position 2.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |   milk    |    7up    |
| Movie-Genre   |  action   |  fantasy  |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop   |   funk    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Pakistani |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv5-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:

1. The person watching family movies is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.
2. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is collecting.

From clue 1, we know that biathlon must be on the left because family movies are to its right, and since there are only two positions (1 and 2), family movies must be in position 2.

So, initially, based on clue 1:
- Position 1 has biathlon as its sport.
- Position 2 has family as its movie genre.

From clue 2, since d&b is to the right of collecting, and knowing that position 2 already has family movies (which doesn't tell us about music genres directly), we can start filling in more information based on elimination and direct clues:

Given:
- Hobby: baking, collecting
- Movie-Genre: family, horror
- Music-Genre: d&b, dubstep
- Sport: biathlon, parkour

And from our initial deduction:
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         |            |         |
| Movie-Genre   |            | Family  |
| Music-Genre   |            |         |
| Sport         | Biathlon   |         |

Now, since the person watching family movies is on the right of biathlon (and thus in position 2), and knowing that d&b must be to the right of collecting, but not directly which hobby corresponds to which sport or movie genre yet:

1. If biathlon is in position 1, then parkour must be in position 2 because there are only two sports.
2. Since family movies are in position 2 (based on clue 1), horror movies must be in position 1.

So, we update our table:
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         |            |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror     | Family  |
| Music-Genre   |            |         |
| Sport         | Biathlon   | Parkour |

Now, let's deal with the hobbies and music genres. We know:
- Collecting must be in position 1 because d&b is to its right (clue 2), meaning collecting cannot be in position 2.
- Thus, baking must be in position 2.

And for music genres:
- Since d&b is to the right of collecting, and we've established collecting is in position 1, d&b must be in position 2.
- Therefore, dubstep must be in position 1.

So, our final table looks like this:

#############
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Collecting | Baking  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror     | Family  |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep    | D&B     |
| Sport         | Biathlon   | Parkour |
