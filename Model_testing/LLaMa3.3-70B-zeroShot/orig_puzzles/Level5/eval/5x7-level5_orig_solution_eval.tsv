Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error to arrive at the final table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:

* Clue 1: ""the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the bartender"" helped to establish the relative positions of chess and bartender.
* Clue 2: ""the fan of country is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling"" established the position of country and traveling.
* Clue 3: ""the freelancer is the fan of soul"" directly assigned a music genre to the freelancer.
* Clue 5: ""the designer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse"" helped to establish the relative positions of designer and lacrosse.
* Clue 9: ""the freelancer is between the person eating cabbage and the fan of funk"" established the position of freelancer, cabbage, and funk.
* Clue 15: ""the person eating pineapple is in an odd position"" limited the possible positions for pineapple.
* Clue 20: ""the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess"" further established the relative positions of traveling and chess.

These clues, along with the others, were used to build up the solution table.

Note: The solution was obtained by applying the given conditions one by one, using a process of elimination and deduction to fill in the table. 

Here is a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:

* Clue 2: The person drinking juice is the person who's sport is weightlifting, so ""juice"" and ""weightlifting"" must be in the same column.
* Clue 6: The person drinking juice is on the far left or far right, so ""juice"" and ""weightlifting"" must be in either column 1 or column 7. However, clue 26 states that the person drinking juice is the videographer, and clue 33 states that the american is on the far left or far right. Since there is already an occupation in column 7 (the teacher), ""juice"", ""weightlifting"", and ""videographer"" must be in column 1.
* Clue 16: The russian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta, so ""russian"" must be to the right of ""fanta"". 
* Clue 11: The dutch is in an even position, so ""dutch"" must be in either column 2, 4, or 6.
* Clue 29: The thai is in an even position, so ""thai"" must be in either column 2, 4, or 6. However, clue 10 states that the thai is on the right of the fan of blues, and clue 1 states that the fan of blues is on the left of the teacher. Since ""teacher"" is already in column 6, ""thai"" must be in column 6.
* Clue 22: The fan of rock is somewhere to the left of the indian, so ""rock"" must be to the left of ""indian"".
* Clue 35: The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the fan of r&b, so ""ice-hockey"" must be to the left of ""r&b"".

Please note that solving this puzzle requires careful attention to the clues and a systematic approach to eliminate possibilities. The solution is unique, but the steps to arrive at it may vary depending on the solver's strategy.


Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:


1. Start with the most restrictive clues, such as clue 16 (musical movies on the far left) and clue 17 (dog owner in the middle).
2. Use clues 1-5 to establish initial relationships between the columns.
3. Apply clues 6-15 to further restrict the possibilities and start filling in the table.
4. Clues 16-25 help to solidify the positions of certain individuals and hobbies.
5. Clues 26-35 are used to make final adjustments and ensure that all conditions are met.

- Italian eats papaya.
- Architect eats something (not specified directly but implied through elimination) and owns a frog.
- Canadian eats kiwi.
- The skateboard is at the end.


### Direct Final Answer Without Step-by-Step for Each Clue


Given the instructions, let's provide the answer in the requested format without detailing every single step due to complexity:
