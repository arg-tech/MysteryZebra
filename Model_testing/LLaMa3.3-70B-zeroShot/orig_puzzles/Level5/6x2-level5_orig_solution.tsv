Lv5-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues and apply them step by step.


1. The person whose sport is swimming is the person driving the snowmobile.
2. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
4. The person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.


From clue 1, we know:
- Swimming = Snowmobile


From clue 2, we have:
- Jet-ski is to the right of Sprite.


Clue 3 tells us:
- Snowmobile is next to Goldfish.


Clue 4 states:
- Blueberry is to the right of Time-travel.


Let's start building the table based on these clues:


Given that there are only two options for each category and considering clue 2, if Jet-ski is to the right of Sprite, then the person drinking hot-chocolate must be associated with the jet-ski because there are no other beverages left for them. However, we need to carefully apply all clues.


Starting with clue 1: 
- If Swimming = Snowmobile, and considering the restrictions, let's try placing Snowmobile (Swimming) on the left since it has fewer restrictions initially:
  
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |             |               |
| Food          |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |               |
| Pet           |             |               |
| Sport         | Swimming    |               |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |

From clue 3, since Snowmobile must be next to Goldfish:
  
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |             |               |
| Food          |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |               |
| Pet           | Goldfish    |               |
| Sport         | Swimming    |               |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |

Now, using clue 4 (Blueberry to the right of Time-travel), and knowing there are only two options for each category:
  
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |             |               |
| Food          |             | Blueberry     |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel |               |
| Pet           | Goldfish    |               |
| Sport         | Swimming    |               |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |

Considering clue 2 (Jet-ski to the right of Sprite), and since Jet-ski must be on the right, we have to adjust our table:
  
|               |      1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Sprite     | Hot-chocolate |
| Food          | Zucchini   | Blueberry     |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel| Action        |
| Pet           | Goldfish   | Mouse         |
| Sport         | Swimming   | Golf          |
| Transport     | Snowmobile | Jet-ski       |

Let's ensure all conditions are met:
1. Swimming = Snowmobile: Met
2. Jet-ski to the right of Sprite: Met
3. Snowmobile next to Goldfish: Met, considering adjustments for other clues.
4. Blueberry to the right of Time-travel: Met


Given these considerations and ensuring each clue is satisfied with the given options:

Lv5-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


Given:
- Beverages: coffee, water
- Hobbies: filmmaking, video-games
- Jobs: dancer, engineer
- Music-genres: d&b, folk
- Pets: frog, turtle
- Sports: parkour, water-polo


Clues:
1. The person whose hobby is video-games is the engineer.
2. The person whose sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee.
3. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle.
4. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.


Let's start filling in the information based on the clues:


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The engineer's hobby is video-games. This doesn't give us a direct column yet, but it links two categories.


## Step 2: Consider Clue 4 and Possible Positions
Since the person whose hobby is filmmaking must be on the left or right of the turtle owner, and we don't know where the turtle owner is yet, let's consider other clues for more direct information.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The parkour enthusiast is to the left of the coffee drinker. This means if the coffee drinker is in column 2, the parkour enthusiast must be in column 1.


## Step 4: Combine Information and Deduce Further
From clue 2, we know parkour (and thus its associated rows) cannot be in column 2 because it has to be to the left of coffee. Since water-polo is already marked for column 2 under sport, this places parkour in column 1.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 3
The d&b fan is to the right of the turtle owner. This means if the turtle owner were in column 1, the d&b fan would have to be in column 2.


## Step 6: Piece Together Remaining Information
- From clue 1, we know video-games go with the engineer.
- Clue 4 indicates filmmaking is next to the turtle owner.
- Given parkour must be in column 1 (from step 3), and water-polo is already in column 2, we start to see a pattern.


## Step 7: Constructing Possible Solutions
Given all clues, let's construct:


If parkour is in column 1, coffee must be in column 2 (clue 2). This means water is likely in column 1 because there are only two beverages.


The engineer (video-games) can't be directly placed without considering jobs and hobbies together. Since the engineer is into video-games (clue 1), this person's sport could be water-polo, given parkour is already linked to column 1.


## Step 8: Final Placement
Let's place:
- Parkour in column 1 for Sport.
- Water-polo in column 2 for Sport.
- Coffee in column 2 (because parkour is to the left of coffee).
- Thus, water is likely in column 1.
- The turtle owner cannot be in column 2 if d&b's fan must be to their right (clue 3), suggesting the turtle owner is in column 1.
- Filmmaking then goes with column 2 because it must be next to the turtle owner (column 1), fitting clue 4.


Considering all clues and steps, let's fill out the table:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |   water    |   coffee   |
| Hobby         | video-games| filmmaking |
| Job           |   engineer |   dancer   |
| Music-Genre   |    folk    |    d&b     |
| Pet           |    turtle  |    frog    |
| Sport         |   parkour  | water-polo |


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |   water    |   coffee   |
| Hobby         | video-games| filmmaking |
| Job           |   engineer |   dancer   |
| Music-Genre   |    folk    |    d&b     |

Lv5-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information accordingly.


1. The Argentine is the person driving the bus.
- This means the Argentine can be in either position 1 or 2 since we don't know which one drives the bus yet. However, it tells us that ""bus"" must be associated with the Argentine.

2. The engineer is somewhere to the right of the Argentine.
- If the Argentine were in position 2, there would be no room for the engineer to the right, so the Argentine must be in position 1. This also means the engineer must be in position 2 because there's only one position to the right.

3. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli.
- Given that we have two people and the first clue already places the Argentine (and thus one of the foods) in position 1, this implies the person eating watermelon must be in position 1 and the person eating broccoli in position 2.

4. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
- Since positions are numbered starting from 1 (odd), the only even position we have is 2. This means the person watching adventure movies must be in position 2.

5. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching thriller movies.
- We know from clue 4 that the person watching adventure movies is in position 2, so the person watching thriller movies (and thus rock-climbing) must be in position 1.


Given all these clues:


- Position 1: Argentine, eating watermelon, driving a bus, rock-climbing, watching thriller movies.
- Position 2: Engineer, eating broccoli, riding a snowmobile (since the other transport is taken), drawing (the only hobby left), watching adventure movies.


Also, since the engineer must be Nigerian (as there are only two nationalities and one person is Argentine), we can fill that in as well.


Therefore, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Food          | Watermelon   | Broccoli  |

Lv5-6x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given and fill in the information step by step.


From clue 1: The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the Malaysian.
- This means the Malaysian cannot be on the right side because there needs to be someone with a camping hobby to their right.

From clue 2: The lawyer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
- This gives us a relative position but doesn't tell us which side yet.

From clue 3: The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
- This indicates that juice and the goldfish cannot be on the same side if there are only two sides (left and right), or it means the goldfish's owner drinks something other than juice, placing them in a specific order.


Let's start filling out based on these clues:


1. Since the Malaysian has to be on one side for the camping hobbyist to be to their right, let's assume the Malaysian is on the left (column 1). If the Malaysian were on the right, there'd be no space for someone with a camping hobby to their right.


|               |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |            |          |
| Hobby         |            |          |
| Job           |            |          |
| Nationality   | Italian    | Malaysian|
| Pet           |            |          |
| Sport         |            |          |

However, we initially placed ""Italian"" in column 1 for demonstration. Let's correct the approach according to the clues without premature assumptions:


Given clue 1 implies the camping hobbyist is to the right of the Malaysian, but doesn't specify which nationality is on which side directly from this clue alone, let's re-evaluate all clues together.


- The lawyer must be on the left of the sailing enthusiast (clue 2).
- The juice drinker is to the right of the goldfish owner (clue 3).


Without loss of generality and considering we have two distinct options for each category, let's properly align them with the clues:


For simplicity and following the format strictly as requested without intermediate steps in the table, here's a straightforward deduction based on given conditions:


Given the constraints:
- A lawyer is to the left of someone who prefers sailing.
- The person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the Malaysian.
- Juice drinker is to the right of the goldfish owner.


The solution must fit these criteria while also considering all other combinations. Let's deduce directly:


If we place the lawyer on the left, they cannot be sailing (from clue 2), so their sport could be ice-hockey, making the person on the right like sailing. The Malaysian being on the left means camping is on the right, fulfilling clue 1.


Now, let's properly fill out the table based on deductions and clues without incorrect assumptions:


Given the need for a systematic approach to not confuse the steps:


The lawyer (Job) must be on the left of the person who likes sailing (Sport), so if we assume the lawyer is in column 1, the sailing enthusiast could be in column 2.


Considering all combinations and given constraints, let's finalize the solution directly into the table format as requested without intermediate incorrect placements:


Given the clues:
1. Camping hobbyist to the right of Malaysian.
2. Lawyer to the left of sailing sport.
3. Juice drinker to the right of goldfish owner.


Let's solve it directly with these conditions in mind and fill out the correct table according to all given constraints and clues without incorrect assumptions:


The final answer is:

Lv5-6x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is writing is the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
2. The person whose hobby is writing is on the left of the teacher.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the owner of the cat.
4. The person eating orange is somewhere to the left of the teacher.


From clue 1, we know that writing and ice-hockey are associated with the same person.


From clue 2, since the writer (and thus the ice-hockey player) is to the left of the teacher, this means the teacher cannot be in column 1.


Considering all jobs, hobbies, sports, pets, transports, and foods must be unique to each person, let's start filling in what we know:


- The teacher can only be in column 2 because the writer (and ice-hockey player) is to their left.
- Since the writer is on the left of the teacher and is also an ice-hockey player, this person cannot be the teacher but must be a lawyer (the only other job), placing them in column 1.


Now, let's tackle clue 3: The jet-ski user is to the left of the cat owner. Since we've established that the writer/ice-hockey player/lawyer is in column 1, and if this person uses the jet-ski, they must be to the left of the cat owner (who could be the teacher in column 2). However, we don't yet know who owns the cat or who prefers the airplane.


Clue 4 tells us that the orange eater is somewhere to the left of the teacher. Given our current setup, this means the person eating orange must be in column 1 because the teacher is confirmed to be in column 2.


Let's summarize what we have so far:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Food        | orange    | pineapple|
| Hobby       | writing   | hiking   |
| Job         | lawyer    | teacher  |
| Pet         | ?         | ?        |
| Sport       | ice-hockey| tennis   |
| Transport   | jet-ski   | airplane |


Now, let's fill in the pets based on clue 3. Since the jet-ski user (in column 1) is to the left of the cat owner, and we've placed the jet-ski in column 1, the cat must be owned by the person in column 2, leaving the bird for column 1.


So, our completed table looks like this:


#############
|             |     1      |     2     |
| Food        | orange    | pineapple|

1. The person whose sport is cycling is on the left of the person driving the scooter.
2. The person eating cauliflower is somewhere to the left of the Turkish person.
3. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku.

Given these clues, we can start filling in the table:


- From clue 1, if cycling is on the left and the scooter is on the right (in terms of transport), this doesn't directly tell us which column each is in without considering other clues.


- Clue 2 tells us that cauliflower is to the left of Turkish. Without knowing the exact positions yet, we can start forming a relationship between food and nationality.


- Clue 3 indicates mirinda is to the left of sudoku. This gives us a relation between beverage and hobby but doesn't specify columns without further analysis.


Given there are only two options for each category and three clues that establish ""left of"" relationships, let's consider how these might align:


1. Cycling is on the left of the scooter (transport).
2. Cauliflower is to the left of Turkish (food/nationality).
3. Mirinda is to the left of sudoku (beverage/hobby).


Since mirinda must be to the left of sudoku and assuming a direct correlation for simplicity, we could start with mirinda on the left (column 1) because it has to be to the left of sudoku based on clue 3.


If cycling is on the left (as per clue 1), this suggests the person who prefers cycling could also prefer mirinda (placing them in column 1 for beverage and sport, considering we have limited options).


Cauliflower being to the left of Turkish (clue 2) means if mirinda is associated with cauliflower (for simplicity and direct correlation), then the Turkish person must be on the right.


Given these deductions, here's a possible arrangement:


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage      |  Mirinda   |  Water   |
| Food          | Cauliflower|  Onion   |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Sudoku   |
| Nationality   | Spanish    | Turkish  |
| Sport         | Cycling    | Handball |
| Transport     | Jet-ski    | Scooter  |


This arrangement respects all given conditions:
- The person whose sport is cycling (column 1) is on the left of the person driving the scooter (column 2).
- The person eating cauliflower (column 1) is to the left of the Turkish person (column 2).
- The person drinking mirinda (column 1) is to the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku (column 2), assuming a direct association for simplicity.


Given these deductions and ensuring all clues are respected:

| Transport     |           |              |


From clue 4, the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon. Since there are only two types of food and the punk fan is already on the left, this means the person eating pineapple must be on the left.

From clue 3, the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies.

Lv5-6x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The mechanic is on the right of the owner of the dog.
2. The person eating peas is on the far right.
3. The German is on the far left.
4. The fan of indie is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.


From clue 3, we know the German is on the far left. This means the Russian must be on the far right because there are only two nationalities.


## Step 1: Determine Nationality
- Far left (1): German
- Far right (2): Russian


Clue 2 tells us the person eating peas is on the far right, which aligns with the Russian.


## Step 2: Determine Food
- Far left (1): Blueberry (since peas are on the far right)
- Far right (2): Peas


Now, let's consider clue 1, which states the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the dog. This means the dog cannot be owned by the person on the far right because there would be no one to the right of them for the mechanic to be.


## Step 3: Determine Job and Pet
- Since the mechanic must be on the right, they can't be on the far left (which is occupied by the German anyway). The mechanic must then be on the far right if we were just considering this clue alone, but since we know the Russian is on the far right eating peas, it means the mechanic is actually the Russian. However, given that the dog owner cannot be on the far right for the mechanic to be to their right, and knowing the German is on the far left, it suggests a different arrangement might be necessary when considering all clues together.
- The person with the dog must then be on the left (the German), allowing the mechanic to be on the right of them.


## Step 4: Correcting Job and Pet Based on All Clues
- Far left (1): German, Dog, Blueberry
- Far right (2): Russian, ?, Peas


Given that the mechanic must be to the right of the dog owner and considering our current setup:


- The mechanic can indeed be on the far right if we adjust our understanding: The German has a dog, eats blueberries, and is on the left. This means the Russian, who is a mechanic (from clue 1's implication when combined with other information), eats peas and must be involved with either indie or trance music.


## Step 5: Determine Music Genre
- Clue 4 states the fan of indie is to the right of the person driving the taxi. This doesn't directly tell us who likes indie, but it implies that indie cannot be on the far left because there needs to be someone (the taxi driver) to the left of them for this clue to make sense.


## Step 6: Combine All Information
- Far left (1): German, Dog, Blueberry, ?
- Far right (2): Russian, ?, Peas, Mechanic


Given that the mechanic is on the far right and must be to the right of the dog owner, we've established a basic structure. The taxi driver cannot be on the far right because they need to be to the left of someone for clue 4 to work.


## Step 7: Finalize Transport and Music
- If the German (on the far left) drives a taxi, this satisfies clue 4's condition that indie must be to the right of the taxi driver. Therefore:
- Far left (1): German, Dog, Blueberry, Taxi
- This leaves the Russian on the far right with peas, as a mechanic, and since they cannot drive a taxi (that would contradict our setup), they must use a ship for transport.


## Step 8: Finalize Music Genre for Each Person
- Given that indie must be to the right of the taxi driver (German), it means the Russian on the far right could like indie or trance, but since there needs to be an arrangement where indie is specifically to the right of the taxi, and considering our structure:
- The German (taxi) cannot like indie because indie needs to be to their right.
- Therefore, the Russian must like indie to fulfill clue 4.


## Step 9: Finalize Music for the German
- Since there are only two music genres (indie and trance), and the Russian likes indie:
- The German must like trance.


### ## Step 10: Final Solution
Given all clues and steps, we can now fill in our table:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Food          | Blueberry   | Peas     |
| Job           | Photographer| Mechanic |
| Music-Genre   | Trance      | Indie    |

| Pet           | Dog         | Pony     |
| Transport     | Taxi        | Ship     |


Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv5-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The dressmaker is on the right of the photographer. This gives us a partial arrangement for Job:
- Column 1: Photographer
- Column 2: Dressmaker


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since we don't know the exact positions of food preferences yet, let's just note that Apple must be in column 1 and Drama in column 2 for now.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 3
The photographer is on the left or right of the Thai. Given the job arrangement from Step 1 (Photographer in column 1), Thai can either be in column 1 for Nationality, but since Photographer is already placed, it means Thai must be associated with the person in column 2 if we were to place nationalities directly, which doesn't fit because we know the dressmaker is on the right. Therefore, considering our current understanding and the need to not directly assign nationality without other clues:
- Nationality for column 1 could be Dutch (since Photographer can't be Thai based on job placement), implying column 2's nationality is Thai.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. This means Milk must be in column 1, and Reading must be in column 2 because there are only two columns.


## Step 5: Combine All Information
Given all clues:
- Beverage: Column 1 has Milk (because it's to the left of Reading), so Column 2 has Almond-milk.
- Food: Since Apple is on the left of Drama, and we know from Clue 4 that Reading is in column 2, Apple must be associated with column 1 (to fit the ""left of"" condition for Drama which must then be in column 2), leaving Plum for column 2.
- Hobby: Cooking must go with column 1 because Reading is in column 2 based on Clue 4.
- Job: Already determined as Photographer in column 1 and Dressmaker in column 2.
- Movie-Genre: Since Drama is in column 2 (because Apple is to its left), Spy must be in column 1.
- Nationality: If the photographer is next to Thai, but given our job arrangement, Dutch must be with the photographer in column 1, and Thai with the dressmaker in column 2.


The final answer is:

Lv5-6x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 3, we know the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the project-manager. This means the project-manager cannot be in column 1 because there would be no one to the left of them.


Clue 1 tells us the person eating apricot is to the right of the person whose sport is volleyball. Clue 2 states the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the fan of reggae.


Given these clues, let's start by placing the project-manager and the rabbit owner based on clue 3:


|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |            |                 |
| Food          |            |                 |
| Job           | Rabbit Owner | Project-Manager |
| Music-Genre   |            |                 |
| Pet           | Rabbit     |                 |
| Sport         |            |                 |


Now, let's place the sport preferences based on clue 1. Since apricot is to the right of volleyball, and considering our current placement:


|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |            |                 |
| Food          | Lemon      | Apricot         |
| Job           | Rabbit Owner | Project-Manager |
| Music-Genre   |            |                 |
| Pet           | Rabbit     | Cat             |
| Sport         | Volleyball | Tennis          |


Next, let's address clue 2. The fan of reggae must be to the left of almond-milk. Given our setup, this means reggae has to be in column 1 (because if it were in column 2, there would be no room for almond-milk to its right), and thus techno is in column 2.


Now, we need to assign beverages. Since almond-milk must be to the right of reggae:


|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea   | Almond-Milk     |
| Food          | Lemon      | Apricot         |
| Job           | Rabbit Owner | Project-Manager |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae     | Techno          |
| Pet           | Rabbit     | Cat             |
| Sport         | Volleyball | Tennis          |


The person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the fan of reggae, and since we've placed reggae in column 1 and almond-milk in column 2, this condition is satisfied.


Finally, let's review our solution against all clues:


1. The person eating apricot (column 2) is indeed to the right of the person whose sport is volleyball (column 1).
2. The person drinking almond-milk (column 2) is to the right of the fan of reggae (column 1).
3. The owner of the rabbit (column 1) is to the left of the project-manager (column 2).


All conditions are met, so our solution is correct.
