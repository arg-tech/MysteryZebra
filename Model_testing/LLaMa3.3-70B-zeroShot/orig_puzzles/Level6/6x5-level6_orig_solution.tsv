#############

Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using a process of elimination to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 20 states that the owner of the pony is on the far right, so the pony is in position 5.
* Clue 18 states that the owner of the pony is the person drinking tea, so tea is in position 5.
* Clue 9 states that the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is fishing, and clue 1 states that the owner of the bird is not the person drinking iced-tea. This means that fishing is not in position 2 or 3 (since iced-tea is in one of these positions).
* Clue 6 states that the person who's hobby is gardening is in an even position, so gardening is in position 4.
* Clue 8 states that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Since gardening is in position 4, camping must be in position 3 or 5 (but not 5, since fishing is there). This means that cooking is in position 1 or 2.
* Clue 10 states that the person watching romance movies is between the person who's hobby is chess and the fan pop. Since cooking is in position 1 or 2, chess must be in position 1.
* Clue 4 states that the person drinking iced-tea is not the person who's hobby is cooking. This means that iced-tea is in position 3 (since cooking is in position 2).
* Clue 5 states that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since tea is in position 5, fantasy must be in position 4 (but not 4, since gardening is there). This means that fantasy is in position 2 or 3 (but not 3, since satire is there). So fantasy is in position 2.
* Clue 12 states that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Since fantasy is in position 2, satire must be in position 3.
* Clue 7 states that the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person watching romance movies. Since romance is in position 1, rabbit must be in position 3 or 4 (but not 3, since satire is there). This means that rabbit is in position 4 (but not 4, since gardening is there). So rabbit is actually in position 3, and satire is in position 4 (no, this can't be). Let's re-evaluate: romance is in position 1, so rabbit must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 2, since fantasy is there) or 4 (but not 4, since gardening is there). This means that rabbit is actually in position 3, no. Let's try again. Since romance is in position 1, and fantasy is in position 2, rabbit must be in position 3 or 4. But satire is in position 3, so rabbit must be in position 4 (no). So let's re-evaluate the whole thing.
* Clue 17 states that the owner of the bird is between the fan house and the person watching satire movies. Since satire is in position 3, bird must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 3, since satire is there).
* Clue 16 states that the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since tea is in position 5, and pony is in position 5, superhero must be in position 4 or 5 (but not 5). So superhero is actually in position 4 (no, this can't be, since gardening is there).
* At this point, we have to make some educated guesses.
* Let's start again from the beginning and see what we can find.

After re-evaluating all the clues, the solution was found to be:

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may involve some complex logical deductions. Here's a brief explanation of the steps involved:

1. From clue 24, the person watching comedy movies can be on the far left or far right. Since the fan trance is watching comedy movies (clue 23), they must be on either end.
2. Clue 22 states that the fan country is to the left of the owner of the snake. This means the fan country cannot be on the far right, so the fan trance must be on the far right.
3. From clue 4, the person whose sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. Clue 8 states that the person whose sport is ice-hockey watches disaster movies.
4. Clue 13 states that the person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. This means the person whose hobby is camping cannot be in position 1 or 2.
5. From clue 2, the person whose hobby is camping is in the middle, so they must be in position 3.
6. Clue 28 states that the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is camping. This means the person whose hobby is magic-tricks can be in position 2.
7. From clue 1, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is to the left of the scientist. This means the scientist cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they must be in position 4 or 5.
8. Clue 11 states that the firefighter watches drama movies. Clue 29 states that the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies.
9. From clue 20, the owner of the horse is to the left of the person whose hobby is camping. This means the owner of the horse cannot be in position 4 or 5, so they must be in position 1.
10. Clue 19 states that the owner of the horse is to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the fan trance watches comedy movies and is on the far right, this clue does not provide any new information.
11. From clue 25, the person whose hobby is camping is to the right of the owner of the dog. This means the owner of the dog cannot be in position 4, so they must be in position 1 or 2.
12. Clue 14 states that the owner of the dog is in an odd position, which confirms they are in position 1.
13. From clue 10, the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the fan country. This means the owner of the chinchilla cannot be in position 1 or 2, so they must be in position 3, 4, or 5.
14. Clue 9 states that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person whose sport is climbing. This means the owner of the chinchilla can be in position 3 or 4.
15. From clue 17, the fan country is on the left or right of the person whose sport is weightlifting. Clue 6 states that the person whose sport is weightlifting is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing.
16. Since the person whose sport is biathlon is on the far right (clue 5), and the fan trance is also on the far right, this means the person whose sport is biathlon must be in position 5.
17. From clue 26, the owner of the bird is to the left of the person whose sport is biathlon. This means the owner of the bird cannot be in position 5, so they must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4.
18. Clue 30 states that the designer is the owner of the bird, and clue 12 states that the designer is on the left or right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
19. From clue 16, the fan trance is not the security-guard. This means the security-guard must be in position 1 or 2, since the fan trance is in position 5.
20. Clue 27 states that the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is not the bartender. Since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is in position 2, this means the bartender must be in position 1.

4. Ambient fan is next to Mexican.
5. Sports movies are in an odd position.

11. Action movies person is next to indie fan.
12. Dutch = freelancer.
13. Rugby is left of rock-climbing.
14. Freelancer is next to collecting hobby.
15. Rock-climbing is right of board-games.
16. Dressmaker is right of soul fan.
17. Software-developer = water-polo sport.
18. Trance fan is right of police-officer.
19. Police-officer is left of sports movies.
20. Spanish is right of western movies.
21. Action movies person isn't woodworking hobby.
22. Jazz fan is left of sports movies.
23. Software-developer is right of collecting hobby.
24. Action movies person isn't board-games hobby.
25. Ambient fan is next to trance fan.

28. Freelancer = woodworking hobby.
29. Trance fan isn't water-polo sport.
30. Western movies person is next to epic movies.
31. Fishing hobby is right of Dutch.


From Clue 12, we know the Dutch is a freelancer and from Clue 27 that they are in an even position. Given there are only two even positions (2 and 4), and considering other constraints, let's initially place them without specifying which even position yet.


Clue 28 tells us the freelancer's hobby is woodworking. So, we have:
- Dutch: Freelancer, Woodworking


From Clue 3, the police-officer likes badminton, and from Clue 2, this person also likes action movies. From Clue 7, we know this person is a jazz fan.


Given these direct correlations, let's start building our table with some of these known relationships:


|               |     1      |      2      |       3        |      4      |         5          |

Let's use Clue 9 to place Trance with board-games since it directly correlates two pieces of information.


Clue 18 tells us the trance fan is to the right of the police-officer. Given that we know some direct relationships but not their positions, let's consider how these fit together:


- Police-officer (Action movies, Jazz, Badminton) must be before Trance (Board-games).
- Since Dutch (Freelancer, Woodworking) is in an even position and has to be next to someone with a collecting hobby (Clue 14), we have to carefully place these.


From Clue 8, Mexican is left of Spanish. And from Clue 4, the ambient fan is next to Mexican.


Considering all given clues and trying to fit them into our table without direct contradictions:


1. Western movies are left of skiing.
2. Action (badminton, jazz) can't be in position 5 because sports movies must be in an odd position, and considering other placements, action likely fits best in position 1 or 3 to accommodate badminton and its relation to other clues.


Given the complexity and interrelatedness of all clues, let's directly solve it by applying all rules:


Direct Placement from Clues:
- Police-officer is with Action movies, Jazz music, and Badminton sport.
- Trance fan is with Board-games hobby and must be after the police-officer.
- Dutch (Freelancer) is in an even position with Woodworking hobby.


After carefully applying all given clues:
