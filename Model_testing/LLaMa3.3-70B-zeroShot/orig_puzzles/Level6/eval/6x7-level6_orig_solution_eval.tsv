#############

Note: This solution is obtained by applying the given rules and constraints to the table. The process involves using logical deductions and elimination techniques to fill in the table step by step.

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:

* Clue 1: The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right (clue 20), the person who's sport is basketball must be to their left.
* Clue 2: The person who's sport is climbing is in an even position. This means they can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6.
* Clue 10: The person who's sport is climbing is the person driving the tram. This helps to narrow down their position further.
* Clue 15: The person driving the motorbike is not the person eating cherry. This helps to eliminate some possibilities for the motorbike driver.
* Clue 28: The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. This gives us a relationship between the motorbike driver and the rugby player.

By applying these clues and others, we can gradually fill in the table until we reach the final solution."	{'food': ['watermelon', 'nectarine', 'garlic', 'cucumber', 'cherry', 'strawberry', 'plum'], 'hobby': ['traveling', 'collecting', 'rock-climbing', 'sudoku', 'card-games', 'dancing', 'drawing'], 'job': ['bartender', 'engineer', 'security-guard', 'paramedic', 'librarian', 'analyst', 'electrician'], 'pet': ['mouse', 'hamster', 'hedgehog', 'snake', 'rabbit', 'horse', 'frog'], 'sport': ['soccer', 'cricket', 'rugby', 'basketball', 'skiing', 'snowboarding', 'climbing'], 'transport': ['quad-bike', 'train', 'motorbike', 'airplane', 'taxi', 'tram', 'bus']}	True	7	False

2. Use clue 1 (the person drinking juice is on the left or right of the owner of the snake) to place the person drinking juice next to the owner of the snake.
3. Apply clue 26 (the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake) to determine that the person drinking juice is on the left of the owner of the snake.
4. Continue applying the clues in a similar manner, using the process of elimination and logical deductions to narrow down the possible options for each category.
5. Clue 39 (the person drinking tea is the person watching crime movies) helps to place the person drinking tea and watching crime movies in position 7.
6. Clue 43 (the fan dubstep is the person drinking almond-milk) helps to place the fan of dubstep music and the person drinking almond-milk in position 2.
