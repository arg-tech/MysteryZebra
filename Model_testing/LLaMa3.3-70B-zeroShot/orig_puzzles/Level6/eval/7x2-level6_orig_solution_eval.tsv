Lv6-7x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2
The person drinking water is on the far left. This means the first column represents someone who drinks water.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 6
The fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony. Since we don't know the position yet, we just note that dubstep and pony go together.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The Italian is in an odd position. Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means the Italian must be in position 1 because it's the only odd position available.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. This implies that cricket cannot be in the second position (since there's no one to the right of the second position), so cricket must be associated with the first position, and thus, trike with the second.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 4
The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake. Since we know the Italian (and thus the cricket player) is in the first position and drives a trike (from step 4), the scooter must be associated with the second position, but this contradicts our understanding from clue 5 unless we reinterpret: the person driving the scooter could indeed be to the left of the snake owner if the snake owner is also in the second position but for a different category. However, given the constraints about transport and other clues, it's clear that the first position (Italian, cricket, trike) has been somewhat defined, and we need to adjust our understanding based on all clues together.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 1
The person whose hobby is writing is not a fan of hip-hop. This clue, combined with others, starts to narrow down possibilities but requires cross-referencing with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 7: Reconcile and Place
Given the Italian is in position 1 (Step 3), drinks water (since the water drinker is on the far left, Clue 2), and considering the constraints around hobbies, music genres, pets, sports, and transport:
- The person who likes dubstep owns a pony (Clue 6). If this were the Italian, it would conflict with no direct clue but would help in placing other preferences.
- Since cricket is associated with the first position (to allow trike to be on the right, Clue 5), and given the Italian's placement, we can start filling in:
1. Water (Beverage)
2. Writing or Drawing (Hobby) - needs further clarification
3. Dubstep or Hip-hop (Music-Genre) - since dubstep goes with pony, and if this is the Italian, then hip-hop must be in the second position.
4. Italian (Nationality) - already placed
5. Pony or Snake (Pet) - if the Italian has a pony (to go with dubstep), then the snake is in the second position.
6. Cricket (Sport) - associated with the first position to allow trike on the right.
7. Trike (Transport) - must be in the second position based on Clue 5.

However, we need to correct our approach considering all clues accurately:
- The water drinker is on the far left (Clue 2).
- The Italian is in an odd position (Clue 3), which is the first position.
- Given the constraints and re-evaluating for accurate placement considering all categories and clues provided, let's directly construct a solution table based on all given information:


Given Clue 6 (dubstep fan owns a pony) and other constraints:
1. The Italian drinks water, is into cricket (to have trike on the right), and must be associated with either dubstep or hip-hop. Since dubstep goes with the pony (Clue 6), let's place that combination.
2. For hobbies, if writing isn't with hip-hop (Clue 1), then it could potentially be with dubstep, but we need to ensure all other clues fit.


The final answer is:

Lv6-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the lizard is on the left or right of the fan of ambient music. This clue doesn't give us a specific position yet, but it links the lizard's owner with the ambient music fan.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. This gives us a relative position but not an absolute one without knowing where the mirinda drinker is.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The lawyer is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. This clue starts to give us some structure, indicating the lawyer and the traveler are in a specific order.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person who's hobby is traveling is not the person watching horror movies. This helps to differentiate between hobbies and movie preferences but doesn't give direct positions.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching satire movies. This clue directly links a mode of transport with a movie genre.


Given these clues, we need to start piecing together the information.


From Clue 3, we know the lawyer is on the left of the traveler.


Clue 5 tells us the quad-bike driver watches satire movies.


Since the person who likes traveling doesn't watch horror (Clue 4), and considering the other clues, let's start building a possible table based on the given information:


Given that we have to link each piece of information carefully, let's assign based on Clue 5 first, as it gives us a direct connection between an activity (transport) and a preference (movie genre).


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Hobby         |         |           |
| Job           |         |           |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |
| Pet           |         |           |
| Transport     |         |           |


From Clue 5, the quad-bike driver watches satire movies. Let's place this person in column 1 for now to start building our puzzle.


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Hobby         |         |           |
| Job           |         |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire  |           |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |
| Pet           |         |           |
| Transport     | Quad    |           |


Now, using Clue 3, the lawyer is on the left of the traveler. This means our column 1 could be the lawyer (since we've already placed someone there), and the traveler would then be in column 2.


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      |         |           |
| Hobby         |         | Traveling |
| Job           | Lawyer  |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire  |           |
| Music-Genre   |         |           |
| Pet           |         |           |
| Transport     | Quad    |           |


Given the lawyer is now in column 1, and from Clue 4 that the traveler doesn't watch horror movies, we can deduce the movie genre for column 2 must be horror because satire is already assigned to column 1.


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      |         |           |

| Pet           |         |           |
| Transport     | Quad    |           |


Clue 2 tells us the goat owner is on the right of the mirinda drinker. Since we have a structure starting to form, let's fill in the beverage for column 2 as mirinda (because if the lawyer drinks iced-tea, it fits the clue that the goat owner is on the right of the mirinda drinker).


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea| Mirinda   |
| Hobby         |         | Traveling |
| Job           | Lawyer  |           |

| Pet           |         | Goat      |
| Transport     | Quad    |           |


The job for column 2 must then be the paramedic, as it's the only option left.

| Beverage      | Iced-Tea| Mirinda   |

| Pet           |         | Goat      |
| Transport     | Quad    |           |


From Clue 1, the lizard owner is next to the ambient music fan. Given the setup, column 1 must be the ambient music fan because we've placed the goat (and thus its owner) in column 2.


|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea| Mirinda   |

This setup satisfies all the given clues.

Lv6-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose sport is surfing is somewhere to the right of the person eating kale. This means the person eating kale cannot be in column 2 if surfing is in column 2.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person whose hobby is camping is not the person driving the taxi. This clue doesn't directly tell us which columns these activities are in but gives a relationship between two categories.


## Step 3: Use Clue 3
The Spanish person is on the right of the person eating kale. If kale is in column 1, then Spanish must be in column 2.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person watching action movies is the person whose hobby is camping. This links two categories but doesn't specify which columns they are in.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The fan of reggae music is on the left or right of the person whose sport is surfing. Since surfing must be to the right of kale (from clue 1), and if we consider kale being in column 1, then surfing could be in column 2, with reggae either in column 1 or 2 but associated with surfing.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 6
The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German. This implies that if the German is in column 1, adventure movies must be in column 2.


## Step 7: Start Building the Table
From clue 3 and clue 6, we can start to piece together some information:
- If Spanish is in column 2 (clue 3), and the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the German (clue 6), then German must be in column 1 because adventure movies are associated with column 2.


## Step 8: Further Deductions
Given that kale is in column 1 (as it's the only way for all other conditions to be met, especially with surfing being to its right and Spanish also being to its right), we can start filling in:
- Food: Kale in column 1, Tomato in column 2 (since there are only two types of food).
- Nationality: German in column 1, Spanish in column 2.


## Step 9: Linking Hobbies with Other Categories
From clue 4, the person watching action movies has a hobby of camping. Since adventure movies are on the right of the German (clue 6), and given that German is in column 1, action movies must be associated with the German because it's the only way for all conditions to be met without contradicting other clues.


## Step 10: Finalizing Movie-Genre
Movie-Genre: Action in column 1 (associated with German and camping), Adventure in column 2.


## Step 11: Sport and Music-Genre Associations
From clue 1, surfing is to the right of kale. Given kale is in column 1, surfing must be in column 2.
From clue 5, reggae music is on the left or right of surfing. Since surfing is in column 2, and considering other placements, jazz could be in column 1, making reggae associated with column 2 (as it has to be near surfing).


## Step 12: Finalizing Sport and Music-Genre
Sport: Given surfing is in column 2, snowboarding must be in column 1.
Music-Genre: Jazz in column 1, Reggae in column 2.


## Step 13: Hobby Placement
From clue 4, the person watching action movies has a hobby of camping. Thus, camping is associated with column 1 (and German).
Hobby: Camping in column 1, Skydiving in column 2.


## Step 14: Transport Placement
From clue 2, the person whose hobby is camping is not driving the taxi. Given camping is in column 1, and to satisfy all conditions without contradiction, taxi must be associated with column 2 (making trike associated with column 1).


## Step 15: Finalizing Transport
Transport: Trike in column 1, Taxi in column 2.

Lv6-7x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the correct arrangement of preferences for each person.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. This means the gardener cannot be in column 2 if the 7up drinker is in column 1, but since we don't know the exact positions yet, we'll keep this in mind for further deductions.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person watching sports movies is not the person eating apricot. This gives us a direct exclusion but doesn't tell us the position directly.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the fan of jazz. This clue links food preference with music genre but doesn't specify positions relative to other categories yet.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. Similar to Clue 3, it gives us a relationship between transport and pet but no direct positioning.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The fan of jazz is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. This clue starts to give us some positional information regarding music preference and pet ownership.


## Step 6: Start Building the Table with Known Information
From Clue 5, we know the jazz fan must be to the left of the dog owner. Let's assume the jazz fan is in column 1 for now because if they were in column 2, there would be no one to their left, which contradicts the clue that they are to the left of the dog owner.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 3 with New Information
Given the jazz fan is in column 1, and from Clue 3, the carrot eater must be next to the jazz fan. This means the carrot eater could potentially be in either column, but since we've placed the jazz fan in column 1, the carrot eater would logically go in column 2 to satisfy ""on the left or right.""


## Step 8: Apply Clue 4
The helicopter driver is on the left or right of the dog owner. If we consider the jazz fan (now in column 1) and the potential placement of the carrot eater (column 2), and knowing the dog owner must be after the jazz fan, the helicopter could fit either before or after the dog owner but must be adjacent.


## Step 9: Finalize Positions Based on All Clues
- From Clue 1, the gardener is to the left of the 7up drinker.
- The sports movie watcher isn't the apricot eater (Clue 2), which means if we assume the apricot eater is in column 1 (to satisfy other conditions indirectly), the sports movie fan could be in column 2.
- Given the jazz fan's placement in column 1 and the need for the dog owner to be after them, we can start filling in more specific details:
- Column 1: Jazz fan, eats apricot (since carrot is linked to jazz but must be adjacent, and we have other categories to fit), owns a frog (to leave dog for column 2), drinks hot chocolate (leaving 7up for column 2), watches horror movies (sports in column 2), has rock climbing as a hobby (gardening in column 2 doesn't fit due to the 7up placement from Clue 1), uses a helicopter.
- Column 2: Eats carrot, owns a dog, drinks 7up, watches sports movies, has gardening as a hobby, uses a jet-ski.

Lv6-7x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The engineer is on the left of the person drinking water. This means the engineer cannot be in column 2 if the person drinking water is also in column 2, but since there are only two people, it implies the engineer must be in column 1 and the person drinking water in column 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. This means the person watching adventure movies must be in column 1, and the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since there are only two columns, this means if the guinea-pig owner is in column 1, the skateboard driver must be in column 2.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person who's sport is handball is not the person who's hobby is camping. This clue does not directly tell us which column to place these activities but indicates a relationship between two people.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Given that there are only two columns and considering clue 3, if the skateboard driver is in column 2 (as suggested by clue 3 when considering possible placements), then the surfer must be in column 1.


## Step 6: Combining Clues
From clue 1, the engineer is in column 1. From clue 2, the adventure movie watcher is also in column 1. Clue 5 places the surfer in column 1. Since handball cannot be with camping (clue 4), and surfing is already in column 1, we can start to piece together the activities.


## Step 7: Finalizing Placements
Given that the engineer, adventure movie fan, and surfer are all in column 1, we need to assign these roles while respecting other clues. The skateboard driver (clue 3) and time-travel movie fan (clue 2) must be in column 2.


## Step 8: Placing Remaining Activities
- Engineer is in column 1.
- Adventure movies are watched by the person in column 1.
- Surfing is the sport of the person in column 1.
- Water drinker is in column 2 (clue 1).
- Time-travel movies are watched by the person in column 2.
- Skateboard driver is in column 2 (from clue 3 and previous deductions).
- Given surfing is in column 1, handball must be in column 2 to fulfill clue 4 and because there's only one sport left for column 2.


## Step 9: Final Placements
Considering all clues:
- Column 1 has the engineer, watches adventure movies, surfs, drinks milk (since water is in column 2), and we need to fit camping or cooking here without violating any rules. Since handball is not with camping (clue 4) and handball must be in column 2, camping can go with surfing/engineer/adventure movies.
- Column 2 has the musician (only job left), watches time-travel movies, drives a skateboard, drinks water, does handball, and we need to fit either cooking or the remaining pet here. Given the guinea-pig owner's relationship with the skateboard driver (clue 3), if the guinea-pig is in column 1, it violates no rules directly but considering all placements, the goat can be placed with the musician.


## Step 10: Finalizing
Given the above analysis:
- Column 1: Engineer, Adventure movies, Surfer, Milk drinker, Camping, Guinea-pig owner.
- Column 2: Musician, Time-travel movies, Skateboard driver, Water drinker, Handball player, Goat owner.

Lv6-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


1. The fan of blues is not the person watching time-travel movies.
2. The person drinking coffee is in an odd position.
3. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
4. The fan of blues is the paramedic.
5. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.


From clue 2, we know coffee is in an odd position, which means it can only be in position 1 since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and both are odd or even depending on the context given. However, considering typical logic puzzle conventions where ""odd"" refers to the first of a pair when counting starts at 1, coffee should indeed be in position 1.


Given clue 4, we know the blues fan is also the paramedic. Combining this with clue 1, we understand that the paramedic (blues fan) does not watch time-travel movies, so they must watch family movies.


Clue 3 tells us the filmmaker is to the right of the taxi driver. This means the taxi driver cannot be in position 2 because there's no one to their right, implying the taxi driver must be in position 1, and thus the filmmaker (who likes blues and is a paramedic) must be in position 2.


However, we've established that coffee is in an odd position, which means it should be with the person in position 1. Given this, and knowing the blues fan (paramedic) is in position 2 because they are to the right of the taxi driver (who drinks coffee), we have a contradiction unless we reconsider our initial assumption about ""odd"" positions strictly meaning the first position. In logic puzzles, an odd position typically means not an even number when counting starts at 1, but since we only have two positions and both could be considered odd or even depending on context (first or second in a sequence of two), the critical clue is actually about relative positioning based on other clues.


Let's correct our approach with this understanding:


- Clue 4 says the blues fan is the paramedic.
- Clue 1 indicates the blues fan doesn't watch time-travel movies, so they must prefer family movies.
- Clue 5 tells us the lizard owner is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.


Given that we know the blues fan (paramedic) prefers family movies and considering clue 3 about the filmmaker being to the right of the taxi driver, let's correctly place these individuals based on all clues:


Since the paramedic likes blues and watches family movies, and is not watching time-travel (from clue 1), they can be in either position. However, given that the lizard owner is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies (clue 5) and assuming each preference is unique to an individual:


Let's place the paramedic (blues fan, family movie watcher) in position 2 for now because we need to figure out who watches time-travel movies based on other clues.


Clue 3 says the filmmaker is to the right of the taxi driver. If the filmmaker were in position 1, there would be no one to their right. Thus, the taxi driver must be in position 1.


Now, combining all information:


- The person drinking coffee (from clue 2) being in an odd position could mean either 1 or 2 since our positions are limited and contextually dependent.
- Given that the paramedic likes blues and watches family movies, if we consider them to be in position 2 based on previous deductions for simplicity:
  - This leaves us with the taxi driver (who could drink coffee) in position 1.
  - The lizard owner is to the left of the time-travel movie watcher (clue 5), suggesting the lizard owner is in position 1, which aligns with our current placement of the taxi driver.


Considering all clues together for a coherent solution:


- Position 1: Taxi driver, drinks coffee (to fulfill clue 2 about an odd position, assuming the first position as 'odd' in a sequence starting from 1), owns a lizard (since they're to the left of the time-travel movie fan), and their hobby could be sudoku because filmmaking is taken by someone else.
- Position 2: Paramedic, drinks water (since coffee is taken), watches family movies, likes blues music, and their hobby must be filmmaking as it's the only one left that fits all given conditions.


The final solution table considering these deductions would look something like this:


#############
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Water      |
| Hobby         | Sudoku   | Filmmaking |

Lv6-7x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 3 - The person driving the subway is British.
This gives us a starting point but doesn't fill in any specific boxes yet.


## Step 2: Use Clue 2 - The person whose hobby is board-games is on the left of the person driving the subway.
Since we know from Clue 3 that the person driving the subway is British, this clue helps in arranging hobbies relative to transport but doesn't give us specific nationalities or hobbies for each column yet.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 1 - The fan of trance music is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling.
This clue starts to give us some arrangement based on music genre and sport, but we still need to connect it with other clues.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 5 - The person whose sport is rugby is the owner of the horse.
This clue directly links a sport with a pet but doesn't specify which column it belongs to yet.


## Step 5: Consider Clue 4 - The person watching scientific movies is not the owner of the horse.
Given that the owner of the horse watches rugby (from Clue 5), this means the person who likes scientific movies cannot be into rugby, indirectly linking movie genre with sport and pet.


## Step 6: Combine All Clues
From Clue 2 and knowing the subway driver is British (Clue 3), we can start building a profile for each column. The board-games hobbyist must be on the left of the subway user, suggesting the left person has a different transport method (quad-bike) and is not British.


## Step 7: Link Music Genre with Other Preferences
Given that the trance fan is to the left of the cycling enthusiast (Clue 1), and knowing from Clue 5 that rugby is linked with the horse, we can start linking these preferences. If rugby is on the right (because it's associated with the horse, and scientific movies are not with the horse, implying family movies might be), then cycling must be on the left.


## Step 8: Finalize Nationality, Hobby, and Transport
- The British person drives the subway (Clue 3) and is on the right.
- The board-games enthusiast is on the left of the subway driver (Clue 2), making them not British, thus German.
- The transport for the German must be quad-bike since the British person uses the subway.


## Step 9: Determine Movie Genre
Since the scientific movie fan doesn't own a horse (Clue 4) and rugby is associated with the horse (Clue 5), the scientific movie fan must be on the left, watching family movies cannot be with the horse owner, thus the left person watches scientific movies.


## Step 10: Link Music Genre and Sport
The trance music fan is to the left of the cycling enthusiast (Clue 1). Given rugby is associated with the horse and presumably on the right, cycling must indeed be on the left. This means hip-hop must be associated with rugby since trance is linked with cycling indirectly through the clues.


## Step 11: Assemble Final Table
Given all deductions:
- Left: German, board-games, scientific movies, trance music, cycling, quad-bike, guinea-pig (since the horse is with rugby).
- Right: British, collecting, family movies, hip-hop music, rugby, subway, horse.

The final answer is:

Lv6-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person whose sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is sudoku.
2. The owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is not the person whose sport is badminton.
4. The librarian is somewhere to the left of the bartender.
5. The person watching thriller movies is not the person whose sport is badminton.

From clue 4, we know the order for Job: librarian, bartender.


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions based on the job
Given the librarian is to the left of the bartender, we can start filling in the table with this information. However, without specific details on how these align with other categories directly from the clues, we need to look at intersections of information.


## Step 2: Use clue 1 to determine sport positions relative to hobby
Since basketball must be to the right of sudoku, and considering there are only two options for each category, badminton must correspond with sudoku if it's not directly stated otherwise. This implies a potential arrangement but doesn't give us direct answers without considering other clues.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 regarding pet and transport
The ferret owner is to the left of the bike rider. Without knowing the exact hobby or job associated, we can infer that if one person has a ferret, they cannot ride a bike based on this clue alone.


## Step 4: Analyze clues 3 and 5 for beverage and movie-genre
The soy-milk drinker is not into badminton, and the thriller watcher isn't into badminton either. This means both soy-milk and thriller movie preferences are associated with basketball since there are only two options for each category.


## Step 5: Piece together all information to form a coherent table
Given the above steps and clues:
- Librarian is to the left of bartender (clue 4).
- Ferret owner is to the left of bike rider (clue 2), implying ferret could be with librarian if we consider the possibility that librarian doesn't ride a bike.
- Basketball is to the right of sudoku (clue 1), and since badminton can't be with thriller or soy-milk, it must align with sudoku.
- Soy-milk drinker isn't into badminton (clue 3), so they must be into basketball.
- Thriller watcher isn't into badminton (clue 5), also implying an association with basketball.

Considering all clues:
- If the librarian is to the left and can't ride a bike if they have a ferret, we pair librarian with ferret and possibly sudoku or baking as hobbies since these are flexible.
- Bartender then pairs with snake (as the other pet) and must be associated with basketball because of clue 1's implication on sports order relative to hobbies.


## Step 6: Finalize the table based on deductions
Based on deductions:
- The person who likes badminton can't watch thrillers or drink soy-milk, so they likely drink hot-chocolate and watch comedies.
- Basketball must be with soy-milk (from clue 3) and thriller movies (from clue 5), leaving badminton for the other combination.


Given these steps and logical deductions, a potential arrangement could look like this:


#############
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | soy-milk   |
| Hobby         | sudoku        | baking     |
| Job           | librarian     | bartender  |

| Pet           | ferret        | snake      |
| Sport         | badminton     | basketball |
| Transport     | train         | bike       |
#############


This solution respects all given conditions:
- Librarian is to the left of bartender.
- Ferret owner (librarian) is to the left of bike rider (bartender).
- Basketball is to the right of sudoku.
- Soy-milk drinker and thriller watcher are associated with basketball, not badminton.


The final answer is:

Lv6-7x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


Given information:
1. Beverages: sprite, tea
2. Foods: apricot, cauliflower
3. Jobs: fisherman, writer
4. Movie-Genres: adventure, sports
5. Music-Genres: hip-hop, pop
6. Sports: baseball, basketball
7. Transports: scooter, ship

Clues:
1. The person drinking sprite is in an even position.
2. The person eating apricot is the writer.
3. The person whose sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the fisherman.
4. The person whose sport is baseball is not the person watching adventure movies.
5. The person driving the ship is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:


## Step 1: Apply clue 2
Since the person eating apricot is the writer, we can start by placing ""apricot"" and ""writer"" in one column. Let's place them in column 1 for now, as there's no restriction given yet about the position of the writer.


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Food          | apricot    |            |
| Job           | writer     |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     |             |            |

## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The person drinking sprite is in an even position, which means they must be in column 2.


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | tea        | sprite    |
| Food          | apricot    |            |
| Job           | writer     |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     |             |            |

## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The person driving the ship is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. This means the ship must be in column 1, and since the writer is already there, we can assign the ship to the writer.


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | tea        | sprite    |
| Food          | apricot    |            |
| Job           | writer     |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     | ship       |            |

## Step 4: Determine the food for column 2
Since there are only two types of food and apricot is already assigned to column 1, cauliflower must go in column 2.


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | tea        | sprite    |
| Food          | apricot    | cauliflower|
| Job           | writer     |            |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     | ship       |            |

## Step 5: Apply clue 3
The person whose sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the fisherman. Since the writer (column 1) could be either the fisherman or not, but there's no direct clue linking the writer with a specific sport yet, we'll have to consider other clues for more information.


## Step 6: Apply clue 4
The person whose sport is baseball is not the person watching adventure movies. This doesn't directly tell us who watches adventure movies or who plays baseball, but it gives us a relation.


Given the constraints and trying to fit all clues:
- The writer (column 1) must have a ship (from clue 5), and since the writer eats apricot, this is consistent.
- The person in column 2 drinks sprite and eats cauliflower. Since the person with basketball is to the right of the fisherman, and assuming the fisherman could be in column 1 (as it's the only position that makes sense for ""to the right"" to apply), this would mean the fisherman is likely the writer, given the need for the ship to be on the left.
- The remaining job (fisherman) must then go to column 2 or be associated with column 1 if we consider the jobs' distribution.


Considering all clues and making logical deductions:
- Column 1 has tea, apricot, writer, ship. The sport here could be baseball because clue 4 only states that the person whose sport is baseball is not watching adventure movies, but it doesn't restrict the writer from being associated with baseball.
- Column 2 has sprite, cauliflower, fisherman (as the remaining job), and must have basketball as its sport due to clue 3.


For movie genres and music genres:
- Since the person with baseball (column 1) isn't watching adventure movies (clue 4), they must watch sports movies.
- This leaves adventure movies for column 2.
- For music, given that hip-hop's fan is to the right of the ship (clue 5), and the ship is in column 1, hip-hop must be in column 2, leaving pop for column 1.


Thus, we deduce:
- Transport for column 2 must be scooter since ship is taken by column 1.


The final solution table is:

Lv6-7x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is not the owner of the dog.
3. The electrician is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker.
4. The person whose hobby is reading is not the person driving the jet-ski.
5. The fan of R&B is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.

Given that we have two columns (1 and 2), let's start assigning based on the clues:


- From clue 5, since the R&B fan is to the left of the reader, and there are only two columns, the R&B fan must be in column 1, and the reader must be in column 2.


- Clue 4 tells us that the jet-ski user isn't the reader. Since the reader is already placed in column 2, the jet-ski could potentially be in either column 1 or 2, but we need more information to decide.


- From clue 3, knowing the electrician is to the right of the dressmaker, this means the dressmaker must be in column 1, and the electrician in column 2.


- Clue 1 states the dog owner is to the right of the drama movie fan. If the drama fan were in column 2, there would be no one to the right for the dog owner, so the drama fan must be in column 1, making the dog owner in column 2.


- From clue 2, since almond-milk isn't drunk by the dog owner (who's now known to be in column 2), and considering the placements so far, we can deduce the following about beverages and pets but need more specific connections for other categories.


Let's try to piece together what we have so far without direct assignments:


|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             |             |
| Hobby         | R&B fan     | Reader      |
| Job           | Dressmaker  | Electrician |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama       |             |
| Music-Genre   | R&B         |             |
| Pet           |             | Dog         |
| Transport     |             |             |

Given the remaining clues and our current setup:


- Since the drama fan is in column 1, and the dog owner (also the non-drama movie fan, thus adventure) must be in column 2, we can fill that in.


- The jet-ski user isn't the reader (column 2), so they must use the bus or jet-ski. Since there's no one left to place in a way that contradicts other clues regarding transport for column 1, and considering all other placements, let's assign based on what we know:


For column 1:
- Beverage: Almond-milk can't be with the dog owner (column 2), so it could potentially fit here.
- Hobby: Already determined as R&B fan.
- Job: Dressmaker.
- Movie-Genre: Drama.
- Music-Genre: R&B.
- Pet: Hamster, since the dog is in column 2.
- Transport: Considering the reader can't use the jet-ski and assuming a distribution that fits all criteria without contradiction, this leaves us with bus for column 1 or an arrangement where transport isn't directly contradicted by other clues.


For column 2:
- Beverage: Cola (since almond-milk is in column 1 based on our deduction).
- Hobby: Reader.
- Job: Electrician.
- Movie-Genre: Adventure (as it's the only one left and fits with being to the right of drama).
- Music-Genre: Pop (the remaining genre).
- Pet: Dog.
- Transport: Jet-ski, since we've established a distribution that could work without contradicting given clues.


So, our final table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Cola        |
| Hobby         | Sudoku      | Reading     |
| Job           | Dressmaker  | Electrician |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama       | Adventure   |
