Lv6-3x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 2 and Clue 3
From Clue 2 and Clue 3, we know that the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice are both to the left of the chef. However, we don't know their exact positions yet.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 6
Clue 6 tells us that the person whose hobby is singing drinks mirinda. This gives us a direct beverage-hobby link but doesn't tell us the job or position.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 10
The coach drinks 7up, according to Clue 10. This links a job with a beverage.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 12 and Clue 13
Clue 12 states that the bartender is in an odd position, and Clue 13 says the person drinking juice is also in an odd position. Since there are only three odd positions (1, 3, 5), this limits where these individuals can be.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 20
Clue 20 tells us that the coach is between the person whose hobby is rock-climbing and the person whose hobby is singing. Given the coach drinks 7up, we have a starting point for linking beverages to hobbies and jobs.


## Step 6: Combining Information
From Clue 4, the person drinking 7up (the coach) is to the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing. Since the coach is also between the rock-climber and the singer (who drinks mirinda), we start to get a sequence.


## Step 7: Finalizing Positions
Considering all clues, especially about positions relative to each other (like Clue 1, Clue 5, Clue 11, etc.), we can deduce that:
- The person drinking cola is to the left of the lawyer and cooking hobbyist.
- The fisherman is to the left of the journalist.
- The skydiver is to the right of both the woodworker and the cook.


Given these deductions and considering all other clues about relative positions, hobbies, jobs, and beverages, we can attempt to fill in the table. However, without a step-by-step filling process for each clue due to the format constraint, let's directly infer the solution based on key clues:


The final answer is:

Lv6-3x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 9 and its implications
Clue 9 states that the owner of the chinchilla is in an odd position. This means the chinchilla can be in positions 1, 3, or 5.


## Step 2: Considering Clue 10 for positioning the accountant and the chinchilla's owner
Clue 10 indicates the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the accountant. Since the chinchilla's owner must be in an odd position (from Clue 9), and considering the accountant cannot be in position 6 (as there needs to be at least one person to the right of the accountant), possible positions for the accountant are 1, 2, or 3 if we were to ignore other clues temporarily.


## Step 3: Integrating Clue 1 for mechanic's and chinchilla owner's positions
Clue 1 states the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the mechanic. This implies the mechanic must be in an even position (2 or 4) if we consider the odd positioning requirement for the chinchilla's owner from Clue 9.


## Step 4: Examining Clue 8 and its implications for techno fan and project-manager
Clue 8 states the fan of techno is on the right of the project-manager. This clue, combined with Clue 6 (project-manager is on the left or right of the fan techno), indicates a specific relationship but does not directly give us positions without considering other clues.


## Step 5: Considering Clue 20 for reggae and techno fans
Clue 20 states the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan techno. This clue helps in understanding the sequence of music genres but requires integration with job and pet information for precise positioning.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 3 for bird owner's position relative to teacher
Clue 3 indicates the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the teacher. Since the teacher must be in an odd position (from Clue 19), possible positions for the teacher are 1, 3, or 5.


## Step 7: Integrating all relevant clues to deduce a solution
Given the constraints:
- Chinchilla's owner is in an odd position and to the right of the accountant and mechanic.
- Teacher is in an odd position.
- Project-manager is on the left or right of techno fan, but techno fan is to the right of project-manager (indicating project-manager cannot be in position 6).
- Reggae fan is to the right of techno fan.

Let's start placing individuals based on these clues:
1. Teacher can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.
2. Considering Clue 10 and the need for the accountant to be before the chinchilla owner, and knowing the mechanic must also precede the chinchilla owner (Clue 1), a possible arrangement starts to form.

Given these complex relationships, let's deduce:
- If the teacher is in position 3 (to satisfy being in an odd position and allowing for the bird owner to be next to them as per Clue 3), we can start building around this.
- The accountant could then potentially be in position 1 or 2, but since the mechanic must precede the chinchilla owner and the accountant also precedes the chinchilla owner, a likely scenario is the accountant in 1, followed by the mechanic, then the teacher.

Considering all clues and attempting to fit them into a cohesive table while respecting the format requirements for this response is challenging without visually arranging each clue's implications. However, based on the given information:

Lv6-3x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues step by step.


From clue 5, we know the person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches horror movies.


Clue 1 tells us the person watching mystery movies is between the person watching family movies and the Indian.


Clue 15 states the Indian is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.


Given these clues, a possible arrangement for these three could be:


- Indian
- Person watching family movies (or another arrangement with mystery in the middle)
- Person watching mystery movies


However, without direct assignments of hobbies or movie genres to nationalities yet, let's continue analyzing other clues.


Clue 2 states the person watching spy movies is not the Indonesian.


Clue 3 indicates the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching spy movies.


From clue 6, we know the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies.


Clue 10 says the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is between the person watching mystery movies and the person whose hobby is magic-tricks (who watches horror movies).


This gives us a sequence for some activities:


- Mystery movies
- Rock-climbing
- Horror movies (magic-tricks)


But we still need to place the other hobbies, movie genres, and nationalities.


Clue 9 tells us the person whose hobby is writing is on the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.


Clue 14 indicates the person whose hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is writing, reinforcing clue 9.


From clue 16, the person whose hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the Indian.


So, we have a sequence for some hobbies:


- Fishing
- Indian
- Writing


Clue 19 states the person whose hobby is writing is on the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku.


This gives us another sequence:


- Writing
- Sudoku


Now, let's try to piece together more clues about nationalities and their positions relative to each other.


From clue 13, the Australian is on the left or right of the British.


Clue 20 states the Australian is somewhere to the left of the Indonesian.


Given all these clues, we start seeing patterns but need a systematic approach to fill in the table.


Here's a step-by-step deduction based on given clues:


1. From clue 5 and clue 21, since the person whose hobby is magic-tricks watches horror movies and this person is on the left or right of the Pakistani, let's consider the Pakistani could be associated with either horror movies (but we know it's magic-tricks) or another genre.


2. Clue 12 states the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the Japanese, and clue 3 says this person is also to the right of the spy movies.


3. Given the constraints about the Indian being on the left of mystery movies (clue 15) and considering clue 1, we might initially place the family movies before the Indian or after, with mystery in between the family movie watcher and the Indian.


4. Clue 11 says the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the Japanese.


5. The Australian being to the left of the Indonesian (clue 20) helps in placing these two relative to each other but not absolutely without more information.


6. Since the person whose hobby is rock-climbing must be between mystery movies and magic-tricks (horror movies), and considering all other constraints, let's try fitting pieces together:


Given the complexity of directly solving this step-by-step without visual aids or trial and error with all clues, we deduce as follows for a final arrangement that fits all given conditions:


|               |     1      |    2    |      3       |     4      |       5       |      6       |

Lv6-3x6-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we get it.


Given:
- 6 types of food: cauliflower, lettuce, orange, pear, pepper, zucchini
- 6 hobbies: baking, collecting, drawing, filmmaking, fishing, sudoku
- 6 means of transport: airplane, bike, bus, car, quad-bike, roller

From clue 3, the person eating orange drives the bus.


## Step 1: Determine position of orange and bus
We don't know the exact position yet, but we'll come back to this.


## Step 2: Use clue 4 to place pear relative to orange
Orange is on the left or right of pear. This doesn't give us an exact position yet.


## Step 3: Apply clue 6 to place lettuce
Lettuce is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).


## Step 4: Use clue 8 to place bike relative to lettuce
Lettuce is on the right of the person driving the bike. Since lettuce must be in an odd position and can't be in position 1 (because then bike would have to be in position 0, which doesn't exist), lettuce could be in positions 3 or 5.


## Step 5: Apply clue 11 to place sudoku relative to bike
Sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means the person driving the bike cannot be in the last two positions (5 or 6) because sudoku needs to be to their right.


## Step 6: Use clue 12 to ensure orange doesn't drive the bike
This confirms our earlier deduction that orange (and thus bus) and bike are not driven by the same person.


## Step 7: Apply clue 15 to place lettuce relative to zucchini
Lettuce is somewhere to the right of zucchini. Given lettuce must be in an odd position, this means zucchini could only be in positions 1 or 3 if lettuce were in position 5, or only in position 1 if lettuce is in position 3.


## Step 8: Use clue 17 to place collecting relative to bus
Collecting is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. Since we know orange drives the bus, this gives us some positioning information but doesn't specify exact positions yet.


## Step 19: Apply clue 20 to place airplane relative to lettuce
Airplane is on the right of the person eating lettuce. Given lettuce's possible positions (3 or 5), if lettuce is in position 3, airplane must be in position 4 or greater. If lettuce is in position 5, there's no room for airplane to its right unless it's actually in a configuration that doesn't allow for all other conditions to be met.


## Step 20: Finalize positions based on all clues
Considering all the above steps and trying to fit the pieces together while respecting all constraints:


Given the complexity of manually solving this puzzle step by step without visual aids or a systematic approach that considers all interactions between clues simultaneously, let's directly infer from key clues for critical placements:


1. **Zucchini** must be on one end (clue 14), and given lettuce is to its right (clue 15) and in an odd position (clue 6), if zucchini were at the far left, lettuce could only be in position 3 to allow other foods and hobbies to fit without conflicting clues.


2. **Orange** drives the bus (clue 3) and is next to pear (clue 4). Since orange cannot drive the bike (clue 12), and given the constraints around lettuce and zucchini, we have to fit orange, pear, and their respective transport/hobbies carefully.


3. **Collecting** is between fishing and drawing (clue 9) and to the left of bus (clue 17). This means collecting cannot be too far to the right since it must precede the bus driver (orange).


4. Given these constraints, a possible configuration starts to emerge, but manually solving this without systematically testing each clue against all others in a grid or table format becomes impractical and prone to error.


5. **Airplane** is on the right of lettuce (clue 20), which further constrains our possibilities, especially considering lettuce's odd position requirement.


Given these considerations and the complexity of manually applying each clue without omitting any interactions:

Lv6-3x6-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's first analyze the given clues and start filling in the information we can deduce directly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Direct Information
From clue 2, the musician drinks Fanta.
From clue 7, the doctor drinks soy-milk.
From clue 15, the social-worker drives a quad-bike.
From clue 16, the person driving an airplane drinks milk.
From clue 22, the paramedic is on the far left.


## Step 2: Applying Positional Clues
Clue 13 states the musician (who drinks Fanta) is in an odd position. Possible positions are 1, 3, or 5.
Given that the social-worker (quad-bike driver) is to the left of the ship driver (clue 1), and considering the paramedic is on the far left (clue 22), we can start building a sequence.


## Step 3: Integrating Beverage and Job Information
Clue 5 indicates milk is to the right of quad-bike, and clue 16 says the airplane driver drinks milk, placing the airplane (and thus milk) at the end.
Clue 9 places juice to the left of the designer, and clue 21 places juice to the left of the boat.


## Step 4: Combining Transport Information
The trike is to the left of the boat (clue 10), and soy-milk is to the right of the trike (clue 3).
Given these clues, we can start constructing sequences for jobs, beverages, and transports.


## Step 5: Finalizing Positions
Let's use clue 8 (airplane on the far right) and clue 16 (airplane driver drinks milk) as anchors.
- Paramedic is on position 1 (clue 22).
- The social-worker drives a quad-bike (clue 15), and since the social-worker is to the left of the ship driver (clue 1), we place the quad-bike and its rider, the social-worker, in an early position but after considering other placements.
- The musician drinks Fanta and must be in an odd position (clue 13). Given that the paramedic is on the far left, Fanta could fit into position 3 if it aligns with other conditions.


## Step 6: Detailed Placement
Considering all clues:
1. Paramedic - Position 1.
2. Since the social-worker drives a quad-bike and must be to the left of the ship (clue 1), and considering the placement of the musician and others, we have to integrate these pieces carefully with the transport and beverage clues.


## Step 7: Final Assembly
Let's assemble based on key clues:
- The doctor drinks soy-milk (clue 7) and is in position 5 because soy-milk must be to the right of the trike (clue 3), and given that the airplane (milk) is at the end, this fits.
- The musician (Fanta) being in an odd position helps place Fanta.
- Juice is to the left of the designer and boat, which can help place the remaining positions.


## Step 8: Finalizing Beverage and Job Placements
Given that milk is on the right (airplane driver), and considering soy-milk's placement relative to trike and ship, we deduce:
- Coffee cannot be with the ship or snowmobile drivers due to various restrictions.
- Water's position can be derived by elimination and considering the engineer's position relative to water.


## Step 9: Transport Finalization
With key positions determined (paramedic on the left, airplane on the right), we fill in transports based on clues about their order and relationship to jobs and beverages.

Lv6-3x6-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the fan of country music
From clue 1, the fan of country music is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the person eating tomato
From clue 2, the person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the fan of electronic music.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the person eating zucchini
From clue 5, the person eating zucchini is in an odd position. Clue 9 also states that this person is on the left of the owner of the hamster.


## Step 4: Analyze music genres' order
Clue 6 indicates the fan of soul is between the fan of indie and the fan of country. Clue 13 adds that the fan of soul is to the right of the fan of indie.


## Step 5: Combine information about music genres
From clue 11, electronic is between indie and the pony owner. Since the soul fan is also between indie and country (but to the right of indie), we can start forming a sequence.


## Step 6: Determine positions based on pets' owners
Clue 7 says the hamster's owner is to the right of the soul fan, clue 8 places the guinea-pig's owner to the left of the tomato eater, and clue 17 tells us the spinach eater owns a fish.


## Step 7: Finalize positions using all clues
Considering clue 12 (pony owner on far left or right), clue 14 (radish eater to the left of tomato eater), clue 15 (tomato eater not hamster's owner), and clue 16 (broccoli eater between turtle and spinach/fish owners), we piece together all information.


Given the complexity and the step-by-step nature required for an accurate solution, let's synthesize the key points into a more direct analysis based on the clues:


1. Country fan is left of watermelon.
2. Tomato is right of electronic.
3. Zucchini is not electronic and in an odd position.
4. Gospel is right of techno.
5. Soul is between indie and country, and right of indie.
6. Hamster's owner is right of soul.
7. Guinea-pig's owner is left of tomato.
8. Zucchini is left of hamster's owner.
9. Pony's owner is on the far left or right.
10. Electronic is between indie and pony.
11. Broccoli is between turtle and spinach (fish owner).
12. Spinach eater owns fish.


Given these clues, let's directly construct a possible solution table based on logical deductions:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |     6      |
| Food          | Pony  |            |            |        |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |       |            |            |        |          |            |
| Pet           |       |            |            |        |          |            |

From clue 12, the pony could be on either end. Let's place it at position 1 for simplicity.


Considering all clues and their implications:


- The sequence for music genres considering soul between indie and country (and to the right of indie), electronic between indie and pony, and gospel to the right of techno gives us a starting point.
- With zucchini in an odd position and left of the hamster's owner, and considering other positions, we start to fill in.


A potential arrangement could be:


|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |     6      |
| Food          |       | broccoli  | zucchini  | radish | tomato  | watermelon|
| Music-Genre   | techno| indie     | soul      | country| electronic| gospel    |
| Pet           | pony  | turtle    | fish      | guinea-pig| hamster  | frog      |


However, the exact arrangement requires careful consideration of all clues and their interactions. Given the format requirements and the complexity of directly solving this puzzle step-by-step in text without iterative refinement based on clue interactions, let's encapsulate a potential final solution table while noting that direct deduction from clues to specific positions for each category requires meticulous cross-referencing:


#############
|               |   1    |     2      |     3      |   4    |    5     |     6      |
| Food          | zucchini| broccoli  | spinach   | radish | tomato  | watermelon|
| Music-Genre   | techno  | indie     | soul      | country| electronic| gospel    |
| Pet           | pony    | turtle    | fish      | guinea-pig| hamster  | frog      |
#############


Please note, the solution provided is a potential arrangement based on the clues given. The puzzle's complexity and the need for iterative deduction to ensure all conditions are met simultaneously mean that constructing a definitive solution requires careful cross-validation against each clue. The table represents one possible outcome from synthesizing the information but may require further refinement based on a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each clue in relation to others."	{'food': ['zucchini', 'broccoli', 'spinach', 'radish', 'tomato', 'watermelon'], 'music-genre': ['techno', 'indie', 'soul', 'country', 'electronic', 'gospel'], 'pet': ['pony', 'turtle', 'fish', 'guinea-pig', 'hamster', 'frog']}	True	4	False
Lv6-3x6-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 2
The fan of techno music is the person driving the tram. This means the techno music fan can be placed directly opposite ""tram"" in the transport row.

## Step 2: Applying Clue 6
The fan of salsa music is in an even position. This gives us potential positions for the salsa fan as 2, 4, or 6.

## Step 3: Considering Clue 14
The fan of techno music is on the left or right of the fan of r&b music. Since we know the techno fan drives the tram and considering the possible even positions for salsa (which also has to be near r&b as per clue 18), we start to get a picture of how these might align.

## Step 4: Using Clue 12
The person driving the scooter is the person watching action movies. This gives us a direct association between a transport method and a movie genre.

## Step 5: Applying Clue 3
The person driving the scooter (action movies) is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. This starts to give us an order for the movie genres.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 16
The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Given that action must be to the left of superhero (from clue 3) and satire is to the right of action (clue 4), we can start forming a sequence for the movie genres.

## Step 7: Considering Clue 20
The person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. Since drama is associated with r&b (clue 15), and knowing that techno is near r&b, we can start seeing how the music genres might align with movie genres and transport.

## Step 8: Applying Clue 23
The person watching crime movies is in an even position. This helps further narrow down possible arrangements for movie genres.

## Step 9: Using Clue 1, 13, and 21
These clues tell us the rock fan doesn't drive the snowmobile or the ship, and r&b isn't driving the helicopter. With techno driving the tram (clue 2) and other associations, we can start to fill in more of the table.

## Step 10: Finalizing Positions
Given all the constraints, let's place the genres and transports:
- Clue 12 places action with scooter.
- Clue 4 places satire to the right of action.
- Clue 16 places superhero near satire, and since action is left of superhero (clue 3), we have a sequence starting with action.
- Clue 20 orders adventure before drama, which is associated with r&b.
- Techno drives the tram (clue 2) and must be near r&b (clue 14).
- Salsa is in an even position (clue 6) and near both ship (clue 17) and r&b (clue 18).

Given these steps, let's construct a possible solution:


|               |    1    |     2      |     3      |     4     |   5   |   6   |
