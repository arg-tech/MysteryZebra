Lv6-2x2-1	"Let's break down the information given:

1. The person who likes soccer is on the far left.
2. The person who likes volleyball does not eat pear.

Given the two types of food (nectarine, pear) and sports (soccer, volleyball), we can start filling in the table based on the clues:

- Since the soccer fan is on the far left, that means their sport is already determined, but we don't know their food preference yet.
- The volleyball fan cannot eat pear, which implies they must eat nectarine because those are the only two options for food.

So, if we assign the sports first based on clue 1:

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

Now, using clue 2 that the volleyball fan does not eat pear, and knowing there are only two food options (nectarine and pear), we can conclude the volleyball fan eats nectarine. The soccer fan, then, must eat pear because it's the only option left.

So, filling in the foods:

|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Pear   | Nectarine  |
| Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Pear   | Nectarine  |
| Sport   | Soccer | Volleyball |

Lv6-2x2-2	"Let's analyze the given information:

1. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
2. The owner of the goat is not the person eating lemon.

From statement 1, we can conclude that the goat must be in column 1 and the guinea-pig must be in column 2.

Now, let's consider statement 2. Since the owner of the goat is not eating lemon, they must be eating an apple (the only other option). 

So, we have:

|        |   1   |     2      |
| Food   | Apple |            |
| Pet    | Goat  |            |

Now, we know that the guinea-pig is in column 2. The owner of the guinea-pig must be eating lemon (since apple is already taken by the owner of the goat).

Therefore, the final solution table is:

#############
|        |   1   |     2      |
| Food   | Apple | Lemon     |

Lv6-2x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two different types of food: plum and pumpkin.
2. There are two different types of sport: handball and sailing.
3. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating plum.
4. The person who's sport is handball is not the person eating plum.

From point 3, we know the arrangement for food is:
- Pumpkin on the left (column 1)
- Plum on the right (column 2)

Given this, let's fill in the table with what we know so far:

|         |    1     |    2    |
| Food    | Pumpkin | Plum   |
| Sport   |          |         |

Now, from point 4, we understand that handball cannot be associated with plum. Since pumpkin is on the left and plum is on the right, and given the constraints:

- If the person eating pumpkin (on the left) prefers handball, then the person eating plum must prefer sailing because there are only two sports.
- However, we have not directly determined which sport goes with pumpkin or plum yet, but we know from point 4 that handball cannot go with plum.

So, considering the options:
- Pumpkin on the left could be associated with either sport, but since handball cannot be with plum (on the right), and there are only two sports, handball must be with pumpkin if sailing is to be with plum, or vice versa. But given that we don't have a direct link between pumpkin and a specific sport yet, let's consider what happens if handball were with pumpkin:
  - This would mean sailing is with plum because each person has a unique sport.
- Or, the other option based on our constraints doesn't actually restrict the sports further without considering the placement of handball with one of the foods directly. Since we know handball isn't with plum (from point 4), and by process of elimination, if pumpkin were associated with sailing, then handball would have to be with plum, which contradicts our information.

Thus, given our constraints and breaking down the logic:
- Pumpkin is on the left.
- Plum is on the right.
- Handball cannot be with plum, so it must be with pumpkin (because there are only two sports and two foods, and each person has a unique preference for sport and food).

So, filling in the sports based on our deductions:

|         |    1     |    2    |
| Food    | Pumpkin | Plum   |
| Sport   | Handball| Sailing|

This solution fits all given conditions. Therefore, the final solution table is:

From statement 2, we know that the person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person eating apricot. This means that the person eating apricot must be in column 1, and the person eating grapefruit must be in column 2.

| Food   | apricot | grapefruit |

Lv6-2x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


## Step 1: Identify the options for movie genres and sports.
The two movie genres are musical and superhero. The two sports are golf and lacrosse.


## Step 2: Apply the first clue.
The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means the person into superhero movies can either be into golf or cannot be matched with lacrosse directly.


## Step 3: Apply the second clue.
The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Given our table structure, this means if lacrosse is in column 1, superhero must be in column 2, and thus paired with golf since the other sport (lacrosse) is already determined to be in column 1.


## Step 4: Deduce the arrangement based on clues.
Given that the person into superhero movies must be to the right of lacrosse and considering our table has only two columns, we deduce:
- Lacrosse cannot be in column 2 because then there would be no room for the superhero movie preference to its right within the constraints of a two-column table.
- Therefore, lacrosse is in column 1, and since the person watching superhero movies cannot have lacrosse as their sport (from clue 1), they must have golf as their sport in column 2.


## Step 5: Determine the movie genre for the person with lacrosse as their sport.
Given that the person into superhero movies has golf, and by elimination, the only other combination left is musical with lacrosse. This fills out our table completely.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Superhero |

Lv6-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The music genres are d&b and indie.
2. The nationalities are Japanese and Polish.
3. The fan of d&b is on the far right (column 2).
4. The fan of indie is not Japanese.

Given that there are only two options for each category and the specific clue that the d&b fan is on the far right, we can start filling in the information:

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   | indie  | d&b      |
| Nationality   |        |          |

Since the fan of indie is not Japanese (from clue 4), and there are only two nationalities, the indie fan must be Polish. This means the d&b fan, who is on the far right, must be Japanese because it's the only remaining nationality.

So, the completed table looks like this:

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Music-Genre   | indie  | d&b      |
| Nationality   | Polish | Japanese |

Lv6-2x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding the Jobs and Pets
We have two jobs: accountant and social worker, and two pets: goat and hamster.


## Step 2: Applying the First Clue
The first clue states that the accountant is in an odd position. Since we only have two positions (1 and 2), position 1 is the only odd position. Therefore, the accountant must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Applying the Second Clue
The second clue tells us that the accountant is not the owner of the hamster. This means the hamster must belong to the person in position 2, who is the social worker, since the accountant (in position 1) cannot own the hamster.


## Step 4: Determining the Pets for Each Job
Given that the accountant (in position 1) does not own the hamster, they must own the goat. The social worker, in position 2, then owns the hamster.


## Step 5: Constructing the Final Table
Based on our deductions:
- Position 1 is the accountant who owns a goat.
- Position 2 is the social worker who owns a hamster.

The final table should look like this:


|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant | Social Worker |
| Pet   | Goat       | Hamster      |

Lv6-2x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating kale is to the left of the person eating potato.
2. The Japanese person is not eating potato.

Given there are only two columns (1 and 2), we can deduce from the first point that:
- Kale must be in column 1 because it has to be to the left of potato, which then must be in column 2.

So, we have:
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          |  kale   | potato |
| Nationality   |          |         |

From the second point, since the Japanese person is not eating potato, and knowing that kale is in column 1, the Japanese person must be associated with kale.

So, we update our table:
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          |  kale   | potato |
| Nationality   | Japanese|         |

The only nationality left (Mexican) must then be associated with potato in column 2.

Therefore, the completed table is:
#############
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Food          |  kale   | potato |

Lv6-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to fill in the table based on the given clues.


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Transport     |         |        |

From clue 2, ""the person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train,"" we can deduce that:


- The train must be in column 1 because if it were in column 2, there would be no space to the right for the trike.
- Therefore, the trike must be in column 2.


So, we have:


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

From clue 1, ""the person driving the train is not the fan of techno,"" we can deduce that:


- Since there are only two music genres (dubstep and techno) and the person driving the train cannot be a fan of techno, they must be a fan of dubstep.


Thus, the table becomes:


|               |    1    |   2    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep|        |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

The only music genre left for column 2 is techno, so we fill that in:

| Music-Genre   | Dubstep| Techno |
| Transport     | Train   | Trike  |

Lv6-2x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


Given:
- Jobs: entrepreneur, firefighter
- Transport: helicopter, van
- Conditions:
  1. The person driving the helicopter is not the firefighter.
  2. The entrepreneur is in an even position.

From condition 2, we know the entrepreneur must be in position 2 since it's the only even position.


## Step 1: Apply condition 2
|             |      1      |      2       |
| Job         |             | Entrepreneur|
| Transport   |             |              |


## Step 2: Apply condition 1
Since the helicopter driver is not the firefighter, and considering the entrepreneur is already placed in position 2, if the person in position 2 (entrepreneur) uses the helicopter, it satisfies both conditions directly. However, we must also consider the placement of the van and the remaining job (firefighter).


## Step 3: Determine transport for position 1
Given that the entrepreneur is in position 2 and must use either the helicopter or the van, and from condition 1 knowing the helicopter pilot isn't a firefighter, we have two scenarios:
- Scenario A: Entrepreneur uses the helicopter. This means the firefighter must be in position 1 and uses the van.
- Scenario B: If we try to place the firefighter with the helicopter (which contradicts condition 1), it would not work.


Thus, considering all conditions, the most logical arrangement that satisfies both is:


|             |      1      |      2       |
| Job         | Firefighter| Entrepreneur|
| Transport   |     van     | helicopter  |


This setup adheres to all given rules: the entrepreneur is in an even position (2), and the person driving the helicopter (entrepreneur) is not the firefighter.


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |      1      |      2       |
