Lv6-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The manager is not the person eating mango.
3. The person whose hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

From clue 1, we know the order for two items: Mango must be to the left of Soy-milk.

From clue 3, Writing must also be to the left of Soy-milk.

Given that there are only two people (thus two columns), and considering clues 1 and 3 together, it means Writing and Mango must be associated with Person 1 because both need to be to the left of Soy-milk. 

Clue 2 tells us the Manager is not eating Mango. Since we've established Mango is likely associated with Person 1 (to satisfy being to the left of Soy-milk), this means the Manager could either be associated with Person 2 or another aspect of Person 1's profile that doesn't conflict with existing clues.

Let's start filling in based on what we know:

- Mango and Writing must be on the left.
- Soy-milk must be on the right.
- Since the manager cannot eat mango, and if we consider that each person has a unique job, hobby, food, and drink, the manager could potentially drink Soy-milk or have another combination that doesn't conflict with given clues.

Given these constraints:

- For Person 1 (left column): Mango (food), Writing (hobby). The beverage here must be Sprite since it's the only other option, and the job must be Electrician because Manager cannot eat mango but could potentially drink Soy-milk.
  
- For Person 2 (right column): Since Soy-milk is to the right, Broccoli (the remaining food) goes here. The hobby not yet assigned is Board-games, and the job is Manager.

So, the filled table looks like this:

#############
|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   |    Sprite   |   Soy-milk  |
| Food       |    Mango    |  Broccoli   |
| Hobby      |   Writing   | Board-games |
| Job        |  Electrician|   Manager   |

Lv6-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Apply the first condition about movie genres and positions.
Given that the person watching comedy movies is in an odd position, this means they can only be in position 1 since there are only two positions (1 and 2) and position 1 is the only odd one. So, we have:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     |             |
| Sport         |             |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

## Step 2: Apply the second condition about sports and positions relative to beverages.
The person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up. This means skiing must be associated with position 1 because it has to be to the left of someone drinking 7up, which could either be in position 1 or 2, but since comedy is already determined to be in position 1 and skiing needs to be on the left, we deduce:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      |             |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     |             |
| Sport         | Skiing     |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

## Step 3: Determine the beverage for position 1 based on the second condition.
Since skiing is in position 1 and must be to the left of someone drinking 7up, it implies that 7up cannot be in position 1 (because there's no one to the right of position 1). Thus, almond-milk must be in position 1:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk|             |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     |             |
| Sport         | Skiing     |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

## Step 4: Fill in the remaining blanks based on previous deductions.
7up must be in position 2 since almond-milk is in position 1:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk| 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     |             |
| Sport         | Skiing     |             |
| Transport     |             |             |

## Step 5: Apply the third condition about transport and beverages.
The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk. This means the airplane must be in position 2 because almond-milk is in position 1, and since the person with the airplane cannot drink almond-milk:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk| 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     |             |
| Sport         | Skiing     |             |
| Transport     |             | Airplane    |

## Step 6: Fill in the remaining movie genre and sport.
Since comedy is already assigned to position 1, time-travel must be in position 2. Also, given that skiing is in position 1, volleyball must be in position 2:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk| 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     | Time-travel |
| Sport         | Skiing     | Volleyball  |
| Transport     |             | Airplane    |

## Step 7: Determine the transport for position 1.
The only remaining option for transport is boat, which must be in position 1:
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk| 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     | Time-travel |
| Sport         | Skiing     | Volleyball  |
| Transport     | Boat       | Airplane    |

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk| 7up         |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy     | Time-travel |
| Sport         | Skiing     | Volleyball  |
| Transport     | Boat       | Airplane    |

Lv6-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze each statement given:


1. The person watching zombie movies is on the far left.
2. The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the person drinking 7up.
3. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.


Given these clues, let's start filling in the table step by step:


- From clue 1, we know the person on the far left watches zombie movies.
- Clue 3 tells us that the airplane user is to the left of the filmmaker. Since there are only two columns, this means the airplane user must be on the left (column 1) because the filmmaker cannot be in column 1 if they are to the right of someone.


Let's assign the zombie movie watcher to column 1 as per clue 1:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      |            |
| Transport     |             |            |


Given that the zombie movie watcher is in column 1 and from clue 3, we know the person using the airplane is also in column 1:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      |            |
| Transport     | Airplane    |            |


Now, let's address clue 2: The person whose hobby is woodworking is not the person drinking 7up. This means if we find out who drinks 7up and who does woodworking, we can start making connections.


Since the airplane user (in column 1) cannot be the filmmaker due to clue 3, they must have a different hobby. Let's assume this person's hobby is woodworking because it fits without contradicting any clues yet:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             |            |
| Hobby         | Woodworking|            |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      |            |
| Transport     | Airplane    |            |


This leaves filmmaking for column 2.


Now, knowing the hobbies and transport, let's figure out the beverages. Clue 2 tells us the woodworking person (now in column 1) does not drink 7up, so they must drink soy-milk:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   |            |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      |            |
| Transport     | Airplane    |            |


The remaining beverage, 7up, goes to column 2:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   | 7up        |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      |            |
| Transport     | Airplane    |            |


Lastly, the movie genre for column 2 must be scientific since zombie is already assigned:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   | 7up        |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      | Scientific |
| Transport     | Airplane    |            |


The only transport left for column 2 is the skateboard:


|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   | 7up        |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie      | Scientific |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Skateboard |


Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk   | 7up        |

Lv6-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The Brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.
2. The person whose sport is tennis is not a fan of punk.
3. The Brazilian is a fan of punk.

From clue 3, we know the Brazilian likes punk music. From clue 2, since the tennis player does not like punk, and given that there are only two music genres (electronic and punk), the tennis player must like electronic music.

Clue 1 tells us the Brazilian is to the right of the roller user. This means if we consider the table from left to right as person 1 and person 2, respectively, the Brazilian cannot be in column 1 because there would be no one to their left. Thus, the Brazilian must be in column 2.

Since the Brazilian likes punk (clue 3) and is in column 2, we can start filling out the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Music-Genre   |            | Punk      |
| Nationality   |            | Brazilian |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

Given that the Brazilian is in column 2 and likes punk, and from clue 2 knowing the tennis player does not like punk (thus likes electronic), the tennis player must be in column 1:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Punk      |
| Nationality   |            | Brazilian |
| Sport         | Tennis     |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

The only sport left for the Brazilian is swimming (since tennis is already assigned to column 1), and the only transport method left that makes sense given clue 1 (the Brazilian is to the right of the roller user) is that the person in column 1 uses the roller, and the Brazilian (column 2) must use the airplane:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Punk      |
| Nationality   | Dutch      | Brazilian |
| Sport         | Tennis     | Swimming  |
| Transport     | Roller     | Airplane  |

The only nationality left for column 1 is Dutch, as Brazilian is already assigned to column 2.

Therefore, the solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:

Lv6-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply it step by step.


From clue 1: ""the person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the journalist,"" we know the journalist cannot be in column 2 because then there would be no one to the right of them for the singer to be. Thus, the journalist must be in column 1.


From clue 3: ""the person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit,"" we understand that the singer and the rabbit owner are next to each other.


Given these clues, there are two initial possibilities for the arrangement based on the position of the journalist and the relative positions of the singer and the rabbit owner:


1. Journalist (Column 1), Singer (Column 2) - Given the singer is to the right of the journalist.
2. The rabbit could either be with the journalist or the singer, but since the singer must be next to the rabbit owner, if the journalist were a rabbit owner, it would contradict clue 3 unless the arrangement specifically allows for this configuration indirectly.


From clue 2: ""the person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit,"" we can start filling in more information:


If the singer is next to the rabbit and is in column 2 (as per clue 1), then the rabbit must be in column 1 because the singer is in column 2. But this would mean the journalist, who must be in column 1 according to our deduction from clue 1, owns the rabbit, which doesn't directly contradict any clues but sets a specific scenario.


Now, let's try to fit the hobbies, jobs, movie genres, and pets into the table based on these deductions:


Given that the singer is in column 2 (to be to the right of the journalist) and must be next to the rabbit owner (clue 3), we have two possibilities for column 1: Journalist with a hobby other than singing (which must be gardening, as there are only two hobbies) and possibly owning the rabbit or cat.


Since the singer is in column 2 and must be next to the rabbit owner, let's assume the journalist in column 1 owns the cat (to avoid direct contradiction without further information), making the singer in column 2 own the rabbit. However, this would contradict clue 2 if the singer also likes fantasy movies, which we haven't directly assigned yet.


Given these considerations and to satisfy all conditions without direct contradiction:


- The journalist (job) in column 1 can have gardening as a hobby and watch scientific movies, owning a cat.
- The dancer (to be determined but must fit the remaining slot), who sings (hobby), watches fantasy movies (to fulfill clue 2 indirectly by not having the rabbit owner watch fantasy), and owns the rabbit.


This arrangement satisfies all given conditions when carefully considering each clue's implications:


|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Singing |
| Job           | Journalist| Dancer  |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Fantasy |
| Pet           | Cat       | Rabbit  |


Thus, the solution table is:

1. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
2. The person whose sport is sailing is not the person eating asparagus.
3. The owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the person eating asparagus.


Given these clues, let's start by placing the movie genres based on clue 1:


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          |           |         |

| Sport         |           |         |


Next, using clue 3, we know the cat's owner is to the right of the person eating asparagus. This means asparagus cannot be in column 2 (since there's no one to the right of column 2), so asparagus must be in column 1.


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Asparagus| Tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Romance |
| Pet           |           |         |
| Sport         |           |         |


Now, since the cat's owner is to the right of the asparagus eater (column 1), the cat must be in column 2.


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Asparagus| Tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Romance |
| Pet           |           | Cat     |
| Sport         |           |         |


Given clue 2, the person whose sport is sailing does not eat asparagus. Therefore, sailing must be associated with column 2 (since asparagus is in column 1), and by process of elimination, golf must be in column 1.


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Asparagus| Tomato  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror    | Romance |
| Pet           | Pony     | Cat     |
| Sport         | Golf     | Sailing |


This arrangement satisfies all conditions:

1. The fan of pop music is not Chinese.
2. The Argentine is to the left of the Chinese.
3. The project-manager is to the left of the person driving the ship.

Given jobs: lawyer, project-manager
Given music genres: pop, r&b
Given nationalities: argentine, chinese
Given transports: roller, ship

From clue 2, we know the Argentine must be in column 1 because they are to the left of the Chinese. 

So, we start with:
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           |                 |         |
| Music-Genre   |                 |         |
| Nationality   | Argentine      | Chinese |
| Transport     |                 |         |

From clue 3, since the project-manager is to the left of the person driving the ship, and considering the Argentine is already placed in column 1, we can deduce that:
- The project-manager must be in column 1 (because they have to be to the left of someone who could potentially be driving the ship).
- This means the lawyer must be in column 2.

So, we update:
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-manager| Lawyer  |
| Music-Genre   |                 |         |
| Nationality   | Argentine      | Chinese |
| Transport     |                 |         |

From clue 1, the fan of pop music is not Chinese. Since the Chinese person is in column 2 and cannot be a fan of pop, they must be a fan of r&b (because there are only two options for music genres). This means the Argentine, being in column 1, must be a fan of pop.

So, we update:
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-manager| Lawyer  |
| Music-Genre   | Pop            | R&B     |
| Nationality   | Argentine      | Chinese |
| Transport     |                 |         |

Finally, since the project-manager is to the left of the person driving the ship (clue 3), and the project-manager is already in column 1, the person driving the ship must be in column 2. This means the transport for column 1 must be the roller.

So, we finalize:
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-manager| Lawyer  |

From clue 1: The person whose hobby is fishing is on the left of the fan of pop. This implies that the fan of pop cannot be in column 1 because there needs to be someone to the left of them, which means they must be in column 2.

| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         | pop        |

From clue 2: The person eating onion is not the person whose hobby is puzzles. This doesn't give us enough information to fill anything in directly, but we'll keep it in mind.


From clue 3: The fan of hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the fan of pop is already determined to be in column 2, and there are only two music genres mentioned (hip-hop and pop), the fan of hip-hop must be in column 1.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

Given clue 1 and the fact that the fan of pop is in column 2, we can infer that the person whose hobby is fishing must be in column 1 because they have to be to the left of the pop fan.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         | fishing |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

Since there are only two hobbies (fishing and puzzles), the person in column 2 must enjoy puzzles.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         | fishing | puzzles    |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

Clue 3 also tells us that the fan of hip-hop is to the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the fan of hip-hop is in column 1, and we've established that column 2 contains the pop fan (and thus, by association with clue 1, likely the epic movie watcher), we can start filling in the movie genres.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         | fishing | puzzles    |
| Movie-Genre   | satire  | epic       |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

This leaves us with the food. From clue 2, we know the person eating onion is not the person whose hobby is puzzles. Therefore, since the puzzle enthusiast is in column 2, the onion eater must be in column 1.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | onion   |            |
| Hobby         | fishing | puzzles    |
| Movie-Genre   | satire  | epic       |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

The only food left for column 2 is watermelon.


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          | onion   | watermelon |
| Hobby         | fishing | puzzles    |
| Movie-Genre   | satire  | epic       |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | pop        |

Therefore, the completed puzzle table is:

Lv6-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


1. The person eating corn is on the far left or far right.
2. The person whose hobby is board-games is not the person eating artichoke.
3. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person eating artichoke.
4. The person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person drinking water.


From statement 1, we know corn must be at either end. Let's start by placing corn on the left and see how it goes:


|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   |           |             |
| Food       | Corn      | Artichoke   |
| Hobby      |           |             |
| Sport      |           |             |


Statement 2 tells us that board-games are not with artichoke. If corn is on the left, then artichoke must be on the right to satisfy statement 1.


Statement 3 says coffee is to the right of artichoke. Since artichoke is already placed on the right in our current setup, this creates a problem because there's no space further to the right for coffee. This indicates we might need to reconsider our initial placement based on other clues.


Let's consider statement 4: soccer is to the right of water. Without knowing where water is yet, it's hard to place soccer directly, but it gives us an idea that if we find water, soccer will be to its right.


Given these constraints and trying to fit all pieces together, let's try a different approach by placing artichoke first and considering the placement of coffee relative to it as per statement 3:


If artichoke is on the left (to satisfy the condition that coffee can be placed somewhere to its right), then corn must be on the right based on statement 1.


|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   |           |             |
| Food       | Artichoke | Corn        |
| Hobby      |           |             |
| Sport      |           |             |


Statement 3 (coffee to the right of artichoke) can now be satisfied by placing coffee on the right:


|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   | Water     | Coffee     |
| Food       | Artichoke | Corn        |
| Hobby      |           |             |
| Sport      |           |             |


Statement 2 says board-games are not with artichoke, so if we place writing with artichoke (since it can't be board-games), then board-games must go with corn:


|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   | Water     | Coffee     |
| Food       | Artichoke | Corn        |
| Hobby      | Writing   | Board-games |
| Sport      |           |             |


Finally, for sports (statement 4 says soccer is to the right of water), we can place tennis with artichoke (and thus water) and soccer with corn (and coffee):


|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   | Water     | Coffee     |
| Food       | Artichoke | Corn        |
| Hobby      | Writing   | Board-games |
| Sport      | Tennis    | Soccer      |


This setup satisfies all given conditions. So, the final solution table is:


#############
|            |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage   | Water     | Coffee     |
| Food       | Artichoke | Corn        |
| Hobby      | Writing   | Board-games |
| Sport      | Tennis    | Soccer      |

Lv6-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person driving the train is not the project-manager.
2. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the person eating pomegranate.
3. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.

From clue 3, we know the order for hobbies: magic-tricks (left) and then rock-climbing (right).

Given that there are only two people, this means:
- Person 1 has magic-tricks as a hobby.
- Person 2 has rock-climbing as a hobby.

Now, looking at clue 2, since the scooter driver is to the left of the pomegranate eater, and considering our current hobby arrangement:
- The person driving the scooter must be eating lemon (because they are to the left), which means Person 1 eats lemon and drives the scooter.
- Therefore, Person 2 eats pomegranate.

Clue 1 tells us that the train driver is not the project-manager. Given that we've established the order of hobbies and foods but not jobs or transport for each person yet:
- Since Person 1 (magic-tricks, lemon, scooter) cannot be the train driver, they could potentially be the project-manager.
- Person 2 (rock-climbing, pomegranate, train) fits the clue that the train driver is not the project-manager if Person 1 is indeed the project-manager.

So, combining all clues:
- Person 1: magic-tricks (hobby), lemon (food), scooter (transport), and must be the project-manager to fit clue 1.
- Person 2: rock-climbing (hobby), pomegranate (food), train (transport), and thus must be the security-guard.

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|             |        1        |       2        |
| Food        |     lemon      |  pomegranate   |
| Hobby       | magic-tricks   | rock-climbing  |
| Job         | project-manager| security-guard|
| Transport   |     scooter    |     train      |
