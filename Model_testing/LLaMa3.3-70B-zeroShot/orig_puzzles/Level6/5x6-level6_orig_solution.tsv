Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions provided in the puzzle. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. Started with clue 18, which states that the person drinking milk is on the far left or far right. This gives us two possible positions for milk.
2. Used clue 7, which states that the american is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta, and clue 25, which states that the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. This helps to establish a partial order.
3. Applied clue 9, which states that the person who's hobby is chess is the person drinking water. This gives us a fixed position for water and chess.
4. Used clue 15, which states that the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is fishing, and clue 14, which states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the dog. This helps to establish a connection between hot-chocolate, fishing, and dog.
5. Applied clue 11, which states that the owner of the dog is the person watching scientific movies. This gives us a fixed position for scientific and dog.
6. Used clue 20, which states that the person watching thriller movies is between the person watching time-travel movies and the person drinking milk. This helps to establish a partial order.
7. Applied clue 26, which states that the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the rabbit, and clue 27, which states that the owner of the bird is not the person drinking mirinda. This helps to establish a connection between bird, rabbit, and mirinda.
8. Used clue 22, which states that the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the malaysian, and clue 30, which states that the malaysian is somewhere to the right of the russian. This helps to establish a partial order.
9. Applied clue 32, which states that the british is on the left or right of the canadian. This gives us a fixed position for british and canadian.
10. Used the remaining clues to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions are satisfied.

Note: This solution may not be unique, and there might be other possible solutions that satisfy all the conditions. However, this is one possible solution based on the given clues."

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis of each statement to arrive at the final answer. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues helped solve the puzzle:

* Clue 21 states that the fan country is the person driving the van, which helps place ""country"" in position 3.
* Clue 14 states that the person who's sport is handball is the person driving the van, placing ""handball"" in position 1.
* Clue 22 states that the fan metal is the person driving the tram, placing ""metal"" in position 5.
* Clue 24 states that the person eating apricot is on the far left or far right. Given other constraints, it's more likely to be on the far left, which places ""apricot"" in position 1.
* Clue 28 states that the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since ""apricot"" is already placed in position 1, this helps place ""motorbike"" in an odd position (clue 15), likely position 6.
* Clue 8 states that the person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the boat, which helps order the transport.
* Clue 34 states that the owner of the ferret is the person eating cauliflower, and clue 33 states that the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person driving the boat. This helps place ""ferret"" and ""cauliflower"" in positions 2 and 6, respectively.
* Clue 7 states that the owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating cauliflower, which places ""dog"" in position 1.
* Clue 18 states that the person driving the van is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle. Given other constraints, it's more likely to be on the right, which helps place ""turtle"" in position 5.

By carefully analyzing and combining these clues with others, we arrive at the final solution table."

* Clue 29 states that the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games, which places card-games in column 2.
* Clue 31 states that the entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, which places the entrepreneur in column 3.
* Clue 25 states that the teacher is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the malaysian (column 5) is watching animation movies, the teacher must be in column 4 or 6. However, clue 14 states that the teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, which places the teacher in column 4.
* Clue 27 states that the chef is somewhere to the right of the entrepreneur, which places the chef in column 6.
* Clue 40 states that the person eating grapes is the person who's hobby is skydiving, which fills in the food for column 6.
