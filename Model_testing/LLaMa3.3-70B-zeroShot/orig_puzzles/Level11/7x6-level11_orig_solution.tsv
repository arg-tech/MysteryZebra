Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis of each statement to arrive at the final table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:

* Clue 20 states that the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left, which means the first column corresponds to the chinchilla.
* Clue 8 provides two options for the owner of the chinchilla: the person eating cherry or the person driving the airplane. However, since the chinchilla is already assigned to the first position, and clue 30 states that the person eating cherry is in an even position, the person eating cherry must be in the 4th column (as per clue 30), and thus cannot own the chinchilla.
* Clue 32 states that the musician is the person driving the quad-bike. Clue 11 provides two options for the musician: the person eating peach or the person whose hobby is collecting. Since the quad-bike is already assigned to the 3rd column (from the initial table), and clue 30 states that the person eating cherry is in an even position, we can infer that the musician (and thus the quad-bike) must be associated with either the peach or collecting. Given that collecting is in the first column, it's more likely that the musician is associated with peach.
* Clue 46 states that the pilot and the fan of gospel have the same parity positions. Since clue 36 states that the malaysian is the pilot, and given the constraints on other nationalities, we can start to piece together the remaining columns.

By carefully considering each clue and using a process of elimination, we arrive at the solution table above."
