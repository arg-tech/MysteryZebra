13. The fan of funk is between the fan of dubstep and the person who's hobby is puzzles:
   
Considering all clues, we start filling in based on restrictions:


From clue 2 and 9, lemonade must be with classical, which is on the right side.


Given clue 5 (tea with radish), clue 10 (baseball between manager and radish), and knowing plum and peach's order from clue 4, let's fill more information considering all constraints:


- Coffee is left of puzzles (clue 6).
- Dubstep is left of funk (clue 3), and funk is between dubstep and puzzles (clue 13).
- Manager is between baseball and r&b (clue 7), and baseball is between manager and radish (clue 10).


Considering all clues together for a coherent solution:


Given the complexity, let's directly solve with logical deductions combined:


1. Teacher is on the far right (writing as hobby from clue 12).
2. Classical fan drinks lemonade and is on the right of entrepreneur.
3. Dubstep fan is left of funk fan, who is left of puzzles.
4. Plum eater is left of peach eater.
5. Tea drinker eats radish.


Let's finalize with all clues considered:


- Entrepreneur can't be on the far right (teacher), so entrepreneur must be in column 1 or 2 to allow classical (and lemonade) to be on their right.
- Manager between baseball and r&b, with baseball also between manager and radish, suggests a specific order that must fit within these constraints.


Direct Solution Attempt Based on All Clues:


|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |      4      |

| Sport         | skiing    | baseball    | climbing | rugby       |


Let's validate against the clues:

3. Dubstep fan is left of funk fan: Valid
4. Plum eater is left of peach eater: Valid
5. Tea drinker eats radish: Valid

Lv2-6x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


From clue 6, we know the rat's owner is on the far right, so the fourth column must be the rat's owner.


Clue 5 tells us that the person whose sport is weightlifting drinks lemonade. 


Clue 8 indicates the person drinking hot-chocolate owns the hamster.


Clue 11 states the person drinking tea drives the subway.


Clue 12 says the person eating lime drives the skateboard.


Let's start by placing some of these known combinations into the table:


|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |

| Nationality   |               |            |               |          |
| Pet           |               |            |               | rat      |
| Sport         |               |            |               |          |

From clue 2, the owner of the lizard is on the right of the person whose sport is weightlifting.


Clue 3 places the person whose sport is sailing to the right of the guinea-pig's owner.


Clue 9 tells us the person drinking 7up is between the van driver and the guinea-pig's owner.


Clue 7 says the van driver is between the Mexican and the tea drinker (subway rider).


Given clue 1, the Egyptian is on the right of the lime eater (skateboarder), and from clue 13, the lizard owner is between the cauliflower eater and the Egyptian.


Let's analyze clue 4: the corn eater is to the left of the Russian. This means the Russian cannot be in column 1.


From clue 10, the soccer player is to the left of the handball player.


Now, let's try to fit these clues together:


Since the tea drinker (subway rider) and the van driver must be in columns 1-3 (because the rat owner is in column 4), and considering clue 7, one possible arrangement for the nationalities could involve the Mexican being on one side of the van driver and the tea drinker on the other.


The person drinking hot-chocolate owns the hamster (clue 8). The person drinking lemonade is into weightlifting (clue 5).


Clue 9 indicates that 7up is between the van and the guinea-pig, suggesting a possible sequence involving the van, 7up, and then the guinea-pig.


Given these clues, we can start filling in more information:


1. The person eating lime drives the skateboard (clue 12), so ""lime"" and ""skateboard"" go together.
2. The Egyptian is to the right of the lime eater (clue 1).
3. The lizard owner is between the cauliflower eater and the Egyptian (clue 13).
4. The weightlifter drinks lemonade (clue 5), and the lizard owner is to the right of the weightlifter (clue 2).


Considering all these clues, let's attempt a possible arrangement:


|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |
| Beverage      |               |            |               |          |
| Food          |               |            |               |          |
| Nationality   |               |            |               |          |
| Pet           |               |            |               | rat      |
| Sport         |               |            |               |          |
| Transport     |               |            |               |          |


Starting with the knowns:


- The person eating lime drives the skateboard (clue 12).
- The Egyptian is to the right of the lime eater.
- The lizard owner is between the cauliflower eater and the Egyptian.


Given these constraints, a possible arrangement could be:


The Russian cannot be in column 1 because the corn eater is to the left of the Russian (clue 4). If we place the Mexican in column 1, we can start building a sequence that fits all clues.


Let's place ""lime"" and ""skateboard"" in column 2 since the Egyptian must be to their right, and there needs to be space for the lizard owner between the cauliflower eater and the Egyptian.


Now, fitting in the rest:


- The weightlifter drinks lemonade.
- The van driver is between the Mexican and the tea drinker (subway rider).
- The 7up drinker is between the van driver and the guinea-pig owner.


Considering all clues, one possible solution is:


|               |       1       |     2      |       3       |    4     |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate |  lemonade  |       tea     |  7up     |
| Food          | cauliflower   |    lime    |     corn      | pepper   |

Clue 7 states the scientist is on the left of the American, so the scientist cannot be in column 4.

Clue 8 tells us the person driving the subway watches scientific movies.

Clue 2 indicates the person drinking water is on the left of the designer.

Given these initial deductions, let's start filling in the table.


## Step 1: Initial Placement Based on Clues
From clue 7 and clue 14, we have an initial sequence: scientist - American (gardening).

Clue 11 places card-games to the left of the car driver, and clue 9 indicates the car driver is between the scientist and card-games. This suggests a possible sequence for some columns could be: scientist - card-games - car driver.

## Step 2: Apply Clues Related to Beverages
Clue 4 states the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking fanta, and clue 1 places fanta between collecting and Malaysian. We don't know their exact positions yet but have a relation.

## Step 3: Analyze Transport Clues
Clue 9 gives us a sequence involving the scientist and card-games related to the car driver. Clue 8 directly assigns subway to scientific movies, but we don't know its position relative to others yet.

## Step 4: Combine Nationality and Job Clues
From clue 5, Russian is on the left of taxi. Clue 7 gives scientist - American. Clue 10 says Malaysian is on the left of crime movies.

## Step 5: Detailed Placement with All Clues
Let's combine all clues for detailed placement:

- From clue 12, software-developer is on the right of 7up.
- Given the sequence from clue 9 and the relation from clue 1, and considering clue 4 (7up to the left of fanta), we start forming a more complete picture.
- Clue 6 places disaster movies to the left of soy-milk, and clue 3 places jet-ski to the right of disaster movies.

Given these deductions, let's attempt to fill in the table with the clues provided:


Since this problem involves complex logical deductions that are not straightforward to solve step-by-step without visual aids or a more systematic approach to eliminate possibilities, we will directly infer the solution based on given conditions and known logic puzzle solving strategies.

Lv2-6x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person drinking Mirinda
From clue 9, the person drinking Mirinda is on the far left. So, the first column for beverage is filled with Mirinda.


## Step 2: Identify the Dutch person's drink and position
Clue 1 states that the Dutch person drinks Fanta. However, we don't know their exact position yet, only that it's not on the far left (since that's Mirinda).


## Step 3: Place the Argentine based on surfing
From clue 5, the Argentine is into surfing. Clue 13 also tells us that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the Argentine.


## Step 4: Determine the transport used by the person on the far right
Clue 2 indicates that the helicopter is used by the person on the far right.


## Step 5: Identify the sport for the far right position
From clue 7, we know volleyball is the sport for the person on the far right.


## Step 6: Combine information about sports and hobbies
Clue 3 states that badminton is to the right of video-games. Clue 10 adds that badminton is also to the left of animation movies.


## Step 7: Place the subway user relative to others
Clue 6 says the subway is to the right of collecting, and clue 4 indicates superhero movies are between subway and spy movies.


## Step 8: Determine the hobby sequence based on clues
From clue 8, magic-tricks are to the left of board-games. Clue 11 repeats that badminton is to the right of video-games.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all given clues
- The person drinking Mirinda (far left) must have a hobby and movie preference not yet determined.
- Hot-chocolate drinker is to the left of the Argentine, who surfs.
- Since volleyball is on the far right, and badminton is to the left of animation but also to the right of video-games, we can start piecing together sequences.
- The Dutch person (drinks Fanta) isn't specified in relation to these activities directly except by drink.


## Step 10: Constructing the final table based on deductions
Let's fill in what we know for sure and make educated guesses where possible:


Given:
- Mirinda is far left.
- Hot-chocolate drinker is before the Argentine (surfer).
- Fanta drinker is Dutch, not specified exactly but must fit with other clues.
- Helicopter (far right) corresponds with volleyball.
- Badminton to the right of video-games and left of animation.


Let's assign based on what we can deduce directly from the clues:

Lv2-6x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fill in the information step by step.


From clue 4, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.
From clue 7, the indian is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
From clue 12, the spanish is on the left of the person drinking juice.
From clue 10, the person who's hobby is dancing (which is the spanish from clue 8) is the person drinking mirinda.


## Step 1: Initial Placement Based on Clues
- The indian and hot-chocolate are in positions 3 and 4, respectively, because of clue 7.
- The spanish must be in position 1 or 2 since they are on the left of the person drinking juice (clue 12), but we don't know which yet.


## Step 2: Further Placement
- From clue 9, the egyptian's hobby is chess. This means the egyptian cannot be in position 4 because the person in position 4 drinks hot-chocolate and there's no direct link between chess and hot-chocolate given yet.
- Clue 3 places the egyptian between puzzles and punk. Since we don't know where puzzles or punk are, this clue is useful for relative positioning later.


## Step 3: Analyzing Sports
- From clue 5, lacrosse is associated with folk music.
- Clue 2 tells us baseball is to the right of chess (and thus the egyptian). This implies the egyptian cannot be in position 4 because baseball must be to their right.


## Step 4: Beverage and Pet Placement
- The person drinking mirinda is on the left of basketball (clue 6), and since mirinda is associated with dancing (and hence the spanish, clue 10), this gives us a potential sport for the spanish or at least places mirinda's drinker before basketball.
- Clue 1 says the guinea-pig owner is to the right of rowing. This doesn't give us exact positions but indicates relative positioning.


## Step 5: Finalizing Positions
Given all clues, let's start filling in what we know for sure:
- Position 4 drinks hot-chocolate.
- The indian is in position 3 (from clue 7).
- The spanish must be on the left of juice (clue 12) and drinks mirinda (clue 10), placing them likely in position 1 because they need to be to the left of another beverage.


## Step 6: Filling Gaps
- Since chess is associated with the egyptian (clue 9) and baseball must be to the right of chess (clue 2), if we place chess (and thus the egyptian) in position 1, it conflicts with the need for the spanish to be in a position that allows them to be on the left of juice. So, the egyptian (chess) likely goes into position 2.
- This places the spanish (dancing, mirinda) in position 1.


## Step 7: Final Placement
Let's fill in what we can with the given information:
- Position 1: Spanish, dancing, mirinda. Since the spanish drinks mirinda and is on the left of juice (clue 12), this fits.
- Position 2: Egyptian, chess. This aligns with clue 9 and allows baseball to be to their right as per clue 2.
- Position 3: Indian, hot-chocolate does not fit here because of clue 7, so the indian must drink another beverage (likely juice given the constraints), and position 4 is hot-chocolate.
- Position 4: Hot-chocolate. Given the clues about beverages and nationalities, this slot seems to be for someone not yet directly identified by other clues.


## Step 8: Music, Pets, and Remaining Sports
- Lacrosse with folk (clue 5) can now start to get placed based on remaining options.
- The guinea-pig owner is to the right of rowing (clue 1), which helps place pets relative to sports.


Given all these considerations, let's construct a possible solution table based on logical deductions from the clues:


#############
|               |    1    |     2      |    3     |       4       |
| Beverage      | mirinda |  juice     |  iced-tea|   hot-chocolate|

This solution attempts to satisfy all given conditions based on the clues provided, but it's crucial to note that without direct information linking every aspect (beverage, hobby, music-genre, nationality, pet, sport) in a straightforward manner for each position, some assumptions are made based on logical deductions and the process of elimination.

2. The writer is to the right of the fisherman (clue 4) and to the left of the person drinking juice (clue 7).
3. The owner of the cat is to the right of the fisherman (clue 8).
4. The Argentine is to the left of the British (clue 2), but since the Pakistani (fisherman) is on the far left, the Argentine must be in the second position.
5. The person drinking juice is skydiving (clue 11) and is to the right of the writer (clue 7).
6. The bartender is a basketball player (clue 10) and is to the right of the writer (clue 4).
7. The engineer is to the left of the baseball player (clue 13).

Lv2-6x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the person whose sport is volleyball on the far left.
Given clue 11, the person whose sport is volleyball is on the far left. So, we start with:
|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |

## Step 2: Place the person watching romance movies on the far right.
From clue 2, we know the person watching romance movies is on the far right. Clue 5 also tells us this person is an accountant.
|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |

## Step 3: Determine the sport and food for each person based on given clues.
From clue 13, the person eating watermelon is the person whose sport is cycling. Clue 4 tells us this person is to the right of the Spanish nationality.

## Step 4: Use clue 6 to place the scientist who eats peach.
The scientist eats peach (clue 6) and watches animation movies (clue 9). This person is also to the right of the person drinking coffee (clue 7).

## Step 5: Place the British person eating avocado.
From clue 12, we know the British person eats avocado.

## Step 6: Apply clue 3 to place the skateboarding sport.
The person whose sport is skateboarding is to the right of the person whose sport is cycling (clue 3).

## Step 7: Use clue 1 to place the comedy movies watcher.
The person watching comedy movies is between the person whose sport is skateboarding and the freelancer (clue 1).

## Step 8: Apply clue 10 to place the coffee drinker.
The person drinking coffee is between the Mexican and the person drinking 7up (clue 10).

## Step 9: Place the remaining items based on all given clues.
From clue 8, the person drinking Sprite is to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.

Given these steps and considering all clues, let's construct the table:


|               |      1       |     2      |       3       |     4      |
| Beverage      |              |            |               |            |
| Food          | Avocado     | Peach      | Watermelon    |            |
| Job           |              | Scientist  |               | Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   |              | Animation  |               | Romance   |
| Nationality   | British     | Mexican    | Spanish       |            |
| Sport         | Volleyball  | Cycling    | Skateboarding |            |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks based on the clues:
- The person drinking coffee is between the Mexican and the person drinking 7up. Since the Mexican is in column 2, and considering other placements, coffee must be in column 2 or 3, but because the scientist (who eats peach) is to the right of the person drinking coffee, coffee cannot be in column 3. Thus, coffee is in column 2.
- The freelancer must be in column 3 because the comedy movie watcher is between the freelancer and the skateboarding sport person, and skateboarding is in column 4 (due to its placement relative to cycling).
- Given that the British person eats avocado and is in column 1, the Mexican drinks coffee (as it's between the Mexican and the person drinking 7up), the scientist (who eats peach) watches animation movies and must be in column 2.
- The person eating watermelon (cycling sport) cannot be in column 4 because skateboarding is to its right. Thus, cycling (watermelon eater) must be in column 3, but since the freelancer is also in column 3 based on previous deductions, we have a conflict that requires reevaluation of placements considering all clues again.


Reevaluating and correcting based on clues:
- Volleyball is on the far left.
- Romance (and thus the accountant) is on the far right.
- The person watching comedy movies is between the skateboarding sport person and the freelancer.
- Skateboarding is to the right of cycling, which is to the right of Spanish.
- Cycling's corresponding food is watermelon.
- The scientist eats peach and watches animation, placed to the right of coffee.
- British eats avocado.

Correcting the approach for a coherent solution that fits all clues:


Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step logic without assuming placements not directly supported by clues, let's simplify and correct the methodology focusing on direct clue applications:


1. Volleyball is far left.
2. Romance (Accountant) is far right.
3. Comedy watcher is between skateboarding and freelancer.
4. Skateboarding is right of cycling.
5. Cycling is right of Spanish.
6. Scientist eats peach, watches animation, and is right of coffee.
7. British eats avocado.

Given these direct clues and avoiding incorrect assumptions:

## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the goat is on the far left. This means the first column is reserved for the goat's owner.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The bartender is the Canadian. Since we don't know the position yet, we'll keep this in mind for later use.


## Step 3: Use Clue 6
The person driving the jet-ski is the Chinese. This gives us a nationality but not a direct position unless combined with other clues.


## Step 4: Combine Clues 9 and 6
The Chinese is between the fan of dubstep and the person drinking iced-tea. Since the Chinese drives a jet-ski, this helps in placing the Chinese relative to others based on music preferences and beverages.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 7
The person drinking iced-tea is the fan of indie. This links a beverage with a music genre.


## Step 6: Use Clue 3
The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Given that the Chinese drives the jet-ski, this places the iced-tea drinker to the right of the Chinese.


## Step 7: Analyze Clues 10 and 11
The Dutch is on the left of the fan of funk and the security-guard. This gives us a relative position for the Dutch but doesn't specify the position directly without knowing who likes funk or where the security-guard is.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 1
The owner of the rabbit is the entrepreneur. This links an occupation with a pet.


## Step 9: Use Clue 13
The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the owner of the cat. This gives us a relative position for the rabbit's owner (the entrepreneur) and the cat's owner.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 8
The person drinking juice is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we know the rabbit's owner is the entrepreneur, this places the juice drinker to the right of the entrepreneur.


## Step 11: Use Clue 12
The person driving the taxi is on the right of the fan of funk. This gives us a relative position for the taxi driver based on music preferences.


## Step 12: Combine All Information
Given all clues, let's start filling in what we know:
- The goat owner is on the far left (Clue 2).
- The Chinese drives a jet-ski and is between the fan of dubstep and the person drinking iced-tea (Clues 6 and 9).
- The person drinking iced-tea likes indie music and is to the right of the jet-ski driver (Clues 7 and 3).
- The Dutch is to the left of the fan of funk and the security-guard (Clues 10 and 11).
- The rabbit's owner (entrepreneur) is to the right of the cat's owner (Clue 13), and the juice drinker is to the right of the rabbit's owner (Clue 8).


## Step 13: Final Placement
Let's try to place everyone:
1. Far left: Goat owner.
2. Since the Dutch is on the left of the fan of funk and the security-guard, and considering other constraints, we need to fit in the Chinese (jet-ski driver) and their neighbors (dubstep fan and iced-tea drinker).
3. The entrepreneur (rabbit owner) must be placed considering they are to the right of the cat owner and to the left of the juice drinker.
4. The Canadian (bartender) needs a place, keeping in mind the other occupations and nationalities.


Given these steps and the complexity of directly applying each clue without visual aid, let's summarize the solution based on logical deductions:


The final answer is:
