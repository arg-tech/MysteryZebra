Here's a brief explanation of how the puzzle was solved:


1. Started with the most restrictive clues, such as the person drinking hot-chocolate being between the coach and the fan of folk.
2. Used clue 8 to determine that the person drinking soy-milk is also the person whose hobby is puzzles.
3. Applied clue 5 to place the person drinking cola to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
4. Utilized clue 20 to position the person drinking fanta to the right of the pakistani.
5. Combined clues 12 and 13 to determine the order of the italian and chinese nationalities.
6. Applied clue 16 to place the owner of the horse between the person whose hobby is photography and the owner of the hedgehog.
7. Used clue 19 to position the owner of the horse in the middle (position 3).
8. Continued applying the remaining clues, making sure that each new piece of information was consistent with the existing solution.

Lv2-7x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step, filling in the information as we go.

From clue 13, milk is in the 3rd position.

From clue 20, rugby is also in the middle, but since milk is already there, it must be either before or after. Given that milk is in the 3rd position and considering other clues about positions relative to each other, we'll have to adjust as we go.


Considering clue 5 (milk on the right of police-officer), the police-officer cannot be in the 3rd position since milk is there. Clue 9 tells us the writer skydives, and from clue 1, this person must be between milk and surfing. Given that writing is a hobby on the far right (clue 3) and western movies are also on the far right (clue 17), we start to build a picture.


From clue 16, freelancer is on the left of ambient, and from clue 21, ferret owner (hip-hop fan, clue 8) is between techno and freelancer. Clue 14 says ambient is on the left of goat, so we have some ordering but need more specifics.


Since milk is in the middle and rugby also needs to be central, let's place rugby as well, considering cycling must be on the left of iced-tea (clue 12) and video-games are on the left of iced-tea (clue 7), suggesting that these positions might not directly align with our current understanding without additional placement.


Given clue 17 (western movies far right) and clue 3 (writing hobby far right), it seems there's an overlap in description. Western movies being on the far right suggests its owner has a writing hobby as well, considering other clues about skydiving and writing being connected to the writer.


Let's address the beverages first with what we know: milk is in the 3rd position.


From clue 18 (almond-milk on the right of fish), if fish were in the 2nd position, almond-milk could be in the 4th or 5th. But considering other clues about positioning relative to sports and hobbies, precise placement will depend on resolving those relationships.


Considering clue 10 (ambient on the right of rugby) and knowing freelancer is on the left of ambient (clue 16), we have a sequence but need to place these with respect to known positions like milk and rugby.


Now, let's summarize what we know before filling in the table:
- Milk in the 3rd position.
- Rugby also central, possibly conflicting unless it's directly next to milk or part of a broader central positioning that includes multiple slots.
- Freelancer is on the left of ambient.
- Ambient is on the right of rugby and on the left of goat.
- Ferret owner (hip-hop fan) between techno and freelancer.


Given the complexity and the step-by-step nature required, let's directly deduce from clues without over-speculating:


Direct Clue Applications:
- From clue 4, soul fan owns a cat.
- From clue 8, ferret owner likes hip-hop.


Final Placement:
After carefully considering all clues and their implications on each category (beverage, hobby, job, movie-genre, music-genre, pet, sport), we must align them according to the given conditions. Given the extensive interconnectivity of the clues, direct placement requires satisfying multiple conditions simultaneously.


The precise arrangement of hobbies, jobs, movie genres, music genres, pets, and sports in relation to beverages is highly constrained by the provided clues. However, a step-by-step logical deduction without guessing would ideally lead us through each category, ensuring that every clue is respected.
