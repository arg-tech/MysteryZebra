Lv2-1x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step:


1. The fan of jazz is between the fan of metal and the fan of soul.
2. The fan of jazz is on the left of the fan of metal.
3. The fan of hip-hop is on the far left.


From clue 3, we know the order starts with hip-hop. So, we have:


|               |    1    |  2   |  3   |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop |      |      |       |


Given that jazz is to the left of metal (clue 2) and considering clue 1, which states jazz is between metal and soul, we can deduce that the order must allow for jazz to be positioned in such a way that it satisfies both conditions. The only way this works with hip-hop on the far left is if the order is:


hip-hop, jazz, ?, ?


Since jazz has to be between metal and soul (clue 1), and considering jazz is to the left of metal (clue 2), we can conclude that soul must come before jazz because jazz cannot be to the right of metal according to clue 2. However, this creates a contradiction with our initial interpretation based on clue 1 alone.


Let's correct the approach by strictly following all clues:


- Hip-hop is on the far left (clue 3).
- Jazz is between metal and soul (clue 1), but also specifically to the left of metal (clue 2).


This means we have hip-hop first, then jazz cannot be directly next to hip-hop if it's going to be between metal and soul. However, considering clue 2 strictly (jazz to the left of metal) and knowing that jazz must be between metal and soul, we actually need to place soul before jazz or after metal to satisfy all conditions.


Given these constraints:


1. Hip-hop is far left.
2. Jazz must be between metal and soul but also to the left of metal.


A possible arrangement satisfying all conditions would be hip-hop, soul, jazz, metal because it places jazz between soul and metal while keeping jazz to the left of metal. This seems to directly conflict with our initial interpretation based on clue 2 alone but fits when considering all clues together.


However, re-evaluating for clarity and correctness:


Given that jazz must be between metal and soul (and given jazz is to the left of metal), if we were to place soul before jazz, it would not satisfy the ""between"" condition properly because jazz needs to be directly between metal and soul. Thus, considering all clues again with strict adherence:


- Hip-hop on the far left.
- Jazz to the left of metal but also between metal and soul.


This implies that for jazz to be between metal and soul while being to the left of metal, we need a configuration where hip-hop is first (satisfying clue 3), followed by soul (to allow jazz to be ""between"" metal and soul in terms of preference order), then jazz, and then metal. This configuration directly adheres to all given clues without contradiction.


Therefore, the correct table should look like this:


#############
|               |    1    |  2   |  3   |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop | soul | jazz | metal |

Lv2-1x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:

1. The person drinking Mirinda is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
3. The person drinking Mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking cola.

From clue 1, we know Mirinda > Hot-Chocolate (in terms of position from left to right).

From clue 2, we know Iced-Tea > Cola.

Clue 3 tells us that Mirinda is between Hot-Chocolate and Cola. This means the order must be: Hot-Chocolate, Mirinda, Cola because Mirinda has to be on the right of Hot-Chocolate (clue 1) and between Hot-Chocolate and Cola (clue 3).

Given that there are four positions (1, 2, 3, 4), we need to fit Iced-Tea into this sequence while respecting clue 2 (Iced-Tea > Cola). Since Mirinda is already placed between Hot-Chocolate and Cola, the only way to satisfy all conditions, including having Iced-Tea to the right of Cola, is to place Cola last. However, this creates a conflict because Mirinda must be between Hot-Chocolate and Cola, and if Cola is last (position 4), there's no room for Iced-Tea to be after Cola as required by clue 2.

Let's correct the interpretation considering all clues properly:

1. Hot-Chocolate, Mirinda, ?, ?
2. Since Mirinda must be between Hot-Chocolate and Cola, and considering clue 2 (Iced-Tea > Cola), we can deduce:
   - If Hot-Chocolate is in position 1, Mirinda could be in 2, but this leaves us with positions 3 and 4 for Cola and Iced-Tea. Given that Iced-Tea must be to the right of Cola, the order for these two can only be Cola then Iced-Tea.
   
So, we have:
- Position 1: Hot-Chocolate
- Position 2: Mirinda (because it's on the right of Hot-Chocolate and between Hot-Chocolate and Cola)
- This leaves us with positions 3 and 4 for Cola and Iced-Tea. Since Iced-Tea must be to the right of Cola, we have:
  - Position 3: Cola
  - Position 4: Iced-Tea

Therefore, the solution table is:

#############

Lv2-1x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the bird.
2. The owner of the pony is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the turtle.
3. The owner of the bird is on the far left.

Given that the owner of the bird is on the far left, we can start by placing the bird in position 1:

|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird |        |      |        |

From clue 1, since the turtle must be to the right of the bird, and considering the bird is already at the far left (position 1), the turtle cannot be in position 2. It must be either in position 3 or 4.

Clue 2 tells us that the pony's owner is between the ferret's and the turtle's owners. This means the pony cannot be on either end (since there needs to be a pet on both sides of it). Given this, and knowing the bird is already on one end, the pony must be in position 2 or 3.

However, if we place the pony in position 2, there would not be enough space for both the ferret and the turtle to be placed with the pony between them (since one of those spots is taken by the bird). Thus, the pony must be in position 3. This means the turtle cannot be in position 3 but must be in position 4 because it has to be on the right of the bird.

So far, we have:

|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird |        | Pony | Turtle |

The only spot left for the ferret is position 2. This arrangement satisfies all conditions: the bird is on the far left, the turtle is to the right of the bird, and the pony is between the ferret and the turtle.

Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|       |  1   |   2    |  3   |   4    |

Lv2-1x4-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person eating papaya is between the person eating nectarine and the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating papaya.
3. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating strawberry.

From clue 3, we know the order for nectarine and strawberry: strawberry, nectarine.

From clue 1, we know papaya is between nectarine and asparagus. Since asparagus is to the right of papaya (clue 2), the order must be: nectarine, papaya, asparagus.

Combining this with the order for nectarine and strawberry, we get: strawberry, nectarine, papaya, asparagus.

Here is the solution table:

Lv2-1x4-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating onion is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating carrot.
2. The person eating broccoli is on the left of the person eating carrot.
3. The person eating broccoli is on the far left.

From clue 3, we know that broccoli is in position 1.

|        |    1     |   2    |   3   |     4     |
| Food   | Broccoli |        |       |           |

From clue 2, we know that carrot must be to the right of broccoli. Since broccoli is in position 1, carrot can be in either position 2, 3, or 4.

Now, let's consider clue 1: onion is between raspberry and carrot. This means that carrot cannot be in position 2, because there would be no room for onion to be between raspberry and carrot. Therefore, carrot must be in either position 3 or 4.

If carrot were in position 4, the order would be:
Broccoli, ?, ?, Carrot

In this case, onion would have to be in position 2 or 3, with raspberry in the other position. But then there would be no room for onion to be between raspberry and carrot. So, carrot must be in position 3.

The order is now:
Broccoli, ?, Carrot, ?

From clue 1, we know that onion is between raspberry and carrot. Since carrot is in position 3, onion must be in position 2, and raspberry must be in position 4.

The final solution is:


#############

Lv2-1x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify the position of the fisherman.
The fisherman is on the far right, which means the fisherman is in column 4.

## Step 2: Determine the possible positions for the lawyer and engineer.
Since the lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman, and given that the fisherman is in column 4, the lawyer must be in either column 2 or 3. This also implies that the engineer must be on the opposite side of the lawyer from the fisherman.

## Step 3: Apply the first clue to narrow down positions.
Given that the lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman, if we consider the lawyer to be in column 2, the engineer would have to be in column 1 (because the lawyer must be between the engineer and the fisherman). If the lawyer were in column 3, the engineer could not be placed without violating the condition that the lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman, because there's no space for the engineer to the left of the lawyer if the lawyer is in column 3. Therefore, the most feasible arrangement starts with the engineer in column 1.

## Step 4: Finalize the positions based on the clues.
- The engineer must be in column 1 (to satisfy the condition that the lawyer is between the engineer and the fisherman).
- The lawyer then can only fit into column 2, as it needs to be between the engineer and the fisherman.
- Column 3 remains for the accountant since all other jobs have been assigned a position based on the clues.
- The fisherman is in column 4.

The final solution table is:

Lv2-1x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person drinking juice is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking fanta.
2. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking juice.

From statement 2, we know the order for juice and fanta is: juice - fanta.

Given statement 1, lemonade must be on the other side of juice from fanta, so the possible arrangement considering just these two statements could be: lemonade - juice - fanta.

However, statement 3 introduces soy-milk, stating that fanta is between soy-milk and juice. This means our previous straightforward arrangement needs adjustment because it seems to contradict the direct placement of juice and fanta without considering soy-milk's position. 

Let's re-evaluate: 
- Juice must be on the left of fanta (statement 2).
- Fanta is between soy-milk and juice (statement 3), which means soy-milk cannot be on the right side of fanta if we are to satisfy all conditions given.

Considering all statements together:
- The arrangement that fits all criteria, considering the constraints about the relative positions of juice, fanta, and including lemonade and soy-milk, requires us to place soy-milk in a way that respects the ""between"" conditions for both sets (juice-fanta and soy-milk-fanta).

Thus, given that fanta must be between soy-milk and juice, but also juice is on the left of fanta and between lemonade and fanta, we have to consider the order carefully. If we place lemonade first, followed by juice, then fanta (to satisfy statement 1), we still need to incorporate soy-milk in a way that respects all conditions.

The correct sequence respecting ""fanta is between soy-milk and juice"" and other conditions seems tricky at first glance because the statements seem to loop back on each other. However, breaking it down:

- Since fanta must be after juice (from statement 2), and juice cannot be at position 4 (because then fanta would have to be beyond position 4, which is not possible given only four positions), we deduce that the sequence has to allow for lemonade to precede juice or follow it, with soy-milk's placement being key.

Given all constraints:
- The puzzle hints at a circular dependency but let's simplify: 
    - If juice is between lemonade and fanta (statement 1) and also on the left of fanta (statement 2), this strongly suggests an order where lemonade precedes juice, which then precedes fanta.
    - However, with soy-milk needing to be before fanta as well (since fanta is between soy-milk and juice), we realize that soy-milk must come first because it allows for the ""between"" conditions to be satisfied when considering all beverages.

So, if we start with soy-milk to satisfy the condition of fanta being between soy-milk and juice:
- The order becomes clearer: Soy-milk (1) - Lemonade cannot precede juice in a way that fits all given statements without contradicting them. Thus, considering the constraints about positions relative to each other, we need an arrangement where soy-milk leads, followed by lemonade or directly by juice to keep fanta between soy-milk and juice while respecting juice's left position to fanta.

The solution that fits is:
- Starting with soy-milk (to allow fanta to be between it and juice), then considering the rest of the constraints, we see that lemonade must fit into this sequence in a way that respects all ""between"" conditions.

Given these conditions, let's finalize the arrangement:
1. Soy-milk
2. Lemonade
3. Juice
4. Fanta

This order satisfies all given statements: 
- The person drinking juice is between lemonade and fanta.
- The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
- The person drinking fanta is between soy-milk and juice, considering their positions relative to each other.

Lv2-1x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


1. The person driving the airplane is on the far left.
2. The person driving the scooter is between the person driving the airplane and the person driving the subway.


From clue 1, we know the arrangement starts with the airplane. So, we have:


|             |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4     |
| Transport   | Airplane |         |        |           |


From clue 2, since the scooter is between the airplane and the subway, and given that the airplane is already placed at position 1, the scooter must be at position 2, and the subway must then be at either position 3 or 4. However, because the scooter is specifically between the airplane and the subway, the subway cannot be at position 4 if we are to satisfy the condition of the scooter being ""between"" them. Thus, the initial placement based on clue 2 gives us:


|             |    1     |    2    |   3    |     4     |
| Transport   | Airplane | Scooter | Subway |           |


Now, we have one mode of transport left to place: the quad-bike. Since all other positions are filled based on the clues provided, the quad-bike must go in the last remaining spot, which is position 4.


Therefore, the completed table looks like this:

Lv2-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching time-travel movies is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The person watching fantasy movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching time-travel movies.
3. The person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person watching disaster movies.

From statement 2, we know the order must be either Comedy-Fantasy-Time Travel or Time Travel-Fantasy-Comedy. However, from statement 1, we know Time Travel must be to the left of Fantasy, so the correct sequence for these three genres is Time Travel-Fantasy-Comedy.

Now, incorporating statement 3, which tells us Comedy is to the left of Disaster, we can conclude the full order is:

Time Travel - Fantasy - Comedy - Disaster

Thus, the solution table with the movie-genres filled in according to the given conditions is:

Lv2-1x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:


1. The person who prefers volleyball is on the far left.
2. The person who prefers parkour is between the person who prefers weightlifting and the person who prefers volleyball.


Given these clues, we can start filling out the table as follows:


Since volleyball is on the far left (position 1), we have:

|         |     1      |    2    |       3       |   4    |
| Sport   | Volleyball |         |               |        |

From clue 2, parkour must be between weightlifting and volleyball. Since volleyball is at position 1, parkour cannot be to the left of it, so it must be to the right, with weightlifting further to the right than parkour. Thus:

|         |     1      |    2    |       3       |   4    |
| Sport   | Volleyball | Parkour | Weightlifting |        |

The only sport left is skiing, which must then be in position 4:
