Lv2-3x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the nationalities, pets, and modes of transport for each position.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2
The person driving the boat is on the far right (position 6).


## Step 2: Apply Clue 8
The Chinese is on the left of the person driving the boat. Since the boat is in position 6, the Chinese must be in position 5.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 10
The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 11
The Thai is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. This implies the Italian (owner of the goldfish) cannot be in position 6 because there needs to be space for the Thai to the right of the Italian.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 9
The Thai is on the left of the Australian.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 1
The person driving the airplane is the owner of the horse.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 3
The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the tram. This means the tram cannot be in position 6 because the airplane needs to be to its right.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 12
The Thai is between the person driving the tram and the owner of the goldfish. Given that the Italian owns the goldfish, this clue helps us understand the relative positioning but requires further clues to solidify positions.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 4
The person driving the van is the owner of the snake.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 7
The owner of the snake is on the right of the person driving the taxi. This implies the taxi and van are not in consecutive positions from the left (since something has to be between them), but it does tell us that the taxi must come before the van.


## Step 11: Apply Clue 5
The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person driving the car. Given the Italian owns the goldfish, this means the car cannot be in position 6.


## Step 12: Combine Information to Place Nationalities and Modes of Transport
From clue 13, knowing the airplane's position relative to others helps but requires deduction based on previous steps. Given the constraints:
- The Chinese is in position 5.
- The Italian (goldfish owner) must be positioned so that the Thai can be to their right, considering other placements.
- The boat is in position 6, and thus the Chinese cannot own it since they are in position 5.
- The airplane's driver owns a horse and is on the right of the tram but must fit with the Thai being between the tram and the goldfish owner.


## Step 13: Finalize Positions
Given all clues:
1. **Nationality**: Consider the fixed positions (Chinese in 5, boat in 6) and relative positions (Thai to the right of Italian, etc.).
2. **Pet**: With specific owners like the Italian owning a goldfish and the van driver owning a snake.
3. **Transport**: Airplane on the right of tram, taxi before van, car's position relative to goldfish owner.


The final answer is:

## Step 2: Applying Clue 1
The person watching animation movies is the person drinking juice. So, the movie genre for position 1 is animation.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |

## Step 3: Using Clue 12
The person drinking juice is the owner of the ferret. So, the pet for position 1 is ferret.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 7
The person drinking almond-milk is between the person watching animation movies and the owner of the lizard. Since animation is at position 1, almond-milk must be at position 2, and the lizard must be at a position to the right of almond-milk.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |

## Step 5: Applying Clue 8
The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means the movie genre for position 3 must be scientific.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |
| Beverage      |   juice   | almond-milk |            |         | soy-milk |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |             | scientific |         |          |            |
| Pet           |  ferret   |             |            |         |          |            |

## Step 6: Using Clue 3
The person drinking milk is the owner of the turtle. We don't know the position yet, but we'll keep this in mind.

## Step 7: Applying Clue 4
The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since scientific movies are at position 3, milk must be at position 4.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |
| Beverage      |   juice   | almond-milk |            |  milk   | soy-milk |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation |             | scientific |         |          |            |
| Pet           |  ferret   |             |            | turtle  |          |            |

## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 5
The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person drinking coffee. We need to find a place for coffee and documentary.

## Step 9: Using Clue 10
The owner of the ferret is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the ferret is at position 1, documentary must be to the right of it but before coffee.

## Step 10: Applying Clue 2
The person drinking sprite is the person watching superhero movies. We also know from clue 11 that fantasy is to the left of sprite.

## Step 11: Filling in Remaining Information
Given all clues, we have to fit in the remaining options:
- Beverage: coffee, sprite
- Movie-Genre: documentary, fantasy, superhero, western
- Pet: chinchilla, hedgehog, horse, lizard

From clue 13, the owner of the chinchilla is on the far right. Clue 9 indicates western is to the left of the horse.

Let's fill in what we can:
- Since scientific is at position 3 and milk (turtle) is at position 4, and considering clue 8, we have a sequence but need to fit in documentary, fantasy, and their respective beverages and pets.

## Step 12: Finalizing Positions
Given the constraints:
- Documentary must be before coffee.
- Fantasy is before sprite.
- Western is before horse.
- Almond-milk is between animation and lizard (so lizard can't be at position 2, it must be further right).
- The only place for documentary that fits all conditions, especially with clue 10, is if we adjust our understanding to fit the pets and genres around the fixed points.

Considering all clues again and fitting them into the remaining spaces:

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |
| Beverage      |   juice   | almond-milk |  coffee    |  milk   |  sprite  |            |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | documentary | scientific | fantasy | superhero| western    |
| Pet           |  ferret   |  lizard     | hedgehog   | turtle  |  horse   | chinchilla |

And finally, fitting in the last beverage (which must be soy-milk) and ensuring it aligns with all given clues:

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |    4    |    5     |     6      |
| Beverage      |   juice   | almond-milk |  coffee    |  milk   |  sprite  | soy-milk   |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | documentary | scientific | fantasy | superhero| western    |
| Pet           |  ferret   |  lizard     | hedgehog   | turtle  |  horse   | chinchilla |

The final answer is:

Lv2-3x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the steps and clues given:


## Step 1: Determine the paramedic's position and its relation to other elements.
The paramedic is on the far left (Clue 3), and the paramedic is on the left of the fan of soul (Clue 4). This means the order for these two positions from left to right is: paramedic, ?, ..., fan of soul.


## Step 2: Establish the position of the fan of reggae and the bartender.
The fan of reggae is on the left of the bartender (Clue 1). Given the paramedic's fixed position, we can start building a sequence but need more information to place them precisely.


## Step 3: Determine the transport used by the fan of soul.
The person driving the train is the fan of soul (Clue 2). This gives us a specific transportation method for the fan of soul.


## Step 4: Place the helicopter in relation to the fan of soul.
The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the fan of soul (Clue 6). Since the paramedic is also on the left of the fan of soul and is at the far left, we have a potential sequence starting with the paramedic.


## Step 5: Position the jet-ski user relative to the bartender.
The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the bartender (Clue 5). This clue helps in placing the bartender and the jet-ski user but requires integration with other clues for exact positioning.


## Step 6: Identify the fan of blues' position.
The fan of blues is on the far right (Clue 7), giving us a clear endpoint to work towards.


## Step 7: Integrate the remaining clues to fill in gaps.
- The bus driver is on the right of the fan of classical and on the left of the fan of country (Clues 8 and 12).
- The nurse is between the fan of house and the train driver (fan of soul) (Clue 11).
- The firefighter is on the right of the fan of house and also on the right of the entrepreneur (Clues 13 and 14).
- The trike user is on the right of the subway user (Clue 10).


## Step 8: Assemble all clues into a coherent table.
Given the complexity and the need for iterative placement based on clues, we deduce:
1. Paramedic (far left) must be driving something, but it's not specified directly. Given the helicopter is to the left of the fan of soul and the paramedic is also to the left of the fan of soul, and considering the paramedic is at the far left, the paramedic could potentially drive the helicopter or another vehicle that fits the clues.
2. The fan of reggae being on the left of the bartender helps place these two relative to each other but requires integration with other clues for exact placement.
3. Since the nurse is between the fan of house and the train (fan of soul), and considering the firefighter's position relative to the fan of house, we start building a sequence that can accommodate all conditions.


Given the extensive clues and the need for precise iterative logic that fits each step without contradiction, let's simplify and directly construct a possible solution table based on the given information:


Considering all clues:
- Paramedic is at the far left.
- Helicopter user (potentially paramedic) is to the left of the fan of soul.
- Reggae fan is to the left of the bartender.
- Train driver is the fan of soul.
- Jet-ski user is to the right of the bartender.
- Blues fan is at the far right.
- Nurse between house fan and train (soul) fan.
- Firefighter to the right of house fan and entrepreneur.


A potential arrangement could look like this, though it requires careful placement to ensure all clues are satisfied:


|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |   6   |
| Job           | Paramedic | Entrepreneur | Nurse    | Bartender   | Firefighter| Coach |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae    | House      | Classical| Country     | Soul       | Blues |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Subway     | Bus      | Jet-ski     | Train      | Trike |


However, the precise arrangement must adhere to all given clues without any contradictions. The above table is an attempt based on logical deductions but may require further adjustments for complete accuracy.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |   6   |

Lv2-3x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each clue step by step to deduce the arrangement of nationalities, pets, and sports.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 7 and Clue 8
The owner of the hamster is on the far left (Clue 7), and the Thai is the owner of the hamster (Clue 8). So, the first column is filled by a Thai person who owns a hamster.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5 and Clue 6
The Japanese is the owner of the guinea-pig (Clue 5), and the owner of the guinea-pig's sport is baseball (Clue 6). This means the Japanese person owns a guinea-pig and prefers baseball.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 4
The owner of the horse is on the left of the Japanese. Since we know the Japanese person's preferences, we can start building the sequence with the horse's owner to the left of the Japanese.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 1
The owner of the horse is on the right of the person who prefers volleyball. Combining this with the information from Step 3, we have a sequence where volleyball is to the left of the horse's owner, and the horse's owner is to the left of the Japanese.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 2
The owner of the dog is on the left of the person who prefers golf. This clue will help in placing the dog's owner relative to golf.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 9
The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who prefers golf. Now we have a sequence for golf and rabbit but need more information to place them.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 3
The person who prefers biathlon is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Given that the Japanese owns a guinea-pig and prefers baseball, biathlon must be after baseball.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 10
The Dutch is the person who prefers parkour. This clue doesn't give us an immediate placement but will be useful once we have more sequences figured out.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 11
The Australian is between the Chinese and the Dutch. This gives us a nationality sequence but not their exact positions or pets/sports yet.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 12
The owner of the dog is on the right of the person who prefers baseball. Given that baseball is preferred by the Japanese, the dog's owner must be after the Japanese.


## Step 11: Combining All Information
- Thai (hamster) is on the far left.
- The sequence for some parts is volleyball -> horse owner -> Japanese (guinea-pig, baseball).
- Biathlon is after baseball (Japanese), so it could fit into a spot that follows the known sequences, considering other clues about positions relative to sports and pets.


Given these steps and combining all information:


1. Thai - Hamster - ?
2. ? - ? - Volleyball
3. ? - Horse - ?
4. Japanese - Guinea-pig - Baseball
5. ? - ? - Biathlon
6. ? - ? - ?

From Clue 11, Australian is between Chinese and Dutch. With the Dutch preferring parkour (Clue 10), we can start placing nationalities:


- The owner of the dog is on the left of golf (Clue 2) and on the right of baseball (Clue 12), suggesting a sequence where after baseball (Japanese), there's the dog owner, then golf.


Considering all clues and filling in the gaps with the remaining information:


1. Thai - Hamster - Parkour (doesn't fit; need to adjust based on Clue 10 and others)
2. Chinese - Dog - Golf (fits with some adjustments for volleyball and considering other placements)
3. Australian - Horse - Volleyball
4. Japanese - Guinea-pig - Baseball
5. German - Rabbit - Biathlon (considering the remaining options and fitting them into the sequence)
6. Dutch - Goat - Parkour (last option, fits with Clue 10)


Adjusting for the correct placement based on all clues:


1. Thai - Hamster - Climbing (only sport left for this position, considering parkour is taken by Dutch)
2. Chinese - Dog - Golf
3. Australian - Horse - Volleyball
4. Japanese - Guinea-pig - Baseball
5. German - Rabbit - Biathlon
6. Dutch - Goat - Parkour


Given the constraints and clues:


The final answer is:

- The person whose hobby is baking is on the far right and eats cherry (clues 1 and 4).
- The person whose hobby is skydiving eats papaya and is to the left of mirinda (clues 2 and 12).
- The person eating eggplant drinks sprite, which is to the right of fanta (clue 10).
- Reading and hot-chocolate are together (clue 6), with singing and pomegranate to their right (clue 5).
- Tea is between papaya and hiking (clue 8).

Let's fill in the remaining blanks based on these rules.


Given the complexity of directly solving this step-by-step without visual aids for each step beyond this point, let's summarize how we can use the clues to deduce the final table:


1. Blueberry is on the left.
2. Cherry and baking are on the right.
3. Papaya and skydiving are before cherry, so papaya must be in position 2 or 3 since blueberry is in position 1 and cherry/baking are in position 6.
4. Since the person drinking mirinda is after skydiving (clue 2), and considering other constraints about food and hobbies, we start to see possible positions for each.
5. Eggplant and sprite must follow fanta, which helps with beverage placement.
6. Reading and hot-chocolate, then singing and pomegranate, give us a sequence for part of the table.
7. Tea is between papaya and hiking, helping to place these items.


Let's attempt to finalize based on logical deductions from clues:


The final solution must fit all given clues. Given the direct placement clues and the relative positioning clues, we deduce:


- Blueberry is far left (Food: Blueberry, _, _, _, _, Cherry)
- Skydiving is with papaya, which must be before mirinda and after blueberry.
- Reading is with hot-chocolate, and singing is with pomegranate to their right.
- Tea is between papaya and hiking.
- Eggplant drinks sprite, which is after fanta.
- Baking (with cherry) is far right.


Given the interlocking nature of these clues, we have to fit them together like a puzzle:


Blueberry on the left, Cherry on the right, with specific hobbies and foods matched and placed according to the given clues.


The final answer is:

From clue 10, we know the person whose hobby is singing owns a chinchilla.

From clue 3, the person who sings (and thus owns a chinchilla) is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.

From clue 7 and 9, the person whose hobby is fishing is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla, and since the owner of the chinchilla also sings, we have: fishing -> singing (chinchilla).

Clue 12 tells us that traveling is on the left of disaster movies.

Clue 2 says disaster movies are on the left of zombie movies.

So far, for movie genres, we have: ... -> disaster -> zombie.

From clue 13, scientific movies are between collecting and fishing. 

Given clue 6 (traveling on the right of collecting) and combining with clue 12 (traveling on the left of disaster), we can start forming a sequence for hobbies: collecting -> traveling.

Clue 11 places romance between traveling and scientific. Since traveling is before disaster (clue 12), and disaster is before zombie, and given that scientific must be after collecting but also after fishing according to clue 13, we have for movie genres so far: ... -> romance doesn't fit here yet, so it's part of another sequence.

For hobbies and pets, combining all information:
- We know the bird owner draws (clue 8).
- The fish owner is on the right of the turtle owner (clue 4), but we don't have their hobbies or movie genres yet.
- Given that fishing is before singing (chinchilla) from our deductions and clue 7, and knowing traveling comes after collecting (clue 6), we can piece together parts of the sequence.

Let's organize what we know into a rough outline for each category without assigning positions yet:

Hobbies: 
- Collecting
- Traveling (after collecting)
- Fishing
- Singing (also owns chinchilla, after fishing)

Pets:
- Chinchilla (singing)
- Bird (drawing)
- Others not yet assigned

Movie Genres:
- Disaster
- Zombie (after disaster)
- Romance (between traveling and scientific)
- Scientific (after collecting but also after fishing)

Now, let's fill in more details based on the clues:

From clue 1, the bird owner is to the right of disaster movies. Given that the bird owner draws, we can say: ... -> disaster -> drawing (bird) ...

Clue 5 places chinchilla (singing) to the right of crime movies.

Given that traveling is before disaster (clue 12), and romance is between traveling and scientific (clue 11), we have for movie genres related to hobbies: collecting -> ? -> traveling -> romance -> scientific doesn't fit here directly, so it must relate to another hobby sequence. 

We know fishing is before singing (chinchilla) from our deductions. Since the owner of the chinchilla sings and is after crime movies (clue 5), we have a possible sequence for movie genres that includes: ... -> crime -> ? -> disaster -> zombie.

Considering all clues again, let's try to fit everything together:

1. Collecting must come before traveling (clue 6).
2. Traveling comes before disaster movies (clue 12).
3. Disaster movies are followed by zombie movies (clue 2).
4. The bird owner draws and is after disaster movies (clue 1 and 8), suggesting: ... -> disaster -> drawing (bird) -> zombie.
5. Fishing is before singing, which owns a chinchilla (from our deductions).
6. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching disaster movies (clue 12), and romance is between traveling and scientific (clue 11), we might have: collecting -> ? -> traveling -> romance -> ?.

Given these sequences, let's fill in more based on the clues:

- Crime must come before chinchilla (singing) which comes after fishing.
- Since scientific is between collecting and fishing (but actually has to be after because collecting is before traveling), it suggests a misunderstanding in direct sequence. Scientific could fit after romance if we consider another hobby like woodworking or drawing that hasn't been directly placed.

Let's re-evaluate with all clues:
- The sequence for hobbies considering traveling, collecting, and the rest must align with movie genres and pets.
- Collecting -> traveling (from clue 6).
- Fishing before singing (and chinchilla), which is also after crime movies.

Given that we have to fit in all hobbies, movie genres, and pets exactly once and follow all clues precisely:

Let's consider the full implications of each clue again with a focus on direct placements and sequences.


After re-evaluation considering all given information:


Given the complexity and the direct relationships outlined by the clues, let's deduce the final table based on logical deductions from the provided clues:


The solution to this puzzle requires careful consideration of each clue in relation to the others. After analyzing the clues and their implications:

From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left.
From clue 3, we know the malaysian is the person who's hobby is skydiving.
From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person eating cabbage.


So, the first column is:
|               |     1     |
| Food          | cabbage  |
| Hobby         | skydiving|
| Nationality   | malaysian|


From clue 1 and 2, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the mexican and on the right of the person eating onion.
From clue 5, we know the mexican is the person eating tomato.


Considering these clues together with clue 8 (the person eating asparagus is the colombian) and clue 4 (the mexican is on the right of the person eating asparagus), we can start building the table:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |
| Food          | cabbage  | onion     | asparagus|
| Hobby         | skydiving|            |          |
| Nationality   | malaysian|            | colombian|


From clue 4, since the mexican is on the right of the person eating asparagus and eats tomato, we can add this information:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Food          | cabbage  | onion     | asparagus| tomato    |
| Hobby         | skydiving|            |          |           |
| Nationality   | malaysian|            | colombian| mexican   |


From clue 2, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be to the right of the person eating onion and to the left of the mexican. Therefore:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |
| Food          | cabbage  | onion     | asparagus| tomato    |
| Hobby         | skydiving| rock-climbing|          |           |
| Nationality   | malaysian|            | colombian| mexican   |


Now, let's consider the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table.


From clue 10, the brazilian is on the left of the dutch.
From clue 11, the person eating kale is on the left of the thai.


We also know from clue 7 that the person eating kale is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since we don't have a column for the person with the hobby camping yet, and considering the constraints about kale being to the left of thai and after camping, we need to place these carefully, keeping in mind the positions of brazilian and dutch relative to each other.


From clue 12, the person who's hobby is singing is on the far right.
From clue 13, the person eating strawberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person who's hobby is cooking.


Given that the first column already has cabbage (and skydiving), we can start placing strawberry and its adjacent hobby of cooking:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |       5       |    6    |
| Food          | cabbage  | onion     | asparagus| tomato    |               |         |
| Hobby         | skydiving| rock-climbing|          |           |               | singing |
| Nationality   | malaysian|            | colombian| mexican   |               |         |


Since strawberry must be between cabbage and cooking, but we already have someone eating onion in the second column (which is next to cabbage), strawberry cannot fit directly next to cabbage without violating other conditions. Thus, considering all placements:


The person who's hobby is rock-climbing could potentially be next to the person eating strawberry if we rearrange some elements while keeping the constraints:


However, given the strict placement rules and re-examining clue 13 in light of the entire puzzle, it seems there was a misinterpretation. Let's correctly place everything with all clues considered properly:


- The first column is skydiving/malaysian/cabbage.
- Strawberry must be between cabbage and cooking (clue 13), but given our initial setup and the necessity to correct the approach based on all clues, let's finalize the table considering all given information correctly.


Given the complexity and upon re-evaluation of the steps for accurate placement according to each clue:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |      4      |       5       |    6    |

Lv2-3x6-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the motorbike
From clue 12, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the far left. So, the transport for column 1 is ""motorbike"".


## Step 2: Identify the food and pet for column 1
Since the motorbike's position is determined but no direct clues link it to a specific food or pet yet, we'll move on to other clues that can give us more information about the arrangement.


## Step 3: Place the person eating tomato
From clue 3, the person driving the roller eats tomato. Clue 7 states this person is also on the left of the person eating apple.


## Step 4: Position the roller and its adjacent foods
Given that the roller's driver eats tomato (clue 3) and is to the left of the person eating apple (clue 7), we start forming a sequence but still lack specific column assignments.


## Step 5: Determine the position of the van and turtle
Clue 2 says the van is on the left of the turtle, and clue 5 states the turtle's owner is on the far right. Clue 11 places the van to the right of the goat's owner.


## Step 6: Place the pony's owner
The pony's owner is between the person eating blueberry and the rabbit's owner (clue 9) and also between the horse's owner and the roller's driver (clue 8). This gives us a sequence but not exact positions yet.


## Step 7: Sequence the foods based on given clues
- The person eating plum is to the right of the person eating blueberry (clue 10).
- The person eating peach is to the right of the goat's owner (clue 13).


## Step 8: Piece together the sequences and positions
Given the roller's driver eats tomato and is on the left of the apple eater, and considering other clues about relative positions:
- We know the motorbike is at column 1.
- The van must be before the turtle, which is at column 6.
- Since the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the van (clue 6), and knowing the van's relative position, we can start piecing together the transport sequence.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues
Considering all given information:
1. Motorbike at column 1.
2. The roller's driver eats tomato, is to the left of apple eater (clue 7), and drives a roller (clue 3).
3. The pony's owner is between blueberry and rabbit or horse and roller, but since roller is with tomato, it must be between horse and roller doesn't fit; thus, it's between blueberry and rabbit.
4. Plum is to the right of blueberry (clue 10), peach to the right of goat (clue 13).
5. Van is before turtle (at column 6), jet-ski after van.


Given these steps, let's assemble a possible solution:


|             |     1     |  2   |   3    |   4   |   5   |    6     |
| Food        |           |      |        |       |       |          |
| Pet         |           |      |        |       |       |          |
| Transport   | motorbike |      |        |       |       |          |

From the clues:
- Motorbike (1) is known.
- Bus is to the left of tomato (but we know roller is with tomato, so bus must be before roller).
- Van is before turtle and after goat; jet-ski after van.
- Roller with tomato, before apple.
- Pony between blueberry and rabbit or horse and roller; since roller is fixed with tomato, pony must be between horse and the sequence that includes blueberry and rabbit.


A possible arrangement considering all clues could look like this:


|             |     1     |  2   |   3    |   4   |   5   |    6     |
| Food        | peach    | plum | tomato | apple |       |          |
| Pet         | goat     |     | horse  | rabbit| pony  | turtle   |
| Transport   | motorbike| bus | roller | bike  | jet-ski| van      |

However, this is an incomplete and partially incorrect attempt at solving the puzzle directly. Given the complexity of the clues, a precise step-by-step solution requires meticulously applying each clue to deduce the correct arrangement, which involves a process of elimination and sequential logic that was not fully applied here.

Lv2-3x6-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each clue step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 3
The person whose sport is cycling is on the far right. This means the sixth position is for cycling.

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |     4      |      5      |     6     |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 14
The person watching adventure movies is the person whose sport is cycling. This fills in the movie genre for the sixth position.

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |     4      |      5      |     6     |

## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 and 9
The person whose sport is golf is the person watching drama movies, and the person drinking mirinda is the person whose sport is golf. This means we have a pair (mirinda, drama, golf), but we don't know where to place it yet.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since we have a pair with drama and we know golf is also involved, this gives us an order for two positions (drama, comedy) but without specific sports or beverages yet except that golf goes with drama.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 13
The person whose sport is golf is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. This reinforces our previous step and adds that golf (and thus mirinda) must be before comedy.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 1 and 4
The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking water, and the person whose sport is biathlon is on the left of the person drinking coffee. This gives us an order for beverages (water, biathlon's drink, coffee) but doesn't specify where these are in relation to our other clues yet.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 7
The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person watching satire movies. This adds another piece to our puzzle, indicating that coffee must be before satire.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 11 and 6
The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer, and the person whose sport is soccer is between the person whose sport is cycling and the person watching horror movies. Given cycling is at position 6, this means soccer must be in position 5.

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |     4      |      5      |     6     |

| Sport         |         |               |          |            | soccer      | cycling   |

## Step 9: Apply Clue 8
The person whose sport is basketball is the person watching horror movies. Given the position of soccer, this means basketball (and thus horror movies) must be in position 4.

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |     4      |      5      |     6     |
| Beverage      |         |               |          |            |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |         |               |          | horror     |             | adventure |
| Sport         |         |               |          | basketball | soccer      | cycling   |

## Step 10: Apply Remaining Clues
Given the constraints:
- Mirinda, drama, golf must be before comedy (from clues 2, 9, and 5).
- Coffee is on the right of water and left of satire (clues 1 and 7).
- Biathlon's drink is between water and coffee (clue 4).
- Almond-milk is on the left of 7up (clue 10), which helps us place some beverages.
- Lemonade is between spy movies and mirinda (clue 12).

From clue 13, we know golf (mirinda) is before comedy. Given soccer's position, and that horror must be before soccer (clue 11), comedy can't fit in the remaining spots without breaking other rules unless it's after drama.

Given the arrangement of sports and genres so far, and knowing cycling is at the end with adventure movies, we start filling in from the beginning:

1. Since golf (mirinda) is before comedy, and considering all constraints, let's place mirinda (golf, drama) first.
2. Then comes the pair that must be before satire and after coffee (considering clue 7), which could involve water or another drink not yet placed.

| Sport         | golf    |               |          | basketball | soccer      | cycling   |

## Step 11: Final Placement
Considering all clues and the positions we've filled:
- Almond-milk is before 7up (clue 10).
- Lemonade is between spy movies and mirinda (clue 12), which doesn't fit with our current arrangement unless lemonade's position is flexible based on other drinks.
- Coffee must be after water (clue 1) and before satire (clue 7).

Given these constraints, we can place the remaining items:
- Since coffee must be before satire and after water, and considering biathlon is between water and coffee (clue 4), this sequence helps us understand the beverage order but requires fitting around the other clues.
- The only spot left for comedy is after drama, given all other constraints.

Let's finalize with a guess based on the clues:
- Water could fit well in the second position, as it allows biathlon and then coffee to follow, which fits with several clues.
- Coffee being before satire (clue 7) suggests that satire should be near the end but before adventure, given cycling's fixed position.
- Since basketball is horror movies, and soccer is between cycling and horror (considering clue 6), our arrangement for sports seems mostly set.

Given all constraints, here's a possible final table:


#############
|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |     4      |      5      |     6     |
| Beverage      | mirinda | water         | almond-milk| lemonade   | coffee     | 7up        |
| Movie-Genre   | drama   | spy           | comedy     | horror     | satire     | adventure |
| Sport         | golf    | biathlon      | weightlifting| basketball | soccer      | cycling   |

This solution attempts to satisfy all given clues, but the complexity and interdependence of the constraints mean there might be slight variations or interpretations. However, this arrangement should fit the requirements outlined in the problem."	{'beverage': ['mirinda', 'water', 'almond-milk', 'lemonade', 'coffee', '7up'], 'movie-genre': ['drama', 'spy', 'comedy', 'horror', 'satire', 'adventure'], 'sport': ['golf', 'biathlon', 'weightlifting', 'basketball', 'soccer', 'cycling']}	True	10	False
Lv2-3x6-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply each clue step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 13
The person drinking mirinda is on the far right (position 6).
|            |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4      |     5      |      6       |
| Beverage   |             |          |             |             |            |  mirinda    |
| Hobby      |             |          |             |             |            | photography |
| Job        |             |          |             |             |            |              |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person whose hobby is photography drinks mirinda, which we've already placed.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 14
The person drinking tea has a hobby of camping.
|            |      1      |    2     |      3      |      4      |     5      |      6       |
| Beverage   |             |          |             |             |            |  mirinda    |
| Hobby      |             |          |             |             |            | photography |
| Job        |             |          |             |             |            |              |
Considering clue 10, camping is to the left of board-games.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 10
Camping is on the left of board-games.
Given the arrangement and clue 14, we can start forming a sequence but need more information for exact placement.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1
The writer is on the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 4
Board-games are on the left of reading.
This gives us a sequence: camping -> board-games -> reading, with tea corresponding to camping and an unknown beverage for board-games and reading.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 8
The analyst is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
So, we have: ? (analyst) -> ? (reading) as part of our sequence.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 12
Board-games are between tea and almond-milk.
Since camping (tea) is before board-games, and considering clue 11, almond-milk must be after board-games but before hiking (iced-tea).


## Step 9: Apply Clue 11
Almond-milk is between the analyst and hiking.
Given that analyst is before reading, and reading is after board-games, we infer almond-milk's position relative to these hobbies.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 6
Almond-milk is on the left of the dressmaker.
This clue helps us place jobs in relation to beverages.


## Step 11: Apply Clue 3
Water is on the right of the musician.
Given that water's position is after the musician, we can start placing jobs and beverages together.


## Step 12: Apply Clue 5
The musician is on the right of woodworking.
This clue helps us understand the sequence of jobs but requires integration with other clues for precise placement.


## Step 13: Integrate All Clues
From clue 14 and step 3, we know tea (camping) must be in one of the earlier positions. Considering all sequences:
- Camping (tea) is before board-games.
- Board-games are between tea and almond-milk (clue 12).
- Almond-milk is between the analyst and hiking (iced-tea) (clue 11).
- The analyst is before reading (clue 8).
- Reading follows board-games (clue 4).
Given these, a possible sequence starts to form:
1. Tea (camping)
2. Analyst
3. Almond-milk (board-games)
4. Iced-tea (hiking)
5. Water (after musician, but exact position of musician and water needs further deduction)


## Step 14: Finalize Positions
From clue 7, camping is on the left of the coach, which doesn't directly tell us the job of the person drinking tea but indicates a sequence.
Considering all clues for jobs:
- The musician must be before water (clue 3).
- Woodworking is before the musician (clue 5).
- Since camping (tea) is on the left of board-games, and given other sequences, we can infer positions.
