## Step 9: Place the person who's sport is climbing
The person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing (Clue 9), and the person watching scientific movies is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person who's sport is water-polo (Clue 14).
Given previous placements, we adjust to fit all remaining clues:

Lv2-3x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to determine the nationality, sport, and transport for each position.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 15
The Canadian is on the far right, so we can fill in the nationality for position 7 as Canadian.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 12
The person driving the bus is the Canadian. Since the Canadian is at position 7, the transport for position 7 is bus.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 1
The Canadian is on the right of the person driving the car. This means the person driving the car must be at position 6, because the Canadian is at position 7.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person who's sport is badminton is the Thai. We don't know the position yet, but we can link badminton with the Thai nationality.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 16
The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the Thai. This gives us a relative position but not an exact one yet.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 3
Clue 2 seems to be a repeat or error, so we focus on Clue 3: The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. This gives us another relative position.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 4
The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person driving the bus. Since the bus is at position 7 (with the Canadian), parkour must be at either position 5 or 6, but because the car is at position 6 (from Step 3), parkour must be at position 5.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 9
The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. So, soccer must be at either position 3 or 4 since parkour is at position 5.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 7
The British is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person driving the trike. This means the British cannot be at positions 1 or 7 (since there must be a person with soccer on one side and a person driving a trike on the other).

## Step 11: Apply Clue 6
The British is the person driving the scooter.

## Step 12: Combine Information from Steps 10 and 11
Given that the British drives a scooter and must be between someone who likes soccer and someone driving a trike, we can start to piece together the middle section.

## Step 13: Apply Clue 8
The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the Indian. This clue helps with relative positioning but doesn't give us exact positions yet.

## Step 14: Apply Clue 11
The Indian is on the right of the British. Since the British drives a scooter and must be near someone who likes soccer, we can start to see how these pieces fit together.

## Step 15: Apply Clue 13
The Egyptian is on the left of the British. This clue helps us understand that the sequence involves Egyptian, British (with scooter), and then Indian, considering previous clues about their relative positions.

## Step 16: Apply Clue 14
The Egyptian is on the right of the person driving the train. This means the train must be at a position to the left of the Egyptian.

## Step 17: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Considering all clues together:
- The Canadian (bus) is at position 7.
- The car is at position 6, which influences where sailing and parkour can be due to their relative positions.
- Parkour is at position 5 because it's on the left of the bus.
- Sailing must then be at a position that fits with being on the right of parkour but also considering other constraints like the Canadian being on the far right and the car being at position 6.

Given these steps, let's assemble what we can directly infer and fill in the rest based on logical deductions from all clues:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3       |    4     |   5    |     6     |    7     |

Lv2-3x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the van and its driver
From clue 9, we know the person driving the van is on the far right. Clue 14 tells us this person drinks water. So, column 7 is filled with ""van"" for transport and ""water"" for beverage.


## Step 2: Position the roller and its driver
Clue 1 (and clue 11, which repeats this information) states the person driving the roller is the accountant. However, we don't yet know the exact position of the roller.


## Step 3: Place the taxi and its driver
From clue 2, we know the person driving the taxi is the journalist. Clue 6 tells us the taxi is on the right of the helicopter. Clue 13 states the person drinking coffee is on the left of the journalist.


## Step 4: Determine the position of the scooter and its driver
Clue 4 says the person driving the scooter drinks fanta. Clue 8 places the scooter to the left of the photographer.


## Step 5: Place the trike
Clue 5 indicates the trike is between the van and the photographer, but since the van is on the far right (column 7), this means the photographer must be in column 6, and the trike in column 5, because the trike has to be between the van and the photographer.


## Step 6: Position the helicopter
Clue 15 states the helicopter is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Clue 7 says soy-milk is on the left of tea.


## Step 7: Analyze remaining clues for job placement
Clues 3, 10, and 12 provide information about relative positions but require knowing the initial placements to solve.


## Step 8: Integrate all known information
Given the van's position (column 7), we start filling in from the right:
- Column 7: Van, Water, (Job to be determined, but likely Manager given other constraints)
- The photographer is in column 6 because the trike must be between the van and the photographer, placing the trike in column 5.
- The scooter (fanta) is to the left of the photographer, potentially in column 4, depending on other placements.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, we deduce further:
- Helicopter's position affects soy-milk and tea's placement. Given soy-milk is to the left of tea (clue 7) and the helicopter is to the left of soy-milk (clue 15), this trio needs three consecutive spots.
- The taxi (journalist) being on the right of the helicopter (clue 6) helps place these elements.


## Step 10: Construct a solution table
Based on deductions:
1. Coffee is on the left of the journalist (clue 13).
2. Engineer is on the right of the musician (clue 10) and also on the right of milk (clue 12).
3. Manager's position relative to others, especially with snowmobile on their right (clue 3), needs consideration.


Given these steps and considering all clues, let's attempt a final placement:


|             |     1      |     2      |     3      |    4    |      5       |    6     |    7     |
| Beverage    | Coffee    | Soy-milk   | Tea        | Fanta   | Iced-tea     | Milk     | Water    |
| Job         | Musician  | Analyst    | Engineer   | Accountant | Photographer | Manager  | Journalist is incorrect based on previous steps, correct placement needs reevaluation |
| Transport   | Helicopter| Roller     | Taxi       | Scooter | Trike        | Snowmobile| Van      |

Lv2-3x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply it step by step.


From clue 1, we know the Italian is on the far left.
From clue 12, we know the Italian eats banana.

So, we start with:
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |     6      |     7     |

From clue 2, the person eating cranberry watches scientific movies.
From clue 8, the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.
From clue 3, the French watches drama movies.

So, we have:
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |     6      |     7     |

From clue 14, the person watching zombie movies is between the person watching animation movies and the person watching drama movies.
However, since the French (drama) is already on the left and there's no room for another genre to the left of drama without violating other conditions, we deduce that the animation must be to the right of scientific. The order then must be: drama, zombie, scientific, animation.

From clue 11, the Turkish watches animation movies.
However, this clue about animation being after scientific doesn't directly apply since our current understanding places scientific after drama based on other clues. We need to consider all clues together for a coherent picture.


Given clue 7 (the person eating apricot is in the middle) and knowing there are 7 positions, ""middle"" would be position 4.

|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |     6      |     7     |
| Food          | banana |           |          | apricot |            |            | blueberry |
| Movie-Genre   | drama  |           |          |         |            |            | adventure|
| Nationality   | italian|           |          |         |            |            | indian    |

From clue 9, the Mexican watches action movies.
From clue 5 and clue 10, the American eats pumpkin and is to the right of radish.

Since we know the positions of drama (1) and adventure (7), and given other constraints:
- The person watching scientific movies must eat cranberry (clue 2).
- The French watches drama (clue 3), so French must be at position 1 with Italian already there, this means our initial setup might need adjustment based on further clues.

Given the complexity and the interlinking of clues, we should re-evaluate all positions considering each clue's impact:
1. Italian is far left.
2. Scientific watches cranberry.
3. French watches drama.
4. Adventure is far right.
5. American to the right of radish, eating pumpkin.
6. Blueberry is far right (conflicts with adventure being far right unless they're the same person).
7. Apricot in the middle.
8. Drama to the left of scientific.
9. Mexican watches action.
10. American eats pumpkin.
11. Turkish watches animation.
12. Italian eats banana.
13. Indian is far right.
14. Zombie between animation and drama (considering our setup, this means zombie must be after drama since animation can't fit before scientific without contradicting other clues).
15. Strawberry to the right of scientific.

Let's correct and finalize based on all clues:
- The Italian eats banana and is on the far left (1).
- Drama (French) must then be at position 2 because it has to be to the left of scientific, but since Italian is already at position 1, we adjust our understanding: Italian (banana) at 1, and given drama's placement relative to others, we have to consider all nationalities and foods together.

Revisiting with corrected logic:
- Position 1: Italian, banana
- Since French watches drama and must be to the left of scientific but after Italian (because Italian is on the far left), our initial assumption needs a slight adjustment for proper placement of genres and foods according to all clues.


Given the constraints and upon reevaluation:
1. The Italian (banana) is at position 1.
2. Drama (French) must be next, considering it's to the left of scientific but after banana (Italian).
3. Scientific (cranberry) follows drama because drama is to its left.
4. Zombie movies are between animation and drama, implying zombie could fit after scientific if we place animation correctly with other clues.
5. Animation (Turkish) should be placed considering it's after scientific or in a way that respects all given conditions.


Let's properly align based on the constraints:
- Italian is at position 1 (banana).
- The sequence for genres must consider drama to the left of scientific, and zombie between animation and drama, but our constraint of adventure being far right and blueberry also being far right indicates these are likely associated with the Indian.


Given all clues and considering potential misalignments in initial reasoning:
- Italian at 1 (banana).
- French (drama) should be next to maintain drama's left positioning relative to scientific.
- However, we need to ensure all other conditions are met regarding food, genre, and nationality.


Correcting the approach with a focus on satisfying all conditions simultaneously:
1. Italian (banana) - Position 1
2. Considering drama must precede scientific and zombie fits between animation and drama but after considering all placements:


The corrected sequence respecting all constraints would be challenging without directly applying each clue to ensure no rule is violated, indicating a need for careful placement of each nationality, food, and movie genre.


Considering the constraints about positions (left, right, middle) and direct associations (e.g., Italian with banana, French with drama), we must fit each piece into the puzzle while respecting the rules about relative positions (before, after) and specific placements (far left, far right, middle).


To align all clues properly without contradiction:
- Italian (banana) at 1.
- Given constraints, let's finalize the correct sequence considering each clue's impact on possible arrangements.


Finalizing with respect to all given conditions and ensuring no rule is broken:
1. Position 1: Italian (banana)
2. Given drama precedes scientific, zombie between animation and drama, and other constraints:


Considering the need for a step-by-step alignment of clues without assuming initial positions incorrectly:
- Apply each clue methodically.
- Italian at position 1 with banana.
- Then, aligning genres and foods with nationalities according to given conditions.


For accurate placement respecting all rules:
1. Start with fixed points: Italian (banana) at position 1.
2. Drama (French) must precede scientific but follows the initial setup.


Given the complexity of interlinking clues, let's ensure each condition is met in sequence:
- Position 1: Italian, banana
- Next, drama (French), considering its relation to scientific and other genres


To properly place all elements without violating any conditions:
1. Begin with known positions and associations.
2. Fill in the gaps while respecting the relative and specific placements.


Given this approach, let's reassemble the information accurately:


The final answer is: 

Here is a possible arrangement that respects most of the given constraints:

| Position | Nationality | Food      | Genre     |
|----------|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| 1        | Italian     | Banana    | Drama     |
| 2        | French      | Radish    | Scientific|
| 3        | Mexican     | Strawberry| Action    |
| 4        | Turkish     | Apricot   | Animation |
| 5        | American    | Pumpkin   | Zombie    |
| 6        |             | Cranberry |           |
| 7        | Indian      | Blueberry | Adventure |

Please note, this is one possible arrangement. The constraints provided might allow for other arrangements as well, depending on the interpretation of ""to the right"" and ""after"" in some clues. Also, some positions (like position 6) are not fully filled due to the lack of direct information linking all elements together without ambiguity."	{'1': ['italian', 'banana', 'drama'], '2': ['french', 'radish', 'scientific'], '3': ['mexican', 'strawberry', 'action'], '4': ['turkish', 'apricot', 'animation'], '5': ['american', 'pumpkin', 'zombie'], '6': ['', 'cranberry', ''], '7': ['indian', 'blueberry', 'adventure']}	False	0	False
Lv2-3x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Determine the freelancer's position and nationality
From clue 3, we know the freelancer is Chinese. Clue 15 tells us the freelancer is on the left of the Australian, and since the Australian is the journalist (clue 6), we can start placing these individuals in the table.

## Step 2: Place the Australian and their transport
Clue 10 states the person driving the tram is the Australian. So, we have:
- Freelancer (Chinese) on the left of the Australian (Journalist) who drives the tram.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the analyst and the quad-bike
Clue 7 says the analyst is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. We don't know their exact positions yet, but we'll keep this in mind for later.

## Step 4: Place the doctor and the boat
From clue 8, the doctor drives the boat. Clue 11 tells us the doctor is on the right of the firefighter, who drives the scooter (clue 4).

## Step 5: Position the firefighter and the scooter
The firefighter drives the scooter (clue 4) and is on the left of the doctor (clue 11).

## Step 6: Place the person driving the subway and the trike
Clue 5 says the person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the trike. Clue 12 indicates the subway driver is between the doctor and the analyst.

## Step 7: Position the Indian and the airplane
The Indian drives the airplane (clue 14), which is on the right of the tram (clue 9).

## Step 8: Determine the position of the Malaysian and the writer
Clue 1 states the Malaysian is on the left of the writer. We don't have enough information yet to place them exactly.

## Step 9: Place the Colombian
The Colombian is on the right of the doctor (clue 13).

## Step 10: Compile all clues for a final placement
Given all the clues:
- The freelancer (Chinese) is on the left of the Australian (Journalist) who drives the tram.
- The Australian (Journalist) drives the tram and is in position 5 because the freelancer must be to their left, and we have the airplane driver (Indian) to the right of the tram driver.
- The doctor drives the boat and is on the right of the firefighter, who drives the scooter.
- The analyst is on the left of the quad-bike driver.
- The person driving the subway is between the doctor and the analyst.
- The Malaysian is on the left of the writer.

Let's place them in order considering all constraints:
1. Freelancer (Chinese) - We don't know their job yet, but they're on the left of the Australian.
2. Analyst - Must be before the quad-bike driver and after considering the subway's position relative to the doctor and analyst.
3. Firefighter (French) - Drives the scooter and is before the doctor.
4. Doctor - Drives the boat and is after the firefighter.
5. Australian (Journalist) - Drives the tram.
6. Indian - Drives the airplane and must be after the tram.
7. The remaining positions for Malaysian, writer, and Colombian can be filled considering the clues about their relative positions.

Given all constraints:
- Freelancer (Chinese) is likely an analyst or another profession not yet ruled out, but since clue 2 says the freelancer is on the left of the tram driver, and we've established the Australian (Journalist) drives the tram, the freelancer must be in position 1, 2, 3, or 4. However, considering clue 15 and that the analyst must be before the quad-bike driver, if the freelancer were the analyst, it would conflict with other placements based on transport. So, let's consider the freelancer as potentially not the analyst but still needing to fit the Chinese nationality into a job.
- The firefighter (French) drives the scooter and is before the doctor, which means they could be in position 3 if we place the analyst and subway correctly.
- The doctor drives the boat and must follow the firefighter.
- The Australian (Journalist) drives the tram and is in position 5.
- The Indian drives the airplane and is after the tram.

Considering all jobs and transports:
1. Chinese Freelancer - Could potentially be the writer or another job, but we need to fit the Malaysian on the left of the writer. If the freelancer is not the writer, they could be the analyst based on earlier deductions about the freelancer's position relative to the Australian.
2. Analyst - Needs to be before the quad-bike driver and considering the subway's placement between the doctor and analyst, this gets complex. The analyst could potentially drive the subway or be in a position that allows for the subway to fit between them and the doctor based on other job placements.
3. French Firefighter - Drives the scooter.
4. Doctor - Drives the boat.
5. Australian Journalist - Drives the tram.
6. Indian - Drives the airplane.
7. The remaining slots are for the Malaysian, writer, Colombian, and quad-bike driver.

Let's finalize based on job, nationality, and transport:
- Clue 16 says the French drives the scooter, which we've placed as the firefighter.
- The doctor (clue 8) drives the boat, and clue 11 says they're on the right of the firefighter.
- The analyst is before the quad-bike driver (clue 7), and considering the placements, this gets tricky without a direct job assignment to the freelancer or exact positioning of the Malaysian and writer.

Given the complexity and the need for precise placement based on all clues:
1. Chinese Freelancer - If the freelancer is indeed an analyst (which we've questioned due to transport constraints), they'd drive the subway (to fit between the doctor and analyst as per clue 12) or another vehicle that allows for this arrangement.
2. Analyst - Must be before the quad-bike, potentially driving the subway if not the freelancer.
3. Firefighter (French) - Scooter.
4. Doctor - Boat.
5. Australian Journalist - Tram.
6. Indian - Airplane.
7. For the Malaysian on the left of the writer and Colombian on the right of the doctor, we fit these into remaining slots based on job and transport availability.

Finalizing with all clues:
- The freelancer (Chinese) is likely in position 1 or 2 to be on the left of the Australian and fulfill other conditions.
- The analyst must precede the quad-bike driver but also consider the subway's placement.
- Firefighter, doctor, Australian journalist, Indian, and then fitting the remaining nationalities and jobs into the transport slots.

The final answer is:

Lv2-3x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fit the pieces together.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the chef based on clue 7.
The chef is in the middle, which means the chef is in position 4.


## Step 2: Use clue 4 to determine the position of the person drinking iced-tea.
Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the chef, and given the chef's position is 4, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 3 or less. However, we cannot pinpoint the exact position yet.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1 to find the possible positions for the owner of the frog.
The owner of the frog is on the left of the security-guard. This gives us a sequence but does not specify exact positions without more information.


## Step 4: Use clue 2 to establish a relationship between the security-guard and the social-worker.
The security-guard is on the left of the social-worker, adding another piece to our sequence but still lacking specific positions.


## Step 5: Combine clues 1 and 2 with the information from clue 13.
Clue 13 states the owner of the frog is on the right of the chef. Given the chef is in position 4, the owner of the frog must be in position 5 or more. This seems to contradict our initial interpretation of clue 1 unless we consider the frog's owner being at least one position to the left of the security-guard but still after the chef.


## Step 6: Apply clue 5 to identify the librarian and their pet.
The librarian owns a mouse, which is crucial information but doesn't give us an exact position yet.


## Step 7: Use clue 10 to place the owner of the mouse (librarian) relative to the coffee drinker.
Since the owner of the mouse (librarian) is on the right of the person drinking coffee, and from clue 15 we know the person drinking coffee is on the left of the librarian, this confirms a sequence but doesn't specify positions without more context.


## Step 8: Apply clue 9 to determine the drink of the pony's owner.
The owner of the pony drinks coffee. From clue 15, we also know this person is on the left of the librarian.


## Step 9: Use clue 8 to find the position of the water drinker relative to the pony's owner.
The person drinking water is on the right of the pony's owner (coffee drinker). Since the coffee drinker is before the librarian, and given that the chef is in the middle (position 4), we start to get a clearer picture.


## Step 10: Apply clue 6 to place the cat's owner.
The owner of the cat is between the dancer and the social-worker. This clue doesn't specify positions but gives us another relationship.


## Step 11: Consider all clues together for a comprehensive solution.
Given the chef is in position 4, we can start building around this:
- The person drinking coffee (pony's owner) must be before the librarian (from clue 15), and since the chef is in the middle, a likely position for the coffee drinker is 3, making the librarian 5.
- The iced-tea drinker is on the left of the chef (clue 4), so possibly positions 1 or 2.
- The frog's owner is on the right of the chef (clue 13) and on the left of the security-guard (clue 1), suggesting a position after the chef but before the social-worker, who follows the security-guard.
- The owner of the lizard is on the left of the almond-milk drinker (clue 3), which doesn't specify positions without knowing more about the almond-milk drinker's location.


## Step 12: Finalize positions based on all clues.
From clue 15 and others, we deduce:
- Coffee drinker (pony owner) is likely in position 3 because they are before the librarian (clue 15), and the chef is in position 4.
- Librarian (mouse owner) is likely in position 5 because they are after the coffee drinker (from clue 10 and others).
- Given the relationships, let's place individuals:
1. Iced-tea (before the chef, exact spot not determined yet)
2. Possible spot for the dancer or another profession before the chef.
3. Coffee (pony owner, before the librarian)
4. Chef
5. Librarian (mouse owner)
6. Possible spot for the frog's owner (after the chef, before the security-guard/social-worker sequence)
7. Remaining spots for other professions and pets.


## Step 13: Solve for each column using all given clues.
Given the complexity and interrelation of clues, let's directly infer from key clues:
- Clue 14 indicates the 7up drinker is after the lemonade drinker.
- Clue 11 states the analyst owns the hedgehog but doesn't specify their position.

Lv2-3x7-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person eating strawberry is on the far right. This means the food for column 7 is strawberry.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person driving the roller is in the middle. Since there are 7 columns, the middle would be column 4. So, the transport for column 4 is roller.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person eating nectarine. We don't know where nectarine or woodworking are yet, so we'll come back to this.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person eating radish is between the person eating cherry and the person eating grapes. This gives us a sequence but not specific locations yet.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person whose hobby is camping is on the right of the person driving the train. We know from clue 7 that the person eating cherry drives the train, but we don't know where cherry or camping are yet.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The person eating nectarine is the person whose hobby is writing. This connects a food with a hobby but doesn't give us a location.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
The person eating cherry is the person driving the train. From clue 11, we know the bus is to the left of the train, and since the roller is in the middle (column 4), the train must be to the right of the roller, placing it at least in column 5 or further.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 8
The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking. This gives us a sequence for hobbies but not specific locations.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 9
The person eating zucchini is on the left of the person driving the car. We don't know where zucchini or the car are yet.

## Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
The person driving the roller is on the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking. Since the roller is in column 4, woodworking must be to its left, in column 3.

## Step 11: Analyze Clue 11
The person driving the bus is on the left of the person driving the train. Given that the roller is in column 4 and the train must be after it (because the roller is in the middle), the earliest the train can be is column 5, making the latest the bus can be column 3 or before.

## Step 12: Analyze Clue 12
The person whose hobby is camping is in the middle. Given there are 7 columns, ""in the middle"" places camping in column 4, but since the roller is also in the middle (column 4), this must mean camping and roller share column 4.

## Step 13: Analyze Clue 13
The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the taxi. This gives us a sequence for transports but not specific locations.

## Step 14: Analyze Clue 14
The person driving the skateboard is the person whose hobby is hiking. Now we know that hiking and skateboard go together, but we don't have their location yet.

## Step 15: Analyze Clue 15
The person eating radish is on the left of the person whose hobby is hiking. Since radish is between cherry and grapes (clue 4), and knowing the skateboard (hiking) must be after radish, we start to get a clearer picture.

Given all these clues, let's piece together what we can:

- Strawberry is in column 7.
- Roller is in column 4, with camping as its hobby.
- Woodworking is in column 3 because it's before the roller (clue 10).
- Nectarine is writing (clue 6), and since woodworking is to the left of nectarine (clue 3), nectarine must be after column 3, possibly column 5 or later.
- Cherry is with the train (clue 7) and must be before grapes because radish is between them (clue 4).
- The bus is before the train (clue 11), placing it in columns 1, 2, or 3 since the roller (and thus the middle) starts at column 4.
- Zucchini is before the car (clue 9), and skateboard is before taxi (clue 13), with skateboard also being hiking (clue 14).
- Radish is before hiking (skateboard) (clue 15).

Let's try to fit these pieces into a coherent table:

1. Bus must be in column 1 because it needs to be on the left of the train, and we have other transports that need placement.
2. Cherry with the train can't be in column 1 (bus), so let's place cherry/train in column 5 for now, considering the roller is in column 4.
3. Radish is between cherry and grapes, so radish must be in column 6 if we're placing cherry in column 5, assuming grapes will follow after radish.
4. Given that nectarine (writing) needs to be after woodworking (column 3), and considering the placements of cherry/train and roller/camping, let's place nectarine/writing in column 6 or later. However, since radish is in column 6, nectarine could fit into column 2, allowing for a sequence that respects all given conditions.
5. With strawberry in column 7, kiwi and zucchini need placement. Given zucchini is before the car (clue 9), and considering other placements, let's try to fit these foods around our existing placements.

Given the complexity and interconnectivity of these clues, we'll have to make some educated guesses while ensuring all conditions are met. Here's a possible arrangement:

|             |       1       |     2     |      3      |    4    |     5      |     6     |     7      |
| Food        | zucchini     | nectarine |   kiwi      | radish  |  cherry    | grapes    | strawberry |
| Hobby       | gardening    | writing   | woodworking | hiking  | camping    | filmmaking|            |
| Transport   | bus          | tram      | skateboard  | roller  | train      | taxi      | car        |

This arrangement seems to fit all the given clues, but note that without a systematic way to apply each clue in sequence while avoiding conflicts, there's always a chance for error. The key was connecting the foods with hobbies and transports through the clues and making sure each condition (like sequences and positions) was respected.

Lv2-3x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8
The person eating papaya is the chef. This means column 3 (where ""pine"" was mentioned, implying pineapple) cannot be the chef since the person eating pineapple has a different hobby (drawing), and according to clue 2, this person eats pineapple. So, we have:
- Column 4: Papaya, Chef


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in the middle. Since there are 7 columns, the middle one would be column 4. However, clue 8 already assigns papaya and chef to column 4. This might seem conflicting, but it actually helps us place other hobbies and foods around this central point.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The person eating pineapple is the person whose hobby is drawing. Given that pineapple was hinted at in column 3, we can now confidently say:
- Column 3: Pineapple, Drawing


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The person eating eggplant is on the left of the person eating papaya. Since papaya is in column 4, eggplant must be in column 3 or to its left. However, pineapple (and thus drawing) is already assigned to column 3 based on clue 2 and our deductions. So, eggplant must be to the left of column 3.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 10
The person whose hobby is collecting is the person eating eggplant. From step 4, we know eggplant is to the left of column 3, so:
- Column 2: Eggplant, Collecting (as a temporary placement since it could be further left)


## Step 6: Apply Clue 13
The firefighter is on the left of the person whose hobby is collecting. This means the firefighter must be to the left of eggplant, which we've tentatively placed in column 2.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 5
The doctor is on the left of the chef. Since the chef is in column 4, the doctor could be in columns 1, 2, or 3. However, given other placements and clues, especially with eggplant (and collecting) needing to be to the left of papaya (column 4), we have to fit these pieces around our existing information.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 9
The teacher is on the right of the writer. Also, the teacher is between the person eating pineapple and the person eating peas. Given that pineapple is in column 3, this places the teacher in column 4 or 5, but since papaya (and the chef) occupy column 4, the teacher must be in a position that accommodates both being after the writer and between pineapple and peas.


## Step 9: Finalize Positions
Given all clues, we start finalizing positions:
- The firefighter is on the leftmost side because they need to be to the left of collecting (eggplant), which needs to be to the left of papaya.
- Collecting (eggplant) follows, but given the constraints about hobbies and foods, we adjust placements considering all clues.


## Step 10: Apply Remaining Clues
Considering filmmaking is in the middle (but taking into account our central figure around column 4 with papaya/chef), and all other clues about hobbies and jobs being to the left or right of certain figures, we finalize the table:


Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction without directly jumping to conclusions:
- Firefighter must be on the far left (column 1) because they are to the left of collecting.
- Doctor is to the left of chef, which places doctor before column 4.
- Teacher is between pineapple (column 3) and peas, suggesting a placement after column 3 but also considering the writer's placement.


The final answer is:

Lv2-3x7-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person drinking sprite.
From clue 1, we know the person drinking sprite is in the middle, which means they are at position 4.

## Step 2: Place the romance and drama movie watchers.
Clue 2 indicates the romance movie watcher is to the left of the drama movie watcher. Clue 3 states the romance movie watcher is in the middle, but since the middle (position 4) is taken by the sprite drinker, this clue must be interpreted with other clues for accurate placement.

## Step 3: Correct interpretation of clue 3 and initial placement.
Given the potential conflict, let's consider clue 7, which states the romance movie watcher is to the right of the soy-milk drinker. This means the romance movie watcher cannot be at position 1 (since there would be no one to their left). Clue 3 might have been misinterpreted in step 2 due to the complexity of the puzzle. The correct approach involves considering all related clues together.

## Step 4: Place the firefighter and the juice drinker.
From clue 4, we know the firefighter drinks juice. Clues 14 and 16 provide more information about the analyst's position relative to the firefighter and coffee drinker, which will help in further placements.

## Step 5: Determine the positions based on job and movie genre clues.
Clue 9 states the coach watches satire movies. Clue 12 indicates the analyst watches documentary movies and drinks fanta (from clue 6). The architect is in the middle (clue 13), which could potentially conflict with the sprite drinker's position unless they are the same person.

## Step 6: Reconcile potential conflicts and make initial placements.
Given the architect is in the middle (position 4) and so is the sprite drinker, it's reasonable to assume the architect drinks sprite. Clue 7 indicates the romance movie watcher is to the right of the soy-milk drinker, suggesting a possible order but requiring further clues for exact placement.

## Step 7: Use clues to place the remaining individuals.
Clue 8 (tea drinker to the left of 7up drinker) and clue 10 (analyst to the right of scientist) provide more positional information. Clue 11 places the engineer to the right of the doctor, further helping with job placements.

## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction that adheres strictly to the format while solving the puzzle directly in this response is challenging without visual aids or iterative steps that can be easily represented in a table format. However, we can deduce key points:
- The architect drinks sprite and is in the middle (position 4).
- The firefighter drinks juice.
- The analyst drinks fanta and watches documentaries.
- The coach watches satire movies.

Lv2-3x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fill in the information step by step.


From clue 4, the owner of the pony is on the far left.
From clue 13, the owner of the pony's sport is surfing.

|         |     1      |      2       |      3      |   4    |     5      |    6    |        7        |

From clue 15, the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the owner of the pony.
So, column 2's sport is tennis.

|         |     1      |      2       |      3      |   4    |     5      |    6    |        7        |

| Pet     | pony       |              |             |        |            |         |                 |

From clue 12, the photographer is on the left of the owner of the frog.
The photographer can't be in column 1 because the pony's owner is there, and it can't be further to the right without leaving space for the frog's owner. So, the photographer must be in either column 2 or 3.

However, from clue 14, the chef is on the left of the owner of the bird, and from clue 9, the guinea-pig's owner is on the left of the chef. This means we have a sequence for pets: guinea-pig, chef, bird. Given that the pony is already at the start and considering other clues about positions relative to each other (like the ferret, lizard, and others), it seems likely that column 3 would be the first possible position for the photographer if we consider all other constraints.

But, from clue 2, the owner of the lizard is between the electrician and the guinea-pig's owner. This means our initial guess about the photographer might need adjustment based on further clues.


Considering clue 16, the writer is on the right of the owner of the frog. Since we have a lot of information but not a clear path forward without making some educated guesses or combining clues in a more sophisticated way, let's try to piece together what we know about jobs and pets first.


From clue 1, the project-manager is on the right of the ferret's owner.
From clue 8, the bird's owner is on the right of the ferret's owner. So, we have a sequence for some pets: ferret, bird.


Given clue 3 (golf is on the left of the writer), clue 5 (golf is on the left of the lizard), and knowing that the lizard is between the electrician and the guinea-pig (clue 2), we can infer a bit more about the order but need to connect it with jobs and sports.


Let's address some easier connections first. From clue 6, the dressmaker is on the right of the writer, and from clue 7, the dressmaker is between cricket and the lizard. This gives us a sequence involving sports: golf (from clue 5), lizard (with its job being between electrician and guinea-pig owner), and knowing that the dressmaker must be after the writer but before or after certain pets.


Now, let's think about how to place these clues into the grid more effectively.


Given all these constraints, it seems best to directly place what we can with certainty and then fill in the gaps based on the process of elimination.


- The pony is at position 1 with surfing as its sport.
- Tennis must be at position 2 (because it's to the right of surfing).
- We have sequences like ferret-bird for pets, guinea-pig-chef-bird for another part of the pet sequence, and sports sequences like golf-lizard and others that need fitting.


Let's consider the project-manager being on the right of the ferret (clue 1) and combine this with other clues to place jobs and pets more accurately.


Without loss of generality and considering all given constraints, we must fit these pieces together while respecting all clue conditions. The puzzle requires a systematic approach that considers each clue's implications on possible arrangements.


However, without a direct method to solve it step-by-step in text without guessing or combining clues in a complex manner, the final solution would typically involve creating a grid and systematically filling in information based on the given clues until all positions are filled correctly.


Given the complexity and the instructions provided, I'll outline a potential approach but note that solving such puzzles often involves trial and error along with deduction:


1. Start by placing the pony (with surfing) at position 1.
2. Place tennis at position 2.
3. Use clues to deduce sequences and possible positions for other jobs, pets, and sports.


Given the format required for the answer and the complexity of directly solving this puzzle in a single response without iterative steps or guessing, let's acknowledge that typically, one would use a process of elimination and deduction based on all provided clues to fill out the table accurately.
