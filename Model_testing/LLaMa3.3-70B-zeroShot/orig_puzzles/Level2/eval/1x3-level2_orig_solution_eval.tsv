Lv2-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to consider both statements given:


1. The Thai is on the left of the Japanese.
2. The Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese.


Given these conditions, let's analyze the possible arrangements:


- From statement 1, we know the order must be Thai-Japanese or have them in this sequence with the Indian placed elsewhere.
- Statement 2 indicates that the Thai cannot be at either end because they are between the Indian and the Japanese.


Considering both statements together, there is only one arrangement that satisfies both conditions:


The correct arrangement from left to right is: Indian - Thai - Japanese.


Therefore, the solution table should look like this:


#############
|               |   1    |  2   |    3     |
| Nationality   | Indian | Thai | Japanese |

Lv2-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing the first clue
The first clue states that the person watching disaster movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching sports movies. This means the order could be either Horror-Disaster-Sports or Sports-Disaster-Horror.

## Step 2: Analyzing the second clue
The second clue tells us that the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. This helps to narrow down the possible orders from the first clue, indicating that the correct order must be Sports-Disaster-Horror because Horror has to be to the right of Disaster.

## Step 3: Constructing the solution table
Given the clues, we can construct the table as follows:

|               |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Disaster | Horror |

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |   1    |    2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Disaster | Horror |

Lv2-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal.
2. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.

From statement 2, we know the order for two of the genres: Folk and then Ambient (since Folk is to the left of Ambient). 

Statement 1 tells us that Folk is between Ambient and Metal. However, given statement 2's information, it means Folk cannot be between Metal and Ambient in a way that would put Ambient on the left of Folk. Instead, it indicates that Folk must be between Metal and Ambient if we consider their positions in a sequence where Folk comes before Ambient.

Given there are three positions (1, 2, 3), and knowing from statement 2 that Folk is to the left of Ambient:

- If Folk were in position 1, Ambient would have to be in position 2 to satisfy being to the right of Folk. This leaves position 3 for Metal.
- Statement 1 then makes sense because Folk (in position 1) is indeed between Metal and Ambient if we consider their placement in a linear sequence where positions are considered in a circular or wrap-around manner, but given the direct statements, it's simpler to interpret this as needing Folk to be directly next to both Metal and Ambient without necessarily implying a circular arrangement.

However, considering the direct interpretation of statement 1 (Folk between Ambient and Metal) alongside statement 2 (Folk to the left of Ambient), we can deduce:

- The sequence that fits is: Metal, Folk, Ambient. This satisfies both conditions because Folk is directly between Metal and Ambient in this order, and it's also to the left of Ambient.

So, filling out the table based on our deductions:


#############
|               |   1   |  2   |    3    |
| Music-Genre   | Metal | Folk | Ambient |
#############"	{'music-genre': ['metal', 'folk', 'ambient']}	True	3	True
Lv2-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


1. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
2. The owner of the snake is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the ferret.

From clue 1, we know the order for the snake and guinea-pig owners must be: Snake, Guinea-Pig.


For clue 2 to be true (the owner of the snake being between the owner of the guinea-pig and the ferret), given that the snake is already to the left of the guinea-pig from clue 1, the ferret must then be to the left of the snake. This order satisfies both conditions because it places the snake between the ferret (on the left) and the guinea-pig (on the right).


Therefore, the correct order is: Ferret, Snake, Guinea-Pig.


Here is the solution table:


#############
|       |   1    |   2   |     3      |
| Pet   | Ferret | Snake | Guinea-Pig |

Lv2-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:

1. The person drinking cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking milk is on the far right.

Given that there are only three positions (1, 2, 3) and the person drinking milk is on the far right, we can start by placing milk in position 3:

|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   |       |      | Milk |

Now, since the person drinking cola must be between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice, and considering milk is already placed at position 3, cola cannot be at position 3. Also, because cola needs to be between milk and juice, and milk is at position 3, cola must be at position 2 to satisfy the condition of being ""between"" milk and juice (since it has to separate them). Thus:

|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   |       | Cola | Milk |

The only spot left for juice, given that cola is in position 2 and milk is in position 3, is position 1:

|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   | Juice | Cola | Milk |

Therefore, the solution table surrounded by '###########' is:


###########
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   | Juice | Cola | Milk |

Lv2-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down the information given:

1. The person drinking Mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking almond-milk.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking Mirinda.

From statement 2, we know that almond-milk must be to the right of Mirinda. 

Given statement 1, since Mirinda is between juice and almond-milk, and knowing almond-milk is to the right of Mirinda (from statement 2), the order from left to right must be: juice, Mirinda, almond-milk.

Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|            |   1   |    2    |      3      |

Lv2-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Understand the Clues
We have two main clues:
1. The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.
2. The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.

## Step 2: Apply the Second Clue
Given that the cat's owner is to the right of the hedgehog's owner, we can start by placing the hedgehog in position 1 and the cat in position 2 or 3, since the cat must be after (to the right of) the hedgehog.

## Step 3: Apply the First Clue
The first clue states that the cat is between the hedgehog and the frog. Since we've determined the hedgehog can only be in position 1 for the cat to be on its right, this means the cat must be in position 2 (because it has to be between the hedgehog and the frog). The frog then must be in position 3.

The final arrangement based on these steps is:
- Position 1: Hedgehog
- Position 2: Cat
- Position 3: Frog

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|       |    1     |  2  |  3   |
| Pet   | Hedgehog | Cat | Frog |

Lv2-1x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given:


1. The person whose hobby is drawing is on the left of the person whose hobby is gardening.
2. The person whose hobby is gardening is between the person whose hobby is reading and the person whose hobby is drawing.


From clue 1, we know the order for two of the hobbies is: Drawing, Gardening.


Clue 2 tells us that Gardening is between Reading and Drawing. Since from clue 1 we already have Drawing on the left and Gardening on the right, this means Reading must be on the far right because Gardening has to be between Reading and Drawing, and we've established Drawing is to the left of Gardening.


So, the order from left to right based on the clues is: Drawing, Gardening, Reading.


Here's how it looks in the table format:


#############
|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |

Lv2-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of techno is between the fan of country and the fan of rock.
2. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of rock.

Given these conditions, we can start by placing the techno fan, as both clues involve this genre. 

From clue 2, since the techno fan must be to the left of the rock fan, and considering the layout:

|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |      |

The techno fan cannot be in position 3 because there would be no space to the right for the rock fan. 

Clue 1 states that the techno fan is between the country and rock fans, which means the possible arrangement considering both clues could look something like this:

- Techno must be in either position 1 or 2 because it has to be between country and rock (clue 1) and to the left of rock (clue 2).

If techno were in position 1, then according to clue 1, country would have to be in position 3, which contradicts clue 2 since rock needs to be after techno. 

So, techno must be in position 2 to satisfy both conditions:

- Country can be in position 1 (to the left of techno).
- Techno in position 2.
- Rock in position 3.

Therefore, the arrangement that satisfies all given conditions is:

#############
|               |    1    |   2    |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | Country | Techno | Rock |

Lv2-1x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding Clue 1
The first clue states that the owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the ferret. This means the rabbit cannot be in position 1 or 3 because there would not be enough space for both the bird and the ferret to be on either side of it.


## Step 2: Understanding Clue 2
The second clue tells us that the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since we've established from the first clue that the rabbit must be in position 2 (because it has to be between the other two pets), this means the bird cannot be in position 1 or 2, leaving only position 3 for the bird.


## Step 3: Determining Positions
Given that the rabbit is in position 2 and the bird is in position 3 (from clue 2), we know the ferret must be in position 1 because it's the only spot left. This arrangement satisfies both clues: the rabbit is between the ferret and the bird, and the bird is to the right of the rabbit.
