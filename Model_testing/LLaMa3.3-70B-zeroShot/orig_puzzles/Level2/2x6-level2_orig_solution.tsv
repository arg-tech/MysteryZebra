Lv2-2x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the American and the Pilot
From clue 6, we know the American is the pilot. Clue 1 tells us the pilot is on the left of the nurse. Therefore, the sequence so far is: Pilot (American), ?, Nurse.


## Step 2: Position the Security-Guard
Clue 7 states the security-guard is on the left of the American. Since the American is already identified as the pilot and in position 1 or 2 (because the pilot must be to the left of the nurse), this means the security-guard cannot be directly to the left of the American if the American is in position 1. However, considering all positions, it's clear there was an initial misunderstanding: given the pilot (American) has to be on the left of the nurse and there's a need for the security-guard to be on the left of the American, we have to reconcile this with other clues for exact positioning.


## Step 3: Correct Understanding of Clue Positions
Re-evaluating, if the American (pilot) is in position 1 or 2, and considering clue 7 (security-guard on the left of the American), it suggests a potential misinterpretation since the security-guard being to the left of the American would place the American not in the first position but potentially in the second if we consider the pilot must be to the left of the nurse. However, clue 1 and clue 7 together actually suggest the pilot (American) could indeed start the sequence because there's no one to the left of the first position.


## Step 4: Place the Nurse
Given the pilot is in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of the nurse and considering the security-guard's placement), the nurse would logically follow, potentially in position 2 or later. However, with the pilot in position 1, we can start building the sequence.


## Step 5: Position the Social-Worker and Argentine
Clue 2 states the Argentine is on the left of the social-worker. Clue 9 says the security-guard is on the right of the social-worker. This implies a sequence where the social-worker must be before the security-guard, but since we have the pilot (American) in position 1, and considering other clues for fitting everyone, we need to integrate these pieces carefully.


## Step 6: Integrate Remaining Clues
Clue 4 states the Russian is between the social-worker and the American. Given the complexity and potential for misinterpretation, let's clarify: if the American (pilot) is in position 1, and considering the constraints around the Russian, social-worker, and Argentine, we must fit these nationalities and jobs while respecting all given conditions.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions Based on Clues
- The analyst is to the left of the firefighter (clue 3).
- The Spanish is to the left of the firefighter (clue 8), which can help in final positioning.
- Considering clue 5, the Mexican is between the Russian and the Argentine, further helping to finalize positions.


## Step 8: Compile Information
Given all clues:
1. Pilot (American) must be on the left of the nurse.
2. Security-guard to the left of the American doesn't fit if the American starts; thus, a correction in understanding is needed for initial placements based on subsequent clues.
3. The sequence must respect all given conditions.

Lv2-2x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the Argentine
The Argentine is on the far right (Clue 5), so the Argentine's position is fixed at column 6.


## Step 2: Place the Italian and the owner of the Horse
Given that the owner of the horse is between the Italian and the Argentine (Clue 3) and knowing the Argentine is in column 6, we can deduce the Italian must be to the left of the horse's owner. However, without more information about the exact positions of other nationalities or pets, we proceed with the understanding that the horse's owner cannot be in column 1 (since there needs to be space for the Italian to the left) and likely occupies either column 4 or 5.


## Step 3: Position the Dutch and Turkish
The Dutch is on the left of the Turkish (Clue 8), which means they can occupy any two consecutive positions from left to right, but we don't have enough information yet to place them exactly.


## Step 4: Consider the Lizard's Owner and the Thai
The owner of the lizard is on the left of the Thai (Clue 2). This clue doesn't give us exact positions but tells us about a relative positioning that will help as we gather more information.


## Step 5: Position the Horse's Owner Relative to the Guinea-Pig's Owner
The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (Clue 1). Since the Argentine is in column 6 and considering clue 3, if the horse's owner were in column 5, there wouldn't be room for the Italian to the left. Thus, we start to see a possible arrangement where the horse could be in column 4 or earlier.


## Step 6: Place the German Relative to the Goat
The German is on the right of the owner of the goat (Clue 4). This indicates that the goat cannot be in the last two positions since there needs to be space for the German after the goat's owner.


## Step 7: Positioning Based on Clues About Pets and Nationalities
Given clue 6 (the owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the snake) and clue 7 (the Italian is on the right of the owner of the frog), we start to piece together the order, keeping in mind the restrictions placed by previous steps.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
With all clues considered, let's finalize positions:
- The Argentine is in column 6.
- The Dutch must be before the Turkish.
- The German after the goat.
- The Italian and horse owner positioning requires them to be together with space for other nationalities around them.


Given these constraints and working through possible arrangements while adhering strictly to each clue, we arrive at a solution that fits all given conditions:


|               |   1   |    2    |  3   |    4    |   5    |     6      |
| Nationality   | Dutch | Turkish | Thai | Italian | German | Argentine |
| Pet           | Frog  | Snake   | Lizard| Horse   | Goat   | Guinea-Pig|

Lv2-2x6-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 7 and clue 9 to determine the far left position.
Given that the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left (clue 7) and the owner of the chinchilla is also on the far left (clue 9), we can conclude the jet-ski driver owns the chinchilla.


## Step 2: Apply clue 1 to place the bird's owner relative to the helicopter.
The owner of the bird is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter cannot be in position 1 (because the jet-ski is there), this gives us a sequence but does not yet fix positions.


## Step 3: Apply clue 5 to place the frog's owner.
The owner of the frog is on the far right, which means position 6 is the frog.


## Step 4: Apply clue 2 to place the guinea-pig's owner.
The owner of the guinea-pig drives the tram. This doesn't give us a direct position yet but links the pet with a mode of transport.


## Step 5: Apply clue 3 to establish the helicopter and taxi sequence.
The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person driving the taxi, further establishing our sequence but not fixing positions without other clues.


## Step 6: Apply clue 4 to place the rabbit's owner relative to the helicopter.
The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. This, combined with clue 3, gives us a partial sequence: helicopter, taxi, and rabbit in that order from left to right, but we still need more information to fix their exact positions.


## Step 7: Apply clue 6 to finalize the rabbit's position relative to the guinea-pig and helicopter.
The owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person driving the helicopter. Given that the helicopter must be to the left of the taxi (from clue 3), and considering other clues, we can start building a more concrete sequence.


## Step 8: Apply clue 8 to place the quad-bike.
The person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the tram driver (guinea-pig's owner) has been established but not directly placed, we know the quad-bike must be after the tram.


## Step 9: Combine all clues to determine the final sequence.
- The jet-ski and chinchilla are at position 1 (far left).
- The helicopter must be after the jet-ski (because of clue 1) but before the taxi (clue 3), and also before the rabbit (clue 4). Given the bird's owner is to the left of the helicopter, we need to fit these elements together.
- The guinea-pig's owner drives the tram and must be placed such that the rabbit can fit between them and the helicopter (clue 6).
- The quad-bike follows the guinea-pig (clue 8), which helps in placing the remaining pets and transports.


Given all these clues, let's construct the solution table:


|             |     1      |  2   |     3      |   4    |     5      |     6     |
| Pet         | Chinchilla| Bird|  Rabbit    | Guinea-pig| Snake      | Frog      |
| Transport   | Jet-ski   | Helicopter| Taxi       | Tram    | Quad-bike | Van       |

Lv2-2x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each clue step by step to deduce the arrangement of foods and transports.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8
Given that the person driving the roller is on the far right (clue 8) and from clue 1, we know this person eats kale. So, the last column (6) is already determined for both transport and food: roller and kale.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The person eating broccoli drives a bike (clue 5). We don't know the position yet, but we have a pair: bike and broccoli.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The trike is to the right of the bike (clue 2), which means the bike cannot be in the last two positions. Since the roller (and thus kale) is in position 6, and considering clue 2, we have a sequence but not exact positions yet: bike, trike, roller.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The scooter is paired with corn (clue 4). We know from clue 7 that corn (and thus the scooter) must be to the left of pomegranate, but we don't have an exact position yet.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 6
The quad-bike is between the bike and pomegranate (clue 6). Since broccoli is paired with the bike, this clue helps us understand that the sequence must accommodate the bike (broccoli), then the quad-bike, and after that, considering other clues, we'll find where pomegranate fits.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 3
The taxi is to the left of grapefruit (clue 3). This clue helps us understand that grapefruit cannot be in position 1 since there needs to be a taxi to its left.

## Step 7: Combine Information
From clue 7, corn (scooter) must be to the left of pomegranate. Since the roller (kale) is at the end, and we have sequences like bike-trike and knowing the scooter (corn) precedes pomegranate, let's try to place everything.

## Step 8: Final Placement
1. We know the roller (kale) is in position 6.
2. The trike must be to the right of the bike but before the roller, so it could potentially be in position 5 if we consider all other placements.
3. Since corn (scooter) must precede pomegranate and considering the placement of the bike, quad-bike, and the constraint that the taxi is to the left of grapefruit, let's place the scooter (corn) early on but after the bike because the bike needs to be followed by the quad-bike which in turn needs to be before pomegranate.
4. The sequence starts to form: bike (broccoli), quad-bike (?), then considering the taxi must precede grapefruit and the scooter (corn) precedes pomegranate, we fit these around our known sequences.

Given all clues:
- Bike is with broccoli.
- Quad-bike is between bike and pomegranate.
- Scooter is with corn, which is before pomegranate.
- Roller is with kale at the end.
- Trike is after bike but before roller.
- Taxi is before grapefruit.

Let's try to fit it all together logically:


Given that the person eating broccoli drives a bike (clue 5), and from clue 6, the quad-bike is between the bike and pomegranate, we start with: bike (broccoli).

The scooter (corn) must be before pomegranate (clue 7), so if we place the scooter early on but after considering the sequence that involves the bike and quad-bike, we might get a clearer picture.

Since the taxi is to the left of grapefruit (clue 3) and knowing the other sequences, let's finalize:


If the roller (kale) is at position 6, and we consider all other clues for positioning, a likely order could be formed by carefully placing each pair according to the given conditions.


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |    1    |      2      |     3      |    4     |   5    |   6    |
| Food        | broccoli| grapefruit |  pomegranate|  corn   |  kale  |  kale  |
| Transport   | bike    | taxi       |  quad-bike  | scooter | trike  | roller |

Lv2-2x6-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each clue step by step and update the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
This means the order for these two genres is fixed as Disaster - Satire.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person watching family movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
This clue doesn't give us a direct movie genre order but tells us about the relative positions of Family movies and Cycling sport.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
This gives another sport order as Golf - Biathlon.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person watching drama movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching sports movies.
Given that Sports movies are on the far right (Clue 8), we can start forming a sequence: ... - Family - Drama - Sports.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
This connects a movie genre with a sport, suggesting Satire - Cycling in terms of left to right order.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 6
The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
So, we have Soccer - Golf for sports.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 7
The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person watching western movies.
This clue tells us about Badminton's position relative to Western movies but doesn't directly connect to other genres or sports yet.

## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 8 and Finalizing Positions
Given that Sports movies are on the far right, let's try to piece together all clues.


From Clue 1: Disaster - Satire
From Clue 5: This sequence must be followed by Cycling.
From Clue 2: Family is after Cycling.
From Clue 4: Then comes Drama, and since Sports is last (Clue 8), we have a possible movie order but need to fill in the sports.


Given Soccer - Golf (Clue 6) and Golf - Biathlon (Clue 3), we get Soccer - Golf - Biathlon for sports.
Badminton must be before Western (Clue 7), and since Western can't be last (Sports is last), it fits into our remaining slots.


Now, combining all clues:
- Movie order has to fit Disaster - Satire - Cycling - Family - Drama - Sports, with Sports being on the far right.
- Sport order has Soccer - Golf - Biathlon, with Badminton before Western.


Let's place them in the table, keeping in mind that some positions are fixed relative to others:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |   4    |   5   |    6     |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |         |        |       |          |
| Sport         |            |           |         |        |       |          |

From Clue 7, Badminton is before Western. Given the constraints, a possible arrangement could be:


Badminton - Disaster (since it's before Satire and doesn't conflict with other clues)
Then comes Soccer (to maintain Soccer - Golf order),
Followed by Satire (as per Disaster - Satire),
Then Golf,
Next would logically be Cycling (after Satire, as per Clue 5),
Followed by Biathlon (maintaining Golf - Biathlon),
Then Family (after Cycling, as per Clue 2),
Drama (between Family and Sports, as per Clue 4),
And finally Sports on the far right.


Given this logical sequence and filling in the gaps:


The person watching Western can only fit into the slot that's left without conflicting other clues, which seems to be where Badminton is placed initially based on its relation to Western. However, since Disaster - Satire must come before Cycling (due to Clue 5), and considering all sports and their positions relative to each other and the movie genres:


Let's correct and finalize the arrangement considering all given clues and the logical deductions made.


Given the constraints:
- Badminton is on the left of Western.
- Soccer - Golf - Biathlon for sports.
- Disaster - Satire for movies, followed by Cycling (from Clue 5).
- Family after Cycling (Clue 2), then Drama, then Sports.


A correct and detailed step-by-step filling of the table based on these clues would require a precise placement of each genre and sport in order, which has been logically deduced but not visually arranged here due to the complexity of integrating all clues simultaneously into the table format provided.


However, considering all clues:
- The sports sequence is Soccer - Golf - Biathlon (with Badminton before Western).
- Movie genres have Disaster before Satire, then Cycling, Family, Drama, and Sports last.


A possible arrangement could be:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |   4    |   5   |    6     |
| Movie-Genre   | Western  | Disaster | Satire | Family | Drama | Sports |
| Sport         | Badminton| Soccer   | Golf    | Cycling| Biathlon| Ice-hockey|


This arrangement satisfies the conditions:
- Badminton is before Western (Clue 7).
- Soccer - Golf - Biathlon for sports.
- Disaster - Satire, then Cycling (from Clue 5), Family after Cycling (Clue 2), Drama between Family and Sports (Clue 4).


Given the constraints and logical deductions:


The final answer is:

Lv2-2x6-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 4, we know the person whose hobby is woodworking is on the far right, and from clue 2, this person eats grapefruit. So, the last column (6) for Food is grapefruit and for Hobby is woodworking.


|         |      1      |     2      |    3    |      4      |     5     |      6      |

From clue 1, the person whose hobby is board-games is to the left of the person whose hobby is traveling. Clue 5 tells us the person eating grapefruit (woodworking) is to the right of the person whose hobby is traveling. So, the order for hobbies must be: board-games, traveling, and then woodworking.


Clue 3 states the person whose hobby is board-games is to the right of the person eating pepper. This means pepper cannot be in column 6 (since grapefruit is there), so it has to be in one of the columns to the left of board-games.


Given clue 8, the person eating nectarine is between the person eating orange and the person whose hobby is woodworking. Since woodworking is in column 6, this means orange must be to the left of nectarine, which is to the left of grapefruit (in column 6).


Clue 9 tells us the person eating cauliflower is the person whose hobby is card-games.


Clue 7 says the person whose hobby is dancing eats strawberry. Clue 6 states the person eating strawberry is to the right of the person whose hobby is card-games.


Now, let's piece together what we know:


- Woodworking is in column 6 with grapefruit.
- Board-games must be to the left of traveling (clue 1), and since woodworking is on the far right, board-games cannot be in column 5 or 6. Given that pepper is to the left of board-games (clue 3) and considering the positions of orange, nectarine, and grapefruit from clue 8, we start seeing a pattern.
- Orange must come before nectarine, which comes before grapefruit, with woodworking in column 6.


Considering all clues:


1. Pepper has to be on the far left because board-games is to its right (clue 3), and given that board-games is also to the left of traveling (clue 1), and there needs to be space for orange and nectarine before grapefruit (clue 8).


2. The order for hobbies from clues 1, 5, and the positions deduced so far must fit with the food in a way that satisfies all conditions.


3. Since cauliflower is eaten by the person whose hobby is card-games (clue 9), and strawberry is eaten by the person whose hobby is dancing (clue 7) and to the right of card-games (clue 6), we have more pieces to place.


Let's try placing based on these rules:


- Column 1: Pepper (because it has to be to the left of board-games, clue 3)
- Column 2: This needs to be a hobby that fits with being to the right of pepper and can precede traveling without conflicting with other clues. Board-games can't be here if we consider the need for orange and nectarine to fit before grapefruit (woodworking) in columns that also allow for card-games, dancing, and reading to be placed without violating any rules.
- Column 3: Needs to have a food that allows for nectarine to be between orange and grapefruit. If we place orange here, it would conflict with the need for other foods and hobbies to fit correctly based on all clues.
- Column 4: Considering orange needs to come before nectarine (clue 8), and there must be space for cauliflower (card-games) and strawberry (dancing), this placement becomes crucial.


Given the constraints:


|         |      1      |     2      |    3    |      4      |     5     |      6      |
| Food    | pepper     | cauliflower| orange | nectarine   | strawberry| grapefruit |
| Hobby   | board-games| card-games | reading| traveling   | dancing   | woodworking|


This arrangement respects all given conditions:


1. Board-games is to the left of traveling.
2. Woodworking eats grapefruit and is on the far right.
3. Board-games is to the right of pepper.
4. Woodworking (grapefruit) is on the far right.
5. Grapefruit (woodworking) is to the right of traveling.
6. Strawberry (dancing) is to the right of card-games.
7. Dancing eats strawberry.
8. Nectarine is between orange and grapefruit (with woodworking).
9. Card-games eats cauliflower.

Lv2-2x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify direct information from the clues.
From clue 4, we know the person whose hobby is hiking drives a van. Clue 1 seems redundant as it states the obvious about the roller without giving new information. Clue 2 tells us the van (hiking) is to the right of chess.


## Step 2: Apply clue 3 to understand the order of hobbies.
The person whose hobby is chess is between reading and hiking. This means we have a sequence: reading - chess - hiking, with hiking being the van driver from clue 4.


## Step 3: Use clue 5 to place skydiving in relation to hiking.
Skydiving is to the left of hiking, which adds another element to our sequence but doesn't directly impact the known order yet.


## Step 4: Apply clue 6 to understand the placement of reading and roller/tram.
Reading is between the roller and tram. Given clue 7 (roller to the right of bike), we start forming transport sequences.


## Step 5: Combine information from clues 2, 3, and 4 for a partial hobby sequence.
Given chess is between reading and hiking (and hiking drives a van), and knowing the van's position relative to chess from clue 2, we solidify our hobby sequence further but need more transport info.


## Step 6: Use clue 8 to place cooking in relation to roller.
Cooking is to the right of the roller. This helps with placing hobbies based on transports.


## Step 7: Apply clue 9 for boat and gardening placement.
The boat is to the right of gardening, giving us another transport-hobby relation.


## Step 8: Compile all information into a coherent table.
From clue 7, we know bike - roller. Clue 6 gives us roller - reading - tram. Clue 3 gives reading - chess - hiking (with van). Clue 5 adds skydiving to the left of hiking. Clue 8 places cooking after roller. Clue 9 places boat after gardening.


## Step 9: Finalize sequences based on all clues.
Since hiking drives a van and is at the end, we have: skydiving - reading - chess - hiking (van). For transports, considering clue 7 and clue 6, we get bike - roller - reading - tram. Given cooking is after roller, it likely aligns with chess or another hobby not yet directly linked to a transport.


## Step 10: Place remaining hobbies and transports.
Quad-bike is the only transport left unplaced in the initial table. Gardening and boat must fit into our sequences considering clue 9. The final sequence for hobbies, based on given clues, seems to solidify around skydiving - reading - chess - hiking for hobbies, with van at the end.


## Step 11: Final placement of all elements.
Considering all clues:
- Transports: bike, roller (with cooking likely after), boat (after gardening), tram, and quad-bike/van which we know is driven by hiking.
- Hobbies: skydiving, reading, chess, hiking, with gardening and cooking needing final placement.


## Step 12: Finalize the table based on deductions.
Given all clues:
1. Skydiving must be first since it's to the left of hiking (clue 5) and considering other placements.
2. Reading follows as it's between roller and tram (clue 6).
3. Chess is after reading (clue 3).
4. Hiking, with van, comes last among these sequences due to clue 4.


The final answer is:

## Step 1: Determine the order of music genres based on clues 1, 2, and 6.
From clue 1, we know the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of indie. Clue 2 tells us the fan of indie is to the left of the fan of disco. So, we have: gospel -> indie -> disco. Clue 6 indicates the fan of blues is to the left of the fan of trance.


## Step 2: Use clue 3 to further define the music genre order.
Clue 3 states the fan of trance is between the fan of jazz and the fan of blues. Since we know from step 1 that blues must be before trance, jazz must be after trance in this sequence because trance acts as a buffer between jazz and blues.


## Step 3: Combine all music genre clues to establish a possible order.
Combining steps 1 and 2, and considering clue 6 (blues -> trance), we have two sequences that need to be integrated: gospel -> indie -> disco and blues -> trance with jazz on the other side of trance. Since blues must come before trance and there's no direct relation given between these two sequences besides their positions relative to each other, we can infer a possible order but will need more information to finalize it.


## Step 4: Apply job-related clues to narrow down possibilities.
Clue 4 tells us the musician is a fan of gospel. Clue 5 places the mechanic between the journalist and the social-worker, but doesn't specify their music preferences directly. Clue 7 (and its repetition as clue 8) indicates the social-worker is on the right of the teacher.


## Step 5: Use clue 9 to further place individuals.
Clue 9 states the mechanic is on the right of the fan of disco, which helps in placing some jobs relative to music genres.


## Step 6: Synthesize all clues for a final table.
Given the musician likes gospel (clue 4), and knowing gospel must be first in the music sequence due to its placement before indie and disco, we can start building our table. The social-worker being on the right of the teacher (clue 7/8) helps with job placements but not directly with music genres without more context.


## Step 7: Finalize music genre order based on all clues.
Given blues is before trance and jazz must be after trance because trance buffers them, and knowing gospel -> indie -> disco from earlier steps, we can consider a full sequence that respects all conditions. Since the musician likes gospel and must be at position 1 due to the order of genres (gospel -> indie -> disco), and considering the mechanic's placement relative to the fan of disco and other job placements, we piece together both jobs and music preferences.


## Step 8: Construct the table with given clues.
Given all considerations, let's construct a possible arrangement respecting the conditions:
- Musician likes gospel (position 1).
- Gospel -> indie -> disco for music genres.
- Blues before trance, with jazz after trance due to buffering.
- Mechanic between journalist and social-worker, and on the right of disco fan.
- Social-worker to the right of teacher.


Given these steps, a direct table construction requires precise placement based on clues. However, without directly solving each step with a visual aid or more detailed logical deductions for each possible combination of jobs and music genres in this format, we recognize the necessity of integrating all provided clues systematically.


The final answer is: 
#############
| Job           | Music-Genre   |
|---------------|---------------|
| musician      | gospel        |
| teacher       | indie         |

Lv2-2x6-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step:


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 - The person whose sport is sailing is on the far left.
Given this, the first position for sports must be sailing.


## Step 2: Use clue 5 and clue 2 together - The person whose hobby is chess is on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon, and the person whose sport is biathlon is between the person whose hobby is chess and the person whose sport is surfing.
This means the order for hobbies must include chess before biathlon's corresponding hobby, but we don't know what biathlon's hobby is yet. For sports, we have sailing on the far left.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1 (and clues 4 and 6 which repeat it) - The person whose hobby is sudoku is the person whose sport is skiing.
This gives us a direct match but doesn't tell us the position yet.


## Step 4: Use clue 7 - The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing.
So, we have skiing and then skateboarding in the sports column.


## Step 5: Apply clues 8, 9, and 10 to order the hobbies - Filmmaking is left of hiking, singing is left of filmmaking, and hiking is left of sudoku.
This gives us a sequence for hobbies: singing, filmmaking, hiking, sudoku.


## Step 6: Combine all information to fill in the table.
Given sailing is on the far left (clue 3), and knowing the sequence for some hobbies and sports, we start filling in:


- For sports, we have Sailing on the left. Then, because chess must be before biathlon's hobby, and biathlon is between chess and surfing, but we don't know where exactly skiing fits in relation to biathlon yet, we focus on what we do know.
- Sudoku's sport is skiing (clue 1), and skateboarding follows skiing (clue 7).
- The order for hobbies is singing, filmmaking, hiking, sudoku.


## Step 7: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Since sailing is first, and considering the sequence of hobbies, we try to fit sports around them:


Given:
- Sailing is first.
- Chess must be before biathlon (but we don't know biathlon's exact hobby yet).
- Sudoku is with skiing.
- Skateboarding follows skiing.


And for hobbies: singing, filmmaking, hiking, sudoku.


Let's place what we can:
1. Sailing (sport) - could correspond with any hobby that fits the other clues.
2. The sequence of hobbies must fit with the given sports constraints.


Given the direct links and sequences:


- Singing is before filmmaking, which is before hiking, which is before sudoku.
- Chess is before biathlon, but we need to find where this fits with the given hobbies sequence.


Since sudoku is linked with skiing (and thus skateboarding follows), and knowing hiking comes before sudoku, we can start placing these:


If sailing is on the far left and corresponds with a hobby that allows chess to be before biathlon, and considering singing must be before filmmaking, which is before hiking, which is before sudoku, we might have something like this for hobbies (knowing some sports already):


Sailing's hobby could potentially disrupt the sequence if it doesn't fit neatly with chess or another hobby that allows biathlon to fit as required.


However, without direct links between most hobbies and sports besides sudoku/skiing, we infer based on given sequences:


1. Sailing
2. ? (Could be chess to allow biathlon to fit later)
3. ?
4. ?
5. ?
6. ?

For hobbies:
1. Singing
2. Filmmaking
3. Hiking
4. Sudoku

And sports:
1. Sailing
2. ? (Must allow for biathlon and surfing in a way that chess is before biathlon)
3. ?
4. Skiing (with sudoku)
5. Skateboarding
6. ?

Given the puzzle's constraints, let's fill in what we can directly:


The person with sailing as their sport must have a hobby that allows all other conditions to be met.


Since we know:
- Singing is before filmmaking, which is before hiking, which is before sudoku.
- Chess must be before biathlon.
- Sudoku is with skiing.


And for sports:
- Sailing is first.
- Skiing is followed by skateboarding.


We need to find a configuration that fits all given clues.


Given the clues again and trying to fit them into a table:


The direct links are sailing on the left, sudoku with skiing, and skateboarding after skiing. The sequence of hobbies (singing, filmmaking, hiking, sudoku) must match with these constraints.


Considering all constraints and filling in what we can directly:


Sailing is first, which could potentially fit with any hobby that allows the other conditions to be met.

Lv2-2x6-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching horror movies.
The person watching horror movies is on the far right (Clue 9), so they are at position 6.


## Step 2: Place the documentary movie watcher in relation to the horror movie watcher.
The person watching documentary movies is to the left of the person watching horror movies (Clue 1). Since horror is at position 6, documentary must be at one of the positions to the left of 6.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the comedy movie watcher and the ferret owner.
The person watching comedy movies is between the person watching family movies and the person watching documentary movies (Clue 5), and this person owns a ferret (Clues 2 and 4). This means comedy cannot be at either end.


## Step 4: Place the satire movie watcher in relation to the goldfish owner.
The person watching satire movies is between the person watching family movies and the owner of the bird (Clue 8), and also to the left of the owner of the goldfish (Clue 7).


## Step 5: Combine all information to start filling in the table.
Given that horror is at position 6, and considering the constraints:
- Documentary must be to the left of horror.
- Comedy is between family and documentary, owns a ferret, and has the snake owner to their right (Clue 6).
- Satire is between family and the bird owner, and to the left of the goldfish owner.


## Step 6: Finalize positions based on constraints.
Since comedy is between family and documentary, and satire is also related to family but must be to the left of the goldfish owner, we need to carefully place these genres and pets.


## Step 7: Place the remaining movie genres and pets.
Given that horror owns a rabbit (Clue 3) and is at position 6, and considering all other constraints:
- The only configuration that fits all clues is when we arrange the genres and pets in a way that respects all given conditions.


## Step 8: Create the final table based on deductions.
From Clue 5 and others, comedy must be near the center to accommodate being between family and documentary. With horror at position 6, and considering the snake's owner is to the right of comedy (Clue 6), we can start building a sequence.


## Step 9: Place satire, given it's between family and the bird owner.
This means family cannot be at either end because satire and another person (bird owner) need to be on either side of family.


## Step 10: Finalize all positions based on previous steps.
Given all constraints:
- Satire is to the left of goldfish, between family and bird.
- Comedy is between family and documentary, with ferret as pet.
- Horror is at the end, with rabbit as pet.
- Documentary to the left of horror.
