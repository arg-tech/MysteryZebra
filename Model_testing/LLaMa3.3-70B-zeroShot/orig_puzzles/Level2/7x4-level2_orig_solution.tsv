Lv2-7x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we get it.


Given:
- Hobbies: camping, dancing, woodworking, writing
- Jobs: analyst, chef, musician, project-manager
- Movie-genres: animation, family, superhero, zombie
- Nationalities: dutch, german, polish, turkish
- Pets: guinea-pig, hamster, pony, turtle
- Sports: climbing, skiing, snowboarding, volleyball
- Transport: scooter, ship, train, van


From clue 10, the person driving the van is the Polish.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 6 and Clue 7
Clue 6 states the person whose hobby is dancing is on the right of the person driving the van.
Clue 7 states the person driving the van is on the left of the person whose sport is snowboarding.


This means we have a sequence for these three: Van (Polish) - Dancing - Snowboarding.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person whose hobby is dancing is on the left of the person whose sport is volleyball.
Given our current sequence, this places Volleyball after Snowboarding in the lineup.


## Step 3: Use Clue 10 and Clue 2
Since the Polish drives the van (Clue 10), and the Polish is on the right of the owner of the hamster (Clue 2), the hamster's owner must be to the left of the van, thus before the dancing person.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The Dutch watches family movies. From Clue 15, the person watching family movies is on the right of the owner of the turtle, implying the turtle's owner and the Dutch are in this order.


## Step 5: Consider Clue 16
The pony's owner is between the scooter driver and the skiing person (who also enjoys woodworking from Clue 4).


## Step 6: Use Clue 11
The train driver is on the left of the musician, giving us another sequence but without specific placement yet.


## Step 7: Piece Together Remaining Information
- From Clue 8, the Turkish watches superhero movies.
- Clue 9 places the zombie movie watcher to the right of the Turkish.
- Clue 5 indicates the pony's owner is between the project-manager and the woodworking (skiing) person.
- Given these clues, we can start filling in the table.


## Step 8: Finalize Positions
Given all the information:
1. Van (Polish) - must be driven by Polish, so Polish is with van.
2. Dancing is to the right of the van (Clue 6).
3. Snowboarding follows dancing (from our sequence).
4. Volleyball follows snowboarding (Step 2).
5. Dutch watches family movies and is after the turtle owner (Clue 15).
6. Turkish watches superhero movies, followed by zombie movies (Clues 8 & 9).
7. Pony's owner between scooter driver and skiing/woodworking person (Clue 16).
8. Train driver to the left of musician (Clue 11).


Let's place them in a table based on these clues:


Given the complexity and the need for iterative reasoning, let's simplify our approach by directly applying key clues that give us direct positions or sequences.


Directly placing individuals based on specific clues:
- The Polish person drives a van.
- The person whose hobby is dancing is to the right of the van driver (Polish).
- The Dutch person watches family movies and must be after the turtle owner.
- The Turkish person watches superhero movies, followed by someone who watches zombie movies.


Considering these positions and sequences:


|               |      1      |    2     |        3        |     4      |
| Hobby         | camping    | dancing | woodworking    | writing   |
| Job           | chef       | analyst| project-manager| musician  |
| Movie-Genre   | animation  | family  | superhero      | zombie    |
| Nationality   | german     | dutch   | turkish         | polish    |
| Pet           | turtle     | hamster| pony            | guinea-pig|
| Sport         | climbing   | volleyball| skiing       | snowboarding|
| Transport     | train      | van     | scooter        | ship      |


However, given the constraints and upon reevaluation for accuracy in placement based on clues provided:


The final solution should reflect all given conditions accurately.


Given this complexity, let's correct our approach with a simplified conclusion that directly answers the puzzle without intermediate incorrect steps.

Lv2-7x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 15
The person watching fantasy movies is on the far left. This means the first column of Movie-Genre is ""fantasy"".


## Step 2: Applying Clues 2 and 11
Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping (Clue 2), and the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching crime movies (Clue 11), we can start building a sequence. However, because fantasy is already determined to be on the far left, the jet-ski clue will help us understand that crime cannot be in the first column but must be after fantasy and possibly camping.


## Step 3: Using Clues 1 and 4
The person drinking mirinda drives the subway (Clue 1), and this person is also a fan of jazz (Clue 4). This links mirinda with the subway and jazz.


## Step 4: Applying Clue 16
The person drinking mirinda is between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the pony. Given that the owner of the pony drinks almond-milk (Clue 3), we have a relationship but need to figure out the exact order.


## Step 5: Using Clues 8 and 14
The person eating carrot is on the right of the person drinking mirinda (Clue 8), and the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person eating cranberry (Clue 14). This gives us a partial sequence for Food and Beverage.


## Step 6: Applying Clues 5, 10, and 13
The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is writing (Clue 5), the fan of country is on the right of the person watching disaster movies (Clue 10), and the fan of electronic is on the right of the person whose hobby is camping (Clue 13). These clues help us understand the relative positions but require careful integration with other information.


## Step 7: Integrating All Clues
Given that fantasy is on the far left, we start building:
- The first column must be fantasy for Movie-Genre.
- Because the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping (Clue 2), and considering other clues about hobbies and movies, we can infer positions.
- Since the owner of the pony drinks almond-milk (Clue 3) and this person is also on the left of the person eating cranberry (Clue 14), and knowing mirinda is associated with the subway and jazz, we start to see a pattern.
- The jet-ski clue places it on the left of crime movies, but since fantasy is far left, jet-ski must be associated with another hobby or preference that fits this constraint.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Given all clues, let's finalize:
1. Fantasy movies are first (Clue 15).
2. Mirinda is linked with the subway and jazz (Clues 1 and 4), and it's between the hamster and pony owners (Clue 16).
3. Almond-milk is associated with the pony owner, who is also on the left of cranberry eater (Clue 14).
4. Coffee is linked with the taxi driver (Clue 9).
5. Juice's position is relative to collecting (Clue 7), and carrot is after mirinda (Clue 8).

Given these complex relationships and without a visual grid provided in this format, we deduce logically but must simplify our explanation due to format constraints.

Lv2-7x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to deduce the information.


1. The Egyptian is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
2. The Spanish is the owner of the mouse.
3. The person eating apple is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing.
4. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
5. The person drinking milk is the person who's hobby is writing.
6. The person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the teacher.
7. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the Polish.
8. The person drinking milk is the musician.
9. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
10. The musician is on the far left.
11. The owner of the pony is the person eating cauliflower.
12. The person who's sport is cycling is between the person eating pumpkin and the owner of the frog.
13. The person who's sport is baseball is the owner of the frog.
14. The teacher is between the person drinking tea and the person eating cauliflower.
15. The chef is on the left of the Spanish.


Given clue 10, we start with the musician on the far left:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3      |      4       |

| Pet           |             |          |            |              |
| Sport         |             |          |            |              |


From clue 8, the musician drinks milk and from clue 5, the person drinking milk has writing as a hobby:


|               |      1      |    2     |     3      |      4       |

| Hobby         | writing    |          |            |              |
| Job           | musician   |          |            |              |
| Nationality   |             |          |            |              |
| Pet           |             |          |            |              |
| Sport         |             |          |            |              |


Clue 15 indicates the chef is on the left of the Spanish, but since the musician is already on the far left, the chef must be in position 2 or 3 to allow the Spanish to be somewhere to their right. However, given that the teacher (from clue 14) needs to be between the person drinking tea and the person eating cauliflower, and considering other constraints about positions relative to each other, we can start building a more detailed picture.


Given clue 1, the Egyptian must be on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the musician is already on the far left (drinking milk), if the Egyptian were also on the far left, it would contradict the placement of the musician as being on the far left unless the Egyptian and the musician are the same person.


Let's apply more clues to refine:


Clue 9 tells us cycling is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Clue 6 says cycling is on the right of the teacher, which means the order must be: teacher -> cycling -> 7up (from clue 9). But we also know from clue 12 that cycling is between pumpkin and frog.


Given the complexity and the need to apply each clue methodically while considering all interactions:


- Clue 2 places the Spanish with a mouse, but doesn't give us an immediate position.
- Clue 3 indicates apple's position relative to singing but not its absolute position yet.
- Clue 4 gives filmmaking's position relative to collecting.
- Clue 7 gives parkour's position relative to Polish.


Considering all these clues together and applying them methodically, the solution requires careful step-by-step deduction, often moving back and forth between clues to find a fit that satisfies all conditions simultaneously.


Let's synthesize what we have so far with additional insights:


1. Musician is on the far left (clue 10), drinks milk (clue 8), and has writing as a hobby (clue 5).
2. Cycling is to the right of the teacher (clue 6) and to the left of 7up (clue 9).
3. The chef must be to the left of the Spanish (clue 15), but exact positions depend on other clues.


Given these constraints, we can start filling in more details:


The musician (drinking milk) is on the far left. Given that cycling is between pumpkin and frog (clue 12), and cycling is also to the left of 7up (clue 9), we need to fit these elements together while respecting other clues.


However, without directly applying each clue in a stepwise manner to fill out the table row by row due to the complexity and interrelatedness of the information, we risk missing critical interactions between the different pieces of data provided.


Given this, let's attempt to piece together some key elements that can help us solve the puzzle:


- The musician is on the far left, drinking milk.
- Cycling must be near pumpkin and frog, and also before 7up.
- The teacher is before cycling (because cycling is after the teacher).
- Apple is after singing.
- Filmmaking is after collecting.


Considering all these elements, we need to find a configuration that fits. Given the constraints about positions relative to each other, let's attempt a solution based on applying these clues systematically:


Since the problem requires a detailed and systematic approach to solve accurately, let's directly construct the final answer table based on deducing from all given clues.


Given the complexity of directly solving this puzzle in real-time without visual aids or further clarification on some steps due to the highly interconnected nature of the clues, we must consider each clue carefully against the constraints provided:


The direct solution involves considering each piece of information and methodically eliminating possibilities that do not fit the criteria provided by the clues.


For a precise answer, let's outline what we've deduced so far and attempt to fill in the blanks with the given information:


Given the musician is on the left (drinking milk), and other clues about relative positions, we piece together the rest of the information.


Considering all constraints, here's how one might construct a solution table based on the provided clues, keeping in mind that some steps may require trial and error or further deduction not immediately outlined:

Lv2-7x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
The teacher is the person who's hobby is board-games. This means the teacher and the board-games hobbyist are the same person.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The owner of the snake is the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the teacher's hobby is board-games, the teacher owns the snake.


## Step 3: Use Clue 13
The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person drinking water. This doesn't give us a direct placement yet but indicates a relationship between gardening and water.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The teacher is on the left of the person drinking milk. This clue, combined with others, will help in placing the teacher and thus the board-games hobbyist.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 15
The teacher is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the teacher is also a board-games enthusiast and owns a snake (from Clue 1 and Clue 6), we can start building relationships between these elements.


## Step 6: Use Clue 8
The person eating orange is the owner of the horse. This gives us a direct food association with the horse owner.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 2
The person drinking juice is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. This clue starts to give us a sequence related to beverages and sports.


## Step 8: Analyze Clue 4
The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This, combined with Clue 2, gives us a sequence for these sports.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 12
The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since we know from Clue 3 that the teacher is on the left of the person drinking milk, and considering other clues about sports sequences, we can start piecing together the sports column.


## Step 10: Use Clue 9
The french is between the person who's hobby is gardening and the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This clue helps in understanding the arrangement based on hobbies and nationalities.


## Step 11: Apply Remaining Clues
Continuing with the process of elimination and direct placements from clues like Clue 5 (the nigerian is on the right of the person eating pomegranate), Clue 10 (the pilot is on the right of the person drinking milk), Clue 11 (the owner of the ferret is on the right of the doctor), Clue 14 (the doctor is the american), and Clue 16 (the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding), we can deduce more specific placements.


## Step 12: Finalize Placements
Given the complex interrelations, let's summarize key points:
- Teacher = Board-games = Snake owner.
- Teacher is to the left of Milk drinker and Horse owner (Orange eater).
- Doctor = American.
- French between Gardening and Filmmaking hobbies.
- Sequences for sports and drinks help in finalizing placements.

Lv2-7x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


From clue 4 and clue 16, we know the manager and the russian are on the far left. Since the manager is specified to be on the far left (clue 4) and the documentary movie watcher is also on the far left (clue 5), and considering clue 16 that places the russian on the far left, it implies the russian is the manager who watches documentaries.


Clue 2 tells us the firefighter is into weightlifting.


Clue 10 indicates the nurse is into rowing.


Given these starting points and using all clues, let's fill in the table step by step:


1. The thai is on the left of the owner of the horse (clue 1).
2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the firefighter (clue 2).
3. The taxi driver is on the right of the writer (clue 3).
4. The manager is on the far left (clue 4).
5. The documentary movie watcher is on the far left (clue 5), which aligns with the manager.
6. The british is on the right of the colombian (clue 6).
7. The sailing sport person watches thrillers (clue 7).
8. The bus driver is on the left of the writer (clue 8).
9. The thai is between the ferret owner and the sailor (clue 9).
10. The nurse rows (clue 10).
11. The hedgehog owner is on the right of the manager (clue 11).
12. The thriller watcher is on the right of the disaster movie watcher (clue 12).
13. The documentary watcher is on the left of the writer (clue 13), reinforcing clue 5.
14. The goldfish owner drives a roller (clue 14).
15. The reader is on the right of the card game player (clue 15).
16. The russian is on the far left (clue 16), which we've established as the manager watching documentaries.
17. The weightlifter (firefighter) is on the right of the water polo player (clue 17).


Now, combining all these clues to fill in the table:


- Column 1: Russian, Manager, Documentary, Hedgehog owner can't be here due to clue 11, so it's the manager with documentary and another pet. Given the clues about left and right positions, we place the manager (russian) with documentary movies, and a pet that fits other clues later.
- Column 2: Given the manager is on the far left and hedgehog owner on their right, this could potentially be the colombian or british based on clue 6. But since the thai must be to the left of the horse owner (clue 1) and between the ferret and sailor (clue 9), we need to figure out where these fit with other clues.
- Column 3 & 4: We have to fit in the firefighter (weightlifter), nurse (rower), and others while respecting all given conditions.


After carefully considering all clues:


The final table looks like this, taking into account all the specific details about positions, hobbies, jobs, movie-genres, nationalities, pets, sports, and transports:

Lv2-7x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply each clue step by step to deduce the arrangement of characteristics for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 13
The writer is on the far right. This means the fourth position is occupied by the writer.

## Step 2: Apply Clues 10 and 6
The doctor is on the left of the person driving the helicopter (Clue 10), and the person watching satire movies is between the French and the person driving the helicopter (Clue 6). This gives us a sequence but not enough to place everyone yet.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 11
The person whose sport is climbing is the police-officer. This doesn't give us a direct position but tells us about the job-sport connection.

## Step 4: Apply Clues 7 and 14
The person driving the trike is on the right of the lawyer (Clue 7), and the person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the lizard (Clue 14). This suggests a sequence involving the lawyer, the lizard owner, and the trike driver.

## Step 5: Apply Clues 12 and 15
The lawyer is on the left of the person eating lettuce (Clue 12), and the lawyer is on the right of the person eating pineapple (Clue 15). This gives us a food sequence related to the lawyer.

## Step 6: Combine Information from Previous Steps
From Clues 7, 14, 12, and 15, we have a partial sequence: Pineapple - Lawyer - Lettuce - Lizard owner - Trike driver. But remember, the writer is on the far right (Clue 13), so this sequence cannot extend to the fourth position.

## Step 7: Apply Clues 1 and 2
The British is on the left of the person watching animation movies (Clue 1), and the Egyptian is on the right of the person driving the taxi (Clue 2). These clues give us nationality-media and nationality-transport connections but don't directly place anyone yet.

## Step 8: Apply Clues 3, 4, and 9
The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person whose sport is cricket (Clue 3), the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person whose sport is skiing (Clue 4), and the person driving the ship is the owner of the goat (Clue 9). These clues give us more connections between movie genres, sports, and pets.

## Step 9: Apply Clues 5 and 8
The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the ferret (Clue 5), and the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the owner of the goat (Clue 8). These clues give us food-pet connections.

## Step 10: Synthesize All Clues
Given the complexity and interconnectivity of all clues, we must find a way to align them. The direct placements from clues are:
- Writer is on the far right.
- Doctor is on the left of the helicopter driver.
- Satire movies are between French and helicopter driver.
- Police-officer's sport is climbing.
- Trike driver is after lawyer and lizard owner.

Considering all connections, let's attempt a solution:


Given the constraints and clues:
1. British is to the left of animation.
2. Egyptian is to the right of taxi.
3. Adventure movies are to the right of cricket.
4. Satire is to the left of skiing.
5. Cauliflower is to the right of ferret.
6. Satire between French and helicopter.
7. Trike after lawyer.
8. Pomegranate after goat.
9. Ship driver owns goat.
10. Doctor to the left of helicopter.
11. Climbing is police-officer.
12. Lawyer to the left of lettuce.
13. Writer on far right.
14. Trike after lizard.
15. Lawyer to the right of pineapple.


Let's solve it step by step with these clues:


From Clue 13, the writer is on the far right.


Considering the constraints and trying different combinations while respecting all given conditions, we aim for a solution that fits all clues.


Given the complexity, let's summarize key points:
- The lawyer is to the left of lettuce (Clue 12) and to the right of pineapple (Clue 15).
- The trike driver is after the lawyer (Clue 7) and also after the lizard owner (Clue 14), indicating a sequence.
- The doctor is before the helicopter driver (Clue 10), and satire movies are between French and the helicopter driver (Clue 6).


Considering all clues, here's an attempt to fill in the table based on deductions:


|               |       1        |       2       |    3     |      4      |
