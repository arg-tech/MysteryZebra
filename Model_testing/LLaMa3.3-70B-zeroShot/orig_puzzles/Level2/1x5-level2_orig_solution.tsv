Lv2-1x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person who likes soccer is in the middle (position 3).
2. The person who likes cricket is to the right of the person who likes weightlifting.
3. The person who likes cricket is to the left of the person who likes soccer.
4. The person who likes skiing is between the person who likes soccer and the person who likes badminton.

From point 1, we know soccer is in position 3.

From points 2 and 3, since cricket must be both to the right of weightlifting and to the left of soccer, it means weightlifting cannot be in position 3 (because soccer is), so weightlifting must be in a position to the left of cricket. Given that cricket is also to the left of soccer (position 3), this places weightlifting in either position 1 or 2, with cricket then being in position 2 if weightlifting is in 1, because it needs to be directly to the left of soccer.

However, considering point 4 and the fact that skiing needs to be between soccer and badminton, and since soccer is already fixed at position 3, badminton must either be in position 4 or 5 (since skiing has to be between them).

Let's try placing weightlifting and cricket:

- If weightlifting were in position 1, then cricket would have to be in position 2. This leaves positions 4 and 5 for badminton and skiing, with skiing needing to be directly next to soccer (position 3). So, this seems like a plausible path.

Now, let's see if we can arrange the remaining sports around soccer:

Given that cricket is in position 2, weightlifting in 1, and soccer in 3, we need to fit in badminton and skiing. Since skiing must be between soccer (position 3) and badminton, and given that cricket is already occupying position 2, the only arrangement left for badminton and skiing that fits all conditions is having skiing in position 4 and badminton in position 5.

So, the final table should look like this:

Lv2-1x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


1. The person driving the trike is to the left of the person driving the van.
2. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the quad-bike.
3. The person driving the skateboard is on the far left.

From clue 3, we know the skateboard is in position 1.


|             |     1      |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | skateboard|          |           |       |     |

Given clue 2, the airplane must be between the skateboard and the quad-bike. This means the airplane cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by the skateboard) or in positions 4 and 5 because there wouldn't be enough space for both the quad-bike and the airplane with the skateboard on one side. Therefore, the airplane has to be in either position 2 or 3.


Considering clue 1 and that the trike must be to the left of the van, we can start placing the remaining transports:


If the airplane is in position 2, then:
- The quad-bike would have to be in position 3 (to satisfy clue 2), but this leaves us with no space for both the trike and the van while adhering to clue 1.
  
So, let's place the airplane in position 3. This means the quad-bike must go on one side of the airplane, but since the skateboard is already occupying position 1 (the far left), the quad-bike has to be on the right side of the airplane.


|             |     1      |    2     |     3     |   4   |  5  |
| Transport   | skateboard|          | airplane  |       |     |

Now, considering clue 1 (the trike is to the left of the van), and with the skateboard already on the far left, we place the trike in position 2. This leaves us with positions 4 and 5 for the quad-bike and the van.


Given that the airplane must be between the skateboard and the quad-bike (clue 2), and since the airplane is in position 3, the quad-bike has to be after it, meaning the quad-bike goes into position 4 or 5. But because the trike must be to the left of the van, we place the van in position 5, which means the quad-bike goes into position 4.


Therefore, the final arrangement looks like this:


#############

Lv2-1x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The person drinking Fanta is between the person drinking Iced-Tea and the person drinking Sprite.
2. The person drinking Sprite is between the person drinking Fanta and the person drinking Mirinda.
3. The person drinking Mirinda is on the left of the person drinking Sprite.
4. The person drinking Iced-Tea is on the left of the person drinking 7up.

From clue 4, we know Iced-Tea must be to the left of 7up. This gives us a starting point: 
- Iced-Tea, ?, ?, ?, 7up (since Iced-Tea has to be before 7up and there are 5 positions)

Clue 1 tells us Fanta is between Iced-Tea and Sprite. Clue 3 tells us Mirinda is on the left of Sprite. Considering clue 2, which says Sprite is between Fanta and Mirinda, we have a contradiction unless we interpret these clues carefully with the understanding that ""between"" implies direct adjacency in this context might not always be necessary given the phrasing of other clues.

However, let's analyze further:
- Since Mirinda is to the left of Sprite (clue 3), and considering clue 2, which might seem confusing at first glance, it actually suggests an order where Mirinda can indeed be before Fanta if we consider ""between"" in a broader sense but given the direct implications, we need to place these drinks with respect to their constraints directly.

Given this, let's try placing them according to all clues:
- Clue 1: Iced-Tea -> Fanta -> Sprite
- Clue 3: Mirinda is before Sprite.
- Clue 4: Iced-Tea is before 7up.

So, a possible arrangement respecting the ""between"" conditions and direct placements could be:
- If we place Mirinda on the far left (since it has to be on the left of Sprite), it doesn't fit because then Fanta can't be between Iced-Tea and Sprite if Mirinda is directly before them. 
- Thus, considering all clues together: Iced-Tea must come first (to satisfy being before 7up and allowing space for other arrangements).
- Then comes the arrangement that fits: Iced-Tea, Fanta, Sprite doesn't work because Mirinda needs to be on the left of Sprite.

A correct interpretation respecting all conditions is tricky given the ""between"" statements. Let's clarify:
- If Mirinda is before Sprite and Fanta is between Iced-Tea and Sprite, we have a specific order that must respect these placements while also considering Iced-Tea is before 7up.

Given the clues again with careful consideration for the word ""between"" implying direct adjacency where applicable:
1. The person drinking Fanta is directly between Iced-Tea and Sprite.
2. Sprite is directly between Fanta and Mirinda (this clue suggests a sequence but considering direct placement, it implies an order that's constrained by other clues).
3. Mirinda is to the left of Sprite, which means if we have a sequence like ..., Mirinda, Sprite, ..., then Fanta must come before Sprite in some capacity given its relation to Iced-Tea and Sprite.
4. Iced-Tea is before 7up.

Let's place them correctly with all constraints:
- Since Mirinda must be on the left of Sprite, and considering other clues for direct adjacency where ""between"" implies a specific order, we might have misinterpreted the sequence without directly applying each clue to possible positions.

The final arrangement that fits all given conditions (considering each clue carefully) is:
- Iced-Tea must come before 7up.
- Fanta between Iced-Tea and Sprite suggests an order but considering Mirinda's placement, we adjust our understanding of ""between"" in the context of these clues.

Given this analysis and directly applying the clues to find a fitting sequence that respects all conditions provided:
- The direct sequence respecting ""between"" and left/right placements would actually require us to reconsider how these fit together given each clue's specific wording about adjacency and order.

Let's finalize with the correct logic applied step by step according to the clues without misinterpretation:

Given the constraints:
1. Fanta between Iced-Tea and Sprite.
2. Sprite between Fanta and Mirinda (suggesting an order but respecting ""between"" implies direct adjacency where applicable).
3. Mirinda on the left of Sprite.
4. Iced-Tea before 7up.

A correct arrangement is derived not just from clue by clue but ensuring each fits within the constraints provided, which leads to a logical conclusion based on the placement rules given.


The sequence that respects all conditions considering direct placements and ""between"" in its proper context would be:
- Mirinda cannot be after Sprite; thus, it must precede it.
- Fanta is between Iced-Tea and Sprite directly.
- Considering these, we find a logical arrangement.

Thus, with careful consideration of each clue's implications for the sequence and ensuring that ""between"" and left/right placements are respected in their proper context:

1. The British is on the right of the Nigerian.
2. The Australian is on the right of the Indian.
3. The Australian is between the Indian and the American.
4. The Nigerian is on the right of the American.


From clue 3, we know the order for three of the nationalities is: Indian, Australian, American (in that order, since the Australian is between the Indian and the American).


Clue 2 supports this order but doesn't add new information about their positions relative to the others.


Clue 4 tells us the Nigerian is on the right of the American. Combining this with clue 1, which states the British is on the right of the Nigerian, we get: American, Nigerian, British (in that order).


Now, let's combine all the information:


- We have Indian, Australian, American from clue 3.
- And we have American, Nigerian, British from clues 1 and 4.


Given these sequences and considering clue 2 for reinforcement, the complete sequence that respects all conditions is: Indian, Australian, American, Nigerian, British.


So, the final table should look like this:

Lv2-1x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the cat.
2. The owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
3. The owner of the turtle is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the chinchilla.
4. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the ferret.

From statement 1, we know the order is cat -> frog (with at least one position between them or immediately next to each other).

From statement 2, we have frog <- ferret, meaning the ferret must be after the frog.

Combining these insights with statement 4, which tells us turtle is on the right of ferret, we start to get a clearer picture: cat -> frog -> ferret -> turtle (since turtle must be after ferret).

However, statement 3 complicates this slightly by saying turtle is between ferret and chinchilla. Given that turtle must be after ferret (from statement 4), the only way for turtle to be between ferret and chinchilla while also being after ferret is if the order ends with ferret -> turtle -> chinchilla.

So, combining all insights:
- Cat comes before frog.
- Frog comes before ferret.
- Ferret comes before turtle (from statement 4).
- Turtle comes before chinchilla (to satisfy being between ferret and chinchilla).

Therefore, the order from left to right must be: cat, frog, ferret, turtle, chinchilla.

Lv2-1x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The teacher is to the right of the designer.
2. The lawyer is between the musician and the chef.
3. The musician is on the far left.

Given that there are 5 jobs and 5 positions, we can start by placing the musician in position 1 since it's stated to be on the far left:

|       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
| Job   | Musician |        |      |          |         |

From clue 2, we know the lawyer must be between the musician and the chef. Since the musician is in position 1, the lawyer cannot be in position 1, so it must be in either position 2 or another position that allows it to be between the musician and the chef. However, given the constraint, if the lawyer were in any other position than 2, it would not be directly between the musician and another person (since there needs to be at least one person between the lawyer and the chef for this condition to hold). Thus, we place the lawyer in position 2:

|       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
| Job   | Musician | Lawyer |      |          |         |

Now, from clue 2 and with the musician in position 1 and the lawyer in position 2, the chef must be to the right of the lawyer. The only positions left for the chef that make sense given this setup are positions 3, 4, or 5, but since we have other constraints (like the teacher being to the right of the designer), let's hold off on placing the chef just yet.

From clue 1, the teacher is to the right of the designer. This means these two cannot be in positions 1 or 2 because there wouldn't be enough space to satisfy all conditions if either were on the far left (since the musician is already there) or in the second position (which we've determined is the lawyer). 

Considering the setup and that the chef needs to be after the lawyer, let's try placing the designer and teacher while keeping in mind the chef needs to follow the lawyer:

- If the chef were in position 3, it would leave positions 4 and 5 for the designer and teacher. However, this doesn't work because one of them (the teacher) needs to be to the right of the other.
  
So, let's place the chef in a way that allows the designer and teacher to fit according to clue 1:

|       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
| Job   | Musician | Lawyer | Chef |          |         |

This leaves positions 4 and 5 for the designer and teacher. Since the teacher must be to the right of the designer (clue 1), we place the designer in position 4 and the teacher in position 5:

|       |    1     |   2    |  3   |    4     |    5    |
| Job   | Musician | Lawyer | Chef | Designer | Teacher |

This arrangement satisfies all conditions:
- The musician is on the far left.
- The lawyer is between the musician and the chef.
- The teacher is to the right of the designer.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv2-1x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:

1. The firefighter is between the coach and the police-officer.
2. The firefighter is in the middle.
3. The teacher is on the right of the police-officer.

Given that there are 5 jobs and the firefighter is in the middle, the firefighter must be in position 3 because it's the only central position in an odd-numbered sequence.

So, we start with:
```
|       |       1       |   2   |      3      |       4        |    5    |
| Job   |               |       | Firefighter|                |         |
```

From clue 1, since the firefighter is between the coach and the police-officer, these two must be on either side of the firefighter. Given the firefighter's position in the middle (position 3), this means:
- The coach could be in position 2.
- The police-officer could then be in position 4 because it has to be next to the firefighter but also allows for the teacher to be on its right, as per clue 3.

So, we have:
```
|       |       1       |   2   |      3      |       4        |    5    |
| Job   |               | Coach | Firefighter| Police-officer|         |
```

Now, with the teacher on the right of the police-officer (clue 3), the teacher must be in position 5:
```
|       |       1       |   2   |      3      |       4        |    5    |
| Job   |               | Coach | Firefighter| Police-officer| Teacher |
```

The only job left is the social-worker, which must then go into position 1:

2. The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
   
   Since the adventure movie watcher is at position 5, horror must be to their left but not necessarily directly next to them.

3. The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
   
   This means Western and Action are a pair with Western before Action, but we don't know where they are relative to Horror and Adventure yet.

4. The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching horror movies and the person watching action movies.
   
   Given that Horror is to the left of Adventure (at position 5), and Mystery must be between Horror and Action, with Western before Action, we start to get a clearer picture.


From clue 2, Horror can't be at position 5. Let's place Horror at position 4 for now as a starting point because it has to be on the left of Adventure, but remember, it could potentially be further to the left.

- If Horror were at position 4, Mystery would have to be between Horror and Action. But since Western must come before Action, this creates an issue if we try to place them in order without leaving enough space for all genres.


Let's correct our approach considering all clues:


Given that Mystery is between Horror and Action, and Western is before Action, a possible arrangement from left to right could be: Western, Mystery, Horror, Action, Adventure.


This satisfies all conditions:
- The person watching adventure movies is on the far right.
- Horror is on the left of Adventure.
- Western is on the left of Action.
- Mystery is between Horror and Action.

| Transport   | Bus |            |      |        |      |


From clue 3, since the snowmobile is between the bus and the boat, and considering the bus is already placed at position 1, the snowmobile must be at position 2 (because it has to be between the bus and the boat, and there needs to be space for the boat after the snowmobile), and the boat cannot be at position 1 or 2 but must be after the snowmobile:


|             |  1  |     2      |  3   |   4    |  5   |
| Transport   | Bus | Snowmobile | Boat |        |      |


Now, considering clue 1, the bike is to the right of the roller. The only positions left that satisfy all conditions (given the bus, snowmobile, and boat's placements) are positions 4 and 5 for the bike and roller, with the roller having to be before the bike:

Lv2-1x5-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place Apricot on the Far Left
Given that the person eating apricot is on the far left, we can start our arrangement with apricot at position 1.

|        |    1    |  2   |     3     |   4    |     5      |
| Food   | Apricot |      |           |        |            |

## Step 2: Place Strawberry on the Far Right
Since the person eating strawberry is on the far right, we place strawberry at position 5.

|        |    1    |  2   |     3     |   4    |     5      |
| Food   | Apricot |      |           |        | Strawberry |

## Step 3: Place Pineapple and Papaya
The person eating pineapple is to the left of the person eating papaya. This means pineapple must come before papaya in our arrangement.

## Step 4: Consider Plum's Position
Plum is between pineapple and apricot. Given that apricot is already at position 1, plum cannot be to the left of apricot, so it must be to the right of apricot but also to the left of pineapple (since pineapple has to be before papaya).

## Step 5: Combine Clues for Final Placement
Given the constraints:
- Apricot is on the far left.
- Strawberry is on the far right.
- Pineapple is to the left of papaya.
- Plum is between pineapple and apricot, but since apricot is at position 1, plum must be after apricot.

Considering all these points, a possible arrangement could start with apricot, followed by plum (since plum has to be between pineapple and apricot, and given apricot's fixed position, it makes sense for plum to follow apricot directly in this scenario). Then comes pineapple and papaya in that order because pineapple must precede papaya. This leaves us with the arrangement:

|        |    1    |  2   |     3     |   4    |     5      |
| Food   | Apricot | Plum | Pineapple | Papaya | Strawberry |

However, this step-by-step logic missed considering that plum being between pineapple and apricot means plum cannot directly follow apricot if we are to satisfy the condition of pineapple also being part of this sequence in a way that respects all given constraints. Let's correct this understanding:

Given the clue ""the person eating plum is between the person eating pineapple and the person eating apricot,"" and knowing apricot starts, it suggests a sequence where apricot starts, followed by plum (to satisfy the 'between' condition with respect to pineapple and apricot), then pineapple, then papaya (since pineapple must be before papaya), and finally strawberry.

The corrected step considering all clues properly should reflect that after placing apricot on the far left and strawberry on the far right, we need to fit in plum between pineapple and apricot, but since apricot is first, it means plum has to come immediately after apricot if we are to include pineapple in a sequence that respects all conditions. However, this was an error in logical progression based on the clues provided.


## Step 6: Finalize with Corrected Understanding
Let's finalize with a corrected understanding of the clues:
1. Apricot is first.
2. Strawberry is last.
3. Pineapple precedes papaya.
4. Plum is between pineapple and apricot.

Given these, and recognizing the mistake in the logical progression regarding plum's placement relative to pineapple and apricot, we should consider that if apricot starts and strawberry ends the sequence, and knowing pineapple must come before papaya, the only way plum fits ""between"" pineapple and apricot while respecting all other conditions is by having a sequence where plum directly follows apricot (to be between apricot and another fruit), which then must be followed by pineapple and papaya in that order to satisfy all given constraints.


The final answer is:
