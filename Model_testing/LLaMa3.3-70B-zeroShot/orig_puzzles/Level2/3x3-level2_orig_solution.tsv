Lv2-3x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 1
The person eating raspberry is the person driving the train. This means that in the transport column, ""train"" must be in the same row as ""raspberry"" in the food column.

## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2
The owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating apple. Since we don't know the order yet, we have two possibilities: either cat is to the left of raspberry and apple is to the right, or cat is to the right of raspberry and apple is to the left.

## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3
The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This implies that ""car"" in the transport column must be to the right of ""lizard"" in the pet column, but we don't know their exact positions yet.

## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4
The owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating apple. Combining this with statement 2, it suggests that the order from left to right could be: cat, raspberry, apple, or at least cat must be before apple.

## Step 5: Combining Information
Given statement 1 (raspberry with train), and knowing cat is between raspberry and apple but also before apple (from statements 2 and 4), we start building the table. Statement 3 indicates car is after lizard, which helps in positioning the remaining options.


## Step 6: Building the Table
From statement 1, raspberry must go with train.
Statement 2 and 4 indicate cat is before apple, and between raspberry and apple.
Statement 3 places car after lizard.

Let's place raspberry (with train) first:
- Since cat is between raspberry and apple, but also before apple, we could initially think to place cat in the middle. However, considering all statements together, especially with the transport and pet constraints, we need to fit everything logically.


Given the constraints:
1. Raspberry with train.
2. Cat between raspberry and apple, but specifically before apple.
3. Car after lizard.

The only configuration that fits is having the person who eats cabbage (the remaining food) own the lizard because it allows us to satisfy all conditions when placing car after lizard.


## Step 7: Finalizing Positions
- Raspberry with train can be in position 2 or 3 due to its flexibility, but considering cat must be before apple and between them, we'll place raspberry (with train) in position 2. This means cat is in position 1 (because it has to be on the left of apple).
- Since car must be after lizard, and knowing the positions of cat and raspberry, cabbage (with lizard) can only fit in position 1 for pet and food columns if we adjust our approach considering all constraints.
- Apple then fits into position 3.


Let's place them:
1. Cabbage (because it fits with lizard which needs to be before car) - Lizard - Boat (since the other two transports are taken by specific foods, boat is the only option left for cabbage/lizard).
2. Raspberry - Cat - Train.
3. Apple - Fish - Car.


This arrangement satisfies all conditions:
- Raspberry with train.
- Cat between raspberry and apple.
- Car after lizard.
- Owner of cat on the left of person eating apple.


The final answer is:

Lv2-3x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose hobby is chess is the lawyer.
2. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
3. The person drinking Fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up.

From clue 1, we know:
- Hobby: Chess = Job: Lawyer

From clue 2, since the person drinking tea must be to the right of the person whose hobby is woodworking, this means:
- Woodworking cannot be in column 3 (because there's no one to the right), so Woodworking must be in either column 1 or 2.
- Tea must then be in a column to the right of Woodworking.

From clue 3, we know Fanta is between the project-manager and 7up. This doesn't directly tell us the jobs or hobbies but gives us a sequence for beverages: Project Manager - Fanta - 7up or 7up - Fanta - Project Manager.

Let's fill in what we can based on these clues:

Given that Chess = Lawyer, let's start with this combination and try to fit it into our table. Since there are only three jobs and hobbies, and given the restrictions:

- If Woodworking is in column 1, Tea must be in column 2 or 3 (but since it has to be directly to the right of Woodworking, it would have to be in column 2 if Woodworking is in column 1). However, considering the beverage clue, we also need to fit Fanta between Project Manager and 7up.

Let's consider placing Lawyer/Chess:
- If Lawyer (Chess) is in column 1, Woodworking can't be there because then Tea would have to be in column 2, but this doesn't help us place Fanta relative to Project Manager and 7up directly.
- So, let's try placing Lawyer/Chess in column 2. This means Woodworking could potentially be in column 1 (since Tea needs to be to its right), which would put Tea in column 3.

With these placements:
- Column 1: Woodworking
- Column 2: Chess/Lawyer
- Column 3: ? (Needs to be Tea for the beverage)

For jobs, considering clue 3 and our current setup:
- If Project Manager is in column 1 (with Woodworking), Fanta would need to be in column 2 (between Project Manager and 7up), but we've established Lawyer/Chess is in column 2.
- So, let's consider the beverage order with the remaining options: 
  - Column 1 could have Woodworking and 7up (because then Fanta can go between Project Manager and 7up if Project Manager is not in column 1).
  - Given that Chess/Lawyer must be in a column where it fits with the other clues, placing Lawyer/Chess in column 2 works if we consider the beverage clue for placement.

If Woodworking is in column 1 with 7up (to satisfy Fanta being between Project Manager and 7up), and Lawyer/Chess is in column 2:
- Column 1: Woodworking, 7up
- Column 2: Chess/Lawyer, ? (This can't be Fanta since we need it between Project Manager and 7up)
- Column 3: ?, Tea

Given the constraints:
- The only configuration that fits all clues is having Fanta in column 2 (because it needs to be between Project Manager and 7up) but this conflicts with our initial placement of Chess/Lawyer unless we adjust based on the job and hobby alignment.

Correcting our approach with a clearer step-by-step alignment:
1. **Woodworking** must be in column 1 or 2 because Tea (to its right) needs to fit.
2. If **Woodworking** is in column 1, **Tea** can only be in column 2 or 3 but must directly follow Woodworking, placing it in column 2 if we consider the direct right placement necessary for all configurations to work out with other clues.

However, considering the beverage clue and job/hobby alignments:
- Let's place **Woodworking** in column 1 (with a beverage), **Chess/Lawyer** in column 2 (because it fits well with having Fanta between Project Manager and 7up if we adjust the jobs accordingly), and then figure out how to fit **Tea**, **Fanta**, and **7up** around these constraints.

Given all clues, let's finalize:
- Column 1: Woodworking, 7up (since Fanta needs to be between Project Manager and 7up)
- Column 2: Chess/Lawyer, Fanta (satisfying the condition of Fanta being between Project Manager and 7up if we adjust jobs accordingly)
- Column 3: ?, Tea

This means:
- The person with **Woodworking** as a hobby drinks **7up**, and their job must be the one not yet assigned.
- **Chess/Lawyer** drinks **Fanta**, fitting the middle beverage condition with the clue about Fanta's placement.
- The remaining job (**Project Manager**) goes with **Tea**, and since Tea is to the right of Woodworking, this setup works.

Given the initial misstep in directly applying clues without considering all permutations, let's correct and clarify:
- **Woodworking** is in column 1 with **7up**.
- **Chess/Lawyer** is in column 2 with **Fanta**, which satisfies Fanta being between Project Manager (in column 3) and 7up (in column 1).
- **Tea** is in column 3, to the right of Woodworking.

Thus, correcting for clarity and direct application of clues:
- Column 1: Woodworking, Project Manager, 7up
- Column 2: Chess, Lawyer, Fanta
- Column 3: ?, Tea

The corrected final table considering all given constraints should align as follows:

#############
|            |   1    |      2      |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up    |     Fanta   |       Tea       |

| Job        |Project Manager| Lawyer | Musician       |
#############

This setup adheres to all given conditions:
- The person whose hobby is chess is the lawyer.
- The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.
- The person drinking Fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up."
Lv2-3x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter.
2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
3. The person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is sailing.

From clue 3, we know that the person who watches disaster movies also plays ice-hockey.

From clue 1, we know that this person (disaster movies, ice-hockey) is on the left of the firefighter.

From clue 4, we know that this person (disaster movies, ice-hockey) is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is sailing. Since they are on the left of the firefighter, the order must be: mechanic, disaster movies/ice-hockey, firefighter/sailing.

Now, let's consider the movie genres:

From clue 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies.

So, the person watching spy movies must be in column 3 (since disaster movies are in column 1 or 2).

The only remaining option for column 2 is documentary movies.

Here's the solution table:

Lv2-3x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the motorbike and the fan of pop.
From clue 1, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the far right. From clue 5, we also know the fan of pop is on the far right. This means the person driving the motorbike must also be the fan of pop.


## Step 2: Position the train and its relation to funk.
From clue 2, the fan of funk is to the left of the person driving the train. Clue 3 tells us the train is between the fan of funk and the person watching drama movies. This doesn't give us exact positions yet but tells us the order for two of the columns.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the drama movie fan.
Since the fan of pop (and thus the motorbike) is on the far right, and from clue 4, the fan of pop is to the right of the person watching epic movies, we can deduce the order for the movie genres but need to figure out how they align with the transport and music genres.


## Step 4: Aligning all genres based on clues.
From clue 3, since the train is between funk and drama, and knowing the motorbike (pop) is on the far right, we can start building our table. The leftmost person must be a fan of funk because they are to the left of the train (clue 2), and thus, drama cannot be on the far left.


## Step 5: Finalizing positions.
Given that pop is on the far right with the motorbike, and knowing from clue 4 that epic movies must be to the left of pop (since pop is to the right of epic), we can place epic in the middle. This leaves drama for the leftmost position since it has to be between funk and the train (but actually, it's more accurate to say the train is between funk and drama based on clue 3). Thus, our movie-genre order from left to right is drama, epic, romance isn't directly mentioned in relation to a specific transport or music genre yet, but given the clues, romance must be with the train because epic is with pop (on the motorbike), and drama has to be with funk based on their positioning relative to the train.


## Step 6: Final alignment check.
- The fan of funk is on the left.
- The train (with its respective genres) is in the middle.
- Pop (and thus the motorbike) is on the right.
Given these, our final table should look like this:


|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama     | Epic  | Romance   |
| Music-Genre   | Funk      | R&B   | Pop       |
| Transport     | Helicopter| Train | Motorbike |


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama     | Epic  | Romance   |

Lv2-3x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:

1. The fan of soul is the owner of the ferret.
2. The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike.
3. The fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski.
4. The owner of the ferret is between the owner of the frog and the fan of salsa.

From statement 3, we know the fan of salsa drives a jet-ski. 

Statement 1 tells us that the fan of soul owns a ferret.

Statement 2 indicates that the ferret's owner (thus, the soul fan) is to the right of the bike rider.

Statement 4 says the ferret's owner is between the frog's owner and the salsa fan (jet-ski rider).

Let's start filling in the table based on these clues:

- Since the salsa fan drives a jet-ski and considering statement 4, the salsa fan cannot be in position 1 because then there would be no one to the left of the ferret's owner. Thus, the salsa fan must be in either position 2 or 3.

Given statement 3 (salsa fan drives a jet-ski) and considering the arrangement:
- If the salsa fan were in position 2, the ferret's owner would have to be in position 3 to satisfy being between the frog's owner and the salsa fan. However, this contradicts statement 2 because the bike rider must be to the left of the ferret's owner, which means the bike cannot be in position 1 if the ferret's owner is in position 3.

Therefore, the salsa fan must be in position 3 (driving a jet-ski), and since the ferret's owner is between the frog's owner and the salsa fan, the ferret's owner must be in position 2. The bike rider then must be in position 1 because they have to be to the left of the ferret's owner.

Now we fill in what we know:
- Position 1: Bike (transport), unknown music genre, unknown pet
- Position 2: Unknown transport, Soul (music-genre because the soul fan owns a ferret), Ferret (pet)
- Position 3: Jet-ski (transport), Salsa (music-genre), unknown pet

Since the salsa fan is in position 3 and drives a jet-ski, and we know from statement 4 that the ferret's owner (soul fan) is between the frog's owner and the salsa fan:
- The only place left for the frog's owner is position 1 because it has to be to the left of the ferret's owner.

Given the remaining options:
- Position 1 must have a frog as its pet since that's the only pet left without an assigned position.
- The only music genre left for position 1 is Trance, as Salsa and Soul are already assigned.
- The transport method for position 3 is already determined to be Jet-ski (Salsa fan), so position 2 must have Van as its transport since Bike is in position 1.

Thus, our final arrangement looks like this:

#############
|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |
| Music-Genre   | Trance | Soul   | Salsa   |

Lv2-3x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading.
2. The fan of rock is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography.
3. The fan of classical is between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock.

From clue 2, we know the order for music-genre related to hobbies is: Rock, Photography. 

From clue 1, since sports movies are watched by someone to the left of the reader, and considering the clue about rock and photography, one possible arrangement could start with Sports (Movie-Genre), but we need more information to solidify positions.

Clue 3 tells us Classical music's fan is between Horror movies and Rock music. This means we have a sequence for Music-Genres: Rock, Classical, Ambient (since these are the only options left and they must be in this order because of clue 3 and given that rock is already associated with being to the left of photography).

Given these clues, let's try to assemble the table:

- Since the fan of classical music is between horror movies and rock, and considering rock is on the left of photography (from clue 2), we can start building our sequence.
- The person watching sports must be to the left of the reader, but since we've established a sequence involving rock and classical with horror, let's see how this fits.

Possible arrangement based on clues:
1. Sports movies cannot be in the middle or right because they need to be to the left of reading (clue 1), so sports could potentially be associated with rock music given the constraints.
2. If Rock is associated with sports, then Classical must be next (because it's between Horror and Rock, but since Rock is first in this scenario, it implies Classical is after Rock and before Horror or another genre not directly mentioned here).
3. Given that photography is after rock (clue 2), and assuming reading can't be first because it needs sports to its left, a possible order starts to emerge.

Let's place the genres and hobbies based on these deductions:

|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |
| Hobby         | Reading  | Photography| Puzzles |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror   | Sports     | Animation|
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Rock       | Classical|

This arrangement seems to fit the given clues:
- The person watching sports movies (2) is to the left of the person whose hobby is reading (not directly applicable here as we've had to adjust based on all clues).
- The fan of rock (2) is to the left of the person whose hobby is photography (matches).
- The fan of classical (3) is between the person watching horror movies and the fan of rock, but given our adjustments for fitting all clues, this direct sequence isn't perfectly preserved; however, considering the initial misinterpretation, let's correctly apply clue 3 with the understanding that Classical must indeed be placed to satisfy its relation with Horror and Rock, which might have been misplaced in initial reasoning.

Re-evaluating strictly by clues without preconceived arrangements:
1. Sports (Movie-Genre) to the left of Reading (Hobby).
2. Rock (Music-Genre) to the left of Photography (Hobby).
3. Classical between Horror and Rock.

Correcting for a strict adherence to clues and reassembling:

Given that we must follow each clue precisely, let's correctly place them without assuming specific starting points:
- If Rock is to the left of Photography and considering other clues, we need to align Music-Genres and Movie-Genres with Hobbies accurately.

Reconsideration with precise clue alignment might suggest an initial misalignment in direct placement based on clue interaction. The critical path involves ensuring each clue directly influences the adjacent or related categories without over-assuming positions.

Given the strict instructions and upon a detailed review for accuracy in adherence to provided clues, let's finalize:

#############
|               |     1     |      2      |    3    |

| Movie-Genre   | Sports   | Horror     | Animation |
| Music-Genre   | Rock     | Classical  | Ambient   |

This solution respects the given conditions:
- The sports movie watcher is to the left of the reader.
- The rock fan is to the left of the photographer.
- The classical fan is between the horror movie watcher and the rock fan, fulfilling all provided clues upon a corrected understanding and application."
Lv2-3x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis.
2. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The person watching western movies is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person whose sport is baseball.

From clue 2, we know the order for transport is: snowmobile, jet-ski, (and thus skateboard is last since it's the only one left).

Clue 1 tells us that documentary is to the right of tennis. Since there are three positions, this means tennis cannot be in position 3 (because then documentary would have no space to its right), so tennis must be in either position 1 or 2.

Clue 3 places western between jet-ski and baseball. Given the transport order from clue 2 (snowmobile, jet-ski, skateboard), and knowing that western is between jet-ski and baseball, this means jet-ski cannot be in position 3 because then there would be no space for both western and baseball to its right. Therefore, jet-ski must be in position 2.

This places snowmobile in position 1 (from clue 2) and skateboard in position 3.

Now we have:
- Transport: snowmobile, jet-ski, skateboard
- Movie-Genre: ?, ?, ?
- Sport: ?, ?, ?

Given the transport order and clue 3, western must be associated with either jet-ski or skateboard since it's between jet-ski and baseball. But since jet-ski is in position 2 and western needs to be between jet-ski and baseball, western cannot be with jet-ski (because then there wouldn't be space for both western and baseball if considering the positions). This means western must be associated with skateboard.

The only arrangement that fits clue 3 now is having baseball in position 1 or 2. But since tennis has to be to the left of documentary (clue 1), and we've established jet-ski is in position 2, this means baseball cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no space for western to be between jet-ski and baseball if considering all other constraints.

So, baseball must be associated with snowmobile in position 1. This leaves tennis for position 2 (since it has to be to the left of documentary, and documentary now fits well in position 3).

For movie-genres:
- Position 1 is western (as it's between jet-ski and baseball, but given our current setup, this was a deduction error; correctly, western should be with skateboard based on initial deductions).
- Position 2 must have fantasy or documentary. Given tennis is here and needs to be to the left of documentary, this means position 2 has fantasy (to satisfy the left-of condition for documentary).
- Position 3 then has documentary.

Correcting our understanding based on re-evaluation:
- Transport: snowmobile, jet-ski, skateboard
- Sport: baseball, tennis, sailing (since we've placed tennis in position 2 and need it to be to the left of documentary; this was an oversight in initial step-by-step logic)
- Movie-Genre: western cannot be directly inferred without considering all positions. Given our corrected transport and sport, let's finalize with accurate placement based on clues:
1. Documentary is to the right of tennis.
2. Snowmobile is to the left of jet-ski.
3. Western is between jet-ski and baseball.

Given this, and correcting for logical flow:
- Baseball is best paired with snowmobile (to allow western to fit between jet-ski and it, considering all constraints).
- Tennis then fits in position 2, as it must precede documentary.
- Western, being between jet-ski and baseball, suggests an arrangement where baseball and western's positions were initially misinterpreted. The correct sequence should reflect the clues directly.

Let's reassemble with corrected logic:
1. Snowmobile (baseball) - because snowmobile is on the left of jet-ski, and baseball needs to be part of this arrangement to allow for the 'between' condition of clue 3.
2. Jet-ski (tennis) - places tennis in a position where documentary can follow it.
3. Skateboard (sailing) - with sailing being the remaining sport.

And for movie-genres, considering all clues:
- The person watching western movies is between jet-ski and baseball, suggesting an arrangement error in initial logic steps. Correctly, with transport and sports arranged as above, we see that:
1. Documentary follows tennis (thus, documentary is in position 3).
2. Western must be between jet-ski and baseball; however, given our corrected understanding of the positions based on transport and sport, this means western should actually align with skateboard to fit between the transport and sport arrangements correctly.

Final arrangement correction:
- Snowmobile (baseball, fantasy) - This doesn't align with previous deductions directly. Correcting for logical consistency across all clues:
1. Transport: snowmobile, jet-ski, skateboard
2. Sport: baseball, tennis, sailing
3. Movie-Genre: Given documentary is to the right of tennis and western between jet-ski and baseball (in terms of their respective positions), and with the transport order set, we correct our genre placement.

Correct Final Table:

1. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the fan of r&b.
2. The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
3. The person who's hobby is card-games is between the fan of indie and the person who's sport is climbing.
4. The fan of indie is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

From clue 4, we know the person whose hobby is magic-tricks likes indie music. Combining this with clue 1, we get that the order for music genre must be ""indie, r&b"" from left to right for these two positions because magic-tricks (which corresponds to indie) is on the left of r&b.

Clue 2 tells us the sports order is ""golf, surfing"" from left to right.

Clue 3 places card-games between indie and climbing. Since we've established that indie is on the left (because it's associated with magic-tricks), this means the order for hobbies must be ""magic-tricks, card-games, gardening"" because card-games has to be between indie and climbing, and magic-tricks is already associated with indie.

Now, let's combine these:

- For music: We have ""indie, r&b"" so far. The only genre left is electronic, which must go on the right.
- For sports: We have ""golf, surfing"". Climbing must be on the right since golf and surfing are already placed in that order from left to right.
- For hobbies: We've determined the order as ""magic-tricks, card-games, gardening"".

Lv2-3x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the order based on clue 4
Given that the owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, and considering clue 3 which states the owner of the chinchilla is in the middle, we can deduce the order for these two pets as follows:
- Pony: Left (Position 1)
- Chinchilla: Middle (Position 2)


## Step 2: Apply clue 1 to determine job positions
The bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst. Since the pony's owner is at position 1 and the chinchilla's owner (who must be in the middle) is at position 2, this implies:
- Pony's owner (Job unknown): Position 1
- Bartender: Position 2 (since they have to be between the pony's owner and the analyst)
- Analyst: Position 3


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 regarding transport means
The person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst. Given that the analyst must be at position 3 based on step 2, we can infer:
- The person driving the ship cannot be at position 3 (because they are between the bike rider and the analyst), which suggests a possible order of bike, ship, and then analyst.


## Step 4: Combine all information to fill in the blanks
From steps 1-3, considering all clues together:
- Position 1 must have the pony's owner.
- The chinchilla's owner is at position 2, who also has to be the bartender based on clue 1 and our deductions.
- The analyst must be at position 3.

Given these positions and the transport information from clue 2, we can try to fit in the remaining pieces:
- Since the pony's owner is at position 1, and considering clue 4 and the fact that the chinchilla's owner (bartender) is in the middle, we have a partial setup.
- The ship driver must be between the bike rider and the analyst. If the analyst is at position 3, this means the bike rider could potentially be at position 1 (pony owner), which fits because the pony owner doesn't conflict with any other given information.


## Step 5: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
- The hedgehog's owner hasn't been mentioned yet. Given that all other pets have owners assigned to specific positions, and considering the clue about the chinchilla being in the middle (position 2), we can deduce:
- Pony at position 1 (with bike as transport to satisfy clue 2)
- Chinchilla/bartender at position 2
- Analyst with ship or scooter at position 3 (but since ship must be between bike and analyst, the analyst must use the scooter to fulfill all conditions without conflict)


The final answer is:

Lv2-3x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.

1. **The Egyptian is the person who's sport is handball.**
   - This means the Egyptian must be associated with handball.

2. **The fan of indie is between the Indonesian and the fan of R&B.**
   - Since there are only three positions, this means the fan of indie cannot be in position 1 or 3 because they need to be between the other two categories (Indonesian and R&B fan).

3. **The person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.**
   - Given that the Egyptian plays handball, this means the Egyptian must be in either position 2 or 3 because they need to be on the right of someone else.

4. **The Mexican is on the left of the fan of R&B.**
   - This gives us another piece of information about positioning but doesn't directly tell us which music genre or sport the Mexican prefers.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- From clue 1, the Egyptian plays handball.
- From clue 3, since handball must be on the right of skateboarding, and considering clue 1, if the Egyptian (handball) were in position 2, there would be no room for skateboarding to their left. So, the Egyptian must be in position 3.

Given this, let's start with the sport since we know the Egyptian is associated with handball:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
| Nationality   |            |               |          |
| Sport         |            |               | Handball |

Now, knowing that skateboarding must be to the left of handball (from clue 3), and there are only three positions:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
| Nationality   |            |               | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboard |               | Handball |

Given that the Mexican is on the left of the fan of R&B (clue 4), and considering the positioning of indie between Indonesian and R&B (clue 2), we can start piecing together the nationalities and music genres.

- Since the Egyptian is in position 3, and the Mexican must be on the left of the R&B fan, the Mexican cannot be in position 3. Given that the indie fan must be between the Indonesian and the R&B fan (and considering all other constraints), we have to fit these pieces together carefully.

The only configuration that fits all clues is if the Mexican is associated with skateboarding (position 1) because they need to be on the left of the R&B fan. This also means the R&B fan cannot be in position 1, and since the indie fan must be between the Indonesian and the R&B fan, it suggests a particular order for the nationalities and music genres.

Given that the Mexican is in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of the R&B fan), and knowing the Egyptian is in position 3 with handball:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
| Nationality   | Mexican    |               | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboard |               | Handball |

Now, fitting in the remaining pieces:
- The R&B fan must be in position 3 because the Mexican (position 1) needs to be on their left, and the indie fan must be between the Indonesian and the R&B fan.
- However, since we've established the Egyptian is in position 3 with handball, it means the R&B fan must also be associated with the Egyptian or another position that allows for the constraints to be met. This suggests a misunderstanding in the initial placement based on clues given.

Let's correct this and properly place the genres and nationalities based on all clues:

1. **Egyptian is with Handball** (Position 3, as deduced).
2. **Mexican is on the left of R&B**, so Mexican cannot be in position 3.
3. **Indie fan between Indonesian and R&B fan**.
4. **Handball to the right of Skateboarding**.

Correcting our approach with all clues in mind:
- The Mexican must be in position 1 because they need to be on the left of the R&B fan, and considering the indie fan's placement, it suggests the following configuration for nationalities and music genres:

Given the constraints:
- If the Mexican is associated with skateboarding (to satisfy being in position 1), and considering all other clues, we have a specific arrangement that must fit.

The correct approach to fill in the table based on the given clues is as follows:

- Since the Egyptian plays handball and is in position 3, and handball must be to the right of skateboarding:
  
|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |          |
| Nationality   | Mexican    | Indonesian   | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboard | Soccer       | Handball |

For music genres, considering the indie fan is between the Indonesian and R&B fan, and the Mexican must be on the left of the R&B fan:

- The only configuration that fits all given clues for music genres, given the placement of nationalities and sports, is:

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |
| Music-Genre   | R&B        | Indie         | Jazz     |
| Nationality   | Mexican    | Indonesian   | Egyptian |
| Sport         | Skateboard | Soccer       | Handball |

This configuration does not satisfy all conditions as initially misinterpreted. Let's correct this based on the clues provided:

1. The Egyptian is with handball (Position 3).
2. The Mexican is to the left of R&B.
3. Indie is between Indonesian and R&B.

Given these, the correct arrangement should consider:
- The Mexican cannot be associated with R&B directly but must precede it.
- The indie fan's position between Indonesian and R&B suggests a specific order for nationalities and music genres that fits all given clues.

Considering the constraints again and correcting for the logical flow based on the clues provided:

The correct arrangement, ensuring all conditions are met (Egyptian with handball, Mexican to the left of R&B, indie between Indonesian and R&B, and handball to the right of skateboarding), is actually misaligned in the explanation above due to an incorrect initial placement.

Given this, let's align it correctly based on clues without assuming direct associations prematurely:

- The correct table, ensuring all constraints are logically met without contradicting any given clue, requires a careful reconsideration of all positions and clues provided.
