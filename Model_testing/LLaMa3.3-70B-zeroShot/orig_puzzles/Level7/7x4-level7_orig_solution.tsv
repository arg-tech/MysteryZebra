Lv7-7x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step by step:


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 8
The Japanese is the coach. This means we can start filling in the job for one of the nationalities.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 12
The owner of the cat is on the far right. This gives us a fixed position but doesn't tell us the nationality or other details yet.


## Step 3: Use Clue 2
The person watching mystery movies is the owner of the cat. Since the cat owner is on the far right, this means the person watching mystery movies is also on the far right.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 21
The videographer is somewhere to the left of the pilot. Clue 10 tells us the videographer drives a car, and Clue 11 says the pilot drives a boat.


## Step 5: Analyze Clues 1 and 5
The Turkish person is on the right of the person watching zombie movies and to the left of the person whose sport is handball. This gives us some positioning but not enough to place them yet.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 16
The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person driving the car (videographer) and the person driving the tram. This clue helps with the transport arrangement.


## Step 7: Use Clue 13
The person driving the tram is on the left of the person whose sport is parkour. This, combined with Clue 16, starts to give us a sequence for transport.


## Step 8: Apply Clues 3 and 9
The person eating pineapple doesn't drive a car, and the pilot doesn't eat raspberry. These clues help eliminate possibilities for food and transport/job combinations.


## Step 9: Analyze Remaining Clues
Continuing with the process of elimination and combination:
- Clue 6 places the cat owner (mystery movies) near the person eating peas.
- Clue 14 indicates the hamster owner is to the right of the librarian, which doesn't give us a direct placement yet.
- Clue 15 says the Polish person is to the right of the horror movie watcher.
- Clue 17 tells us the parkour enthusiast isn't Japanese.
- Clue 18 places the chinchilla owner to the left of the raspberry eater.
- Clue 19 positions cycling between the coach (Japanese) and baseball.
- Clue 20 confirms the chinchilla owner doesn't eat raspberry.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Given the complexity and the interrelated nature of these clues, let's summarize key points to deduce the final arrangement:
1. Japanese is the coach.
2. Cat owner watches mystery movies and is on the far right.
3. Videographer drives a car and is to the left of the pilot (who drives a boat).
4. Subway driver is between car and tram drivers.
5. Tram driver is to the left of the parkour enthusiast.


The final answer is:

- Music-Genre: blues, disco, hip-hop, indie
- Nationality: german, polish, russian, thai
- Sport: basketball, golf, parkour, weightlifting
- Transport: bike, car, snowmobile, van


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 14
The german is in an odd position.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 5
The polish is the person eating grapes.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 11
The person who's hobby is collecting is the person eating grapes.


## Step 5: Combining Information from Clues 3, 5, and 11
Since the polish eats grapes and has collecting as a hobby, we can start forming a profile for the polish person.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 16
The person driving the car is the fan of indie.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 2
The fan of indie is in an odd position.


## Step 8: Combining Information from Clues 14, 16, and 2
Given that the german is in an odd position and so is the fan of indie (who drives a car), we can start placing these individuals.


## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 6
The german is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.


## Step 10: Analyzing Clue 15
The person driving the car is on the left or right of the fan of disco.


## Step 11: Analyzing Clue 4
The person whose hobby is dancing is the person watching spy movies.


## Step 12: Analyzing Clue 22
The person who's hobby is dancing is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.


## Step 13: Analyzing Clue 10
The person watching spy movies is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the fan of blues.

#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis and step-by-step deductions. Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 23, we know that the person eating peas is on the far left. Clue 17 tells us that the person eating peas is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage, so cabbage must be in position 2.

Clue 15 states that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. Since pumpkin cannot be in position 1 (already occupied by peas), it must be in position 3 or 4. Clue 13 tells us that the person eating pumpkin is somewhere between the person eating cabbage and the person drinking milk, so pumpkin must be in position 3.

Clue 10 states that the person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the tram. Clue 24 tells us that the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk, so punk must be in position 1 or 2. Since pop is in an even position (clue 16), it must be in position 2, and punk must be in position 1.

Clue 5 states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Clue 9 tells us that the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour, so camping must be in position 3, and parkour must be in position 4.

Clue 12 states that the person driving the scooter is in an even position, so it must be in position 2 or 4. Clue 21 tells us that the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter, and since d&b is on the right of punk (clue 11), it must be in position 3 or 4.

Clue 2 states that the person driving the van is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Clue 7 tells us that the person driving the subway is somewhere between the owner of the cat and the fan of pop, so the van must be in position 1, and the subway must be in position 2.

Clue 6 states that the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since punk is in position 1, the subway must be in position 2.

Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the cat is not the person driving the tram, so the cat must be in position 2.

Clue 19 states that the fan of pop is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since pop is in position 2, tennis must be in position 1.

Clue 20 tells us that the person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since pumpkin is in position 3, parkour must be in position 4.

Clue 22 states that the fan of pop is not the owner of the goat, so the goat must be in position 4.

The final solution table is above. Note that some clues may have been used implicitly or explicitly to arrive at the solution."
Lv7-7x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down and apply each clue step by step.


1. The police-officer is between the owner of the rabbit and the person driving the taxi.
2. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the van.
3. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
4. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
5. The person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the australian.
6. The architect is on the left or right of the fan of r&b.
7. The person driving the van is on the left of the owner of the pony.
8. The spanish is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
9. The japanese is not the person driving the roller.
10. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess.
11. The person driving the roller is not the turkish.
12. The fan of dubstep is not the person who's hobby is hiking.
13. The paramedic is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography.
14. The japanese is the owner of the pony.
15. The fan of punk is somewhere between the person drinking sprite and the japanese.
16. The spanish is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance.
17. The person drinking sprite is the fan of r&b.
18. The spanish is not the fan of trance.
19. The person who's hobby is hiking is the person drinking sprite.
20. The owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the paramedic.
21. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk.
22. The person driving the taxi is the turkish.

Let's deduce from these clues:

- From clue 17 and 19, the person who's hobby is hiking drinks sprite and is a fan of r&b.
- Clue 15 indicates the fan of punk is between the person drinking sprite (hiking, r&b) and the japanese. Given the Japanese owns a pony (clue 14), this suggests an order but doesn't specify positions yet.
- The spanish is to the right of the hiking person (clue 8) since they are to the right of the fan of trance (clue 16) and not the fan themselves (clue 18).
- Clue 22 states the turkish drives a taxi, which with clue 1 means the police-officer is between the rabbit owner and the turkish taxi driver.
- The person drinking mirinda is to the left of the milk drinker (clue 21), and since the board-games hobbyist is to the left of the Australian (clue 5), this gives us some positioning clues but not enough for direct placement yet.

Now, let's start building the table based on these deductions:


Given clue 14 (Japanese owns a pony) and clue 7 (van driver is to the left of the pony owner), we can start with:
- Japanese (pony) at position 4 because if they were at 1, 2, or 3, there wouldn't be enough space for all other required positions to the left or right as specified by various clues.

With clue 17 and 19, the person drinking sprite (hiking, r&b) must be at either position 1 or 2 because they need to be to the left of the Japanese for the punk fan to fit between them (clue 15). However, since the spanish is to their right (clue 8), and considering other clues about positioning relative to nationalities and hobbies, we have to carefully place them.

Clue 1 indicates the police-officer is between the rabbit owner and the turkish taxi driver. Given clue 22, this means the turkish must be at position 2 or 3 if we consider the police-officer's possible positions.


Let's attempt a more detailed placement considering all clues:


- Since the person drinking sprite (r&b, hiking) is likely at position 1 (to satisfy being to the left of the punk fan and the Japanese pony owner), this means:
  - Position 1: Sprite (R&b, Hiking)
- The spanish must be after the hiking person but before or at the Japanese pony owner. However, since the fan of punk is between sprite and Japanese, and considering the Spanish cannot be the fan of trance and must be to their right:
  - This implies an order for nationality and music genre that's tricky without direct hobby and job assignments.
- Clue 21 (mirinda to the left of milk) and clue 5 (board-games to the left of Australian) give us relative positions but not enough for direct placement yet.
- Given clue 9 (Japanese is not driving a roller), clue 11 (roller driver is not Turkish), and other clues about transport, we can infer some transport assignments.

Lv7-7x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step, filling in the information as we go.


From clue 4 and 1, we know the person whose sport is cycling is the fan of soul and owns a fish.


Clue 8 tells us the fan of funk is the coach. Clue 2 indicates the owner of the ferret is between the fan of funk and the fan of soul.


Given clue 7 (the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of soul) and clue 4 (the person whose sport is cycling is the fan of soul), we can start building a sequence: d&b, ?, soul.


Clue 20 states the fan of salsa is between the person whose sport is cycling and the fan of funk. Since the fan of funk is the coach (clue 8) and the person whose sport is cycling is the fan of soul (clue 4), we have: funk, salsa, soul.


Given clue 18, the indian is the fan of salsa, which means the sequence so far for music-genre is: d&b, funk, salsa, soul.


Clue 16 tells us the person whose sport is cycling is on the right of the malaysian. Clue 14 states the turkish is on the left of the person whose sport is surfing.


From clue 17, the indian is on the left or right of the turkish, and since the indian is the fan of salsa (clue 18), we can start placing nationalities relative to each other.


Clue 10 says the owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the coach. Since the person whose sport is cycling owns a fish (clue 1) and is also the fan of soul, this means the coach (fan of funk) cannot be in position 1.


Considering clue 3 and clue 9, the airplane driver must be near the coach but on the left or right of the frog owner. Clue 13 places the airplane driver to the right of the frog owner.


Clue 5 indicates the videographer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Clue 21 tells us the person drinking water is to the right of the tram driver.


Given clue 19, the trike driver is to the left of the videographer. Clue 6 says the milk drinker is not the coach, and clue 11 places the engineer to the left of the coffee drinker.


Clue 12 states the social-worker is not the person whose sport is cycling (who is also the fan of soul). Clue 15 indicates the 7up drinker is to the right of the indian.


From clue 2, knowing the ferret owner's position relative to funk and soul, we can deduce more about the pet column.


Given all these clues, let's try to piece together a possible arrangement that satisfies all conditions:

14. The social-worker is the fan of house.
15. The person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
16. The owner of the pony is the person watching superhero movies.
17. The person driving the bus is on the left of the fan of gospel.
18. The person eating lettuce is not the person who's sport is cycling.
19. The person watching thriller movies is not the person who's sport is cycling.
20. The person eating pear is in an odd position.
21. The dressmaker is somewhere to the left of the lawyer.
22. The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
23. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the lawyer.


From clue 14, we know the social-worker is the fan of house, and from clue 9, this person drives a van.


Clue 20 tells us that the person eating pear is in an odd position, which means they could be in positions 1 or 3.


Let's start filling in some information based on these clues and see if we can deduce more:


Given the constraints, let's consider where each piece of information might fit, starting with the most restrictive clues.


Since the person eating pear is in an odd position (clue 20), and considering clue 7 (the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person eating pear), if pear is in position 1, climbing must be in a position that doesn't exist to its left, so pear cannot be in position 1. Thus, pear must be in position 3.


Now, let's apply more clues step by step:


- The fan of house (social-worker) drives a van (clue 9 and 14). Given the fan of house is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing (clue 12), and if we consider pear (and thus climbing) in position 3, house could potentially fit into position 1 or 2 to satisfy this condition.


- Since the person eating apricot is between the person watching martial-arts movies and the fan of salsa (clue 10), and given other constraints about positions relative to each other, we have to carefully place these items while considering all other clues.


Given the complexity, let's directly apply what we can deduce with certainty:


1. The social-worker is a fan of house and drives a van (from clue 14 and 9).
2. The person watching superhero movies owns a pony (clue 16).


Let's make an educated guess on the arrangement based on these clues, keeping in mind that without directly applying each clue sequentially due to the complexity and interconnectivity of the information, we might need to adjust as we fill in more details.


Given this, let's attempt a solution table based on deductions:

Please note, this solution is an attempt based on the information provided and might require further adjustments based on a detailed, step-by-step application of each clue. The puzzle's complexity necessitates careful consideration of how each clue interacts with others."
Lv7-7x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to narrow down the possibilities.


Given:
- The 4 different types of food: asparagus, corn, nectarine, strawberry
- The people have 4 different hobbies: cooking, dancing, drawing, writing
- The people have 4 different jobs: designer, electrician, fisherman, nurse
- The people prefer 4 different movie-genres: epic, romance, satire, superhero
- The people prefer 4 different music-genres: country, gospel, punk, trance
- There are 4 different nationalities: Brazilian, Indonesian, Pakistani, Spanish
- 4 different pets are kept: goat, hedgehog, mouse, rat

Clues:
1. The person watching superhero movies is the owner of the hedgehog.
2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right.
3. The fan of punk is in an odd position.
4. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.
5. The owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies.
6. The Indonesian is somewhere between the person eating strawberry and the person who's hobby is cooking.
7. The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the left of the fisherman.
8. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
9. The Pakistani is on the far left.
10. The Brazilian is not the person eating corn.
11. The designer is not the person who's hobby is dancing.
12. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the Spanish.
13. The fisherman is the person who's hobby is writing.
14. The fan of country is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus.
15. The electrician is on the right of the Pakistani.
16. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the Brazilian.
17. The person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus.
18. The nurse is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
19. The fan of trance is on the right of the person watching satire movies.
20. The fan of punk is on the left of the fan of trance.
21. The fisherman is on the far left or far right.
22. The person watching epic movies is the electrician.

From clue 9, we start with:
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani |             |           |           |

Clue 15 places the electrician to the right of the Pakistani. Since clue 22 states the person watching epic movies is the electrician, and from clue 8, the owner of the hedgehog must be next to the person watching epic movies, we can start building a partial table.

Given the constraints about positions (especially clues 2 and 21), let's try placing key elements:

- The fisherman (who writes) could be on either end. Given clue 13, if the fisherman is on the far right, it conflicts with having the person eating asparagus to their left (clue 7). So, let's tentatively place the fisherman on the far left, but we must remember the Pakistani is already there according to clue 9.

|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani |             |           |           |
| Job           |            |             |           | Fisherman |

However, this initial placement seems to conflict with other clues when trying to apply them directly. Let's correct the approach based on clue 9 and subsequent clues that give more direct placements.

Correct Approach:

1. From clue 9, the Pakistani is on the far left.
2. Clue 15 places the electrician after the Pakistani.
3. Since the electrician watches epic movies (clue 22), and must be next to the hedgehog owner (clue 8), we place them accordingly.

Considering the constraints about jobs, hobbies, and preferences, let's apply clues systematically:

- The fisherman is on the far left or far right (clue 21) but since the Pakistani is on the far left (clue 9), the fisherman must be on the far right if we consider a direct placement based on initial clues. However, this seems to conflict with our need to place the electrician after the Pakistani and other constraints.

Re-evaluating for accurate placement:
- Clue 1: Superhero movies are watched by the hedgehog owner.
- Clue 8: The hedgehog owner is next to the epic movie watcher (electrician).
- Given these, if we start with the Pakistani on the left (clue 9), followed by the electrician (who watches epic movies and thus must be next to the hedgehog owner), we need to carefully place other elements.

Considering all clues, especially about nationalities, jobs, and pets:
- The Indonesian is between strawberry and cooking (clue 6).
- Brazilian isn't eating corn (clue 10).
- Designer isn't dancing (clue 11).

Let's try a systematic approach with key elements first:

1. Pakistani on the far left.
2. Electrician after Pakistani, watching epic movies.
3. Hedgehog owner next to electrician, watching superhero movies.

However, direct application of clues without considering all interactions leads to potential conflicts. Let's resolve by applying all constraints systematically:

Given:
- The person eating asparagus is to the left of the fisherman (clue 7).
- Fisherman writes and could be on either end but must fit with other placements.
- Owner of rat to the left of fisherman (clue 4) and to the left of Brazilian (clue 16).

Direct Placements:
1. Pakistani (Nationality)
2. Electrician (Job, watches epic movies)
3. Hedgehog owner (Pet, watches superhero movies)

To fit all clues without direct conflicts:
- Clue 21 suggests fisherman on far left or right, but with Pakistani on the far left, and considering other placements, we need to adjust our understanding based on all given information.

Final Adjustments:
Given the complexity and potential for error in sequential logic without visual aids, let's synthesize key points for a solution:

1. **Nationality**: Start with Pakistani.
2. **Job**: Electrician after Pakistani.
3. **Movie-Genre**: Epic (electrician), Superhero (hedgehog owner).
4. **Pets**: Hedgehog next to electrician.

Considering all clues, especially about positions and relationships between elements:
- The solution requires careful placement of each category (nationality, job, movie-genre, pets, etc.) while adhering to all given constraints.

For a precise table without speculative placements:
|               |     1      |      2      |     3     |     4     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani | Indonesian | Brazilian |           |
| Job           |            | Electrician|           | Fisherman |
| Movie-Genre   |            | Epic       | Superhero | Satire    |
| Pets          |            | Hedgehog   | Rat       |           |

This table represents a synthesis of clues but may not perfectly align with every constraint without further clarification or adjustment. The precise placement requires ensuring each clue is respected, which can be complex given the interrelated nature of the information.

Given the constraints and aiming for accuracy within the format provided:
```python
# Example Python code to represent the table
class Person:
    def __init__(self, nationality, job, movie_genre, pet):
        self.nationality = nationality
        self.job = job
        self.movie_genre = movie_genre
        self.pet = pet

people = [
    Person(""Pakistani"", """", """", """"),
    Person(""Indonesian"", ""Electrician"", ""Epic"", ""Hedgehog""),
    Person(""Brazilian"", """", ""Superhero"", ""Rat""),
    Person("""", ""Fisherman"", ""Satire"", """")
]

for i, person in enumerate(people):
    print(f""Person {i+1}:"")
    print(f""Nationality: {person.nationality}"")
    print(f""Job: {person.job}"")
    print(f""Movie Genre: {person.movie_genre}"")
    print(f""Pet: {person.pet}"")
    print(""-----"")
```

However, the above code and table are simplified representations. The actual solution would require a detailed, step-by-step application of each clue to ensure all constraints are met accurately.

The Final Answer is not straightforward without visually arranging all clues in a systematic manner that respects every given constraint. This response outlines an approach but acknowledges the complexity and potential for errors in sequential logic application without visual aids or a more comprehensive algorithmic approach."
