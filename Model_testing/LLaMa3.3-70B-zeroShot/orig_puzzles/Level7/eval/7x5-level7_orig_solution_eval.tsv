Lv7-7x5-9	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the steps and clues provided to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 9
The person watching disaster movies is on the far left. This means the first column is for the person who watches disaster movies.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 13
The Japanese is the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is on the far left, and given other constraints about positions relative to each other, we start building the table with this information.


## Step 3: Use Clue 25
The Egyptian is on the right of the Japanese. This helps in placing the Egyptian relative to the Japanese.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 11
The Chinese is in the middle. This clue helps us place the Chinese in the third position.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 17
The person driving the van is the person eating apple. This gives us a direct association between a mode of transport and a type of food.


## Step 6: Use Clue 1
The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person eating onion and the person eating apple. Given that we have some fixed positions, this helps in narrowing down where the subway driver can be.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 20
The person driving the subway is in an odd position. This means the subway driver can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 24
The person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle. Since the Chinese is also in the middle (position 3), this means the person with the hobby of skydiving and the Chinese are the same person.


## Step 9: Use Remaining Clues to Fill Gaps
With the information from the clues about relative positions, hobbies, jobs, movie genres, nationalities, sports, and transports, we start filling in the gaps. The process involves trial and error, ensuring that all conditions are met.
