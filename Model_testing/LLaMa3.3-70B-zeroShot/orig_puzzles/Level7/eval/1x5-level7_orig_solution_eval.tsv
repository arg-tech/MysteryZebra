Lv7-1x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person driving the quad-bike is in the middle: This means the quad-bike is at position 3.


|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
| Transport   |      |      | quad-bike |      |         |


2. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person driving the taxi: This clue doesn't specify exact positions yet, but it tells us the order.


3. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike: This means the jet-ski can only be at position 4 or 5 if the bike is at a position to its left.


4. The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the quad-bike: Given the quad-bike is at position 3, this means the taxi must be at either position 2 (if the ship is at position 1) or it can't fit if we consider other positions for the ship that would satisfy clue 2.


5. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship: This clue helps us place the bike and ship relative to each other but not their exact positions yet.


From clues 2, 4, and 5, a possible arrangement starts to emerge:


- Ship must be before Taxi (clue 2).
- Quad-bike is in the middle (clue 1), so it's at position 3.
- Taxi can't be after quad-bike because then there wouldn't be space for both ship and taxi with quad-bike in the middle, considering clue 4. Thus, a possible sequence is Ship-Taxi-Quad-bike.


Given this and that bike must be to the right of ship (clue 5), and jet-ski to the right of bike (clue 3), we have:


Ship at position 1 (since it has to be on the left of taxi, and there's no room for it to be after the quad-bike without violating other clues).
Taxi then must be at position 2 because it's between ship and quad-bike.
Quad-bike is already placed at position 3.


This leaves us with bike and jet-ski. Since bike must be to the right of ship (and taxi), and jet-ski to the right of bike, they can only fit in positions 4 and 5 respectively.


So, we get:


|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |
| Transport   | ship | taxi | quad-bike | bike | jet-ski |


Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############
|             |  1   |  2   |     3     |  4   |    5    |

Lv7-1x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
2. This statement seems to be a repetition or correction of the first one but specifies that tennis and weightlifting are next to each other.
3. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby.
4. The person who's sport is rugby is in an even position.
5. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the person who's sport is tennis and the person who's sport is golf.
6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is tennis.


From statement 4, we know rugby must be in either position 2 or 4 since those are the even positions available.


Given statement 5, and knowing rugby is in an even position, let's place rugby in position 4 for now, as it gives us more flexibility to arrange the other sports around it without violating any rules. If we place rugby in position 2, it would be difficult to satisfy all conditions, especially with tennis needing to be on one side of weightlifting and rugby being between tennis and golf.


With rugby in position 4:


- Statement 5 (rugby is between tennis and golf) suggests that tennis could be in position 1, 2, or 3, but since rugby must be between tennis and golf, and considering the restrictions on weightlifting's position relative to tennis, let's explore placing tennis and weightlifting around rugby.


Considering statement 6 (weightlifting is between rugby and tennis), if we place tennis in position 1, it satisfies the condition that tennis is to the left of weightlifting. Weightlifting could then be in position 3, satisfying several conditions at once.


Now, let's fill out the table based on these deductions:


|         |   1    |       2       |    3    |   4   |  5   |
| Sport   | Tennis | Cycling/Golf |Weightlifting| Rugby | Golf/Cycling |


Given that cycling must be next to rugby (statement 3), and rugby is in position 4, cycling should be in either position 3 or 5. However, since weightlifting needs to be between rugby and tennis, and we've placed weightlifting in position 3, cycling can't be there. Thus, cycling must be in position 5.


The only spot left for golf, considering rugby is between tennis and golf (statement 5), is position 2, as all other positions are either taken or would violate the given conditions.


Therefore, the arrangement that satisfies all conditions is:

Lv7-1x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


## Step 1: Place the jet-ski
From clue 4, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left. So, the table now looks like this:

|             |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |  5  |
| Transport   | jet-ski |      |       |      |     |

## Step 2: Place the boat
From clue 1, we know the person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the boat can be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. However, since clue 2 doesn't provide new information (it's a repetition), we move to other clues for more specific placements.


## Step 3: Place the taxi and car relative to each other
From clue 5, we know the person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the taxi. This means the taxi must be to the left of the car, but their exact positions are not yet determined.


## Step 4: Use clue 3 to further refine the taxi's position relative to the train
Clue 3 states the person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the train. However, since we know from clue 5 that the car is to the right of the taxi, this implies the train must be to the left of the taxi (because the taxi has to be between the car and the train). This creates a sequence: train, taxi, car.


## Step 5: Combine all information
Given the jet-ski is on the far left (position 1), and knowing the boat must be to the right of the jet-ski but not necessarily directly next to it, we start building our sequence. The sequence from clue 3 and step 4 (train, taxi, car) needs to fit into positions 2 through 5, with the boat also needing to be placed.


## Step 6: Final placement
Since the jet-ski is in position 1, and considering all other clues:
- The train can't be in position 1 (jet-ski's place), so it could start from position 2. But since the taxi must be between the train and the car, and the boat needs to be on the right of the jet-ski, a possible arrangement starts to form.
- Given the constraints, one feasible order that respects all conditions is: jet-ski, train, taxi, car, boat. This order places the boat on the right of the jet-ski (though not directly next to it), puts the taxi between the train and the car, and has the car to the right of the taxi.


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv7-1x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step based on the given clues.


1. The dressmaker is between the paramedic and the manager.
2. The manager is to the left of the bartender.
3. The paramedic is to the left of the dressmaker.
4. The bartender is to the right of the paramedic.
5. The teacher is on the far right.


From clue 3, we know the order for two jobs: Paramedic -> Dressmaker.

Clue 1 tells us that the manager must also be in this sequence but does not specify the exact position relative to both the paramedic and the dressmaker. However, since the paramedic must be to the left of the dressmaker (clue 3), and considering clue 1, we can deduce a possible order: Paramedic -> Dressmaker -> Manager or Paramedic -> Manager -> Dressmaker.

Clue 2 states that the manager is to the left of the bartender, which means the sequence must be: Paramedic -> [either Manager then Dressmaker or Dressmaker then Manager] -> Bartender.

Given clue 4 (the bartender is to the right of the paramedic), we know the bartender cannot be in positions 1, 2, or 3. This supports our deduction that the bartender follows after the sequence involving the paramedic, dressmaker, and manager.

Clue 5 places the teacher at the far right, which means position 5 must be the teacher.


Now, let's try to fit all these pieces together:


- The paramedic cannot be in position 5 (teacher is there) or likely position 4 because then the bartender wouldn't have space to be after the paramedic without violating other conditions.
- Since the dressmaker is between the paramedic and manager (clue 1), and considering clue 3, a possible sequence starting from the left could be: Paramedic -> Manager -> Dressmaker or Paramedic -> Dressmaker -> Manager. But given that the bartender must follow the paramedic at some point and before the teacher, we can start building our table.


Given all clues:


1. The only configuration that fits is starting with the Paramedic on the left since it has to be before both the dressmaker (clue 3) and the bartender (clue 4), and considering clue 2 which requires the manager to be before the bartender, we can start placing jobs.


Let's consider positions:


- The teacher must be in position 5.
- If the paramedic is in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of the dressmaker and allowing space for other configurations), it gives us room to maneuver.
- The manager then could follow, but considering all clues about positioning relative to others, a direct sequence that respects all given conditions needs careful placement.


Considering clue 2 (manager is to the left of the bartender) and clue 4 (bartender to the right of the paramedic), with clue 3 (paramedic to the left of the dressmaker), we need to fit these around each other while respecting clue 1's requirement that the dressmaker is between the paramedic and manager.


Given the conditions:


- Paramedic cannot be after position 2 if we are to satisfy all conditions about relative positions.
- The sequence needs to allow for the bartender to follow after the paramedic, which means the paramedic must be early enough in the sequence.


The possible arrangement considering all clues would then need to fit within these constraints:


Paramedic (1), Manager (2), Dressmaker (3), Bartender (4), Teacher (5)


This fits because:
- The dressmaker is between the paramedic and manager.
- The manager is to the left of the bartender.
- The paramedic is to the left of the dressmaker.
- The bartender is to the right of the paramedic.
- The teacher is on the far right.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:


#############

1. The person who's hobby is card-games is between reading and filmmaking.
2. Reading is on the right of card-games.
3. Card-games is on the right of skydiving.
4. Skydiving is on the right of magic-tricks.
5. Filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks.

From clue 4, we know: magic-tricks -> skydiving
From clue 3, we know: skydiving -> card-games
From clue 2, we know: card-games -> reading
From clue 1, we know: filmmaking is to the left of card-games (since reading is to the right of card-games)

Now, let's combine all the information:
magic-tricks -> skydiving -> card-games -> reading
and filmmaking is to the left of card-games

So, the order is: filmmaking -> magic-tricks -> skydiving -> card-games -> reading

The only hobby left is magic-tricks, which should be in the second position.

Lv7-1x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the sports movie watcher on the far left
Given clue 2, the person watching sports movies is on the far left. So, our starting table looks like this:

|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |      4      |  5  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports |         |        |             |     |

## Step 2: Determine the position of horror movies
From clue 1, we know the person watching documentary movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies. Clue 3 states that the person watching horror movies is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching documentary movies. This means horror cannot be in position 1 (since sports is there) or 5 (because then documentary would have to be to its right, which is not possible since there are no more positions to the right). Also, considering clue 3, if horror were in position 2, romance would have to be in either position 1 (which is taken by sports) or a position further to the left of horror, which isn't possible. Thus, horror can only fit into position 2, 3, or 4.


## Step 3: Place horror movies
Given that horror must be between romance and documentary and considering the placement of sports in step 1, let's tentatively place horror in position 2 for now to see if it fits with other clues:

|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |      4      |  5  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Horror  |        |             |     |

However, this placement needs further consideration based on subsequent clues.


## Step 4: Determine the position of romance movies
Since horror is between romance and documentary (clue 3), and if we temporarily place horror in position 2 as a starting point, romance would have to be in position 1 or to the left of horror. But since sports is already in position 1, this initial placement of horror in step 3 may not hold under all conditions. Let's reconsider: If horror were in position 3, then romance could potentially be in position 2 (to satisfy being on one side of horror), and documentary to its right, satisfying clue 1.


## Step 5: Adjust placements based on further analysis
Placing horror in position 3 seems more promising because it allows for the necessary arrangements around it. Thus:

|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |      4      |  5  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Romance | Horror |             |     |

This setup satisfies clue 3, with horror between romance and (a future placement for) documentary.


## Step 6: Place the documentary movie watcher
From clue 1, documentary must be to the right of horror. With horror in position 3, this means documentary can only go in positions 4 or 5:


|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |      4      |  5  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Romance | Horror | Documentary |     |

This arrangement satisfies clues 1 and 3.


## Step 7: Place the spy movie watcher
Clue 4 states that the person watching spy movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Given our current table, this means spy can only fit into position 5:


|               |   1    |    2    |   3    |      4      |  5  |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Romance | Horror | Documentary | Spy |

This satisfies all given conditions.


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv7-1x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 6
Given that the person watching sports movies is in an odd position (Clue 4) and on the left of the person watching family movies (Clue 6), possible positions for sports are 1, 3, or 5. Since sports must be to the left of family, if sports were in position 5, family would have to be in a non-existent position 6. Thus, sports can only be in positions 1 or 3.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies (Clue 5). This clue, combined with Clue 1, which states that the person watching romance movies is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies, indicates that romance must be to the right of martial-arts because if it were to the left, it would contradict Clue 5.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 3
The person watching comedy movies is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching family movies (Clue 2), and the person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching romance movies (Clue 3). This creates a sequence where martial-arts, comedy, and then romance must appear in that order because comedy acts as a buffer between romance and family, and martial-arts acts as a buffer between comedy and romance.


## Step 4: Combine All Information
Given that sports is in an odd position (1 or 3) and to the left of family, and knowing the sequence for martial-arts, comedy, and romance, we can start building the table. If sports were in position 1, it would leave no room for the martial-arts, comedy, romance sequence to fit with family at the end, given that comedy must be between romance and family. Therefore, sports must be in position 3.


## Step 5: Finalize Positions
With sports in position 3, family cannot be next to sports as per Clue 6 (since sports is on the left of family), which means family must be after the sequence involving martial-arts, comedy, and romance. Given that martial-arts, comedy, and romance must appear in that order, and considering all other clues:


- Sports is in position 3.
- Martial-arts, comedy, and romance must follow in that order after sports because romance has to be to the right of martial-arts (Clue 5), and comedy acts as a buffer between romance and family (Clue 2).
- The only remaining genre for position 1 is family or one of the genres not yet placed. However, since family must come after sports according to Clue 6, and considering the need for martial-arts to be between comedy and romance while also respecting that romance is to the right of martial-arts, we find a potential conflict in initial reasoning regarding the placement based on clues alone without visual aid.


## Step 6: Correcting Approach Based on Clues
Given the constraints:
- Sports must be odd (1, 3, or 5) and left of family.
- Martial-arts, comedy, romance sequence with martial-arts before romance.
- Comedy between romance and family.

A correct approach should directly apply these rules to find a fitting order that respects all given conditions without overcomplicating the sequence.


## Step 7: Final Placement
Considering sports in position 1 (as it's an odd position and allows for more flexibility with the remaining clues):
1. Sports
2. Martial-arts (since martial-arts needs to be before comedy, which is before romance)
3. Comedy
4. Romance
5. Family

This order respects all conditions: sports is in an odd position and to the left of family, martial-arts is before comedy, which is before romance, and comedy acts as a buffer between romance and family.

1. The person drinking sprite is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking sprite.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking soy-milk.
4. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.


From clue 4, we know mirinda is to the left of almond-milk.


Clue 3 tells us almond-milk is between mirinda and soy-milk, so we have: mirinda -> almond-milk -> soy-milk.


Clue 2 indicates soy-milk is between mirinda and sprite, which fits with our current sequence but also allows for the possibility of mirinda -> soy-milk -> sprite or any other order as long as soy-milk is between mirinda and sprite. However, since we've established that almond-milk is between mirinda and soy-milk, the correct sequence so far considering all clues must be: mirinda -> almond-milk -> soy-milk -> sprite.


Clue 1 tells us sprite is between mirinda and iced-tea. Given our current order (mirinda -> almond-milk -> soy-milk -> sprite), for sprite to be between mirinda and iced-tea, iced-tea must be at the end.


So, we have the sequence: mirinda, almond-milk, soy-milk, sprite, iced-tea.


Given this analysis, the solution table would look like this:

Lv7-1x5-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The person who prefers lacrosse is to the right of the person who prefers ice-hockey.
2. Snowboarding is between golf and skiing.
3. This statement seems redundant or possibly misprinted as it repeats itself without adding new information.
4. Snowboarding is to the right of skiing.
5. Snowboarding is to the right of lacrosse.
6. Skiing is to the left of golf.

From statement 2 and 4, we can deduce that the order for three of the sports is: Skiing, Snowboarding, Golf (since snowboarding must be between skiing and golf and also to the right of skiing).

Statement 1 tells us lacrosse is to the right of ice-hockey, but doesn't give us their exact positions relative to the others yet.

Statement 5 tells us that snowboarding is to the right of lacrosse. Since we know from statement 4 that snowboarding must be to the right of skiing and between golf and skiing (with golf being on the far right among these three), lacrosse cannot be in position 5 because snowboarding needs to be after it, and there's not enough space for both ice-hockey and lacrosse before skiing if we consider the constraints given by statements 2, 4, and 6.

Given statement 6 (skiing is to the left of golf), and combining all other information:


- We have Skiing and then Snowboarding because snowboarding must be after skiing.
- Golf must come after snowboarding based on statement 2 and the deduction that snowboarding is between skiing and golf, with the clarification from statement 4.
- Lacrosse must be before snowboarding (because snowboarding is to the right of lacrosse), but since we have a sequence for three sports (Skiing, Snowboarding, Golf) based on statements 2, 4, and 6, lacrosse has to fit in such a way that it respects its position relative to ice-hockey as well.
- Ice-hockey must be before lacrosse.

Considering the positions and trying to fit all pieces:


1. The only position left for ice-hockey that allows lacrosse to be after it but still before snowboarding (since snowboarding has to be after skiing) is if ice-hockey takes the first spot, followed by lacrosse.
2. Then comes Skiing because it needs to be before golf and we have determined that snowboarding follows skiing.
3. Snowboarding then follows, as it must be between skiing and golf and also after lacrosse.
4. Golf is last since it has to come after snowboarding.

Thus, the table should look like this:

Lv7-1x5-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the steps and clues given:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the chinchilla's owner
The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle, which means they are in position 3.


## Step 2: Place the horse and dog owners relative to each other
The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the dog. This gives us a sequence of Horse -> Dog, but we don't know where this sequence starts or ends yet.


## Step 3: Position the snake owner relative to the horse and guinea-pig owners
The owner of the snake is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the owner of the guinea-pig. This means we have a sequence of Horse -> Snake -> Guinea-pig, but again, the exact positions are not yet determined.


## Step 4: Combine all information to find possible arrangements
From step 1, we know the chinchilla's owner is in position 3. Combining this with the sequences from steps 2 and 3, and knowing that the guinea-pig's owner is to the right of the snake's owner, we can start building a complete picture.


## Step 5: Apply the clues to find the exact arrangement
Given the chinchilla is in position 3, and considering the sequences:
- Horse must be before Dog (from clue 1),
- Snake between Horse and Guinea-pig (from clue 2),
- Guinea-pig to the right of Snake (from clue 4),
we can try fitting these into our table.


Since the chinchilla's owner is in the middle (position 3), we have two main sections to fill: positions 1, 2, and positions 4, 5. The sequence must respect all given clues.


Given that Horse is before Dog and Snake is between Horse and Guinea-pig, a possible arrangement could be:
- Horse in position 1 (to satisfy being on the left of Dog),
- Snake in position 2 (between Horse and Guinea-pig),
- Chinchilla in position 3 (as per clue 3),
- Dog in position 4 (since Horse is before Dog, and we've placed Horse and Snake already),
- Guinea-pig in position 5 (to the right of Snake).


This satisfies all clues:
1. Horse is on the left of Dog.
2. Snake is between Horse and Guinea-pig.
3. Chinchilla's owner is in the middle.
4. Guinea-pig's owner is to the right of Snake.
