Note: The solution was obtained by applying the given constraints one by one and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the constraints were used:

* Constraint 20 states that the person who's hobby is photography is the pilot, so we can fill in ""photography"" as the hobby for the pilot (person 1).
* Constraint 18 states that the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the pilot, so the goldfish must be in position 2 or later. Since constraint 10 also states that the owner of the goldfish is in an even position, we can conclude that the goldfish is in position 2.
* Constraint 5 states that the owner of the bird is somewhere to the left or right of the owner of the goldfish, and since the bird cannot be to the right of the fish (constraint 2), it must be to the left. Therefore, the bird is in position 1.
* Constraint 24 states that the owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the videographer, which means the videographer cannot be in position 1. Since constraint 16 also states that the videographer is on the far left or far right, we can conclude that the videographer is in position 7.
* Constraint 13 states that the accountant is on the left or right of the videographer, but since the accountant cannot be in position 7 (already occupied by the videographer), it must be in position 4 (to the left of the videographer would put it out of range).
* And so on... 

Using these constraints and applying them one by one, we can eventually fill in the entire table."	{'hobby': ['photography', 'baking', 'sudoku', 'traveling', 'camping', 'woodworking', 'singing'], 'job': ['pilot', 'software-developer', 'coach', 'accountant', 'firefighter', 'architect', 'videographer'], 'pet': ['bird', 'goldfish', 'snake', 'fish', 'rat', 'hamster', 'pony']}	True	9	False
Lv7-3x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the steps and clues provided.


Given:
- 7 hobbies: camping, collecting, dancing, fishing, photography, rock-climbing, writing
- 7 music genres: disco, funk, jazz, punk, r&b, rock, techno
- 7 nationalities: argentine, brazilian, canadian, colombian, indonesian, russian, spanish

## Step 1: Analyze Clue 21 and 3 to start placing hobbies and nationalities.
From clue 21, writing is in an odd position. Since the Brazilian's hobby is writing (clue 3), the Brazilian must be in one of the odd positions (1, 3, 5, or 7).

## Step 2: Use Clue 8 to place the Indonesian and punk music.
The fan of punk is the Indonesian. Given that punk is in the middle (clue 15), the Indonesian must be in position 4.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 16 to further restrict positions.
The Indonesian is between the fan of funk and the person who's hobby is writing. Since the Brazilian writes and is in an odd position, and considering the Indonesian's fixed position at 4, the Brazilian could either be at position 1 or 3 if we are to satisfy clue 16 and have the fan of funk also placed according to clue 14 (in an even position).

## Step 4: Place the Spanish using Clue 2.
The Spanish is between the rock-climbing hobbyist and the Russian. This clue, combined with clue 19 (photography is the Spanish), starts to give us a clearer picture of possible arrangements.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 13 for further restriction on nationalities.
The Spanish is on the left or right of the Colombian. This, along with previous clues, helps in narrowing down positions for these nationalities and their respective hobbies and music genres.

## Step 6: Utilize Clues 4, 17, and 20 to place camping, jazz, and the Canadian.
Camping is to the right of photography (clue 4), the camper likes jazz (clue 17), and jazz is to the right of the Canadian (clue 20). This sequence helps in further defining the arrangement.

## Step 7: Piece together remaining clues for a complete picture.
- Clue 10 places disco to the right of collecting.
- Clue 5 indicates the Canadian does not like disco, helping to place the Canadian and subsequently the jazz fan.
- Clue 6 has techno to the right of funk, further restricting music genre placements.

## Step 8: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Considering all restrictions:
1. The Brazilian must be at position 3 (writing, odd position).
2. The Indonesian is at position 4 (punk fan, between funk and writing).
3. Given the Spanish's hobby is photography and must be near rock-climbing and the Russian, and considering other placements, we start to see a pattern emerge.
4. The Argentine being to the left of punk (clue 9) places them at position 1 or 3, but since the Brazilian is at 3, the Argentine could fit at 1.
5. With funk in an even position (clue 14), and techno to its right (clue 6), we can start placing music genres more securely.

## Step 9: Apply remaining clues for precise placement.
- The fan of disco is on the right of collecting (clue 10) and left of r&b (clue 23).
- Dancing is to the right of writing (clue 18), which could place dancing at position 5, given writing is at 3.

The final answer is:

Lv7-3x7-4	"To solve this logic puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


Given the complexity and the number of clues, let's break down the key information first:


1. **Movie-Genres**: action, crime, mystery, romance, spy, western, zombie
2. **Pets**: fish, guinea-pig, hamster, hedgehog, mouse, snake, turtle
3. **Sports**: cycling, ice-hockey, sailing, skiing, soccer, surfing, weightlifting


From clue 8, the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right.


From clue 9, the owner of the snake is the person who's sport is soccer.


Let's start with what we know for sure and build up:


- **Soccer/Snake**: Far left or far right (Clue 8 & 9)


Given that soccer must be on one end and considering all other clues about positions relative to each other, let's place soccer/snake at the beginning for now, as it gives us a fixed point to work with.


- **Surfing/Hamster**: Since surfing is the owner of the hamster (Clue 15) and action movies are watched by the owner of the hamster (Clue 2), we can link these together.


From clue 22, spy movies are watched by the person who's sport is skiing.


Let's place skiing/spy next to soccer for now as a starting point since we need to figure out how all these fit together with the other clues about relative positions.


Given the complexity and interlinking nature of these clues, let's fill in more based on direct associations:


- **Weightlifting** must be to the left of cycling (Clue 3) and also to the left of sailing (Clue 25).


Now, considering all pets and sports and their relative positions, we start filling in based on direct clues like the owner of the hamster being between crime movies and the turtle (Clue 7), and so forth.


However, without a step-by-step elimination process for each clue against every possible combination, it's challenging to directly fill in the table here. The key is to follow the chain of clues that provide direct links or exclusions.


Given this complexity and the instructions, let's summarize how we might approach filling out the table based on what we know:


1. Place soccer/snake at one end.
2. Link surfing/hamster with action movies.
3. Associate skiing with spy movies.
4. Position weightlifting relative to cycling and sailing.
5. Use clues about movie genres and pets to fill in the gaps.


Since providing a detailed, step-by-step solution for each clue in this format is impractical due to the sheer volume of information, let's consider how these pieces fit together based on direct associations and exclusions:


- Soccer at one end with snake.
- Surfing/hamster linked to action movies.
- Skiing/spy movies placement considering other sports and genres.


However, to directly solve this puzzle as requested without showing each intermediate step due to complexity, let's consider the final arrangement must satisfy all given conditions simultaneously.

Lv7-3x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the fan of techno and the person drinking iced-tea.
From clue 10, the fan of techno is on the far right, which means they are at position 7. Clue 6 tells us the person drinking iced-tea is also on the far right, but since the fan of techno is already placed there, we need to reconsider based on other clues that might override or clarify these positions.


## Step 2: Clarify the positions based on additional clues.
Clue 6 directly states the person drinking iced-tea is on the far right, which conflicts with our initial interpretation. Given clue 10 places techno on the far right and considering the rest of the clues, we prioritize clue 6 for iced-tea's position as it directly addresses a beverage's placement.


## Step 3: Place the fan of dubstep.
From clue 2, the fan of dubstep is between the Colombian and the Thai. Since we don't know their exact positions yet, we'll come back to this after placing other clues.


## Step 4: Position the Dutch and Thai.
Clue 4 states the Dutch is on the left or right of the Thai. Clue 3 also mentions the Thai is on the left or right of the fan of dubstep, creating a potential sequence but not definitive positions without further information.


## Step 5: Place the Japanese.
Clues 8 and 15 indicate the Japanese is in an odd position. This means they could be in positions 1, 3, 5, or 7, but since clue 17 states the Japanese is to the right of the fan of salsa and clue 25 mentions the Japanese is on the left or right of the Dutch, we need more information to pinpoint their exact location.


## Step 6: Position the Mexican and Colombian.
Clue 11 tells us the Colombian is on the right of the Mexican. Clue 24 indicates the Colombian is in an even position (2, 4, or 6), helping narrow down their possible placements.


## Step 7: Determine the music genre for the Mexican.
From clue 20, the Mexican is the fan of pop. Clue 14 states the person drinking tea is the fan of pop, which means the Mexican drinks tea.


## Step 8: Position the fan of punk and the person drinking cola.
Clue 26 tells us the fan of punk is to the right of the fan of pop (Mexican). Clue 16 places the fan of punk on the left of the person drinking cola, giving us a sequence but not exact positions.


## Step 9: Place the Egyptian.
Clue 22 states the Egyptian is on the right of the fan of punk. This clue helps in establishing a sequence but requires knowing the position of the fan of punk first.


## Step 10: Position the person drinking lemonade and their music preference.
Clue 13 places the person drinking lemonade between the Dutch and the fan of R&B. Clue 19 states lemonade is to the right of coffee, giving us relative positions but needing more information for exact placements.


## Step 11: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, we must ensure each clue is considered in the context of all others. However, without a step-by-step elimination process for each position and considering the interdependence of many clues, directly solving this puzzle requires making connections between various pieces of information that haven't been explicitly outlined in these steps.

Lv7-3x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as it becomes available.


Given:
- There are 7 different favourite beverages: almond-milk, cola, fanta, hot-chocolate, milk, soy-milk, sprite
- There are 7 different nationalities: brazilian, canadian, german, nigerian, polish, spanish
- The people prefer 7 different types of sport: baseball, climbing, lacrosse, parkour, rowing, rugby, skateboarding


Starting with the most direct clues:


1. Climbing is in an even position.
2. Rowing is not the Brazilian.
3. Baseball is to the left of the Brazilian.
4. Skateboarding is Spanish.
5. Rowing is between German and Fanta.
6. Parkour is in an odd position.
7. Cola is to the left of Skateboarding (Spanish).
8. Brazilian is in an odd position.
9. German is to the right of Almond-milk.
10. Spanish is to the right of Cola.
11. German drinks Hot-chocolate.
12. Lacrosse is to the left of Cola.
13. Sprite is not Lacrosse.
14. Canadian is to the right of Nigerian.
15. Fanta is to the left of Cola.
16. Spanish drinks Soy-milk.
17. Parkour is German.
18. Climbing is to the right of Brazilian.
19. Polish is to the right of German.
20. Cola is between German and Sprite.
21. Skateboarding is next to Milk.
22. Baseball is in the middle.


From clue 11, we know German drinks Hot-chocolate. Clue 3 tells us Baseball is to the left of Brazilian, and since Baseball is in the middle (clue 22), it must be position 4, making Brazilian in an odd position, which could be 1, 3, 5, or 7.


Given that Parkour is German (clue 17) and Parkour is in an odd position (clue 6), and considering the constraints about the positions of other activities and nationalities, we start building the table:


|               |    1     |      2      |       3       |    4     |     5     |     6     |       7       |
| Beverage      |          |             |               |          |           |           |               |
| Nationality   |          |             |               |          |           |           |               |
| Sport         |          |             |               |          |           |           |               |


Clue 4 says Skateboarding is Spanish, and clue 16 says Spanish drinks Soy-milk. Clue 21 indicates Skateboarding is next to Milk.


From clue 11, German drinks Hot-chocolate, and from clue 17, Parkour is German. Since Parkour must be in an odd position, it could fit into position 1 or 3, considering the constraints about even positions for other activities.


Given that Rowing is between German and Fanta (clue 5), and knowing German drinks Hot-chocolate, we have to place these accordingly, keeping in mind that Climbing is to the right of Brazilian (clue 18) and in an even position (clue 1).


Let's start filling the table with what we know for sure:


- Position 4 is Baseball (from clue 22).
- German drinks Hot-chocolate (clue 11), and since Parkour is German (clue 17) and in an odd position, let's place it in position 3 for now, which means Hot-chocolate must be in position 3 as well.


Now, considering the placement of Brazilian being in an odd position and to the left of Baseball or possibly at position 1 or 5:


If we consider clue 18 (Climbing is to the right of Brazilian) and that Climbing must be in an even position, this gives us a potential issue unless Brazilian is at position 1, making Climbing potentially at position 2 or another even position to its right but after other constraints are considered.


Given the complexity, let's simplify based on direct clues:


- Spanish drinks Soy-milk (clue 16) and is Skateboarding (clue 4).
- Cola is to the left of Spanish (clue 7), and Spanish is to the right of Cola (clue 10), indicating a sequence but requiring other positions to be filled for clarity.


Since Baseball is in position 4, and Brazilian must be in an odd position, let's tentatively place Brazilian at position 1 or 5. But considering all constraints, especially about even/odd positions and the relative placements of sports and beverages:


We know:
- German (Parkour) is at position 3 with Hot-chocolate.
- Baseball is at position 4.


Given the constraints about Rowing being between German and Fanta, and knowing German's position, we can infer more:


Let's finalize based on the most restrictive clues first and fill in as we go, considering all constraints might require trial and error to satisfy every condition.


However, due to the complexity and interdependence of the clues, directly solving this step-by-step without guessing requires a systematic approach that considers all possible placements according to the rules. Given the format and instructions, let's focus on key placements:


- German (Hot-chocolate, Parkour) at position 3.
- Baseball at position 4.


To fully solve this puzzle accurately within the given constraints and without violating any rules would typically require creating a system of equations or using a logic grid to systematically eliminate possibilities. The clues provided are extensive and interrelated, making it challenging to deduce the solution through a simple step-by-step analysis without such tools.


Given the complexity of directly solving the puzzle with the information provided in this format, let's clarify that the goal is to use each clue to narrow down possible arrangements until we find a configuration that satisfies all conditions. However, due to the instructions and the nature of this puzzle, providing a complete step-by-step logical deduction for every single placement without using a grid or systematic elimination process would be highly complex and prone to error.


The final solution, considering all clues and their implications on each other, requires meticulous attention to detail and a methodical approach to ensure accuracy. Given the constraints of this format, let's proceed to the arrangement that fits all given clues:

Lv7-3x7-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the teacher
From clue 4, the teacher is on the far left or far right. Clue 20 states the person eating lettuce is the teacher.


## Step 2: Establish the relationship between food and job
Since there are multiple clues linking specific foods to jobs or transport without direct assignment, we'll focus on key links: apricot with car (clue 1), peas not with musician (clue 5), papaya between teacher and artichoke (clue 6), and lettuce as the teacher's food (clue 20).


## Step 3: Use clue 2 to place the architect
The architect is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas.


## Step 4: Place the photographer and teacher
From clue 3, the photographer is to the left of the teacher. Clue 22 links the freelancer with the photographer.


## Step 5: Determine the position of the freelancer
Clue 12 states the freelancer is in the middle (position 4).


## Step 6: Link transport to food and job
From clue 8, the social-worker drives the scooter. Clue 16 separates artichoke from driving the scooter.


## Step 7: Apply remaining clues for precise placement
Clues 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, and 25 provide additional constraints but require iterative application with previous steps to avoid contradictions.


## Step 8: Finalize positions based on clues
Given the complexity, we deduce key positions:
- Teacher (lettuce) is at an end.
- Apricot (car) is in an odd position.
- Freelancer is in the middle.
- Social-worker (scooter) is to the left of pepper.
- Architect to the right of peas.


## Step 9: Construct the table
Given the clues, a direct construction requires combining all deductions. However, without iterative steps for each clue, we focus on key placements:
- Teacher (lettuce) at one end,
- Freelancer in the middle,
- Social-worker and scooter's relation to pepper,
- Apricot and car's odd position.

#############

Note: The solution is obtained by using the given clues and applying logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 3 states that the person watching satire movies is on the far left, so satire goes in position 1.
* Clue 14 states that the person watching western movies is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since filmmaking is not in position 1 (satire), and clue 21 states that filmmaking is on the left or right of cooking, we can place western and filmmaking in positions 2.
* Clue 16 states that almond-milk is in an even position, but since position 2 is already occupied by cola (due to clue 18), almond-milk goes in position 1 for beverage, with baking as the hobby (clue 20).
* Clue 5 states that 7up is in an odd position, and clue 22 states that filmmaking is not the person drinking 7up. This means 7up can go in position 3 or 5. However, clue 4 states that water is on the right of reading, so water must be in position 6 or 7 (since there needs to be at least one person between them). If we put 7up in position 3 and water in position 6, it leaves no space for soy-milk and martial-arts. Therefore, 7up goes in position 5.
* Clue 1 states that the person watching thriller movies is drinking milk. Since milk is not in position 1 (almond-milk) or 2 (cola), we can place thriller and milk in positions 6.
* Clue 12 states that iced-tea is between adventure and family, and clue 15 states that family is on the left of iced-tea. This means family must be in position 7, with iced-tea in a previous position (but not position 1, since satire is there). The only remaining spot for iced-tea is position 7.
* Clue 6 states that martial-arts is between soy-milk and water. Since water is already determined to be in position 6 or 7, and soy-milk can't be in position 7 (family is there), martial-arts must go in position 4.
* The remaining spots are filled with the remaining hobbies and genres.

Note: This explanation does not cover all the clues, but it should give a general idea of how the solution was obtained."	{'beverage': ['almond', 'cola', 'water', '7up', 'soy-milk', 'milk', 'iced-tea'], 'hobby': ['baking', 'filmmaking', 'reading', 'puzzles', 'writing', 'collecting', 'cooking'], 'movie-genre': ['satire', 'western', 'comedy', 'martial', 'thriller', 'adventure', 'family']}	True	7	False
Lv7-3x7-9	"To solve this logic puzzle, let's start by applying the most direct clues first and then build upon them.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 20
The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left (Position 1). From Clue 3, we know the person eating papaya is the person whose hobby is writing. So, Position 1 is Papaya - Writing.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 19
The fan of gospel is on the far left. However, since Position 1 is already occupied by the person eating papaya (whose hobby is writing), and considering the structure of the clues, we need to adjust our understanding based on subsequent clues that might clarify or contradict initial interpretations.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 11
The fan of reggae is the person eating apricot. This clue directly associates a music genre with a food but doesn't specify the position yet.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 1 and Clue 5
Given that the person eating lemon is between the person eating spinach and the fan of ambient, and knowing the fan of ambient is not the person eating lemon, we start to see a sequence but lack specific positions.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 13
The fan of metal is in an even position. This clue starts to give us some structure for placing music genres.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 18
The person eating cauliflower is in an odd position. This helps with food placement.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 17
The person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right (Position 7).


## Step 8: Synthesize Information
From Clues 20 and 3, Position 1 is Papaya - Writing.
From Clue 11, Apricot is associated with Reggae, but we need to find its position considering other clues.
Clue 4 indicates the fan of reggae is to the left of cauliflower, which is in an odd position (Clue 18).
Given that metal is in an even position (Clue 13) and to the left of soul (Clue 16), and considering all previous steps, we can start building a possible sequence.


## Step 9: Detailed Placement
1. Papaya - Writing - Gospel (Clues 20, 19, and associations)
2. Since Apricot is with Reggae and must be to the left of Cauliflower (which is odd), let's place it in an early position but after considering all constraints.
3. The fan of metal being even and to the left of soul helps narrow down positions for these genres.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, a step-by-step logical deduction without assuming positions not directly stated leads to:
- Position 1: Papaya - Writing - Gospel (from Clues 20 and 19)
- Position 7: ? - Traveling (from Clue 17)
- The rest requires meticulous placement based on all given constraints.

## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is board-games.
From clue 5, we know the person whose hobby is board-games is in the middle, which means they are in position 4.

## Step 2: Identify the drink and pet of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
From clue 7, we know the person whose hobby is filmmaking drinks water. Clue 6 tells us this person is to the right of the owner of the rabbit, but we don't know their exact position yet.

## Step 3: Determine the drink and pet of the person whose hobby is fishing.
From clues 8 and 15, we know the person whose hobby is fishing drinks milk and owns a lizard. Clue 17 tells us this person is to the right of the owner of the dog, but again, we don't know their exact position.

## Step 4: Place the person drinking 7up.
From clue 3, the person drinking 7up is in an odd position. Clue 9 tells us this person is to the left of the person whose hobby is traveling. Clue 13 also places them to the left of the person drinking water.

## Step 5: Place the person drinking mirinda.
From clue 4, the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the owner of the dog.

## Step 6: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is traveling.
Clue 11 tells us this person is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since we don't have enough information to place them exactly, we'll come back to this later.

## Step 7: Place the person drinking tea.
From clue 10, this person is between the owner of the pony and the person whose hobby is filmmaking (who drinks water).

## Step 8: Combine all known positions and clues to fill in the table.
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach, let's summarize key points:
- Board-games are in position 4.
- Filmmaking (water) is to the right of the rabbit owner.
- Fishing (milk, lizard) is to the right of the dog owner.
- 7up is in an odd position, to the left of traveling and water.
- Mirinda is to the left of the dog owner.
- Traveling is next to the rat owner.
- Tea is between the pony owner and filmmaking (water).
- Camping is between the horse owner and board-games.

## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the extensive list of clues, we need to ensure each clue is considered in the final placement. However, without a step-by-step elimination process for each clue, we'll outline the solution directly.
