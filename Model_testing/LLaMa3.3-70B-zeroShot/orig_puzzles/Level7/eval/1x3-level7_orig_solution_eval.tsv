Lv7-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:


1. The fan of metal is somewhere to the right of the fan of house.
2. The fan of metal is somewhere between the fan of house and the fan of jazz.


From statement 1, we know the order must be house -> metal (with possibly other genres in between, but since there are only three genres, it simplifies our options).


Statement 2 tells us that metal is between house and jazz. This means the possible orders are limited to: house -> metal -> jazz or jazz -> metal -> house.


However, given statement 1, we can eliminate the possibility of jazz -> metal -> house because metal must be to the right of house, not to its left as it would be in that order.


Thus, the only arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:


|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | house | metal | jazz |


Given this analysis, the solution table surrounded by '#############' is:


#############
|               |   1   |   2   |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | house | metal | jazz |

Lv7-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:

1. The person driving the trike is somewhere between the person driving the train and the person driving the boat.
2. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.

From clue 2, we know the order must be: boat, ?, train or boat, train, ? (with the question mark representing the trike).

Given clue 1, the only way the trike can be between the train and the boat is if the order is: boat, trike, train. This satisfies both conditions because the trike is between the boat and the train, and the train is to the right of the boat.

So, the solution table with the means of transport filled in according to the clues provided is:

#############
|             |  1   |   2   |   3   |
| Transport   | Boat | Trike | Train |

Lv7-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given conditions.


1. The person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies.
2. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.

From condition 2, since the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person watching animation movies, this means the order for these two genres is: Romance, Animation.


Given that there are three positions (1, 2, 3) and considering both conditions, the only way the person watching animation can be between the other two is if the person watching romance movies is in position 1, the person watching animation movies is in position 2, and the person watching zombie movies is in position 3.


Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |     2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance | Animation | Zombie |

Lv7-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to follow the given conditions:


1. The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating peas is on the far right.


Given that there are three positions (1, 2, 3) and the person eating peas is on the far right, we can place peas at position 3.


|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Food   |           |           | Peas |


Now, considering the first condition that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus, and knowing peas are at position 3, nectarine must be at position 2 to be between peas (at 3) and asparagus (which has to be at position 1 because it's the only place left for asparagus to satisfy the ""between"" condition).


So, the arrangement is:


|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Food   | Asparagus | Nectarine | Peas |


Therefore, the final solution table with '#############' around it is:

Lv7-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given conditions:


1. The person drinking Mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water.
2. The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
3. This condition repeats the information given in condition 1, so it doesn't add any new information.


From condition 2, we know the order must be Water, then Hot-Chocolate, because Water has to be to the left of Hot-Chocolate.


Given condition 1, Mirinda must be between Water and Hot-Chocolate. Since there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), and considering Water must be to the left of Hot-Chocolate, the only possible arrangement that fits all conditions is:


Water in position 1, Mirinda in position 2, and Hot-Chocolate in position 3.


The final solution table looks like this:


#############
|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |
| Beverage   | Water | Mirinda | Hot-Chocolate |

Lv7-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person driving the bus is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the tram.
2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

Given these conditions, we can determine the order as follows:

- Since the bus driver is to the right of the quad-bike driver (condition 2), and considering condition 1, the possible orders are:
  - Quad-bike, Bus, Tram
  - Tram, Quad-bike, Bus

However, only ""Quad-bike, Bus, Tram"" satisfies both conditions given. The bus is between the quad-bike and the tram, and it's also to the right of the quad-bike.

Thus, the final solution table with the means of transport in order from 1 to 3 is:

#############
|             |     1     |  2  |  3   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Bus | Tram |

Lv7-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions based on the first statement.
The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the engineer. This means the entrepreneur can be in position 2 or 3 if the engineer is in position 1, or the entrepreneur must be in position 3 if the engineer is in position 2.


## Step 2: Apply the second statement to narrow down the possibilities.
The engineer is somewhere between the entrepreneur and the manager. Given that the entrepreneur must be to the right of the engineer (from step 1), this means the manager must be in position 1 if the engineer is in position 2, because the engineer has to be between the entrepreneur and the manager.


## Step 3: Combine both statements for a final arrangement.
Considering both statements together:
- If the engineer were in position 1, the manager would have to be in position 2 (to satisfy the condition that the engineer is between the entrepreneur and the manager), but this contradicts the first statement since the entrepreneur must be to the right of the engineer. Thus, the engineer cannot be in position 1.
- If the engineer is in position 2, then the manager must be in position 1 (to satisfy the condition that the engineer is between the entrepreneur and the manager), and the entrepreneur can only be in position 3 (satisfying both conditions).


The final answer is: 
#############

| Job   | Manager | Engineer | Entrepreneur |

Lv7-1x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given conditions:


1. The person drinking Fanta is between the person drinking Soy-milk and the person drinking Almond-milk.
2. The person drinking Soy-milk is to the left of the person drinking Almond-milk.


Given these conditions, there are two possible arrangements that satisfy both rules:


- Soy-milk, Fanta, Almond-milk
- Fanta cannot be at either end because it must be between Soy-milk and Almond-milk. Therefore, the only arrangement where Fanta is between the other two and Soy-milk is to the left of Almond-milk is: Soy-milk, Fanta, Almond-milk.


Let's fill in the table according to this solution:


|            |    1     |   2   |      3      |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta | Almond-milk |


The final solution table is:

Lv7-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The fan of d&b (drum and bass) is on the right of the fan of soul.
2. The fan of soul is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.

Given that we have three positions (1, 2, 3) and three music genres (d&b, reggae, soul), let's analyze the clues:

- From clue 1, we know the order must be ""soul"" followed by ""d&b"" in some arrangement because d&b is to the right of soul.
- Clue 2 tells us that ""soul"" acts as a buffer between ""reggae"" and ""d&b"". This means ""reggae"" cannot be on the right side of ""soul"" if ""d&b"" is already determined to be on the right side of ""soul"".

Considering these points, there are two possible arrangements based on the clues:

1. reggae - soul - d&b
2. soul - reggae - d&b

However, only one arrangement satisfies both conditions given:
- The fan of d&b is to the right of the fan of soul.
- The fan of soul is between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.

The correct arrangement that fits both conditions perfectly is:

reggae - soul - d&b

Because this is the only way ""soul"" can be between ""reggae"" and ""d&b"", and also have ""d&b"" to the right of ""soul"".

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|               |   1    |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   | reggae | soul | d&b |

Lv7-1x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided:

1. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
2. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the ship.

Given there are only three positions (1, 2, 3) and three means of transport (motorbike, quad-bike, ship), we can deduce the following:

- From statement 1, since the motorbike must be to the left of the ship, the ship cannot be in position 1. The motorbike also cannot be in position 3 because then it wouldn't be to the left of the ship (unless the ship is also in position 3, which contradicts the premise that each person uses a different means of transport).
  
- From statement 2, the motorbike must be between the quad-bike and the ship. This implies the quad-bike cannot be in position 3 because then the motorbike wouldn't fit between the quad-bike and the ship (since one of them has to be in position 1 or 2 for the motorbike to be between them).

Considering both points, a possible arrangement that satisfies both conditions is:
- Quad-bike in position 1
- Motorbike in position 2
- Ship in position 3

This arrangement places the motorbike between the quad-bike and the ship and also ensures the motorbike is to the left of the ship.

Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|             |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike | Motorbike | Ship |
