Lv7-1x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the snake.
2. The owner of the goat is somewhere between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the snake.
3. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat.

From clue 3, we know the order for the hamster and the goat is: hamster, goat.

Given clue 2, since the goat must be between the hamster and the snake, and from clue 3 we already have the order hamster -> goat, the snake must come after the goat to satisfy both conditions. So, we have: hamster, goat, snake.

Now, incorporating clue 1, which states the frog is on the right of the snake, and knowing we've already placed the snake after the goat (and thus after the hamster), the only position left for the frog that satisfies all conditions is after the snake. 

So, the final order from left to right is: hamster, goat, snake, frog.

Here is the solution table:

Lv7-1x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


1. The person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating spinach.
   - This means spinach cannot be in position 4 because there would be no space to the right for papaya.

2. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person eating lettuce and the person eating apricot.
   - This indicates that lettuce and apricot must be on opposite sides of papaya, but we don't know which side yet.

3. The person eating papaya is between the person eating lettuce and the person eating spinach.
   - This refines statement 2 by specifying that spinach is one of the foods next to papaya. Since from statement 1, we know papaya must be to the right of spinach, this means spinach cannot be on the leftmost position (because if it were, papaya would have to be to its right, leaving no space for lettuce), and lettuce must be to the right of papaya or in a position that allows papaya to be between lettuce and spinach.


From statement 1 and considering statement 3:
- Spinach cannot be on the rightmost side (4th position) because papaya needs to be to its right.
- Since papaya is to the right of spinach, a possible arrangement could have spinach in position 1 or 2.

Considering all statements together for a coherent solution:
- If spinach were in position 1, then papaya would be in position 2 (to satisfy statement 1). 
- Lettuce must then come after papaya to fulfill the condition that papaya is between lettuce and spinach (statement 3), placing lettuce in either position 3 or 4. However, apricot also needs to be on one side of papaya (statement 2), meaning if lettuce were in position 4, apricot would have to be before spinach, which contradicts the need for papaya to be between them based on statement 3.
- Therefore, a possible arrangement that respects all conditions is: Spinach in position 1, Papaya in position 2 (because it's to the right of spinach), Lettuce in position 3 (because papaya must be between lettuce and spinach), and Apricot in position 4.

Given this analysis, the solution table would look like this:

#############

Lv7-1x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating cabbage is on the left of the person eating pear.
2. The person eating pumpkin is somewhere between the person eating pepper and the person eating pear.
3. The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.

From statement 1, we know cabbage must come before pear in the sequence.

From statements 2 and 3 together, we understand that pumpkin cannot be at either end because it must be between pepper and pear, and since pepper is to the right of pumpkin, the order for these three items must be: pumpkin, pepper, pear (since pumpkin has to be between pepper and pear, and pepper is to the right of pumpkin).

Given statement 1, cabbage must come before pear. Since we've established a sequence that includes pumpkin, pepper, and pear, and knowing cabbage comes before pear, the only place for cabbage is at the beginning because it has to be to the left of pear.

So, combining all information:

- Cabbage is first.
- Pumpkin is between pepper and pear, but since pepper must be to the right of pumpkin, the order for these three is: pumpkin, pepper, pear.

This gives us a sequence of: cabbage, pumpkin, pepper, pear.

Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

Lv7-1x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:


1. The person driving the train is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the jet-ski.
2. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the left of the person driving the train.
3. The person driving the bike is between the person driving the train and the person driving the snowmobile.


From clue 1, we know the order must be either Snowmobile - Train - Jet-ski or Jet-ski - Train - Snowmobile.


Clue 2 tells us the Bike must be to the left of the Train. Clue 3 then specifies that the Bike is between the Train and the Snowmobile, which means the Snowmobile must be on one end (since the Bike cannot be to the right of the Train), and the Jet-ski must be on the other end because it has to be separated from the Snowmobile by the Train.


Given these constraints, we can deduce two possible arrangements:


- If Snowmobile is at position 1: Snowmobile - Bike - Train - Jet-ski
- This fits all given conditions. The Train is between Snowmobile and Jet-ski (clue 1), the Bike is to the left of the Train (clue 2), and the Bike is between the Train and the Snowmobile (clue 3).


Let's fill in the table based on this solution:

Lv7-1x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person watching comedy movies relative to the person watching documentary movies.
From condition 3, we know the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. This gives us two possible arrangements for these two genres: Comedy-Documentary or Documentary-Comedy.


## Step 2: Place the person watching crime movies.
Condition 2 states that the person watching crime movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. This means we have a sequence of Comedy-Crime-Martial Arts or Martial Arts-Crime-Comedy, but given condition 1 (the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies), only the first sequence is possible.


## Step 3: Combine the information from steps 1 and 2 to find a valid arrangement.
Considering step 2's outcome, we know the order must include Comedy-Crime-Martial Arts in some form. Since condition 4 also states that comedy is between documentary and martial arts, and knowing martial arts is on the right of crime (and thus also on the right of comedy), we can start building a possible sequence.


## Step 4: Finalize the arrangement with all conditions considered.
From step 3, if Comedy is on the left of Crime, and given that Martial Arts must be to the right of Crime (condition 1), and considering condition 4 which places Comedy between Documentary and Martial Arts, we have two main sequences to consider based on our earlier steps: Documentary-Comedy-Crime-Martial Arts or Comedy-Documentary-Crime-Martial Arts. However, given all conditions, especially that Comedy must be between Documentary and Martial Arts (condition 4), and Crime is between Comedy and Martial Arts (condition 2), the sequence that fits all criteria is Documentary-Comedy-Crime-Martial Arts.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1      |   2    |   3   |      4       |

Lv7-1x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The Colombian is somewhere between the Turkish and the Russian.
2. The Thai is somewhere between the Colombian and the Turkish.
3. The Thai is on the left or right of the Turkish.
4. The Thai is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.


From statement 4, we know the Thai must be to the right of the Turkish. Combining this with statement 2, which says the Thai is between the Colombian and the Turkish, it means the order for these three nationalities must be: Turkish, Colombian, Thai (since the Thai has to be to the right of the Turkish and between the Turkish and Colombian).


Now, incorporating statement 1, which places the Colombian between the Turkish and Russian, we know that the Russian must be on the opposite side of the Colombian from the Turkish. Given the order we've established so far (Turkish, Colombian, Thai), the only place left for the Russian is before the Turkish or after the Thai.


However, considering statement 3 as well, which says the Thai can be either to the left or right of the Turkish but knowing from statement 4 that it must be to the right, and combining all information:


- The sequence has to accommodate the Colombian between the Turkish and Russian.
- The Thai is between the Colombian and Turkish but specifically to the right of the Turkish.


So, if we place the Russian first (to satisfy the condition that the Colombian is between the Turkish and Russian), followed by the Turkish, then the Colombian, and finally the Thai, this order satisfies all conditions:


1. Russian
2. Turkish
3. Colombian
4. Thai


This arrangement meets all criteria: the Colombian is between the Turkish and Russian, the Thai is to the right of the Turkish (and thus also between the Colombian and Turkish as required), and the Thai's position relative to the Turkish satisfies both statements 3 and 4.


The final solution table is:

Lv7-1x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully consider each clue.


## Step 1: Understanding the Clues
- The first clue states that the person drinking iced-tea is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person drinking 7up.
- The second clue indicates that the person drinking fanta is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking almond-milk.
- The third clue tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person drinking 7up.


## Step 2: Applying the Clues
From the third clue, we know iced-tea must be to the right of 7up. Combining this with the first clue, we can deduce a possible order: 7up, iced-tea, almond-milk or almond-milk, iced-tea, 7up. However, given that iced-tea is between almond-milk and 7up and to the right of 7up, the correct sequence respecting all clues must start with 7up.


## Step 3: Further Deduction
Since fanta is between iced-tea and almond-milk (second clue), and considering iced-tea's position relative to 7up and almond-milk from the first and third clues, we have a specific order: 7up, iced-tea, fanta, almond-milk. This sequence respects all given conditions.


## Step 4: Constructing the Final Table
Based on our deductions:
- Position 1 is 7up.
- Position 2 is iced-tea.
- Position 3 is fanta.
- Position 4 is almond-milk.

The final answer is:

Lv7-1x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching action movies is in an odd position.
2. The person watching romance movies is on the right of the person watching animation movies.
3. The person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching action movies and the person watching horror movies.

Given there are 4 positions (1, 2, 3, 4), the odd positions are 1 and 3. 

From point 1, Action could be in position 1 or 3.

From point 3, since Animation must be between Action and Horror, if Action is in position 1, then Animation could be in 2 or 3, but because it also has to be before Horror (and considering Romance's placement relative to Animation from point 2), the only configuration that allows all conditions to be met when Action is in position 1 is:

- Action in 1
- Animation in 2
- Since Romance must be on the right of Animation, and there needs to be a spot for Horror as well, this leaves us with:
  - Animation in 2
  - Romance in 3 (to satisfy being on the right of Animation)
  - And Horror in 4

However, if Action were in position 3, it would be challenging to place all genres according to the rules since Animation needs to be between Action and Horror, and Romance must be on the right of Animation. This scenario doesn't allow for a configuration that satisfies all conditions given.

Thus, considering the placements:
- If Action is in position 1, we have a possible arrangement: Action, Animation, Romance, Horror.
  
Let's verify this against all rules:
1. Action is indeed in an odd position (1).
2. Romance is on the right of Animation (3 is to the right of 2).
3. Animation is between Action and Horror (2 is between 1 and 4).

This satisfies all conditions given.

Therefore, the solution table is:

#############
|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |   4    |

Lv7-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step:


1. The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right.
2. The person driving the van is somewhere to the right of the person driving the helicopter.
3. The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person driving the van.
4. The person driving the van is somewhere between the person driving the scooter and the person driving the subway.


From clue 1, we have two possibilities for the subway: it can be in position 1 or position 4.


Considering clue 2, since the van must be to the right of the helicopter, and given that there are only four positions, if the subway were in position 1 (far left), the order could potentially allow for all conditions to be met. However, we need to consider all clues together.


Clue 3 tells us the scooter is to the right of the van, and clue 4 tells us the van is between the scooter and the subway. This creates a seeming contradiction unless the arrangement allows for the van to be in the middle, with the scooter on one side and the subway on the other. However, given that the scooter must be to the right of the van (clue 3), this means the subway cannot be to the right of the van if we are to satisfy all conditions.


Given these constraints:


- The subway can only be in position 1 (to allow the van and scooter to be arranged as per clues 2, 3, and 4).
- If the subway is in position 1, the helicopter must then be in position 2 because the van needs to be to its right.
- With the helicopter in position 2, the van can only fit in position 3 to satisfy clue 2 and allow for the scooter to be placed according to clue 3.


So, we have:


|             |   1    |     2      |  3  |    4    |
| Transport   | Subway | Helicopter | Van | Scooter |


This arrangement satisfies all clues:


1. The subway is on the far left.
2. The van is to the right of the helicopter.
3. The scooter is to the right of the van.
4. The van is between the scooter and the subway.


Therefore, the final solution table is:

2. The dancer is on the left of the analyst.
3. The chef is on the left of the dancer.


From clue 3, we know the order for two of the jobs: chef, dancer. Since the dancer must be to the left of the analyst (clue 2), and the chef is to the left of the dancer, we have a partial sequence: chef, dancer, analyst.


Given that the analyst must be between the fisherman and the chef (clue 1), but since the chef is already determined to be before the dancer and thus before the analyst, the fisherman must be after the analyst in this sequence to satisfy clue 1.
