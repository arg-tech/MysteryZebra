Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

1. Start with clue 50, which states that the accountant is on the left of the coach. This means that the accountant must be in either position 1 or 2, and the coach must be in either position 3 or 4.

2. From clue 24, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea cannot be in position 6 (because then the person drinking 7up would have to be in position 7, which does not exist), the person drinking tea must be in either position 1 or 5.

3. From clue 10, we know that the person drinking tea and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions. This means that if the person drinking tea is in position 1 (an odd position), then the person eating lettuce must also be in an odd position.

4. Continue applying the clues in this manner, using a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error to fill in the table. 

Note: The solution process involves applying all 59 clues, which would be too lengthy to describe in detail here. The provided solution table represents the final result after carefully considering all the given clues."
