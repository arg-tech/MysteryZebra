Lv9-4x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each rule step by step to narrow down the possibilities until we find a solution that satisfies all conditions.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 20 - Police-officer in the middle
Given the police-officer is in the middle (position 3), we start with:
```
| Job           |  ?    |  ?     | Police-officer |  ?       |  ?          |
| Movie-Genre   |       |        |                |          |             |
| Music-Genre   |       |        |                |          |             |
| Transport     |       |        |                |          |             |
```

## Step 2: Apply Rule 10 - Software-developer on the far left or far right
This gives us two possible positions for the software-developer. Let's consider both options.


## Step 3: Combine with Rule 18 - Person watching family movies and software-developer have same parity positions
And Rule 5 - Fan ambient is the person watching family movies.
If software-developer is on the far left, then the person watching family movies (and fan ambient) must also be on an odd position.


## Step 4: Apply Rule 16 - Person watching zombie movies on the far left or far right
This could potentially conflict with the software-developer's placement. We need to ensure both can satisfy their conditions.


## Step 5: Consider Rule 6 and 17 - Doctor is not fan dubstep, and taxi driver is not police-officer
These rules start to limit who can be where based on job and music preferences.


## Step 6: Apply Remaining Rules Iteratively
Given the complexity and interdependence of many rules, we'll need to iteratively apply them, ensuring each step satisfies all previous conditions. This process involves trial and error, adjusting placements based on job, movie genre, music genre, and transport method until all rules are satisfied.


The final answer is:

Lv9-4x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 7
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left. This means the first column corresponds to hot-chocolate.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 13
Since the pilot is not drinking 7up (Clue 13) and the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking fanta (Clue 2), we can't directly place them yet, but we know their relative positions.

## Step 3: Consider Clue 1 and Clue 6
The videographer is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski, and the pilot is to the left of the videographer. This gives us a sequence: Pilot -> Videographer -> Jet-ski driver.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The jet-ski driver is in an odd position. Given our current sequence from Step 3, if we consider positions (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the jet-ski could be in position 3 or 5 to satisfy being in an odd position.

## Step 5: Use Clue 11
The person driving the van is on the right of the pilot. This helps us understand that the van cannot be in the first position since the pilot must be to its left.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 17 and Clue 20
The owner of the ferret and the software-developer have the same parity positions, and the owner of the guinea-pig and the person driving the van have the same parity positions. This means if one is in an even position, the other must also be.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 5
The owner of the rat is not to the right of the owner of the dog. This gives us a relative positioning but doesn't tell us their exact positions yet.

## Step 8: Consider Clue 12 and Clue 18
The owner of the dog is on the left of the person driving the taxi, and the skateboard driver is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. This gives us another sequence: Dog -> Taxi (with skateboard being adjacent to dog).

## Step 9: Piece Together Information from Previous Steps
From Clue 7, hot-chocolate is in position 1.
Given the sequences and clues:
- Pilot must be before Videographer and Jet-ski driver (Step 3).
- Van is after Pilot (Step 5).
- Ferret and software-developer have the same parity (Step 6), as do guinea-pig and van.
- Dog and taxi are in a sequence with skateboard adjacent to dog (Step 8).

## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Considering all clues:
1. Hot-chocolate (from Clue 7).
2. Pilot (since pilot is before videographer and jet-ski, and considering parity and other placements).
3. Jet-ski (odd position, from Clue 3, and after pilot and before videographer).
4. Videographer (after jet-ski, fulfilling Clue 1).
5. Van (must be after pilot, and given the van's relation to guinea-pig and parity).

Considering beverage clues:
- Hot-chocolate is in position 1.
- Fanta must be before 7up (Clue 2), but their exact positions are tricky without direct job or pet associations.

Given job and transport associations:
- Pilot isn't with rat (Clue 4) and isn't drinking 7up (Clue 13).
- Software-developer is before roller (Clue 9), which helps place the developer relative to transport but not directly to a beverage without more information on pets or direct job-beverage links.

Final placements require considering all interactions:
- Hot-chocolate in position 1 (Clue 7).
- Pilot, then videographer, then jet-ski driver for jobs and transport.
- Fanta before 7up for beverages.
- Dog before taxi, with skateboard adjacent to dog.
- Ferret and software-developer in the same parity positions.
- Guinea-pig and van in the same parity positions.

Given these constraints and working through the clues methodically:
1. Hot-chocolate (beverage), Pilot (job), Chinchilla (pet, by elimination and fitting other clues), Jet-ski (transport).
2. Fanta, Videographer, Dog, Taxi.
3. 7up, Software-developer, Ferret, Roller.
4. Juice, Project-manager, Rat, Skateboard.
5. Water, Freelancer, Guinea-pig, Van.

Lv9-4x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


Given:
- Beverages: almond-milk, fanta, juice, lemonade, milk
- Music Genres: country, disco, electronic, metal, reggae
- Nationalities: mexican, nigerian, pakistani, russian, turkish
- Sports: badminton, basketball, biathlon, sailing, skiing


From clue 10, the person who's sport is sailing is on the far right.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the fan of country music.
Clue 8 indicates the fan country is on the far left or far right. Given that sailing is already determined to be on the far right (clue 10), and considering clue 20, which states the fan country is somewhere to the left of the nigerian, country must be on the far left.


## Step 2: Determine the position of reggae and disco fans relative to each other.
From clue 6, the fan reggae is on the left of the fan disco.


## Step 3: Place the Turkish person.
Clue 1 indicates the turkish is on the left or right of the fan disco. Considering the constraints about positions (especially with country being on the far left and sailing on the far right), we'll need to integrate this information as we go, considering other clues for more direct placements.


## Step 4: Place the Russian.
Clue 12 simply states ""the russian is the russian,"" which doesn't give us placement information directly. Clue 13's mention seems to be a non-sequitur or error in transcription since it repeats clue 12 verbatim without adding new information. We'll look at other clues for Russian placement.


## Step 5: Determine the position of the person who drinks almond-milk.
From clue 19, the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position. Clue 15 indicates this person is to the left of the fan metal.


## Step 6: Place the fan of electronic music.
Clue 14 states the fan electronic is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since sailing is on the far right, electronic can be in positions 1 through 4.


## Step 7: Integrate information about metal and electronic fans.
Clue 7 indicates the fan metal is between the fan electronic and the person whose sport is skiing. Given that electronic must be to the left of sailing (and thus could be in positions 1-4), and considering almond-milk's position relative to metal, we start to see a possible sequence.


## Step 8: Place the person who drinks fanta.
Clue 11 states the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon. Clue 3 indicates this person is not to the left of the person drinking milk.


## Step 9: Determine the positions based on parity and direct clues.
From clue 2, the fan reggae and the person drinking lemonade have the same parity positions. Given all constraints, we need to fit these pieces together with the sport preferences and nationalities.


## Step 10: Finalize placements considering all clues.
Given the complexity and the interrelated nature of the clues, direct placement requires integrating all information simultaneously:


1. Country music fan is on the far left (clue 8).
2. Sailing is on the far right (clue 10).
3. Reggae fan is to the left of the disco fan (clue 6).
4. Almond-milk drinker is in an even position and to the left of the metal fan (clues 19 and 15).
5. Electronic music fan is to the left of sailing (clue 14), and metal is between electronic and skiing (clue 7).


Considering all clues for a coherent solution:

Lv9-4x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the arrangement of hobbies, music genres, pets, and sports for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 16
The fan of d&b is on the far left. This gives us a starting point.


|               |     1      |    2    |      3      |    4     |     5      |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person who's hobby is video-games is in an odd position. Since positions are numbered from 1 to 5, odd positions are 1, 3, and 5.


## Step 3: Combine with Clue 6
The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games. This implies that if video-games is at position 1, baking must be at position 2, given the constraint from clue 16 that d&b (and thus its associated hobby) occupies position 1.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 17
The fan reggae is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hamster. This clue doesn't directly tell us positions but implies an order.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 13
The owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the snake. Another ordering clue without specific positions.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 11
The person who's sport is basketball is the person who's hobby is dancing, and this person is on the left or right of the fan pop. This gives a direct connection between two categories.


## Step 7: Apply Remaining Clues Iteratively
Given the complexity and interconnectivity of clues, we must iteratively apply each clue to refine our solution, ensuring consistency across all provided information.

Lv9-4x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Identify Key Information
From clue 7, we know the fan of rock music is also into baking.
Clue 21 states the fan of techno music is in the middle, which means they are at position 3 since there are 5 positions (an odd number of positions with one being exactly in the middle).


## Step 2: Apply Positional Clues
Given clue 17, the fan of rock (baking) is to the left of the person driving the airplane. This doesn't directly tell us where they are but gives a relationship.
Clue 4 tells us the airplane driver is on the left or right of the rock fan (baker), reinforcing their proximity.


## Step 3: Determine Parity and Proximity Relationships
From clue 9, we know the satire movie watcher isn't a fan of trance music.
Clue 10 indicates the satire movie watcher is not to the right of the video-games enthusiast.


## Step 4: Piece Together Music Preferences and Hobbies
Given clue 2, the techno fan (at position 3) cannot be to the right of the board-games enthusiast. This implies the board-games enthusiast must be at or to the right of position 3.
Clue 5 tells us the video-games enthusiast and the jazz fan are in different parity positions.


## Step 5: Analyze Transport Clues
From clue 8, we know the helicopter driver is to the left of the scooter driver.
Clue 15 indicates the roller driver is to the right of the martial-arts movie watcher.


## Step 6: Synthesize Information for Final Placement
Considering all clues:
- The techno fan is at position 3 (clue 21).
- Rock (baking) must be to the left of the airplane driver, and since rock is also on the left of the airplane driver (clue 17), this places baking (rock) likely at position 1 or 2.
- Given the board-games enthusiast shares parity with the scooter driver (clue 1) and considering other constraints, we can start filling in the table.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions Based on All Constraints
Considering all given clues and their implications:
1. The fan of rock music is also into baking (clue 7).
2. The techno fan is at position 3 (clue 21).
3. The airplane driver's position relative to others, especially the rock fan/baker (clues 4, 17).
4. Satire movie watcher's position and preferences (clues 6, 9, 10, 18).
5. Video-games enthusiast's position relative to jazz fan and others.
Given these points and considering parity, proximity, and direct placements from clues:
- Position 1 could likely be baking (rock), given its relation to the airplane.
- The board-games enthusiast must align with the scooter driver in terms of parity and cannot be too far left due to the techno fan's placement at position 3.


The final answer is:

Lv9-4x5-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the steps and clues provided:


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 17 and 18
The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left and in an odd position, which means they are in position 1.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 14
The owner of the dog is the Nigerian. Given that the dog's owner has a different parity position than the person eating pineapple (Clue 8) and considering the positions are either odd or even, we can start placing these individuals.


## Step 3: Use Clue 4
The British is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla's owner is in position 1, the British person must be in a position to the right of 1.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 19
The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far right, which means they are in position 5.


## Step 5: Use Clue 10
The owner of the frog is the person who's hobby is sudoku. This links two categories but doesn't give a specific position yet.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 20 and 22
The Polish is in an even position (2 or 4) and to the right of the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian (dog owner) has a different parity from pineapple eater, and considering the restrictions on positions, we can start forming groups.


## Step 7: Analyze Clues 1, 6, 11
- The person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
- The owner of the frog (sudoku hobby) is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes.
- The British is somewhere to the right of the person eating zucchini.


## Step 8: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Considering all clues together, especially about nationalities, hobbies, and pets' positions relative to each other and food preferences:


- From Clue 12, the Argentine is to the left of the Japanese.
- Clue 3 indicates the Argentine is not to the left of the person eating grapes.
- The owner of the turtle (Clue 2) is to the left of the writer.


Given these clues and steps, let's construct a possible solution table. Note that without a systematic way to apply all clues simultaneously in this format, we deduce based on given restrictions:
