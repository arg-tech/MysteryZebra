Lv9-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue given:


1. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking tea.
2. The writer and the person whose hobby is skydiving have different parity positions (meaning one is in position 1 and the other is in position 2).
3. The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of soul.


Let's break down the information:


- From clue 1, if magic-tricks is on the left of tea, then magic-tricks must be associated with almond-milk because it has to be on the left (position 1), and tea is in position 2.
  
- From clue 3, since hip-hop is on the right of soul, hip-hop must be in position 2, and soul must be in position 1.


Given these deductions:


|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | tea          |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| skydiving    |
| Job           |              |              |
| Music-Genre   | soul        | hip-hop      |


Now, using clue 2:


- The writer and the person whose hobby is skydiving have different parity positions. Since skydiving is in position 2 (based on our deductions), the writer must be in position 1.


So, we fill in the job column based on this information:


|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | tea          |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| skydiving    |
| Job           | writer      | videographer|
| Music-Genre   | soul        | hip-hop      |


The final solution table is:

Lv9-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The videographer and the person driving the train have different parity positions.
   - This means one must be in an odd position (1) and the other in an even position (2).

2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
   - This implies the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 2, because if they were in position 1, the train driver could still be to their right, which contradicts this statement.

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the Colombian.
   - Given that ice-hockey must be in position 2 (from statement 2), and it's to the left of the Colombian, the Colombian must also be in position 2, which means ice-hockey and Colombian are associated with the same person.

Let's try to fill out the table based on these deductions:


Given that ice-hockey is in position 2 and so is the Colombian (from statement 3), we have:


|               |      1       |      2       |
| Job           |              | Videographer|
| Nationality   |              | Colombian   |
| Sport         |              | Ice-Hockey  |
| Transport     |              |             |

Since the person driving the train cannot be to the right of ice-hockey (statement 2), and ice-hockey is in position 2, the train must be associated with position 1.


Now, considering statement 1, if the videographer is in position 2, then the train driver (in position 1) and the videographer have different parity positions, which satisfies statement 1. The only job left for position 1 is photographer.


The remaining options are sailing for sport (which must be in position 1 since ice-hockey is in position 2), Polish for nationality (since Colombian is already assigned to position 2), and van for transport (since train is already assigned to position 1).


Thus, the filled table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Job           | Photographer| Videographer|

Lv9-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing and the scientist have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position (1) and the other is in an even position (2).


2. The Russian is on the right of the person whose hobby is reading.
   - Since there are only two positions, this implies the person who likes reading must be in position 1, and the Russian must be in position 2.


3. The person whose hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear.
   - Given that the reader is in position 1 (from clue 2), this means the person eating pear must also be in position 2, as there are no positions further to the right.


From these clues:


- The reader is in position 1 and eats papaya (since the pear eater is in position 2).
- The Russian is in position 2.
- Since the rock-climber and scientist have different parity positions, and given that reading is already assigned to position 1, rock-climbing must be associated with position 2 (to satisfy the condition of being on opposite parity positions), making the scientist's hobby reading (in position 1).
- The person in position 1 (reader/scientist) eats papaya.
- The Russian in position 2 is a rock-climber and eats pear.


Therefore, the table should look like this:


#############
|               |     1     |        2        |
| Food          | Papaya   | Pear           |
| Hobby         | Reading  | Rock-climbing  |
| Job           | Scientist| Project-manager|
| Nationality   | Not Thai | Russian        |
#############


However, based on the given instructions and the nature of the puzzle, it seems we need to fill in all fields accurately according to the clues provided. Given that:


- The person who reads is a scientist (as deduced).
- The rock-climber cannot be the scientist (from clue 1), thus must be associated with position 2.
- The Russian's job isn't directly stated, but given the scientist is in position 1 and reads, and there are only two jobs, the Russian (in position 2) must be the project-manager.


This logic puzzle's constraints lead us to a solution where all fields can be filled based on the given clues. Here's how it should look after accurately applying all deductions:


#############
|               |     1     |        2        |
| Food          | Papaya   | Pear           |
| Hobby         | Reading  | Rock-climbing  |
| Job           | Scientist| Project-manager|
| Nationality   | Not Russian| Russian       |
#############


Given the constraints and applying logical deductions, we determine that ""Not Russian"" in position 1 should actually be ""Thai"" to satisfy the condition of two different nationalities. Therefore, correcting our solution:


#############

Lv9-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot.
2. The person who's hobby is reading and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions (meaning they are both either in position 1 or both in position 2).
3. The person who's sport is cricket and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions.

Given these clues, let's start by filling in what we know:

- **Clue 1** implies that apricot cannot be on the right side because the turtle owner must be to the right of the apricot eater. So, apricot must be on the left.
- **Clue 2** suggests that since reading and the turtle owner have the same parity positions, and given the constraint from Clue 1, both must be in position 2 (because if they were in position 1, the turtle couldn't be to the right of apricot).
- **Clue 3** indicates cricket and woodworking have the same parity positions. Since reading is already determined to be in an even position (2), this means cricket and woodworking must also be in even positions or both in odd positions. However, since reading (and thus turtle) is already assigned to position 2, cricket and woodworking cannot both fit into position 2.

Let's summarize our findings so far:

- Apricot must be on the left.
- Reading and turtle are on the right (position 2).
- Cricket and woodworking have the same parity positions but cannot both be in position 2 because it's already occupied by reading/turtle.

Given these constraints, let's try to fill out the table:

|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | Apricot    | Asparagus    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking| Reading      |
| Pet     | Bird       | Turtle       |
| Sport   | Skateboarding| Cricket     |

This arrangement satisfies all given conditions:
- The turtle is to the right of apricot.
- Reading and the turtle owner are in the same parity position (both in position 2).
- Cricket and woodworking have the same parity positions (both in position 2, considering the whole set of constraints).

Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv9-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus. This means the lizard cannot be in column 2 if the bus is in column 2, but since there are only two columns, this clue primarily tells us that the lizard and the bus cannot both be in the same column with the lizard on the right.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. Since we have a 2x4 table (two rows for each category type, but considering each row individually for the categories of food, movie-genre, pet, transport), this means they must both be in either column 1 or column 2 because there are no more columns to consider different parities.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. This clue further restricts where the lizard and satire movie preferences can be relative to each other.


Given these clues, let's try to construct a table that fits all conditions:


- From clue 1, if we place the bus in column 2, the lizard must be in column 1 because it has to be to the left of the bus.
- Clue 2 tells us that lemon and motorbike are in the same parity positions. If we consider the person with lemon in column 1 (to satisfy being on the left as per clue 1 for the lizard), then the motorbike must also be in column 1 or column 2 to maintain the same parity.
- Clue 3 reinforces that the lizard is to the left of satire, meaning if satire were in column 2, the lizard must indeed be in column 1.


Considering all clues together:


Let's place the lizard in column 1 (satisfying clue 1 and clue 3 by being on the left) and assume lemon is also in column 1 to start, which would put motorbike in column 1 based on clue 2. However, this creates a conflict since we can't have both transport methods and both foods in just one column without violating some conditions.


So, let's correct our approach considering all possibilities:


- The lizard must be in column 1 (from clues 1 and 3).
- If the bus is in column 2 (as per clue 1), then the motorbike could also be in column 1 or 2 but based on parity with lemon (clue 2), let's assume lemon is in column 1, which means motorbike should also be in an odd position if considering a larger table context, but here it simply means they're both in the same column type (either both in column 1 or both in column 2).
- Given satire must be to the right of lizard (clue 3), and assuming martial arts could be anywhere but needs a pair for each category, we have to fit these into our existing structure.


## Step 4: Finalizing Placement
Given all constraints:


|               |      1       |     2     |
| Food          | cranberry   | lemon     |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| satire    |
| Pet           | lizard      | rabbit    |
| Transport     | motorbike   | bus       |

This arrangement satisfies:
- The lizard (column 1) is to the left of the bus (column 2).
- Lemon and motorbike are in the same parity positions (both column 1 for one scenario, but here we've placed them to fit all other conditions as well).
- The lizard is also to the left of satire.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1       |     2     |
| Food          | cranberry   | lemon     |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| satire    |

Lv9-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that if soccer is in position 1, comedy must be in position 2, and if soccer were in position 2 (which isn't possible given this clue since comedy has to be to its right), then comedy would have to be in a non-existent third position, so we can safely say soccer is in position 1.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of ambient music and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), both must be in either an odd or even position. However, given we only have two slots to fill, this means they are both on the same side (either both on the left or both on the right). But since we know from clue 1 that soccer is on the left, ambient and cat can't both be on the left unless they're associated with soccer.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The fan of indie music is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient music. This means if ambient is in position 1, indie must be in position 2. Given the information from clue 2 that ambient and cat are on the same parity (and thus likely together), and from clue 1 that comedy (and by association its sports counterpart which isn't soccer) is to the right of soccer, we start seeing a possible arrangement.


## Step 4: Combine Information
From Clue 1, we know soccer can only be in position 1 because comedy needs to be to its right. Thus, comedy must be in position 2.

Given Clue 2 and considering parity, ambient music (and thus the cat) could be on either side but is likely paired with soccer due to the constraints of Clue 1. However, since indie has to be to the right of ambient (Clue 3), and comedy is already determined to be in position 2, we can start piecing together.


## Step 5: Finalize Positions
If soccer is in position 1 (and thus associated with a movie genre that isn't comedy, which leaves thriller as the only option since comedy is taken by position 2), and comedy is in position 2 (which means it's associated with basketball because soccer is already taken by position 1), then we can fill in the rest.


For music genres: Ambient must be with soccer (position 1) to allow indie to be on the right, which fits perfectly as it would be paired with comedy (and thus basketball).


For pets: Since ambient and cat have the same parity positions, and if ambient is with position 1 (soccer), then cat must also be in position 1. This leaves lizard for position 2.


The final arrangement looks like this:


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Comedy    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Indie     |
| Pet           | Cat      | Lizard    |

Lv9-4x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person drinking tea is on the left of the fan of soul music.
2. The person watching sports movies and the fan of house music have the same parity positions (meaning they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions).
3. The person whose hobby is dancing and the person drinking fanta have the same parity positions.

Given there are only two positions, these statements imply:
- Since the tea drinker is to the left of the soul music fan, and given we're dealing with positions 1 and 2, this means the soul music fan must be in position 2.
- The sports movie watcher and house music fan being in the same parity positions implies they are both in either position 1 or position 2. However, since there's only two positions (1 and 2), and given one of them has to align with another hobby or preference that also has a specified position, this statement actually means they have to be together but doesn't specify which is which without considering other clues.
- The dancing hobbyist and fanta drinker having the same parity positions suggests they are both in either an odd (1) or even (2) position. Given we're only dealing with two positions, this implies that if one set of preferences (like tea and soul music) occupies one side, the other set (involving dancing and fanta) must be on the other.

Let's start filling in based on clue 1:
- If the tea drinker is to the left of the soul music fan, then tea must be in position 1, and soul music must be in position 2.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |  Tea   |  Fanta    |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |  Soul     |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |

Given the soul music fan is in position 2, and knowing from clue 3 that the dancing hobbyist and fanta drinker have the same parity positions (which must be even since they're together on the right side based on our current arrangement), we can fill in:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |  Tea   |  Fanta    |
| Hobby         |         | Dancing   |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |         |  Soul     |

Now, using clue 2 that the sports movie watcher and house music fan have the same parity positions (and thus must be together), and knowing the soul music fan is already in position 2, we deduce:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |  Tea   |  Fanta    |
| Hobby         | Fishing| Dancing   |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports|
| Music-Genre   | House   |  Soul     |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- The tea drinker is to the left of the soul music fan.
- The sports movie watcher and house music fan have the same parity positions (both in position 2 and 1 respectively, but since there are only two options, they align with each other's genre type).
- The dancing hobbyist and fanta drinker have the same parity positions.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

From clue 1: ""the person driving the boat is on the right of the fisherman,"" we can infer that the fisherman is in position 1 and the person driving the boat is in position 2.


## Step 1:
|               |     1     |     2      |

| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Transport     |           | Boat       |


From clue 2: ""the person driving the boat and the person watching thriller movies have different parity positions,"" since the boat is in position 2 (even), the thriller movie watcher must be in an odd position, which means they are in position 1.


## Step 2:

From clue 3: ""the person watching western movies and the person drinking water have different parity positions,"" since the western movie watcher must be in position 2 (to satisfy the condition of having a different parity from the thriller watcher), and knowing that the thriller watcher is in an odd position, it means the western movie watcher is indeed correctly placed in position 2. The person drinking water then must be in position 1.


## Step 3:

Given that the fisherman is in position 1 and uses a mode of transport not specified yet, but knowing there are only two modes of transport (boat and subway) and the boat is used by the person in position 2, we can infer the fisherman must use the subway.

Lv9-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The Russian is on the left of the person whose sport is swimming. This means the Russian cannot be in column 2 if swimming is in column 2, but since we don't know the position of swimming relative to the Russian yet, we'll keep this in mind for later deductions.

The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony. This means if the pony is in column 1, the rabbit must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The owner of the rabbit and the person eating onion have the same parity positions. Since we only have two columns (odd and even positions), this implies that either both are in odd positions or both are in even positions. Given our setup, if one is in column 1 (an odd position), the other must also be in an odd position, but since there's no direct odd/even designation for our two-column setup, we consider the implication that they share the same column based on the given structure.


## Step 4: Combining Clues
From clue 2 and considering our table structure, if the pony is in column 1 (left), the rabbit must be in column 2 (right). Since there are only two positions, and from clue 3, we know the owner of the rabbit and the person eating onion share the same parity position, this actually means they could both be on the right or left if we were considering more columns. However, with just two columns, it simplifies to them being in the same column under a typical interpretation for larger sets.


## Step 5: Finalizing Positions
Given that the Russian must be to the left of swimming (clue 1), and assuming the simplest scenario where each type is represented exactly once across both columns:


- If the Russian is in column 1, swimming cannot be in column 1. Thus, swimming must be in column 2.
- From clue 2, if the pony is in column 1, the rabbit is in column 2. This aligns with our current deductions and does not conflict with clue 3 since both the rabbit's owner and onion eater could theoretically be on the right (column 2) based on parity.


## Step 6: Placing Remaining Items
Considering all clues, let's place items:
- Russian in column 1 for nationality.
- Since swimming must be to the right of the Russian, it goes in column 2 under sport.
- The pony, being to the left of the rabbit (clue 2), goes in column 1 under pet.
- This leaves the rabbit for column 2 under pet.
- For food, since onion and the rabbit's owner share parity positions (and thus likely the same column based on our simplified interpretation), and considering the pony is already placed in column 1, we might initially think to place onion in column 2. However, given our constraints and aiming for a solution that fits all clues without direct conflict, let's ensure each category has a unique item per column.


## Step 7: Final Placement
Given the above steps and ensuring no rule is broken:
- Nationality: Russian (column 1), Indonesian (column 2).
- Pet: Pony (column 1), Rabbit (column 2).
- Sport: Cycling (must be in column 1 since swimming is in column 2), Swimming (column 2).
- Food: Onion (column 1, to maintain parity with the rabbit's owner if considering a broader application of clue 3 but here fitting our two-column constraint), Pineapple (column 2).


The final answer is:

Lv9-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions.
   - This means one is in an odd position (1) and the other in an even position (2).


2. The person whose hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
   - Since there are only two columns, this implies the person with the chess hobby must be in column 1 if the bus is in column 2.


3. The person driving the train is the person whose hobby is chess.
   - From statement 2 and this one, we can deduce that chess and train must be associated with column 1 because chess is to the left of bus (which must then be in column 2).


4. The musician is on the far left.
   - This places the musician in column 1.


Given these points:


- Column 1 has the musician and the person whose hobby is chess, who also uses the train. 
- Since the musician is in column 1 (odd position), and they cannot have peach (because then the peach eater and musician would be in the same parity position if peach were also in column 1, or it contradicts statement 1 if peach is considered to be in an even position without further information about its exact placement), this implies that banana must be with the musician.


- Column 2 has the bus. The hobby here must be fishing because chess is already assigned to column 1.


- Since the musician (column 1) and the peach eater have different parity positions, and given the musician is in an odd position, peach must then be associated with column 2.


So, we can fill out the table as follows:


#############
|             |    1     |        2        |
| Food        | Banana   | Peach          |
| Hobby       | Chess    | Fishing        |
| Job         | Musician | Project-manager|
| Transport   | Train    | Bus            |
