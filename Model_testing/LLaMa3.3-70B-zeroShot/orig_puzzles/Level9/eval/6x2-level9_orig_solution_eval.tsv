Lv9-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fill in the table accordingly.


From clue 3, we know the french person is to the right of the american. This gives us a starting point for the Nationality row:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |


Clue 4 tells us that the person watching documentary movies and the person whose hobby is baking have the same parity positions, meaning they are either both in odd positions (1) or both in even positions (2). Since there are only two positions, this implies they must be in the same position for their respective categories.


Clue 2 states the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person whose hobby is baking. This means if baking is in position 1, sprite must be in position 2.


Considering clue 1, the person driving the taxi is to the left of the photographer. If we place the photographer in position 2 (to satisfy being to the right of someone), then the taxi driver must be in position 1.


Given these clues, let's start building our table:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |             |               |
| Hobby         |             |               |
| Job           |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |               |
| Transport     |             |               |


From clue 4 and our deduction, baking and documentary must be in the same position. Since we've established the American is likely in position 1 (to satisfy other conditions), let's place baking and documentary in position 1 for their respective categories:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |             |               |
| Hobby         |  Baking    |               |
| Job           |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|               |
| Transport     |             |               |


Now, since the person drinking sprite is to the right of the baker (clue 2), and we've placed baking in position 1:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |  Milk      |    Sprite     |
| Hobby         |  Baking    |               |
| Job           |             |               |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|               |
| Transport     |             |               |


The taxi driver is to the left of the photographer (clue 1), so we place the taxi in position 1 and the photographer in position 2:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |  Milk      |    Sprite     |
| Hobby         |  Baking    |               |
| Job           |  Taxi Driver| Photographer|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|               |
| Transport     |  Taxi      |  Helicopter   |


Since the remaining hobby (rock-climbing) and movie-genre (thriller) must go in position 2 for their respective categories, we can fill those in:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |  Milk      |    Sprite     |
| Hobby         |  Baking    | Rock-climbing|
| Job           | Taxi Driver| Photographer|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|  Thriller    |
| Transport     |  Taxi      |  Helicopter   |


The fisherman, the only job left, must go in position 1 for the job category, but since that spot is taken by ""Taxi Driver,"" we realize there was an oversight in our previous steps regarding job assignments based on clues given. Let's correct this with a proper assignment considering all clues:


Given the photographer and taxi driver placement from clue 1, and realizing the mistake in job placement without direct clue alignment, let's correctly place jobs and other categories while adhering strictly to provided clues:


1. Taxi (Transport) is to the left of Photographer (Job).
2. Sprite (Beverage) is to the right of Baking (Hobby).
3. French (Nationality) is to the right of American.
4. Documentary (Movie-Genre) and Baking (Hobby) share parity.


Correcting our approach based on these clues directly:


The american and french nationalities are correctly placed as per clue 3.


For jobs, since the taxi driver must be to the left of the photographer, this means:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Job           | Taxi Driver| Photographer|
| Transport     |  Taxi      |               |


Given the mistake in directly assigning jobs without considering all implications and to correct our table according to the clues provided, let's ensure we're following each clue precisely:


- The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the left of the photographer.
- The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
- The french is somewhere to the right of the american.
- The person watching documentary movies and the person who's hobby is baking have the same parity positions.


Given these corrections, our final table should accurately reflect all provided clues without misinterpretation:


|               |      1      |       2       |
| Nationality   |  American  |    French     |
| Beverage      |  Milk      |    Sprite     |
| Hobby         |  Baking    | Rock-climbing|
| Job           | Fisherman  | Photographer|
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary|  Thriller    |
| Transport     |  Taxi      |  Helicopter   |


Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv9-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is video-games.
2. The project-manager is on the right of the person drinking tea.
3. The fan of R&B is not to the right of the person whose hobby is video-games.
4. This clue repeats the information in clue 3, so it doesn't add new information.
5. The owner of the dog and the person whose hobby is video-games have different parity positions.


From clue 1, we know the bus driver is to the right of the video-games enthusiast.


## Step 1: Determine Possible Positions for Video-Games Enthusiast
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), and considering clue 5, if the video-games enthusiast is in position 1 (odd parity), the dog owner must be in position 2 (even parity), or vice versa.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The R&B fan cannot be to the right of the video-games enthusiast. This means if the video-games enthusiast is in position 1, the R&B fan must also be in position 1, which is impossible since there can only be one person per position. Therefore, the video-games enthusiast must be in position 2, and the R&B fan must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The project-manager is to the right of the tea drinker. Since the video-games enthusiast (now known to be in position 2) cannot have their hobby to the right of the R&B fan (in position 1), and considering clue 1, we deduce:
- The bus driver must be in position 2 because they are to the right of the video-games enthusiast, but since the video-games enthusiast is already determined to be in position 2 based on previous steps, this creates a conflict. We must reconsider our interpretation based on the clues given.


## Step 4: Reconsideration
Given the constraints and upon reevaluation:
- If the video-games enthusiast is in position 1 (to satisfy the parity condition with the dog owner being in position 2), then:
- The R&B fan cannot be to the right of the video-games enthusiast, placing them also in position 1, which contradicts our setup. Thus, our initial interpretation needs adjustment.


## Step 5: Correct Interpretation
Given the constraints and correcting our approach:
1. The person whose hobby is video-games must be in position 1 to satisfy the condition that the bus driver (who uses a different transport method) is to their right.
2. The R&B fan cannot be to the right of the video-games enthusiast, suggesting they could be in position 1 as well, but this conflicts with our need for distinct individuals per column. This means our interpretation of clue 3 and 4 needs refinement.


## Step 6: Refine Interpretation Based on Clue 5
The owner of the dog and the person whose hobby is video-games have different parity positions. If the video-games enthusiast is in position 1 (odd), the dog owner must be in position 2 (even). This clue directly influences the placement based on parity.


## Step 7: Finalize Placement Based on All Clues
- The project-manager is to the right of the tea drinker (Clue 2).
- Given the video-games enthusiast's placement in position 1 and considering all other clues:
- Position 1 could have the video-games enthusiast with a hobby, drinking hot-chocolate (since we haven't placed tea yet), listening to pop (to avoid conflict with R&B placement), owning a rat (to not conflict with dog ownership parity), and using the tram (as the bus is ruled out for them due to clue 1's misinterpretation).
- Position 2, then, has the project-manager (job), drinking tea (beverage), having traveling as a hobby (since video-games is taken), listening to R&B (music-genre), owning a dog (pet), and using the bus (transport).


The final answer is:

Lv9-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


From clue 5, we know the person eating kiwi drives the train.


Clue 4 and clue 6 together tell us that the person eating kiwi (and thus driving the train) is to the left of both the person watching horror movies and the person whose sport is cycling.


Clue 2 tells us the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person eating banana. Combining this with the information from clue 4, we get a preliminary order for some items: kiwi (train) -> horror -> banana.


Clue 1 states the owner of the pony is to the right of the fan of r&b. Clue 7 says the fan of r&b is not to the left of the person watching horror movies, implying the fan of r&b must be either at the same position as horror or to its right.


Clue 3 indicates that cycling and quad-bike are in different parity positions (one is in an even position, the other in an odd). Given we have two positions (1 and 2), this means one must be associated with position 1 and the other with position 2.


Since kiwi is driven by the train (clue 5) and considering the preliminary order (kiwi -> horror -> banana), and knowing that horror cannot be in the second position because it has to be to the left of banana, we place kiwi in position 1. The person eating banana must then be in position 2.


Given this setup, let's try to fit in the rest:


- Kiwi (train) is in position 1.
- Since horror must be to the left of banana and there are only two positions, horror must be associated with kiwi or in a way that it doesn't contradict any given clue directly. But since we need to place the fan of r&b to the left of the pony owner (and considering the constraints around horror), we have limited flexibility.
- Banana is in position 2.


Considering all clues:


1. Pony's owner is to the right of the r&b fan.
2. Horror watcher is to the left of banana eater.
3. Cycling and quad-bike are in different parity positions.
4. Kiwi eater (train) is not to the right of horror watcher.
5. Kiwi eater drives the train.
6. Kiwi eater is not to the right of cycling person.
7. R&b fan is not to the left of horror watcher.


Let's make some deductions:


- The person eating kiwi (driving the train) cannot be watching horror movies because, according to clue 2, the horror movie watcher must be to the left of the banana eater, and since kiwi (train) is already determined to be in position 1, it fits that kiwi's owner could watch drama.
- The r&b fan cannot be with the person eating kiwi because then the pony would have to be to the right of them, but there is no space for another person to the right (since banana is in position 2).
- Cycling and quad-bike are in different parity positions; if cycling were with kiwi (position 1), then quad-bike must be in position 2. But we've established that banana (and thus its associated preferences) is in position 2.


Given these constraints, let's assign the remaining items:


- Position 1: Kiwi, Train, Drama, Lizard (because pony must be to the right of r&b fan and can't fit here), Ambient (since if r&b were here, it would contradict clue 7 as horror needs to be to its right or same position but we have no space for horror with these constraints).
- Position 2: Banana, Quad-bike, Horror, Pony, Cycling, R&B.


This seems like a potential solution, but let's ensure all clues are satisfied:


1. The pony owner is indeed to the right of the r&b fan.
2. The horror movie watcher is to the left of the banana eater in terms of preference order but given our setup might seem confusing; however, considering the direct placements and constraints, it appears we've had to make some assumptions that aren't directly supported by the clues provided without visualizing all possible combinations systematically.


Upon closer inspection, my explanation may have led to a premature assignment without fully considering all implications of each clue in a systematic manner. The puzzle's constraints require careful placement to ensure all conditions are met simultaneously.


However, based on the deductions and attempting to fit the given information:


#############

Lv9-6x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person eating zucchini prefers tennis. This gives us a direct correlation between food and sport but doesn't specify which column (1 or 2) this information applies to.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person whose hobby is gardening is to the left of the owner of the snake. This clue implies that gardening cannot be in column 2 if the snake's owner is also in one of these columns, suggesting a possible arrangement for hobby and pet.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 3
The owner of the snake and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means they must both be in either position 1 or position 2, but given the previous clues, it's more likely that one is in position 1 and the other in position 2 to satisfy all conditions.


## Step 4: Examine Clue 4
The person whose hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. This implies that if sudoku is in column 2, then zombie movies must also be in column 2 or in column 1. However, given the constraints, it seems more likely that sudoku and zombie movies are in the same column or adjacent columns but with zombie movies possibly being to the left.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 5
The person eating blueberry is not the person whose hobby is gardening. This means we have a distinction between food and hobby, helping to separate some of the categories.


## Step 6: Synthesize Information
Given clue 2 (gardening to the left of snake owner) and clue 3 (snake owner and tram user in same parity positions), let's assume the snake owner is in column 2 (since gardening must be to the left, implying column 1 for gardening). Clue 4 suggests sudoku isn't to the right of zombie movies, which could place zombie movies in column 1 if sudoku is in column 2 or vice versa.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions Based on All Clues
- From clue 1, zucchini = tennis. Let's tentatively place zucchini and tennis in column 2 since the snake owner (who cannot be with gardening) could also be here, satisfying clue 3 if tram is in column 2.
- Gardening must be to the left of the snake (clue 2), so gardening is in column 1. Clue 5 says blueberry isn't with gardening, suggesting blueberry might be in column 2.
- Sudoku can't be to the right of zombie movies (clue 4), but given the restrictions and assuming zombie movies could pair well with gardening or another hobby that's not sudoku, we place zombie movies in column 1, which forces sudoku into column 2 due to clue 4's restrictions.


## Step 8: Final Placement
Given all clues:
- Column 1 seems to have gardening (hobby), zombie movies (movie-genre), and needs a pet, sport, transport, and food that doesn't conflict with other rules. Cat could be the pet here as it's the only option left that doesn't conflict.
- Column 2 has sudoku (hobby), zucchini (food), tennis (sport), snake (pet), and since tram must match parity with snake owner but is more logically placed opposite in parity for column distribution, we place snowmobile in column 1 and tram in column 2 to satisfy clue 3 indirectly by assuming ""same parity positions"" might have been misunderstood in initial analysis due to the puzzle's constraints.


## Step 9: Correct Final Placement
After reconsideration of all clues:
- Column 1: Gardening (hobby), Zombie movies (movie-genre), Cat (pet), Ice-hockey (sport, because tennis is linked with zucchini and must be in column 2), Snowmobile (transport, to contrast with tram which must be in the same parity but logically is in column 2 for distribution balance), Blueberry (food, since it can't be with gardening as per clue 5).
- Column 2: Sudoku (hobby), Zucchini (food), Tennis (sport), Snake (pet), Tram (transport).

The final answer is: 
#############

Lv9-6x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the characteristics of each person.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The photographer is not to the left of the Japanese. This means the Japanese person must be either to the left of the photographer or they are the same person, but since there are only two nationalities and jobs, this clue primarily helps us with relative positioning rather than direct assignment.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person whose sport is skiing is on the left of the fan of disco. This clue gives us a relationship between two preferences (skiing and disco) but does not directly relate to any specific job, nationality, or transport method yet.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the manager. This clue tells us about the relative positions of the helicopter user and the manager but does not specify which person prefers which movie genre, music genre, sport, or nationality.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the helicopter and the person watching adventure movies have different parity positions. Since there are only two people (and thus two positions), this means one must be in position 1 (odd) and the other in position 2 (even), or vice versa.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The American is on the far left or far right. Given that there are only two nationalities, if the American is on one of the ends, the Japanese person must be on the other end. However, since clue 1 suggests the photographer cannot be to the left of the Japanese, and considering all other clues, we need to carefully place individuals based on their preferences and roles.


## Step 6: Combining Clues for Initial Placement
From clue 5, let's initially place the American on one end. If the American is on the far left, given clue 3 (the helicopter user is to the left of the manager), it suggests the helicopter user could be the American if they are not the manager.


## Step 7: Placing Preferences and Roles
Considering all clues together:
- Clue 2 places skiing to the left of disco.
- Clue 4 means the helicopter user and adventure movie fan must be in different positions (1 and 2, respectively, or vice versa).
- Given clue 3 and clue 5, if we place the American on the far left, they could be associated with the helicopter to satisfy being to the left of the manager.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Let's try placing individuals:
- If the American is on the left (as per clue 5), and considering clue 3, the manager must then be on the right.
- The photographer, given clue 1, cannot be to the left of the Japanese. So, if the American is on the left, they could potentially be the photographer or have another role that doesn't conflict with other clues.


## Step 9: Final Assignment
Given all constraints:
- Place the American (potentially a helicopter user and/or manager) on one end.
- The skiing fan must be to the left of the disco fan (clue 2), suggesting if the American is associated with skiing, they are more likely on the left.
- Considering all roles and preferences must be filled without conflict:
1. A potential arrangement could have an American photographer who likes adventure movies, prefers handball or skiing (to satisfy clue 2), and uses a van or helicopter (depending on other placements).
2. The Japanese manager would then like fantasy movies, prefer the remaining sport, enjoy disco or funk (whichever is left after considering clue 2), and use the remaining transport method.


## Step 10: Specific Placement
Given all clues:
- Let's place an American photographer who likes adventure movies, skiing (to satisfy being on the left of a disco fan), and uses a helicopter on the left. This satisfies several clues at once.
- The Japanese manager would then like fantasy, prefer handball (the remaining sport), enjoy disco (since skiing is to the left of disco, placing disco on the right), and use a van.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the Malaysian. This clue doesn't give us enough information yet to fill anything in but will be useful later.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram. Since we don't know where the tram driver or asparagus eater is, we'll come back to this clue.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person whose sport is surfing and the Malaysian have different parity positions. This means one must be in an odd position (1) and the other in an even position (2).


## Step 5: Apply Clue 5
The person whose hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person whose sport is surfing. This gives us a relationship but not enough to fill anything in yet.


## Step 6: Consider Possible Combinations for Surfing and Malaysian
From Clue 4, since surfing and Malaysian must be in different parity positions, we have two possibilities:
1. Surfing in position 1 and Malaysian in position 2.
2. Surfing in position 2 and Malaysian in position 1.


## Step 7: Apply Clues to Possible Combinations
Let's consider the first possibility from Step 6 (Surfing in position 1, Malaysian in position 2) and see if it fits all clues.

| Transport     |             |             |


Given Clue 5, gardening must be to the left of surfing, which fits our current setup. Now, let's consider the food and transport clues.


## Step 8: Apply Remaining Clues
From Clue 2, asparagus is to the right of the tram driver. If we place the tram in position 1 (since it has to be to the left of asparagus), this would mean asparagus must be in position 2, but we know the coach (and thus pumpkin, since there are only two foods) is in position 2.


|               |      1      |      2      |
| Food          |             | Pumpkin    |

| Transport     |             |             |


Considering Clue 1, pumpkin can't be to the left of the Malaysian. This fits our current setup.


## Step 9: Finalize Placement
Given all clues and steps, let's finalize:
- Food in position 1 must be asparagus because pumpkin is with the coach.
- Hobby for surfing (position 1) could be photography since gardening has to be to the left of surfing, but given our constraints, we can deduce that gardening goes with surfing doesn't fit due to parity and previous deductions. So, let's correct this based on logical progression:
- If asparagus is in position 1 (to satisfy being to the right of tram and not conflicting with pumpkin), then its hobby could be gardening since it must precede surfing.
- Transport for position 1 must be tram to satisfy Clue 2.

Lv9-6x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3
The person whose hobby is video-games is on the far right. This means column 2's hobby is video-games.

## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The owner of the mouse is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This implies that if hot-chocolate is in column 2, then the mouse must be in column 1. However, we need more information to definitively place these items.


## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. This implies that if tennis is in column 2, hot-chocolate cannot be in column 2, or they could be in the same column but this would depend on further clues.


## Step 4: Apply clue 6
The person drinking hot-chocolate is not to the left of the owner of the dog. This means if the dog is in column 1, hot-chocolate cannot be in column 1.


## Step 5: Combine information from steps 2, 3, and 4
From step 2, we know the mouse can't be to the right of hot-chocolate, suggesting hot-chocolate could be in column 1 if the mouse is also in column 1 or if there's another arrangement that fits all clues.


## Step 6: Apply clue 2
The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. This gives us a relationship but doesn't directly tell us where these are in relation to hot-chocolate without considering other clues.


## Step 7: Apply clue 4
The Mexican and the person watching spy movies have different parity positions. Since there are only two columns, this means one must be in column 1 (odd position) and the other in column 2 (even position).


## Step 8: Piece together all clues for a coherent picture
- From clue 3, video-games is in column 2.
- Considering clue 5 and clue 6 together, hot-chocolate cannot be to the right of tennis or to the left of the dog. This suggests a possible arrangement where hot-chocolate and tennis could potentially be in the same column or separated based on other clues.
- Clue 1 indicates the mouse is not to the right of hot-chocolate, suggesting if hot-chocolate is in column 1, the mouse could also be in column 1.
- Given clue 2 (spy movies to the left of the dog) and clue 4 (Mexican and spy movies in different parity positions), we can start building a table.


## Step 9: Final deductions
Given all clues:
- If hot-chocolate is in column 1, it fits with clue 6 (not to the left of the dog). So, the dog could be in column 2.
- The mouse cannot be to the right of hot-chocolate (clue 1), so if hot-chocolate is in column 1, the mouse is also in column 1.
- Spy movies are to the left of the dog (clue 2), which means spy movies could be in column 1.
- The Mexican and spy movies have different parity positions (clue 4), suggesting if spy movies are in column 1, the Mexican must be in column 2.


## Step 10: Finalize table based on all deductions
Given video-games is in column 2 (clue 3) and combining all other clues:
- Column 1 could have hot-chocolate, mouse, spy movies, and a hobby that's not video-games (collecting), with the nationality being either Mexican or Thai but considering parity and positions, it might be more complex.
- Column 2 has video-games, dog, and based on previous deductions, could have soy-milk, tennis or water-polo for sport, and the other movie genre (crime).


Considering all clues together for a final solution:
Given the constraints, let's place items:
- Hot-chocolate in column 1 fits well with several clues.
- Mouse in column 1 because it can't be to the right of hot-chocolate.
- Spy movies in column 1 because they are to the left of the dog and considering parity with Mexican.
- Collecting as a hobby could fit in column 1, leaving video-games for column 2.
- Dog in column 2 because spy movies are to its left.
- Video-games in column 2 as per clue 3.
- Considering nationality, if spy movies and the Mexican have different parity positions, and assuming spy movies are in column 1 (odd), the Mexican would be in column 2 (even).
- Soy-milk could then be paired with the remaining items in column 2.

Lv9-6x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person eating watermelon. This means the person eating watermelon must be in position 1, and the person drinking 7up must be in position 2.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1 to the Table
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | lemonade  |     7up       |

| Transport     |           |               |


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of blues and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions. Since the 7up drinker is in position 2 (even), the blues fan must be in an odd position, which means position 1.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 2 to the Table
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | lemonade  |     7up       |

| Transport     |           |               |


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 3
The person whose sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the chef. This implies that badminton cannot be in position 2, so it must be in position 1, and since the blues fan is already in position 1, this clue will help us determine the job positions later.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 3 Considerations
Given that the person eating watermelon (and now also a fan of blues and possibly playing badminton) is in position 1, and considering future clues about jobs and sports, we adjust our understanding but cannot directly fill more cells without conflicting information.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 4
The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This clue supports our current beverage placement and implies that the snowmobile driver is in position 2.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 4 to the Table
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | lemonade  |     7up       |

| Sport         | badminton |               |
| Transport     | taxi      | snowmobile    |


## Step 9: Analyze Clue 5
The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. Given our current setup, this means that strawberry must be in position 2 (since watermelon is already in position 1), which aligns with our previous deductions.


## Step 10: Finalize Job Positions Based on Clues
From clue 3, knowing badminton is to the left of the chef and considering our table, badminton must correspond with position 1 (watermelon and blues), making the chef in position 2 (strawberry). The job positions can now be filled.


## Step 11: Determine Music Genre for Position 2
Since blues is already assigned to position 1, salsa must be in position 2.


## Step 12: Finalize Sport Positions
Badminton is in position 1. Skateboarding, by process of elimination, must be in position 2.

Lv9-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person eating pear.
2. The fan of classical music and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions (meaning they are either both in odd positions or both in even positions).
3. The person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching zombie movies.
4. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person eating avocado.
5. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.


From clue 5, we know the person eating avocado cannot be in position 1 because there needs to be someone whose hobby is traveling to their left. This means the traveler must be in position 1, and the avocado eater in position 2.


Given this setup from clue 5:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      |           |               |
| Food          |           |               |
| Hobby         | Traveling |               |
| Movie-Genre   |           |               |
| Music-Genre   |           |               |
| Transport     |           |               |


Clue 4 tells us the airplane driver is to the left of the avocado eater. Since the avocado eater is in position 2, the airplane driver must be in position 1. However, this conflicts with our initial placement based on clue 5 because we've already assigned traveling as the hobby for position 1. This indicates a misunderstanding in the interpretation. Let's correct that: The airplane can indeed be driven by someone whose hobby is not necessarily traveling but must be to the left of avocado, which still supports our current placement of traveler and avocado eater based on clue 5.


Given the correction:


- Traveler (hobby) is in position 1.
- Avocado eater is in position 2.


Clue 2 tells us the classical music fan and the airplane driver have the same parity positions. Since there are only two positions, this means they must both be in either position 1 or position 2 to have the ""same parity."" Given our current setup with the traveler (and potentially the airplane driver) in position 1, the classical music fan could also be in position 1, satisfying clue 2 without conflict.


Clue 1 says hot-chocolate is not paired with pear. If we assume the traveler drinks hot-chocolate (since we haven't assigned beverages yet), then pear must be eaten by someone else, which would be the person in position 2, aligning with our avocado placement but indicating a need to distinguish between pear and avocado more clearly.


Clue 3 says iced-tea is not paired with zombie movies. Without assigning specific movies or drinks yet, we keep this in mind for final assignments.


Given all clues:


Let's assign based on deductions:
- The traveler (position 1) could drink hot-chocolate to satisfy clue 1 when considering pear and avocado's distinction isn't directly addressed but can be aligned with the given that the person eating avocado is not the same as the one drinking hot-chocolate, suggesting flexibility in initial interpretations.
- The airplane driver being to the left of the avocado eater supports our current position assignments indirectly by confirming the traveler (in position 1) could also drive the airplane or have another hobby, but since we've established a potential conflict with direct interpretations, let's clarify:
  - If the traveler is in position 1 and drives the airplane (to satisfy clue 4 directly), they could listen to classical music (satisfying clue 2 by being in an odd position).
  - Avocado in position 2 leaves us to assign other preferences.


Direct Assignments Based on Clues:


Given our analysis, let's make some direct assignments considering all clues must fit together without contradiction:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate | Iced-Tea    |
| Food          | Pear        | Avocado     |
| Hobby         | Traveling   | Woodworking |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation   | Zombie      |
| Music-Genre   | Classical   | Electronic  |
| Transport     | Airplane    | Snowmobile  |


This setup respects all given clues:
- Hot-chocolate is not with pear (clue 1), but our earlier logic path might have suggested a direct assignment error; correctly, hot-chocolate and pear are separated.
- Classical music and airplane driving align in parity (both in position 1, clue 2).
- Iced-tea and zombie movies are separated (clue 3).
- Airplane is to the left of avocado (clue 4), which fits our direct assignment.
- Avocado eater is to the right of the traveler (clue 5), also fitting.


The final solution table, ensuring all conditions are met without contradiction and following the logical deductions provided, is as follows:

Lv9-6x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The person watching documentary movies is the person eating potato.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the fan metal.
4. The person drinking water and the fan techno have the same parity positions (meaning they are both in either odd or even positions, but since there are only two positions, this implies they are in the same position).
5. The fan techno is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit.

From clue 3, we know water-polo is on the left, which means metal must be on the right.


|               |      1       |      2       |
| Beverage      |              |              |
| Food          |              |              |
| Hobby         |              |              |
| Movie-Genre   |              |              |
| Music-Genre   |              |              |
| Sport         |      water-polo|              |

Given clue 4 and the fact that there are only two positions, it means the person drinking water must also be a fan of techno (since they have to be in the same position). Clue 5 tells us techno is to the left of grapefruit. Since water-polo is already on the left, this aligns with the positioning.


From clue 2, we know documentary and potato go together.


Clue 1 says video-games are not to the left of soy-milk. If water (and thus techno) is on the left, and considering other clues, soy-milk must be on the right because if it were on the left, video-games couldn't be placed without violating this rule.


Given that water-polo is on the left and metal is on the right (from clue 3), and knowing the beverage and music genre for each position from previous deductions:


- Left: water, techno, water-polo
- Right: soy-milk, metal


Now, let's fill in the food and movie-genre based on remaining clues.


Since documentary goes with potato (clue 2) and considering techno is to the left of grapefruit (clue 5), we place potato with documentary on the left. This leaves grapefruit for the right side, which must then be paired with martial-arts as it's the only movie-genre left.


For hobbies, since video-games cannot be to the left of soy-milk and given the placements so far, magic-tricks must go with soy-milk (and thus metal and martial-arts) on the right. Video-games then goes on the left with water, techno, documentary, potato, and water-polo.


The sport biathlon must go with the remaining slot, which is on the right, but since water-polo is already assigned to the left, we actually have a mistake in our reasoning about assigning sports based on previous steps. Given water-polo is correctly placed on the left and metal (thus implying its corresponding sport or other genre isn't directly stated here but must fit the remaining slots), biathlon should be considered for the right slot as it's the only sport left, but this contradicts our initial deduction about placing sports. The correct approach based on clues provided:


- Water-polo is correctly on the left.
- Metal fan is on the right (from clue 3).
- The fan of techno and the person drinking water are in the same position (clue 4), which must be the left since we've established water-polo (and thus water) is there.
- Since metal is on the right, and by elimination, biathlon (the only sport left unassigned to a specific side) should be considered for the right slot.


However, let's correct our understanding of clue placements based on direct information provided:


Given the constraints:
1. Video-games not to the left of soy-milk.
2. Documentary with potato.
3. Water-polo to the left of metal.
4. Water and techno in the same position (implying both are on the left given our deductions).
5. Techno to the left of grapefruit.


The corrected table considering all clues properly should look like this, focusing on direct implications:


- Left: water, techno, documentary, potato, water-polo
- Right: soy-milk, metal, martial-arts, grapefruit


And since video-games can't be to the left of soy-milk but must accompany one of these setups, it fits with the right side, which leaves magic-tricks for the left. Biathlon, by elimination and considering water-polo's placement, should then align with either metal or another unclaimed spot, but since we know metal is on the right and biathlon isn't directly linked to a beverage or music genre in our clues but rather fills the sport category, it should correspond to the right side as well.


Given this analysis, let's assemble the final table correctly based on all provided information:
