Lv9-3x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Two different movie genres: epic, superhero.
2. Two different nationalities: Australian, Malaysian.
3. Two different means of transport: jet-ski, roller.
4. The person driving the roller is on the right of the Malaysian.
5. The person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions.

From point 4, we know the arrangement must be:
- Malaysian on the left
- Roller on the right

So, the transport for the left column must be jet-ski (since roller is on the right), and for the right column, it's roller.

Given point 5, since the person driving the jet-ski (left) and the person watching epic movies are in the same parity positions, this means they must both be in either the first or second position of their respective categories. However, considering the structure of our puzzle, ""same parity positions"" implies that if one is in an odd position (1st), the other must also be in an odd position regarding their category list. Since there are only two options for each category and they're already paired with specific transport methods, we deduce:

- The jet-ski driver watches epic movies because both are associated with the left side (odd position in a list starting from 1), and this satisfies the condition of having the same parity.

Now, let's assemble the information into the table format based on our deductions:

Given that the Malaysian is on the left and prefers epic movies (since the jet-ski driver watches epic movies), and knowing the roller is on the right, we can start filling in the blanks:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Malaysian| Australian|
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Roller    |

So, the final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Superhero |

Lv9-3x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person who owns a dog and the person who watches martial-arts movies are in the same parity positions (both odd or both even).
2. The person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left.

Given that there are only two rows for each category and considering the clues:

- From clue 3, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1 (far left).
- Since the martial-arts fan and the dog owner have the same parity positions (clue 1), and given the martial-arts fan is in an odd position (position 1), the dog owner must also be in an odd position, which means the dog owner can only be in position 1 as well.
- However, clue 2 tells us that the tea drinker and the dog owner have different parity positions. Given the dog owner is in position 1 (odd), the tea drinker must be in position 2 (even).
- This leaves hot-chocolate for position 1 (since tea is taken by position 2) because each beverage, movie genre, and pet can only be assigned once.
- Since martial-arts is already assigned to position 1, sports must go to position 2.
- Lastly, with the dog in position 1 (because it shares the same parity as martial-arts and tea is in position 2, thus the dog cannot be there due to different parity requirement for tea and dog owner), hamster goes to position 2.

So, putting it all together:

Lv9-3x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the parity positions based on clue 1
The person whose hobby is hiking and the person drinking milk have the same parity positions. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), one must be odd (position 1) and the other even (position 2). This means that if the hiker is in position 1, the milk drinker must also be in an odd position, but since there's no third position, this implies they cannot both be in the first position. Thus, one of them must be in the second position, making the other also in an even position if we were considering more positions, but here it means they are either both in odd or both in even positions based on a broader interpretation. However, given our specific case with only two slots, this clue essentially tells us that either both activities (hiking and drinking milk) are associated with the same person, or they are in separate positions but share the parity, which is naturally satisfied since position 1 is odd and position 2 is even.


## Step 2: Apply clue 2 to determine the relative positions of hiking and milk
The person whose hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person drinking milk. This means if the hiker is in position 2, the milk drinker must be in position 1, because the only way for the hiker not to be to the left of the milk drinker is for the milk drinker to be to the left of the hiker or for them to have a specific arrangement that satisfies this condition given the constraints.


## Step 3: Apply clue 3 to determine the position of the frog owner relative to the hiker
The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is hiking. This means if the hiker is in position 2, the frog owner must be in position 1 because that's the only position to the left.


## Step 4: Combine all clues to determine the final arrangement
Given clue 2 and clue 3 together, it seems we have a conflict unless we place the milk drinker and the frog owner in the same person in position 1, which would then allow the hiker (who could be drinking soy-milk based on the table's initial setup) to be in position 2. This satisfies all conditions: the frog owner is to the left of the hiker (clue 3), and the hiker is not to the left of the milk drinker (clue 2). The only beverages mentioned are milk and soy-milk, and since one person drinks soy-milk (as per the initial table setup), this must be the hiker in position 2.


## Step 5: Finalize the arrangement based on given options
- Position 1: Milk drinker, frog owner, hobby not specified but must be sudoku to not conflict with other clues.
- Position 2: Soy-milk drinker, hiker, pet not specified but must be ferret since the other pet (frog) is already assigned.


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv9-3x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions step by step.


1. The person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions.
   - This means both are either in odd or even positions. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this implies that the person who drinks cola and the person who watches romance movies must be in the same position, because both positions are of different parities (1 is odd, 2 is even). Therefore, one person must like cola and romance.


2. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
   - This means if the person drinking milk is in position 1, the frog's owner must be in position 2. If the person drinking milk were in position 2, there would be no one to the right, so this scenario isn't possible.


Given these conditions:


- From condition 1, since cola and romance are liked by the same person (due to parity), let's assign them to position 1 for now as it satisfies both being in an odd position. This gives us:
  
|               |      1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Cola        |         |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance     |         |
| Pet           |             |         |

- Condition 2 tells us the frog is to the right of milk. If we place milk in position 1, it contradicts our initial placement based on condition 1 (since cola and romance should be together). Thus, milk must be in position 2 for this scenario not to contradict any conditions directly:
  
|               |      1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Cola        | Milk    |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance     |         |
| Pet           |             |         |

- Since the frog's owner must be to the right of milk, but milk is now in position 2, this creates a conflict because there is no ""right"" of position 2. This means our initial assumption about placing cola and romance together in position 1 needs reevaluation based on the conditions given.


Reevaluating Condition 1 with the understanding that both must be in positions of the same parity (and realizing my earlier interpretation might have been too narrow), let's consider if they could both be in even positions or odd positions but not necessarily in the same row for the same person:


- Given there are only two rows and considering condition 2 more directly: If milk is in position 1, then the frog must be in position 2. This fulfills one condition directly without assuming cola and romance's positions prematurely.


Let's try placing milk in position 1 and fulfill condition 2 by placing the frog (and thus its owner) in position 2:


|               |      1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | Milk        |         |
| Movie-Genre   |             |         |
| Pet           |             | Frog    |

Now, considering cola and romance must be of the same parity but realizing that with only two positions (odd and even), they essentially have to match up in a way that respects condition 1 without direct placement error:


- If we place cola in position 2 (to fulfill the beverage requirement and keep it flexible for now), we're left with romance needing to be in an even position as well, which would mean both are liked by the same person due to the constraints provided.


Given this analysis and correcting the logic path considering parity and the conditions:


The corrected approach should align cola with romance (as they need to match in parity) and ensure milk is placed so that the frog's owner can be to their right. However, my initial explanation may have caused confusion by not directly applying these conditions to reach a straightforward table solution.


To directly solve it based on given conditions without overcomplicating:


1. Milk cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no one to the right of milk for the frog's owner (condition 2). So, milk is likely in position 1.


2. Given cola and romance have the same parity positions, this implies they are associated with the same person due to the limited options (only two positions), but this interpretation may not directly apply as initially thought since it was based on an incorrect extension of the conditions.


3. Correctly applying condition 2: If milk is in position 1, the frog must be in position 2.


4. Considering cola and romance together under correct parity conditions within these constraints actually suggests a simpler alignment where one person enjoys cola and romance (to satisfy the same parity), which was an overcomplication given the direct statements of the puzzle.


Let's finalize with a straightforward application of the rules:


Given the constraints, let's place milk in position 1 to satisfy condition 2 directly by allowing the frog (and its owner) to be in position 2. Cola then goes with romance due to parity considerations but must align with one of these positions while respecting all given conditions.


Since we know the person drinking cola and watching romance movies are in the same position type (odd or even), and considering our corrected understanding that milk is likely in position 1, this allows us to place cola and romance together without violating any rules, especially when we acknowledge the mistake in over-interpreting parity without direct placement.


The final answer is:

Lv9-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing the first clue
The first clue states that the person whose hobby is writing and the person whose sport is ice-hockey have different parity positions. This means one of them must be in position 1 (odd) and the other in position 2 (even).


## Step 2: Analyzing the second clue
The second clue tells us that the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since there are only two positions, this means the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in position 1, and thus the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Determining the hobby for each position based on clue 1
Given that the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 1 (from step 2), and from clue 1 that this person and the one whose hobby is writing are in different parity positions, the writer must be in position 2.


## Step 4: Filling in the movie genre for each position
From step 2, we know the person watching mystery movies is in position 2. This means the person in position 1 watches animation, as those are the only two genres mentioned.


## Step 5: Determining the sport for each position
We've already established from clue 2 that the person whose sport is ice-hockey is in position 1. Therefore, the person in position 2 must prefer cycling.


## Step 6: Finalizing the hobby for each position
From step 3, we know the writer is in position 2. Since writing and card-games are the two hobbies mentioned, the person in position 1 must enjoy card-games.

Lv9-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating raspberry and the person whose sport is badminton have the same parity positions. This means they are either both in odd positions (1) or both in even positions (2).
2. The Turkish person is on the right of the person eating raspberry.

Given the foods, nationalities, and sports:

- Foods: raspberry, tomato
- Nationalities: French, Turkish
- Sports: badminton, skiing

Let's start by placing the raspberry eater and the badminton player in the same parity position based on clue 1. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), they must both be in either position 1 or position 2 to satisfy the ""same parity"" requirement.

From clue 2, we know the Turkish person is to the right of the raspberry eater. This means the raspberry eater cannot be in position 2 because then there would be no one to the right of them for the Turkish person to be placed.

So, let's place the raspberry eater in position 1 and the badminton player also in an odd position (which is only possible if we consider ""same parity"" to mean both are in position 1 or both could be in even positions but since there's only two slots, this interpretation might slightly differ). However, given our constraint of two slots and interpreting the clue strictly:

- If raspberry is in slot 1, badminton must also be associated with slot 1 due to parity (but this can't directly happen as each slot has a unique sport, food, and nationality), so we interpret it as both being on the same side of the parity (odd or even), which means badminton should ideally be in an ""even"" position if raspberry is in an odd one for them not to conflict but given our constraints, this direct placement isn't possible. Thus, we focus on the nationality clue.

Given that Turkish must be to the right of raspberry and assuming raspberry can't be in slot 2 (as per initial reasoning), let's re-evaluate:

- If the person eating raspberry is in position 1 (to satisfy the condition of being to the left of the Turkish person), then:
  - Position 1: Raspberry
  - Given badminton and raspberry share parity, but must be distinct entities, we'll need to reconsider how these fit with the nationalities.

Considering all combinations while respecting the clues:

- Since Turkish is on the right of raspberry (clue 2), if raspberry is in position 1, then Turkish cannot be in position 1. This implies:
  - Position 1 could have French (as nationality) eating raspberry.
  - Position 2 would then have Turkish and must eat tomato.

Now, matching sports with these positions while keeping the parity clue for badminton and raspberry:

- Given that raspberry is in an odd position (1), and if we associate badminton with the even position to maintain ""same parity"" indirectly by being on opposite sides but respecting distinct slot allocations:
  - Position 1: Raspberry, French, Badminton
  - Position 2: Tomato, Turkish, Skiing

This seems a plausible arrangement given the constraints. However, it's critical to note that my explanation aimed to logically deduce based on provided clues and might have simplified or interpreted ""same parity positions"" in the context of available slots.

The final solution table is:

Lv9-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll fill in the table step by step based on the clues provided.


Given:
- Hobbies: camping, magic-tricks
- Music-Genres: classical, r&b
- Pets: frog, rabbit


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose hobby is camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions. This means if the camper is in position 1 (odd), the rabbit owner must be in position 2 (even), and vice versa.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical music. Since there are only two positions, this implies that the frog's owner must be in position 1 because they have to be to the left of someone who likes classical music, regardless of whether that person is in position 1 or 2.


## Step 3: Combine Clues
From Clue 2, we know the frog owner is in position 1. Using Clue 1, if the camper were in position 1 (with the frog), then the rabbit would have to be in position 2, which doesn't directly conflict with any given information but let's see how it fits with all clues.


## Step 4: Apply Clues to Table
Let's assume:
- Position 1 is the frog owner because they must be on the left of the classical music fan.
- Given that camping and rabbit have different parity positions, if the camper (with the frog) were in position 1, then the rabbit would indeed be in a different parity position (2), which fits.


## Step 5: Determine Music Genre for Each
Since the frog owner must be to the left of the classical fan, and assuming the frog owner is also the camper (based on our earlier assumption for simplicity):
- Position 1 could potentially like r&b if we consider the camping hobby and the pet (frog) without directly assigning music genres yet.
- However, Clue 2 specifically mentions the frog's owner being to the left of the classical fan, suggesting that position 2 likes classical music.


## Step 6: Finalize Table
Let's finalize with actual assignments:
- Position 1: Camping as a hobby (to fulfill different parity for camping and rabbit), owns a frog (since they're on the left of the classical fan), and for simplicity in assignment, let's say they like r&b.
- Position 2: Magic-tricks as a hobby (by elimination), owns a rabbit (different parity from camper), and likes classical music.

Lv9-3x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The fan of country music and the person whose sport is baseball have the same parity positions (meaning they are either both in odd-numbered positions or both in even-numbered positions).
2. The fan of metal music is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
3. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person whose sport is baseball.

Given there are only two positions, we can deduce:

- From point 3, since the scooter driver must be to the right of the baseball fan, and considering there are only two positions (1 and 2), if the baseball fan were in position 2, there would be no room to the right for the scooter driver. Thus, the baseball fan must be in position 1.
- From point 1, since the country music fan shares the same parity position as the baseball fan, and knowing the baseball fan is in an odd-numbered position (position 1), the country music fan must also be in an odd-numbered position. However, given there are only two positions and one of them is already determined to be for the baseball fan (and thus potentially the country music fan if they were the same person or if we're considering parity), this means the country music fan cannot occupy a separate odd position without contradicting the setup that implies distinct individuals or interests per row. Thus, it suggests the country and baseball preferences could be held by the same individual, or we are focusing on the fact that both preferences (country music and baseball) must align in terms of being associated with either the first or second position based on parity, but given our constraints, they likely represent the same person or are directly related in positioning.
- From point 2, knowing the metal fan cannot be to the right of the scooter driver, and considering the country fan (or the individual who prefers country music) is already linked with the baseball preference potentially in position 1 (to satisfy parity and the given constraints), this means the metal fan must also be in position 1 or there's an implication that needs clarification based on the direct positioning of individuals relative to their preferences. However, since we've established a link between country music, baseball, and the first position due to parity and the constraints provided, it seems we have a conflict unless the metal preference is directly tied to an individual who can only occupy the second position if we're strictly interpreting the ""not to the right"" as implying the metal fan could be in the same position under different circumstances. Yet, this doesn't align with our setup since we need distinct associations for each type of preference.

Given these constraints and clarifying the potential misunderstandings:

- The baseball fan must be in position 1 (to allow the scooter driver to be to their right).
- The country music fan is implied to share a parity position with the baseball fan, suggesting they are also in an odd position, which would be position 1 if we consider direct association or shared individual preferences.
- The metal fan cannot be to the right of the scooter driver, implying if the scooter driver is in position 2 (as deduced from point 3), then the metal fan must also be associated with position 1 or this implies a specific arrangement where metal and country are distinguished by their association with other categories.

However, upon closer examination and considering we have to fit all these preferences into just two slots while respecting parity, direct associations, and ""to the right of"" conditions:

- If the baseball fan is in position 1 (as deduced), and assuming the country music preference aligns due to parity or shared individual interest:
  - The scooter driver must be in position 2.
  - Given the metal fan cannot be to the right of the scooter driver, this suggests a potential misinterpretation since if the scooter driver is in position 2, there's no ""right"" position left. Thus, it implies the metal fan could be associated with position 1 or 2 but must precede the scooter in some logical arrangement considering all constraints.

Given these logical steps and acknowledging potential for misunderstanding based on the conditions provided:

The direct implications from our deductions considering parity, positioning to the right, and the constraints about music genres and sports are somewhat conflicting without assuming specific overlaps (like country and baseball being associated with one individual). However, we need a clear allocation based on the clues:

1. Baseball is in position 1.
2. Country music shares parity with baseball; thus, it could also be associated with position 1 or considered as part of an overlapping preference set.
3. The scooter driver is in position 2 because they must be to the right of the baseball fan.
4. Metal cannot be to the right of the scooter, implying metal's association must be with position 1 if we consider direct placement without overlap.

Considering ice-hockey and snowmobiles haven't been directly placed yet but are part of the preferences:

- Ice-hockey would naturally fit with the remaining slot not taken by baseball in terms of sports.
- Snowmobiles, as a means of transport not scooter, could only fit into the remaining category slot after considering all other placements.

Therefore, synthesizing all information and acknowledging potential direct associations or overlaps between categories for individuals:

#############
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Country   | Metal     |
| Sport         | Baseball  | Ice-Hockey|
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Scooter   |
#############

This arrangement respects the given constraints: country and baseball share parity in position 1, metal is not to the right of the scooter (as it's associated with position 1 or considered before the scooter in a logical sequence), and the scooter driver is indeed to the right of the baseball fan. Ice-hockey and snowmobile fit into the remaining slots naturally based on the preferences outlined."

## Step 2: Analyze the statement about time-travel movies and lacrosse.
The person watching time-travel movies and the person whose sport is lacrosse have different parity positions. Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means one must be in position 1 and the other in position 2.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the person whose sport is lacrosse.
Given that the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the far right, we can fill in the Sport row as follows:

## Step 4: Combine information to determine the movie genre for each person.
Since the person watching time-travel movies and the person whose sport is lacrosse have different parity positions, and knowing the lacrosse player is in position 2, the time-travel movie fan must be in position 1. The other movie genre (zombie) must then be paired with lacrosse in position 2.

1. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the bus.
2. The American and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions.

Given:
- Movie Genres: Mystery, Romance
- Nationalities: American, Colombian
- Transport: Bus, Quad-bike

Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, since the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the bus, and considering there are only two positions (left and right), the person watching romance must be in position 1, and the bus must be in position 2.

From clue 2, if the American and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions, and knowing that the person watching romance is in position 1 (odd parity), the American must be in an even parity position, which means the American is also in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table based on this analysis:

Since the person watching romance is in position 1, and we know from clue 1 that this person is to the left of the bus driver, the transport associated with romance cannot be the bus (as it would then not be to the left of the bus). Therefore, romance must be paired with the quad-bike.

This leaves mystery to be paired with the bus in position 2. 

Given the American is in position 2 and the only remaining nationality for position 1 is Colombian, we have:
