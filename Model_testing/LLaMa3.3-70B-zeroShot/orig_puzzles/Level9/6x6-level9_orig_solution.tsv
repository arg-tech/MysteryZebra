This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Note that the table is read from left to right, with position 1 being the far left and position 6 being the far right. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 38, the french person must be on either end.
* Clue 47 places tea between frog and coffee, while clue 30 puts juice to the right of rat, and clue 29 puts juice to the right of rat. 
* With these constraints in mind, we can start building the table from the ends and work our way inwards, using each clue to narrow down the possibilities for each position.
* Clue 35 tells us that cooking is on the far right (position 6).
* Using a combination of clues 3, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, we can determine the order of several pairs and groups of items.
* Clue 25 tells us that dancing is to the right of baking, while clue 23 puts dancing to the right of baking. 
* With all these constraints in mind, the solution begins to take shape, and by process of elimination and using each clue to inform our decisions, we arrive at the final table.
