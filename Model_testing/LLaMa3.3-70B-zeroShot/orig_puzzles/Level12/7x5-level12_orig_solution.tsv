#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and their respective numbers. It's a complex puzzle that requires careful analysis of each clue to arrive at the correct solution. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues helped solve the puzzle:

* Clue 11 fixes the person eating pomegranate on the far left.
* Clue 13 places the musician to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
* Clue 28 indicates that the social-worker and the person eating pomegranate have different parity positions, which helps place the social-worker in column 1.
* Clue 36 reveals that the person driving the helicopter is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, which helps place the helicopter in column 1 and the magic-tricks hobby in column 2.
* Clue 16 restricts the scientific movie genre to either the far left or far right. Given other constraints, it fits best on the far left.
* Clue 4 indicates that the musician and the person who's sport is snowboarding have different parity positions, which helps place snowboarding in column 3 (since the musician is already in an even position).
* Clue 25 restricts the raspberry eater to be next to the radish eater. Given other constraints, they fit best in columns 2 and 5.
* Clue 17 places the musician between the fantasy movie genre and the turtle owner. This helps solidify the positions of these elements.
* Clue 30 provides two possibilities for the helicopter driver, but given other clues, it's most likely that the helicopter driver is also the raspberry eater or the mouse owner.
* Clue 38 indicates that the firefighter and the grapes eater have different parity positions, helping to place them in columns 2 and 3 respectively.

By carefully considering all the clues and their implications on each other, we arrive at the solution table above."
