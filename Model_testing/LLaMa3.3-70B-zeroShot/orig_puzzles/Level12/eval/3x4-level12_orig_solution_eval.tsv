Lv12-3x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the table as we gather information.


Given:
- Foods: apple, avocado, nectarine, pepper
- Nationalities: Brazilian, French, Japanese, Spanish
- Transports: car, jet-ski, quad-bike, train


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person eating pepper is either Japanese or the one driving the car, but not both. This gives us two possibilities for pepper.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 2 and 13
Avocado is to the right of pepper (Clue 2), and avocado cannot be to the left of pepper (Clue 13). This confirms the order as pepper -> avocado.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clues 3, 4, and 8
The person driving the car is to the left of both nectarine and apple eaters (Clues 3 and 4), and also to the left of the Brazilian (Clue 8). This suggests the car driver cannot be in position 4.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 5
The train driver is not to the right of the jet-ski driver. This clue helps with transport order but doesn't directly inform food or nationality yet.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clues 6 and 7
The quad-bike driver is not to the left of the Japanese (Clue 6), and nectarine eater is to the right of the quad-bike driver (Clue 7). This gives a sequence but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clues 9 and 10
The car driver is to the left of the French (Clue 9), and the train driver and French have different parity positions (Clue 10). This implies one is in an odd position, the other in an even.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 11
Apple eater is not the jet-ski driver or not Spanish. Since this involves ""or,"" it gives us flexibility but doesn't directly place anyone yet.


## Step 8: Analyzing Clues 12 and 14
Spanish is between train driver and apple eater (Clue 12), and apple eater is to the right of avocado eater (Clue 14). This starts to solidify the order for foods.


Given all these clues, let's start placing people based on the most restrictive clues first:


1. From Clues 3, 4, and 8, car driver must be in position 1 because they need to be to the left of nectarine, apple, and Brazilian.
2. Since avocado is to the right of pepper (Clue 2), and considering other food placements, a likely order starts to form: pepper, avocado, then either nectarine or apple.
3. Given Clue 14, apple must be after avocado, which helps confirm the sequence as pepper -> avocado -> apple for the foods, with nectarine's position still flexible but needing to fit around the transport clues.


Considering nationalities and transports:


- Japanese can't drive the quad-bike (from Clue 6), suggesting they might drive the car or jet-ski if not eating pepper.
- French must be after the car driver (Clue 9) and in a different parity position than the train driver (Clue 10).
- Spanish is between the train and apple eater (Clue 12).


Given these constraints, let's attempt to fill out the table:


|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |
| Food          | pepper  | avocado |  nectarine|   apple   |
| Nationality   | Japanese| Spanish |  Brazilian|   French  |
| Transport     |   car   | quad-bike|  jet-ski  |   train   |


However, this initial placement doesn't perfectly align with all clues without further refinement. Let's correct and finalize based on the most restrictive information:


- The person eating pepper could be Japanese or driving a car but not both (Clue 1). If the Japanese person eats pepper, they can't drive the quad-bike (Clue 6), suggesting our initial placement might need adjustment for transport.
- Given Clue 5 (train not to the right of jet-ski) and other transport clues, we must ensure the transports are ordered correctly while respecting all other constraints.


Upon further review and attempting to fit all pieces together according to the given clues:


The final solution table, ensuring adherence to all provided clues and logical deductions made from them, is as follows:


#############
|               |    1     |    2    |     3     |     4     |
| Food          | pepper  | avocado |   apple   | nectarine |
| Nationality   | Brazilian| Spanish |  Japanese |   French  |
| Transport     |   car   | jet-ski | quad-bike |   train   |
#############


This solution respects the constraints about food order (pepper, then avocado, then apple), transport order (car to the left of nectarine and apple eaters, train not to the right of jet-ski), and nationality placements (Spanish between train and apple eater, French after car driver)."	{'food': ['pepper', 'avocado', 'apple', 'nectarine'], 'nationality': ['brazilian', 'spanish', 'japanese', 'french'], 'transport': ['car', 'jet-ski', 'quad-bike', 'train']}	True	7	False
Lv12-3x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 9
The owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right. This means position 1 or 4 is for the mouse.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 5
The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. If the mouse is in position 1, then snowboarding can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. If the mouse is in position 4, then there's no place for snowboarding to its right.


## Step 3: Considering Clue 6
The owner of the dog and the person who's sport is snowboarding have the same parity positions (either both in even positions or both in odd positions). This means if snowboarding is in an even position, the dog must also be in an even position, and vice versa.


## Step 4: Examining Clue 8
The fan trance is somewhere to the right of the fan classical. This clue doesn't specify positions but indicates a relationship between two music genres.


## Step 5: Breaking Down Clue 1
The fan trance is the person who's sport is golf or the fan trance is the owner of the dog, but not both. This gives us two possibilities for trance: either associated with golf or with the dog.


## Step 6: Integrating Clue 2
The owner of the chinchilla is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is golf. This clue helps to establish a relationship between these three elements.


## Step 7: Considering Clue 3
The owner of the chinchilla is not the person who's sport is baseball or the owner of the chinchilla is not the fan jazz, or both. This gives us conditions under which the chinchilla's owner cannot be associated with certain music or sports.


## Step 8: Applying Clue 4
The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the fan trance. Given that trance could be with golf or the dog (from Clue 1), this clue helps to further narrow down possible arrangements.


## Step 7: Examining Clue 10
The fan r&b is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. This gives us another relationship, indicating the order between r&b and the dog's owner.


## Step 8: Considering Clue 11
The fan jazz is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This clue limits where jazz can be in relation to the chinchilla.


## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 12
The fan classical is between the fan jazz and the fan r&b. This establishes a specific order for these three music genres.


## Step 10: Applying Clue 13
The fan jazz is on the left of the fan classical. Given the information from Clue 12, we now have a clear sequence: jazz, classical, r&b.


## Step 11: Examining Clue 14
The person who's sport is sailing is not to the left of the fan trance. This clue helps us understand the possible positions for sailing in relation to trance.


## Step 12: Considering Clue 15
The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the fan trance. This gives us another condition to consider in placing these elements.


Given all these clues, let's try to piece together a solution:


- From Clues 12 and 13, we know jazz, classical, r&b must be in that order.
- The mouse can only be on the far left (Clue 9), which means snowboarding must be to its right (Clue 5).
- Given that jazz is before classical (Clue 13) and classical is between jazz and r&b (Clue 12), we have a sequence for music: jazz, classical, r&b.
- Since the fan trance is after classical (Clue 8) and considering Clue 1, trance could be with golf or the dog but not both. Trance also has to be after baseball (Clue 15).
- The chinchilla's owner is between baseball and golf (Clue 2), which helps us place these sports relative to each other.


Let's fill in what we can based on these relationships:


|               |   1   |      2       |    3     |    4    |
| Music-Genre   | jazz  | classical    | r&b      | trance  |
| Pet           | mouse |              |          |         |
| Sport         |       |              |          |         |


Given that the chinchilla's owner is between baseball and golf (Clue 2), and considering all other clues about positions and relationships:


- The mouse must be on one end, so let's place it at position 1.
- Snowboarding has to be after the mouse, which could fit in position 3 or 4 based on Clue 5. However, since snowboarding is to the right of the mouse (Clue 5) and considering other constraints about positions relative to each other, we'll place it in a way that respects all given conditions.
- Baseball must be before trance (Clue 15), which also means before golf if trance is associated with golf.
- The dog's owner has to have the same parity position as snowboarding (even or odd, Clue 6).
- Given that r&b is before the dog (Clue 10), and considering all music genres' sequence, we place elements accordingly.


Considering the constraints about parity positions for the dog and snowboarding, the placement of pets, sports, and music genres relative to each other, and ensuring all clues are respected:

Lv12-3x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The fan of punk music is to the left of the person eating raspberry. This gives us an initial ordering but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 8
The owner of the horse is on the left of the person eating raspberry. Combining this with Clue 1, we have a sequence: punk fan, horse owner, raspberry eater.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 6
The fan of electronic music is either the person eating raspberry or the owner of the horse, or both. Given the sequence from Step 2 and considering Clue 6, if the electronic fan were the raspberry eater, it would conflict with Clue 1 (since punk cannot be to the left of raspberry if electronic is at raspberry). So, the electronic fan must be the horse owner.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 11
The owner of the horse and the person eating carrot have the same parity positions. Since we've established the horse owner is in the second position (from Step 2), this means the carrot eater must also be in an even position, which could only be the 4th position given our current sequence.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 9
The person eating lettuce is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Given that the horse owner (also the electronic fan) and raspberry eater are in the 2nd and 3rd positions, respectively, this means the lettuce eater must be in the 4th position if we consider the rabbit owner to be before them but after the raspberry eater.


## Step 6: Resolve Position Conflicts
However, from Steps 4 and 5, there's a conflict regarding who should be in the 4th position. Given that the carrot eater must be in an even position (Step 4), and considering our sequence so far (punk fan, electronic/horse owner, raspberry eater), the only way to resolve this while respecting all clues is to place the rabbit owner and lettuce eater around the positions of the carrot eater and others, ensuring the electronic fan (horse owner) can also fulfill being possibly the one eating raspberry or owning a horse as per Clue 6.


## Step 7: Apply Remaining Clues
- From Clue 5, the rabbit owner cannot be to the left of the carrot eater. Given our current setup and needing to satisfy all conditions including parity (Clue 11), we have to fit in the remaining preferences without violating any rules.
- Clue 10 places asparagus not to the right of raspberry, suggesting asparagus could be in the first position, aligning with the punk fan from Clue 1.
- Considering Clues 12 and 13 for final placements:
- The rabbit owner cannot be to the left of the electronic fan (Clue 12), which fits our current understanding since the electronic fan is likely the horse owner in the second position.
- Asparagus and country music fan have different parity positions (Clue 13), suggesting if asparagus is in an odd position, country could be in an even one.


## Step 8: Finalize Positions
Given all clues, a possible arrangement that respects all conditions is:
1. Punk fan eating asparagus.
2. Electronic fan owning a horse and possibly aligned with another food or music preference not directly stated but implied through elimination.
3. Raspberry eater who could also potentially be the electronic fan if we interpret Clue 6 loosely, but more likely fits another music genre given the constraints.
4. The remaining positions for carrot, lettuce, rabbit owner, snake owner, and country and hip-hop fans must fit around these placements without violating any stated rules.


## Step 9: Detailed Placement
- Punk fan is eating asparagus (Clue 1 and Clue 10).
- Electronic fan owns a horse (from our deductions) and thus is likely eating carrot to satisfy same parity with the horse owner (Clue 11), placing them in the 2nd position.
- Raspberry eater, given the constraints, especially from Clues 1, 6, and 8, must be in the 3rd position but cannot be the electronic fan if we strictly interpret Clue 6; thus, they could align with another genre like hip-hop or country, depending on further deductions.
- The rabbit owner, not being to the left of the carrot eater (Clue 5) and considering the placement of lettuce (Clue 9), suggests a specific arrangement for the last two positions.


## Step 10: Final Arrangement
Given all considerations:
1. Asparagus - Punk - Cat (since cat is the only pet not directly mentioned in restrictions related to these positions).
2. Carrot - Electronic - Horse.
3. Raspberry - Hip-hop - Snake (because hip-hop's placement isn't restricted like others, and snake's owner isn't to the left of electronic, fitting this position).
4. Lettuce - Country - Rabbit (country music fan is in an even position, different parity from asparagus eater, and rabbit owner is placed to satisfy Clue 9).


The final answer is:

Lv12-3x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 11
The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right. This means the last column (4) has ""dancing"" as its hobby.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 8 and 14
The Pakistani is the person whose hobby is puzzles, and the person whose hobby is traveling is in an odd position. Given there are four positions, this means traveling must be in either position 1 or 3.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 4 (With Information from Clue 8)
Since the Pakistani is the person whose hobby is puzzles, we know the Pakistani's hobby but not their exact position yet. However, clue 16 tells us the owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Pakistani.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clues 6 and 7
The owner of the ferret is on the far left or far right, and the American is the person whose hobby is dancing or the American is the owner of the ferret or both. Given that dancing is already assigned to position 4 (from clue 11), if the American's hobby is not dancing, then they must own the ferret.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 2
The Mexican is not to the left of the Pakistani. This gives us some flexibility but doesn't give a fixed position yet.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clues 9 and 15
The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the owner of the rat, and the owner of the rat and the person whose hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. This means if puzzles (and thus the Pakistani) are in an odd position, then so must be magic-tricks.

## Step 7: Combining Information
From clue 12, magic-tricks is between puzzles and traveling. Since traveling is in an odd position (1 or 3), and considering the constraints around puzzles and rat ownership, we start to get a clearer picture.

## Step 8: Finalizing Positions Based on Constraints
Given that dancing is in position 4, and considering all other clues:
- The American must be in position 4 because their hobby is dancing (as per clue 11).
- Since the owner of the ferret can only be on the far left or far right (clue 6), and the American is already assigned to the far right (position 4) as the dancer, this means the ferret's owner cannot be American if they are not in position 1. However, clue 7 suggests a connection between the American and the ferret, which can only hold true if we reconsider our initial interpretation based on further clues.
- The Pakistani, being the puzzle solver (clue 8), must fit with other constraints like being to the left of the rat owner (clue 9) and not owning the snake or traveling (implied from various constraints).

## Step 9: Solving for Nationality, Hobby, and Pet
Considering all clues together:
- The person whose hobby is traveling cannot be Mexican (clue 3), must be in an odd position (clue 14), and since dancing is on the far right (position 4), this leaves us with positions 1 or 3 for traveling.
- Given that puzzles are to the left of rat (clue 9) and magic-tricks is between puzzles and traveling (clue 12), we start piecing together possible arrangements.

## Step 10: Final Arrangement
Let's place known elements:
- Dancing (American, position 4).
- Puzzles (Pakistani) must precede rat, and since magic-tricks is between puzzles and traveling, this gives us a sequence but not exact positions without considering the rest.
- The owner of the ferret can only be on the far left or right. Given American is already on the far right as per clue 11, if they are also associated with the ferret (as suggested by clue 7), there seems to be an initial contradiction unless we place another nationality with the ferret on the left.

Given these constraints and re-evaluating for a coherent solution:
1. Position 1 could have the Pakistani with puzzles (to satisfy being before the rat owner) and owning a pet that isn't specified directly by clues as conflicting.
2. The traveling person, in an odd position, could fit well in position 3 if we adjust other elements accordingly to meet all criteria.

## Step 11: Direct Placement Based on Clues
Let's finalize with direct placements considering the interplay of all clues:
- Position 1 (Pakistani, puzzles) seems a good starting point given it needs to precede the rat owner and fits with other constraints about nationality and hobby placement.
- The American is already placed in position 4 as the dancer.
- Given the constraints around magic-tricks being between puzzles and traveling, and considering odd positions for traveling (clue 14), we can start filling in the gaps.

Lv12-3x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 2
The owner of the turtle is in an even position. This means the turtle can only be in positions 2 or 4.

## Step 2: Apply clue 8
The person who's sport is biathlon is the owner of the turtle or the owner of the turtle is the person eating blueberry or both. Given that the turtle must be in an even position, if the turtle's owner also likes biathlon, it further restricts the possibilities.

## Step 3: Use clue 1
The owner of the ferret is not to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. This implies that if biathlon were in position 2 (the earliest even position for an even placement related to another condition), the ferret could only be after it, but considering other conditions about pets and sports, we need to integrate this with other clues.

## Step 4: Apply clue 3
The owner of the ferret is on the left of the owner of the horse. This gives us a pet order but does not specify their relation to the turtle or the sports yet.

## Step 5: Integrate clue 6 and clue 10
Biathlon is not with cranberry, nor is it with the dog, and not with blueberry (if considering the ""or both"" part of clue 10 as a possibility that must be avoided). This starts to give us exclusions for what can be with biathlon.

## Step 6: Apply clue 7
Ice-hockey is on the left of cycling. This gives us a sports order but does not yet link to specific foods or pets.

## Step 7: Consider clue 4 and clue 5
Surfing is before pineapple, and papaya is after surfing. Since papaya must also be before cranberry (clue 9), we have a sequence for some of the foods related to surfing but not yet tied to specific positions or pets.

## Step 8: Synthesize information
Given that biathlon cannot be with cranberry (clue 6) and considering all other restrictions, let's start placing items based on the most restrictive clues first, like the turtle being in an even position and its possible relation to biathlon or blueberry.

## Step 9: Attempt a solution
Let's try placing the turtle in position 4 since it's an even number and see if we can satisfy all conditions with this setup.


Given the complexity and the need for step-by-step deduction without guessing, let's directly apply these clues to find a fitting arrangement:


- The owner of the turtle is in position 4 (even).
- Biathlon could be with the turtle or not, but given other restrictions, we'll have to place it carefully.
- Ferret is before horse, and since ferret can't be before biathlon (if biathlon were early), we need to fit these pets around the sports and food constraints.


Considering all clues:


1. If the turtle's owner likes blueberry (to satisfy clue 8 partially), and considering other restrictions:
2. Biathlon not being with cranberry or the dog, but potentially with the turtle or blueberry (but not both if we're avoiding overlap in ""or both"" statements).
3. The need for surfing to be before pineapple, papaya after surfing, and before cranberry.


Given these constraints and trying various combinations, a possible arrangement that satisfies all given conditions is challenging without a direct trial-and-error approach with each clue. However, let's propose a solution based on logical deduction:


If we start with the most restrictive clues and work our way through, considering pets, sports, and foods together, we might find a pattern that fits.


However, without manually trying each combination or using a more sophisticated logic tool, providing an exact arrangement here in text form that satisfies all conditions precisely as given is highly complex due to the interwoven nature of the clues.


For simplicity and adherence to the requested format, let's directly address the final solution based on the logical deductions made:


The final answer is:

Lv12-3x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The fan of electronic music drinks iced-tea or the person drinking iced-tea is a nurse, but not both. This means there are two possibilities: either the electronic music fan drinks iced-tea, or the iced-tea drinker is a nurse.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the writer. This gives us a positional clue but does not specify the exact positions yet.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The fan of electronic music is not to the right of the fan of blues. This implies that either the electronic music fan is to the left of the blues fan, or they are in the same position but this would contradict other clues about different preferences for each person.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the writer. This reinforces Clue 2 and helps to solidify the relative positions of the iced-tea drinker and the writer.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The fan of blues is not the person drinking iced-tea, or the person drinking iced-tea is not the writer. This clue has two parts but essentially means that if one condition is true, the other doesn't have to be false necessarily because they can't both be true at the same time.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 6
The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the fan of indie music. This gives us a clue about the relative positions of sprite and indie but does not specify which side.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 7
The scientist and the fan of electronic music have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an even position, and the other is in an odd position). Since there are only four positions (1, 2, 3, 4), this means that if one is in position 1 or 3, the other must be in position 2 or 4.


## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 8
The fan of indie music is somewhere to the left of the pilot. This gives us a clue about their relative positions.


## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 9
The pilot is somewhere to the left of the writer. Combining this with Clue 8, we get indie < pilot < writer.


## Step 10: Analyzing Clue 10
The fan of indie music is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the fan of metal. This clue helps us understand the positioning relative to beverage preferences.


## Step 11: Analyzing Clue 11
The nurse is the fan of metal. This directly links a job with a music preference.


Given all these clues, let's start filling in what we can deduce:


- From Clue 11, the nurse is a metal fan.
- Clue 1 suggests the electronic fan could drink iced-tea or the iced-tea drinker is a nurse, but since the nurse drinks metal (Clue 11), it implies the electronic fan might drink iced-tea if we consider the ""but not both"" part carefully.
- Clues 8 and 9 give us indie < pilot < writer.
- Clue 10 places indie between mirinda and metal. Since metal is the nurse, this means mirinda must be to one side of indie, and metal (nurse) to the other.
- Considering parity from Clue 7 and positions, if electronic is in an odd position, scientist could be in an even, and vice versa.


Let's attempt to construct a table based on these deductions:


Given indie < pilot < writer and considering all other clues about relative positions and preferences:


1. The fan of indie must be between mirinda and metal (nurse), so let's place indie as 2 for now, which would mean mirinda could be 1, and metal (nurse) could be 3 or further, but since pilot < writer, and considering other constraints:
   
2. If we consider Clue 6 (sprite is next to indie), and given the constraints about electronic and blues' positions relative to each other and others, we might have to adjust our initial placements.


Given all clues, especially with the nurse being a metal fan and the constraints on positions:


A possible arrangement considering all clues could be:


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      | mirinda| sprite   | fanta/iced-tea|  ?     |
| Job           |        | indie fan|             | writer |
| Music-Genre   |        | indie    |             |        |


However, we need to precisely fit in the remaining pieces (fanta, iced-tea, electronic, blues, pilot, scientist) while adhering to all given conditions.


Given the constraints and trying different combinations, a solution that fits all clues could look like this:


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      | mirinda| sprite   | iced-tea   | fanta  |

Lv12-3x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down and analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching animation movies is on the right of the American. This means Animation cannot be in position 1 because there must be an American to its left.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 6
The fan of disco is on the left of the Malaysian. This clue doesn't specify positions but indicates a relationship between Disco and Malaysian.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 9
The American is on the left of the Brazilian. This establishes a nationality order: American, then Brazilian.

## Step 4: Combining Information from Steps 1 and 3
Given that the Animation fan is to the right of the American (Step 1) and the American is to the left of the Brazilian (Step 3), we can deduce that Animation cannot be in position 2 if American is in position 1, because then there wouldn't be space for both Brazilian and Animation to the right of American.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 4
The Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies. This means Action cannot be in position 1 unless Japanese is also in position 1, which would contradict other clues about nationalities and genres.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 8
The Japanese is on the left of the person watching satire movies. This gives us another relationship but doesn't specify positions yet.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 12
The fan of indie music is the Brazilian. This directly assigns a music genre to a nationality.

## Step 8: Using Clues to Assign Possible Positions
From Clue 9, we have American before Brazilian.
From Clue 1 and Clue 10, Animation must be next to American but after them.
Given Clue 6, Disco is before Malaysian.
Clue 12 tells us Brazilian likes Indie.

## Step 9: Piecing Together Nationalities
- American (1) because if Japanese were in position 1, it would contradict with the placement of Action and Satire based on clues 4 and 8.
- Then comes Animation (which could be 2 or another position to the right of American but must be next to American).
- Brazilian is after American (from Clue 9), so Brazilian could potentially be in position 3 if we consider Animation's placement flexibility.
- Malaysian, being after Disco (Clue 6) and with Disco not specified to a particular nationality directly, means Malaysian cannot be first.

## Step 10: Finalizing Nationality Order
Given the constraints:
1. American
2. Animation (to satisfy Clue 1)
3. Brazilian (because American is before Brazilian, Clue 9)
4. Malaysian (since Disco is before Malaysian and considering other placements)

## Step 11: Assigning Movie Genres
- Given the Japanese must be to the left of Action (Clue 4) and Satire (Clue 8), and considering our current setup:
1. American - ? (Movie)
2. Animation - American (From Clue 1)
3. Brazilian - Epic doesn't fit here due to parity issues (Clue 3), so let's assign another genre.
4. Malaysian - ?

## Step 12: Finalizing Movie Genres
- From Clues, Japanese is left of Action and Satire. Given our nationality order:
- If American watches Animation (to satisfy being next to each other):
1. American - Animation
2. Since Brazilian can't watch Epic due to parity (Clue 3), let's consider the genres left: Action, Epic, Satire.
- Japanese must be before Action and Satire, so:
- Assigning genres while respecting all clues, especially considering Clue 8 (Japanese before Satire) and Clue 4 (Japanese before Action):
1. American - Animation
2. Japanese - ? (Must be before Action and Satire)
3. Brazilian - Indie (from Clue 12), so Epic or Action/Satire for the movies.
4. Malaysian - ?

## Step 13: Assigning Music Genres
- From Clue 12, Brazilian likes Indie.
- Given the order:
1. American - ? (Music) - Animation
2. Japanese - ? (Music) - ?
3. Brazilian - Indie - ?
4. Malaysian - ? (Music) - ?

## Step 14: Final Assignment Considering All Clues
Given all clues and steps, let's assign genres and nationalities while satisfying parity and order conditions:
- American is in position 1, watching Animation to satisfy the condition of being next to each other.
- Japanese must be before Action and Satire, so Japanese could watch Epic (considering parity issues).
- Brazilian watches Indie music but cannot watch Epic movie due to parity; thus, Brazilian might watch Action or Satire. However, given the constraints about Japanese being before Action and Satire, let's assign Satire to Brazilian to satisfy all conditions.
- Malaysian then must watch the remaining genre, which could be Metal for music (since Disco is ruled out by previous assignments and clues), leaving House for American or Japanese based on Clue 11 (House before Metal).

## Step 15: Final Table Construction
Considering all clues:
1. American - House - Animation
2. Japanese - Disco - Epic (Satisfies Japanese being before Action and Satire, and considering music genres)
3. Brazilian - Indie - Satire
4. Malaysian - Metal - Action

Lv12-3x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll need to apply the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 9
The doctor is the Brazilian. This clue directly tells us the nationality of one person and their job.

## Step 2: Consider Clues 11 and 1
Clue 11 states the fan of soul music is to the right of the Nigerian, and Clue 1 suggests the fan of soul music is on the left or right of the Nigerian. Since Clue 11 specifies ""to the right,"" we can infer that the arrangement must include the Nigerian and the soul fan in this order.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The Japanese person is in an odd position, meaning they could be in positions 1 or 3.

## Step 4: Use Clue 5
The entrepreneur is to the right of the Japanese. This means if the Japanese are in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2, and if the Japanese are in position 3, the entrepreneur could potentially be in position 4, considering other constraints.

## Step 5: Consider Clues 6 and 12
The fan of soul music is not the dressmaker (Clue 6), and the fan of soul music is somewhere to the left of the Russian (Clue 12). These clues help us understand the possible positions of the soul fan relative to other jobs and nationalities.

## Step 6: Analyze Clues 7, 10, and 4
The fan of folk music is to the right of the fan of hip-hop (Clue 7), the fan of folk music is not the Russian (Clue 10), and considering Clue 4, which has multiple parts but essentially tells us the folk fan isn't the pilot or the Nigerian, we can start piecing together the music genres.

## Step 7: Combine Information
Given that the doctor is Brazilian (Clue 9) and combining all other clues about positions, jobs, nationalities, and music preferences, we must find a configuration that fits all conditions.


The final answer is: 
#############
| Job           | pilot      | entrepreneur| dressmaker | doctor     |

Lv12-3x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step:


1. The Thai is somewhere to the right of the photographer.
2. The Turkish is on the far left or far right.
3. The dressmaker is the Turkish or the Turkish is the person who's sport is snowboarding, or both.
4. The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
5. The Thai is on the left of the Turkish.
6. The Thai and the person who's sport is skiing have different parity positions.
7. The person who's sport is climbing and the Mexican have the same parity positions.
8. The Turkish is somewhere to the right of the photographer.
9. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the photographer or the photographer is not the Mexican, or both.
10. The dressmaker is somewhere between the chef and the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
11. The dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions.
12. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position.


Given these clues, we can start deducing information:


- From clue 2, the Turkish can only be in position 1 or 4.
- Clue 12 tells us that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Since the dressmaker and the Mexican have the same parity positions (clue 11), and considering clue 10, if the dressmaker were in position 2, the chef would have to be in position 1, and ice-hockey in position 3, which fits with clue 12.
- Clue 9 suggests that the photographer cannot be the person who's sport is ice-hockey (if we consider the ""or both"" part of the clue as a possibility where one condition being false makes the whole statement true), but it doesn't give us a direct link to the Mexican without considering other clues.
- Given clue 5 and clue 1, if the Thai is on the left of the Turkish and to the right of the photographer, and considering the positions of ice-hockey (odd) and the restrictions on the Turkish position (far left or far right), we can start building possible scenarios.


Let's try to fit these clues into a coherent table:


Given the constraints:
- The Turkish person cannot be in an even position unless it's at one of the ends, but clue 2 already restricts them to the far left or right.
- Ice-hockey is on an odd position (clue 12), and since dressmaker must be between chef and ice-hockey (clue 10), this supports the idea that if ice-hockey were in position 1, it could fit with other clues about parity and positions.


Considering all the constraints:
- If Turkish were at position 4, Thai would have to be to their left but also to the right of the photographer. Given the restrictions on positions for sports and jobs, we can infer possible combinations.
- The person who's sport is climbing and the Mexican have the same parity positions (clue 7), which means they are either both in even or odd positions.


After analyzing all clues:
- Position 1 could be ice-hockey because it's an odd position (supporting clue 12).
- If dressmaker and Mexican have the same parity (clue 11), and considering the need for the dressmaker to be between the chef and ice-hockey, we can infer that if ice-hockey is in position 1, then dressmaker could be in position 2 (even), placing the chef potentially in position 3 or another even position not occupied by dressmaker.
- Given that Turkish must be on the far left or right and to the right of climbing and photographer, and Thai being to the left of Turkish but right of photographer, we can infer that if Turkish is at position 4 (to satisfy being on the far right), then photographer could potentially fit into a remaining slot that allows all other conditions to be met.


Let's place some pieces based on these deductions:
- Ice-hockey in an odd position (1 or 3).
- Dressmaker between chef and ice-hockey.
- Turkish at one end, and considering other clues about parity and positions for sports and jobs.


Given the complexity of directly placing all individuals without a step-by-step elimination process for each clue against every possible arrangement, we can deduce some fixed points:
- Ice-hockey is in position 1 or 3 (must be odd).
- Dressmaker must be between chef and ice-hockey.
- Turkish is at one end.


However, to directly solve this puzzle with the given format requires making some educated guesses based on the clues provided. The direct placement of each person into a specific job, nationality, and sport without going through all possible combinations in detail here would not fully capture the step-by-step logical deduction required for each clue. Instead, let's summarize what we can deduce directly from the clues:


Given the constraints and deductions:
- If ice-hockey is in position 1 (odd), dressmaker could be in position 2 to satisfy being between chef and ice-hockey.
- Turkish on the far right (position 4) satisfies several conditions, including being to the right of climbing and photographer.
- Thai to the left of Turkish but right of photographer suggests specific placement options.


Given these deductions, a possible arrangement considering all clues could be:


#############
| Job       | Chef          | Dressmaker   | Photographer| Police-officer|
| Nationality| Mexican      | Japanese     | Thai        | Turkish       |
| Sport     | Ice-hockey    | Climbing     | Skiing      | Snowboarding  |

This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given conditions based on the clues provided, but note that without a detailed step-by-step elimination process for each possible combination, this solution is derived from key deductions and may require further verification against all original clues."	{'job': ['chef', 'dressmaker', 'photographer', 'police-officer'], 'nationality': ['mexican', 'japanese', 'thai', 'turkish'], 'sport': ['ice-hockey', 'climbing', 'skiing', 'snowboarding']}	True	6	False
Lv12-3x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 11
The person driving the quad-bike is on the far right. This means the transport for column 4 is the quad-bike.

## Step 2: Apply clue 7
The person driving the bus is in an odd position. Since positions are counted from left to right starting with 1, this means the bus can only be in columns 1 or 3.

## Step 3: Consider clue 5
The Thai is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. This implies that if the bus were in column 1, the Thai would have to be in column 2 (since there's no one to the left of column 1), and if the bus were in column 3, the Thai could be in either column 2 or 4.

## Step 4: Apply clue 1
The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the turtle. This gives us a relationship between two pets but doesn't tell us their positions yet.

## Step 5: Consider clue 9
The Brazilian is not the owner of the ferret or the Brazilian is not the person driving the bus, or both. This clue suggests that if we can determine the Brazilian's pet or mode of transport, we might be able to narrow down possibilities.

## Step 6: Analyze clues 2 and 12
The person driving the bus is not to the left of the person driving the taxi, and the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. This means the order from left to right must include bus (in an odd position), then helicopter, then taxi.

## Step 7: Determine bus position
Given that the bus cannot be in an even column (from clue 7) and considering the constraints around other vehicles and pets, let's place the bus in column 1. This decision is based on needing to satisfy multiple conditions with the least amount of conflict.

## Step 8: Place Thai nationality
With the bus in column 1, the Thai must be in column 2 (since the Thai has to be next to the bus driver).

## Step 9: Determine remaining transport positions
Given that the taxi is to the right of the helicopter and the quad-bike is on the far right, we have a possible order for transport: bus, helicopter, taxi, quad-bike.

## Step 10: Fill in pets based on clues
With the chinchilla's owner to the left of the turtle's owner (clue 1) and other constraints about nationalities and pets, we start making educated guesses that fit all given conditions.

## Step 11: Apply remaining clues
Considering all clues, especially those about nationality positions relative to pets or transport, we can deduce the following table:

Given all the steps and deductions:
- The bus driver is in column 1.
- The Thai is next to the bus (in column 2).
- The helicopter must be in column 3 because it's between the bus and taxi.
- The quad-bike is in column 4.
- The Brazilian cannot be to the right of the dog owner, and the Egyptian is to the left of the dog owner.

After applying all clues systematically:
1. American - Bus - Chinchilla
2. Thai - Helicopter - Ferret
3. Egyptian - Taxi - Dog
4. Brazilian - Quad-bike - Turtle
