Lv3-1x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
2. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.
3. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching western movies.
4. The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.
5. The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.


From clue 1, we have: Documentary - Western


From clue 2, we have: Musical - Satire


From clue 3, we have: Western - Sports


Now, combining these, we get a possible sequence: Documentary - Western - Sports (from clues 1 and 3) and Musical - Satire.


Clue 4 indicates that Documentary is next to Satire. Given the constraints, if Documentary were on the right of Western, it would not be able to satisfy being directly next to Satire unless the order started with Musical - Satire - Documentary - Western - Sports, which does satisfy all conditions when considering clue 5 as well.


So, let's place them according to these rules:


- Since Documentary must be next to Satire (clue 4) and Western is to the right of Documentary (clue 1), we can have Musical - Satire - Documentary - Western - Sports as a possible arrangement that satisfies all given conditions.


Let's fill in the table based on this solution:


#############
|               |    1    |   2    |      3      |    4    |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Satire | Documentary | Western | Sports |
#############


This arrangement satisfies all clues given:
- Western is to the right of Documentary.
- Satire is to the right of Musical.
- Sports is to the right of Western.
- Documentary is next to Satire, satisfying clue 4.
- Western and Sports are adjacent, satisfying clue 5."
Lv3-1x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The fisherman is on the right of the architect.
2. The fisherman is on the left of the entrepreneur.
3. The architect is on the left or right of the journalist.
4. The entrepreneur is on the left of the mechanic.


From clue 1 and 2, we can deduce the order for three of the jobs: Architect, Fisherman, Entrepreneur (in that order from left to right).


Given clue 3, the architect must be next to the journalist. Since the architect is already determined to be before the fisherman, the journalist could either be on the far left or between the architect and the fisherman, but given the constraints, it makes more sense for the journalist to be on the far left because we don't have enough space to fit all jobs if the journalist were between the architect and the fisherman without violating other conditions.


Clue 4 tells us the entrepreneur is before the mechanic. Combining this with our previous deductions (Architect, Fisherman, Entrepreneur), the mechanic must come after the entrepreneur.


So, we can construct a possible order based on these clues:


- Journalist
- Architect
- Fisherman
- Entrepreneur
- Mechanic


This order satisfies all given conditions:
- The fisherman is to the right of the architect.
- The fisherman is to the left of the entrepreneur.
- The architect is next to the journalist (in this case, on the right).
- The entrepreneur is to the left of the mechanic.


Therefore, the final solution table with jobs filled in according to the clues provided would look like this:

Lv3-1x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step.


1. The fisherman is on the right of the coach.
2. The security-guard is on the far left or far right.
3. The fisherman is on the left of the security-guard.
4. The dancer is on the left or right of the coach.

From clue 2, we have two possibilities for the security-guard's position: far left (position 1) or far right (position 5). Let's consider both scenarios.


### Scenario 1: Security-Guard at Far Left
If the security-guard is at the far left (position 1), then from clue 3, the fisherman must be to the right of the security-guard but also to the left of the security-guard if we consider the whole arrangement, which doesn't fit because it contradicts the direct positioning based on clue 1 and the layout. Thus, this scenario doesn't directly align with all clues without considering other positions.


### Scenario 2: Security-Guard at Far Right
If the security-guard is at the far right (position 5), then from clue 3, the fisherman must be to the left of the security-guard. This means the fisherman can only occupy position 4 because it has to be on the right of the coach (clue 1) and also to the left of the security-guard.


Given these constraints:


- The fisherman is in position 4.
- The security-guard is in position 5.


Now, let's place the coach. Since the fisherman is on the right of the coach (clue 1), and the fisherman is in position 4, the coach can only be in position 3 or to the left of it because there must be at least one position between them for other jobs, but given the dancer's relation to the coach (clue 4), we need flexibility.


Considering clue 4, the dancer needs to be on the left or right of the coach. If we place the coach in position 3, this leaves us with positions 1 and 2 for the dancer and paramedic, with one of them being next to the coach (to satisfy clue 4).


Let's finalize based on all clues:


- Security-guard is at position 5.
- Fisherman is at position 4.


For the remaining jobs (coach, dancer, paramedic), given that the fisherman must be on the right of the coach and the security-guard at the far right, a logical arrangement considering clue 4 (dancer on the left or right of the coach) could place the coach in position 3 to satisfy all conditions.


Given this, we have:


- Position 5: Security-Guard
- Position 4: Fisherman


To satisfy clue 1 and clue 4 together with the constraints above, let's fill in:


- If the coach is in position 3 (to allow for flexibility with the dancer), 
- The dancer could be in position 2 to be next to the coach.
- This leaves positions 1 for the paramedic.


Thus, a solution that fits all clues could look like this:


#############
|       |     1     |   2    |   3   |     4     |       5        |
| Job   | Paramedic | Dancer | Coach | Fisherman | Security-Guard |
#############


This arrangement respects all given conditions:
- The fisherman is on the right of the coach.
- The security-guard is at the far right.
- The fisherman is on the left of the security-guard (in terms of their positions).
- The dancer is on the left of the coach, fitting clue 4.


Note: Logic puzzles can sometimes have multiple solutions depending on how one interprets the clues. However, based on the given conditions and standard logic puzzle conventions, the above solution seems to satisfy all requirements."
Lv3-1x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the bus driver
From clue 1, the person driving the bus is on the far left. So, the initial placement looks like this:

|             |  1  |  2  |     3      |  4   |  5   |
| Transport   | Bus |     |            |      |      |

## Step 2: Place the taxi and bike drivers relative to each other
From clue 2, the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the bike. This doesn't give us exact positions yet, but we know the order for these two.


## Step 3: Position the helicopter driver
Clue 3 tells us the person driving the helicopter is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the car. This starts to give us a sequence but still lacks specific positions.


## Step 4: Consider possible positions based on all clues so far
Given that the bus driver must be on the left or right of the car driver (clue 4), and knowing the bus driver is already placed on the far left, we can infer the car cannot be in position 1 (since the bus is there) but could potentially be in any other position. However, considering clue 3, if the helicopter must be between the bike and the car, and given that the taxi must be to the right of the bike, our sequence starts to take shape.


## Step 5: Piece together all information
Given all clues:
- The bus is on the far left (position 1).
- The taxi is to the right of the bike.
- The helicopter is between the bike and the car.
- The bus must be next to the car.

Considering these points, a possible arrangement could be:
Bus, Car, Bike, Helicopter, Taxi

This satisfies all conditions: the bus is on the far left and next to the car (on its right), the taxi is to the right of the bike, and the helicopter is between the bike and the car.


The final answer is:

Lv3-1x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step:


1. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person watching crime movies is in the middle.
3. The person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies.
4. The person watching western movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies.


Given that there are 5 positions and the person watching crime movies is in the middle (position 3), we can start by placing Crime in position 3:


|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        | Crime |         |        |


From clue 1, Sports must be on either side of Crime. Considering the arrangement and other clues, let's consider both possibilities but keep in mind that Western is to the left of Sports (clue 4), which will influence our final decision.


Given clue 3, Musical must also be next to Crime. Since Crime is fixed in position 3, we have two slots for both Sports and Musical: positions 2 and 4.


However, because Western must be to the left of Sports (clue 4), and considering Crime's central position, if Sports were on the right of Crime (in position 4), Western would have to be in a position that doesn't exist to its left (since it can't occupy position 3, which is taken by Crime). Therefore, Sports must be on the left side of Crime or directly next to it but considering all clues, let's analyze:


- If Sports were in position 2, Western would have to be in position 1 to satisfy clue 4. This leaves positions 4 and 5 for Musical and Horror, with Musical needing to be next to Crime (thus in position 4) to satisfy clue 3.


Let's place the genres according to these deductions:


|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Western | Sports | Crime | Musical | Horror |


This arrangement satisfies all clues:
- Crime is in the middle.
- Sports is on one side of Crime (in this case, the left).
- Musical is next to Crime (on its right).
- Western is to the left of Sports.


Thus, the solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |   2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |

Lv3-1x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the pony and the hamster based on clue 1 and clue 5.
From clue 1 and clue 5, we know the owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the hamster. This means the possible positions for the pony and the hamster are (pony, hamster) in columns 1 & 2, 2 & 3, 3 & 4, or 4 & 5, with the pony always being one position to the left of the hamster.


## Step 2: Apply clue 2 to narrow down the positions.
Clue 2 states that the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. This means the cat cannot be in column 1 if the hamster is in column 2, nor can it be in column 5 if the hamster is in column 4, without violating other clues about relative positions.


## Step 3: Apply clue 3 to determine the horse and goat's position.
The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the goat. This gives us a pair (horse, goat) that needs to be placed considering the pony-hamster and cat-hamster constraints.


## Step 4: Apply clue 4 to further narrow down the positions.
Clue 4 states the owner of the goat is between the owner of the horse and the owner of the pony. This means the sequence must include (horse, goat, pony) in that order, with other pets fitting around them.


## Step 5: Combine all clues for a solution.
Given clue 4 and knowing the pony must be to the left of the hamster, we can start building a possible arrangement:
- Horse and goat must be together in that order.
- Goat is between horse and pony (clue 4).
- Pony is to the left of hamster (clues 1 and 5).

Considering these points, one feasible arrangement could be: horse, goat, pony, cat, hamster. This satisfies all given conditions:
- The pony is indeed to the left of the hamster.
- The cat is next to the hamster, satisfying clue 2.
- The horse is to the left of the goat, as per clue 3.
- The goat is between the horse and the pony, fitting clue 4.


The final answer is: 
#############
|       |   1   |  2   |  3   |    4    |  5  |

Lv3-1x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking Sprite.
2. The person drinking cola is between the person drinking Mirinda and the person drinking juice.
3. The person drinking Sprite is on the far left or far right.

From clue 3, we have two possibilities for Sprite: it can be in position 1 or position 5.

### If Sprite is in position 1:
- From clue 1, since Juice must be to the right of Sprite, and considering the arrangement with Cola between Mirinda and Juice (clue 2), a possible order could be: Sprite, Mirinda, Cola, Juice. This leaves Soy-milk for position 5 because it's the only one left.

### If Sprite is in position 5:
- From clue 1, Juice must be to the left of Sprite, which means Juice cannot be in position 5 (since Sprite is there) and must be in a position that allows it to be to the right of another drink but still to the left of Sprite. Considering clue 2, if we place Juice in position 4, Cola needs to be between Mirinda and Juice. This gives us a possible order: ?, Mirinda, Cola, Juice, Sprite. The only spot left for Soy-milk is position 1 or 2 (since the others are taken), but because Cola must be between Mirinda and Juice, Soy-milk must go in position 1 to satisfy all conditions, leaving us with: Soy-milk, Mirinda, Cola, Juice, Sprite.

Given these considerations, let's evaluate both possibilities against all clues:

- **For Sprite in position 1:** Sprite, Mirinda, Cola, Juice, Soy-milk
  - Satisfies clue 1 (Juice to the right of Sprite)
  - Satisfies clue 2 (Cola between Mirinda and Juice)
  - Satisfies clue 3 (Sprite on the far left)

- **For Sprite in position 5:** Soy-milk, Mirinda, Cola, Juice, Sprite
  - Also satisfies all clues given the conditions.

However, there's an oversight in the initial analysis regarding the strict placement based on the clues provided. Given the constraints and re-evaluating the logic:

1. If Sprite is on the far left (position 1), to satisfy clue 2, we actually need a sequence that allows Cola to be between Mirinda and Juice. This means a possible arrangement could indeed start with Sprite, but we must ensure Cola is correctly placed between Mirinda and Juice.

2. The critical insight from clue 2 is that Cola must be directly between Mirinda and Juice, not necessarily next to both in the overall sequence without considering their positions relative to Sprite and Soy-milk.

Given this clarification, let's correct and finalize the arrangement based on the constraints:

- If we start with Sprite (to satisfy clue 3), followed by considering clue 2 for the placement of Cola between Mirinda and Juice, but also accounting for clue 1 that places Juice after Sprite:
  
A corrected sequence respecting all clues could indeed place Soy-milk in a position that's not directly constrained by the given clues except by elimination. However, upon closer inspection:

The arrangement that fits best considering all constraints is actually derived from ensuring Cola acts as a buffer between Mirinda and Juice while also adhering to Sprite's placement on either end and Juice being after Sprite.

Upon reevaluation for accuracy in logic application:
- **Corrected Solution:** Given the strict interpretation of clues, we should align them precisely with given conditions. The arrangement that perfectly fits all given constraints without assuming additional information is actually derived from directly applying each clue in sequence:

1. If Sprite is on one end (clue 3), and considering Juice must be to its right (clue 1), with Cola between Mirinda and Juice (clue 2), the most direct fit respecting all conditions, especially with Sprite's placement options and the necessary positioning of Cola relative to both Mirinda and Juice, leads us to a specific sequence.

Given these constraints and directly applying them:
- The arrangement that fits is indeed one where we place drinks according to their specified relationships, but let's finalize it in a table format as requested.


#############
|            |   1    |   2   |  3   |    4    |    5     |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk| Mirinda| Cola|   Juice  |  Sprite  |
#############

This solution respects all given conditions:
- Sprite is on the far right (satisfying clue 3).
- Juice is to the right of Sprite (clue 1), but since Sprite can only be on one end, this arrangement places Juice correctly relative to Sprite if we consider the end positions for Sprite.
- Cola is between Mirinda and Juice (clue 2).

However, upon final review for adherence to the specified format and accuracy in logic application based on provided clues:


The correct sequence that fits all conditions without contradiction, given the constraints and ensuring each clue is respected, should indeed directly reflect the relationships outlined. Given this, let's ensure we've applied them correctly:


For Sprite being on one end and Juice to its right (with Cola between Mirinda and Juice), considering all positions:


The direct application leads us to a solution where each drink's position relative to others is as specified, but ensuring we haven't overlooked any clue's implication.


Upon this detailed review, the arrangement should fit within the provided table structure while respecting each clue. Let's finalize it accurately based on our step-by-step analysis and the clues given:


Given the constraints, a final, corrected sequence that respects all conditions (with Sprite on one end, Juice to its right, Cola between Mirinda and Juice) would indeed look like this when correctly applying each clue without assuming additional information not provided in the puzzle statement.


Thus, ensuring we adhere strictly to the clues and their implications for drink placements:


The solution, when accurately derived from the given conditions and ensuring each clue is satisfied without contradiction, leads us to a specific arrangement of beverages.


Therefore, with careful consideration and direct application of all clues provided in the puzzle statement, the final answer should indeed reflect an accurate, step-by-step deduction based on those clues.


Given this detailed analysis and ensuring adherence to the format requested for the solution presentation:


The correct table reflecting the beverage placements according to the given clues is as follows:

Lv3-1x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The fan of dubstep is between the fan of pop and the fan of metal.
2. The fan of pop is in the middle (position 3).
3. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of soul.
4. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
5. The fan of soul is on the right of the fan of d&b.

From clue 2, we know:
- Pop is in position 3.

Considering clue 1 and with pop in the middle (position 3), dubstep must be either in position 2 or 4 because it has to be between pop and metal. However, since pop is fixed at position 3, dubstep cannot be directly next to both pop and metal unless one of them is at position 1 or 5.

Clue 4 indicates soul is on the left or right of pop, which means soul could potentially be in positions 2 or 4.

From clue 3 and 5, we understand d&b must come before soul. Since soul has to be on one side of pop (clue 4) and considering clue 5 that soul is on the right of d&b, a possible arrangement for d&b and soul could be positions 1 and 2 or positions 4 and 5.

However, if we place d&b and soul in positions 4 and 5 (considering soul must be after d&b), it contradicts clue 1 because dubstep needs to be between pop and metal. So, a more likely scenario for d&b and soul is in the first two positions, given that soul can't be directly next to pop if d&b precedes soul.

Given these constraints:
- Pop must be at position 3.
- Dubstep has to be between pop and metal, suggesting dubstep could be at position 2 or 4.
- D&b is before soul, and considering the constraints around pop's placement, a likely scenario is d&b in position 1, followed by another genre that fits the clues.

Let's place d&b in position 1 as it satisfies clue 3 (d&b on the left of soul) and allows for other genres to fit according to their clues. If d&b is at position 1, soul cannot be directly next to pop (as per clue 4), so a genre must separate them.

Given these conditions:
- Position 1: d&b (to satisfy clue 3 and allow flexibility for other placements).
- Position 3: pop (from clue 2).

For dubstep to be between pop and metal, considering pop is at position 3, dubstep could fit well in position 2 or 4. However, since d&b is in position 1, and soul needs to be after d&b but also near pop (as per the clues), we have a potential conflict unless we carefully place the remaining genres.

Let's test placing dubstep in position 2:
- Position 1: d&b
- Position 2: dubstep
- Position 3: pop

This placement satisfies clue 1 (dubstep between pop and metal) if metal is placed after pop. Now, soul needs to be on the right of d&b but also near pop (left or right of pop). Given pop's fixed position at 3, and with dubstep in position 2, soul could fit well in position 4, satisfying clue 5 (soul on the right of d&b) and allowing metal to be placed last.

So, a possible arrangement considering all clues is:
- Position 1: d&b
- Position 2: dubstep
- Position 3: pop
- Position 4: soul
- Position 5: metal

This satisfies all given conditions:
- Dubstep is between pop and metal.
- Pop is in the middle.
- D&b is on the left of soul.
- Soul is on the right of pop (and d&b).
- The arrangement respects all given constraints.

Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:

Lv3-1x5-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:

1. The freelancer is to the left of the chef.
2. The lawyer is either to the left or right of the scientist.
3. The lawyer is in the middle (position 3).
4. The scientist is to the left of the social-worker.

Given these clues, we can start filling out the table:

- Since the lawyer must be in position 3, we have that fixed.
- Because the scientist must be to the left of the social-worker and considering clue 2, there are two possibilities for the scientist's position: either immediately to the left or right of the lawyer. However, since the lawyer is in position 3, the scientist cannot be to the lawyer's right if we also consider that the freelancer must be to the left of the chef (and both need positions). So, the scientist likely goes to the left of the lawyer.
- The freelancer being to the left of the chef means they can't occupy the last two spots since the social-worker needs a spot after the scientist. Given the constraints, we have limited space for all these conditions.

Let's try placing them based on our analysis:

1. Scientist (because it has to be before the social-worker and considering the middle spot is taken by the lawyer).
2. Freelancer (since it must be to the left of the chef, but also considering the scientist's placement).
3. Lawyer (fixed in the middle as per clue 3).
4. Chef (since the freelancer must be to its left, this can fit after the lawyer if we adjust other positions accordingly).
5. Social-worker (must be after the scientist).

Given these considerations and trying to fit all clues together:

The only configuration that fits all conditions is having the scientist in position 1 or 2 because it needs to precede the social-worker, but since the freelancer must also precede the chef and the lawyer is fixed in the middle, we adjust accordingly.

Considering all clues again with careful placement:
- Scientist can't be in position 5 (because then the social-worker would have no place after it), so let's consider scientist in position 1 or 2.
- If scientist is in position 1, freelancer could potentially fit into position 2 if we hadn't already established that the lawyer needs to be near the scientist. Given this complexity and re-evaluating clue 2 (lawyer on either side of the scientist), let's properly place them considering all constraints.

Let's finalize with a careful approach:

Given the clues, one arrangement could look like this, ensuring we adhere to all given conditions:

|       |     1      |  2   |   3    |     4     |       5       |
| Job   | Scientist | Freelancer | Lawyer | Chef | Social-worker |

This arrangement satisfies:
- The freelancer is to the left of the chef.
- The lawyer is in the middle and next to the scientist, fulfilling clue 2's condition that the lawyer can be on either side of the scientist (in this case, to the right).
- The scientist is to the left of the social-worker.

Thus, the solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

#############

Lv3-1x5-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements step by step:


1. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling.
2. The person who's sport is handball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton.
3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the far right.
4. The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.


From statement 3, we know ice-hockey is at position 5.


|         |   1    |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |
| Sport   |        |           |          |         | Ice-Hockey |


Statement 4 tells us handball is to the left of cycling. Statement 1, combined with statement 3, implies that cycling cannot be at position 5 (since ice-hockey is there), and because ice-hockey is on the far right, it must be next to cycling, but since ice-hockey is at position 5, cycling must be at position 4.


|         |   1    |     2     |    3     |    4    |     5      |
| Sport   |        |           |          | Cycling | Ice-Hockey |


Given statement 4 and the current placement, handball must be to the left of cycling. Since cycling is at position 4, handball could be at positions 1, 2, or 3. However, considering statement 2 (handball is on the left or right of badminton), if handball were at position 3, it would not be directly next to badminton unless badminton is at position 2 or 4. But cycling occupies position 4, so for handball and badminton to be next to each other with cycling in the way, handball must be at position 3, which does not work as per our initial assumption of flexibility. Thus, handball must be either at position 1 or 2, with badminton being next to it.


Let's place handball and badminton considering they need to be together and handball is to the left of cycling:


- If handball were at position 3, it cannot be directly next to badminton because cycling is in the way. So, this scenario doesn't work as initially thought.
- Handball must then be either at position 1 or 2 for it to be next to badminton and also satisfy being on the left of cycling.
