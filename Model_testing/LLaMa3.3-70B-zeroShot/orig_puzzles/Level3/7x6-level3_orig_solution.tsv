1. From clue 9 and 10, we know that tennis can be at either end. 
2. Clue 20 tells us that the indian is on the far right.
3. Using clues 5, 6, 13, and 18, we can determine that dancing is at position 3, kiwi is at position 3, biathlon is at position 2, and soy-milk is at position 3 or 4.
4. From clue 25, kale is at position 5 (since colombian is not at position 6), and from clue 7, soy-milk must be at position 3.
5. Clue 11 tells us that reading is the hobby of the turtle owner, but we don't know the position yet.
6. Using clues 1, 28, and 8, we can determine that spanish is at position 1, 7up is at position 2, and snake or frog is at either end (since one of them must be at position 1 or 6).
7. Clue 32 tells us that skiing is to the left of tea.
8. From clue 24, we know tea can only be at position 6.
9. Using clues 2, 3, and 4, soul's position is between skiing and mouse.
10. With clue 14, folk is with mouse, which helps determine some positions based on the given restrictions.
11. Clue 16 tells us that grapes are next to australian or ice-hockey, helping narrow down possibilities for those positions.
12. Continue applying all clues and solving the puzzle step by step.

#############

Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using a process of elimination to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 23 states that the person watching sports movies is on the far left, so we start by placing ""sports"" in the movie genre column for person 1.
* Clue 31 states that the owner of the mouse is the fan of folk and also watches sports movies, but since folk is not the music genre for person 1 (due to other clues), we conclude that the owner of the mouse is actually person 3, based on clue 1 and other information.
* Clue 7 states that the fan of dubstep is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies. Given that person 1 watches sports movies, dubstep must be either person 1 or person 2's music genre. However, due to other clues (e.g., clue 26, which places watermelon near coffee), we can deduce more information.
* Clue 21 states that the person watching romance movies drinks 7up. Clue 22 states that the person eating strawberry is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person drinking coffee. This helps us place strawberry in the food column for person 3, with magic-tricks (and thus designer, due to clue 10) on one side and coffee on the other.
* Clue 27 states that the person eating apricot is the mechanic, which helps us place apricot in the food column for person 2 (due to clue 9 and other information about the mechanic's position).
* By carefully applying all the clues, we can fill in the rest of the table.

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."

#############

Note: The solution table is based on the given clues and their logical deductions. 

Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues helped solve the puzzle:

- Clue 1: The person driving the motorbike is the fan of blues, which means blues must be in column 4 (since motorbike is mentioned in clue 30 as being on the right of indie, and indie is between dancer and surfing).
- Clue 5: The fan of reggae is on the far left, so reggae must be in column 1.
- Clue 22: The photographer is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Given that the photographer is also the person whose sport is water-polo (clue 32), and considering other constraints, fanta ends up being in column 5.
- Clue 25: The person driving the bike is on the far left, which places bike in column 1.
- Clue 28: The person whose hobby is filmmaking is the librarian. Given that the person whose hobby is filmmaking owns a horse (clue 7), and considering other constraints, this helps place the librarian in column 2 and the horse in column 3.
- Clue 31: The person whose hobby is card-games is on the far right, placing card-games in column 6. However, due to clue 18 and others, there was an initial confusion that got resolved by carefully reconsidering all relevant clues together.

The solution involved a process of elimination and careful consideration of all given clues to ensure consistency across all categories."
