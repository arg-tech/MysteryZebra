Lv3-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by filling in what we know from each clue:


1. The owner of the goldfish is on the far right.
2. The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
4. The analyst is on the right of the Turkish.

From clue 1, we know the pet for column 2 is a goldfish.

| Beverage      |          |            |
| Food          |          |            |

| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

From clue 4, since the analyst is on the right of the Turkish, and given that there are only two nationalities (British and Turkish), the Turkish person must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no space to the right for the analyst.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          |            |

| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

Now, using clue 3, since the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person eating strawberry, and knowing the nationalities' positions:


- If the Turkish person (column 1) drinks soy-milk, then the British person (column 2) must eat strawberry.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk |            |
| Food          |          | Strawberry |

| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

From clue 2, the person eating kiwi must be on the left or right of the person whose sport is rowing. Given that strawberry is already assigned to column 2, kiwi must be in column 1.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk |            |

| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

The only beverage left for column 2 is iced-tea.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Iced-tea   |
| Food          | Kiwi     | Strawberry |

| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

Given that the analyst is in column 2, and from clue 4, the job for column 1 must be manager.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Iced-tea   |
| Food          | Kiwi     | Strawberry |
| Job           | Manager  | Analyst    |
| Nationality   | Turkish  | British    |
| Pet           |          | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

The pet for column 1 must be a frog since the goldfish is in column 2.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Iced-tea   |
| Food          | Kiwi     | Strawberry |
| Job           | Manager  | Analyst    |

| Pet           | Frog     | Goldfish   |
| Sport         |          |            |

For the sport, since rowing must be next to kiwi (from clue 2), and considering all other placements:


- Rowing could be in column 1 or 2. However, given that lacrosse is the only sport left and must pair with one of these, we should consider which combination fits best with the clues provided.


If rowing were in column 1, it would mean kiwi (and thus the Turkish manager) is next to rowing, fulfilling clue 2 directly.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Iced-tea   |
| Food          | Kiwi     | Strawberry |
| Job           | Manager  | Analyst    |
| Nationality   | Turkish  | British    |
| Pet           | Frog     | Goldfish   |
| Sport         | Rowing   | Lacrosse   |

This arrangement satisfies all given conditions without contradiction.

Lv3-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues and apply them step by step to the table.


Given:
- Beverages: cola, iced-tea
- Food: cabbage, mango
- Music Genres: hip-hop, pop
- Nationalities: dutch, german
- Pets: goldfish, guinea-pig
- Transport: motorbike, taxi

Clues:
1. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right.
2. The German is on the left of the fan of pop.
3. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop.
4. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango.

Let's apply these clues to fill in the table:


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The owner of the guinea-pig is on the far right. This means the pet column for the second person is guinea-pig.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The German is on the left of the fan of pop. This doesn't give us an exact position yet, but it tells us the German cannot be on the right since the guinea-pig owner (from clue 1) is already there.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the fan of pop. This means cola and pop must be adjacent.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating mango. Since there are only two options for transport, this implies the motorbike is on the left.


Given these clues, let's try to construct a possible solution:


From clue 2 and considering clue 3, if German is on the left of pop, and cola must be adjacent to pop, then the German could be drinking cola (since it has to be next to pop). The pop fan cannot be German from clue 2 but doesn't specify the nationality directly for the pop fan. However, since there are only two nationalities, and the German is on the left of the pop fan, the pop fan must be Dutch.


Clue 1 tells us the guinea-pig owner is on the far right. Clue 4 indicates the taxi (and thus its driver) is on the right of mango. If we assume the person eating mango is not the same as the one owning the guinea-pig (since there's no direct information linking them), then the taxi must be associated with the guinea-pig owner, placing motorbike with the other transport option.


Let's assemble what we know so far:


- German on the left
- Pop fan to the right of German but not necessarily directly next to (due to the need for cola to be adjacent)
- Cola drinker adjacent to pop fan
- Mango eater cannot be on the far right because taxi is to their right
- Guinea-pig owner on the far right


Considering all options and filling in what we can deduce:


|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | cola     | iced-tea   |
| Food          | mango    | cabbage    |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop  | pop        |
| Nationality   | german   | dutch      |
| Pet           | goldfish | guinea-pig |
| Transport     | motorbike| taxi       |


Given the constraints and deductions:


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | cola     | iced-tea   |
| Food          | mango    | cabbage    |
| Music-Genre   | hip-hop  | pop        |

| Pet           | goldfish | guinea-pig |

Lv3-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement carefully and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1
The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means the person with the hobby of singing must be in column 2, and the person with the hobby of woodworking must be in column 1.

## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2
The person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skiing. This statement doesn't specify which column the documentary fan or the skier is in but indicates they must be adjacent.

## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3
The fan of reggae is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. This means the reggae fan cannot be in column 2, so they must be in column 1, and the climber must be in column 2.

## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4
The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the chinese. This doesn't tell us which nationality is associated with which beverage directly but gives a relative position for one of the nationalities and beverages.

## Step 5: Combine Information from All Statements
From Step 1, we have:
- Woodworking in column 1.
- Singing in column 2.

From Step 3, since the reggae fan is on the left of the climber:
- Reggae must be associated with column 1 (because it's to the left of climbing).
- Climbing is in column 2.

Given that skiing and documentary are adjacent (Step 2), and knowing the positions of singing and woodworking, if skiing were in column 2 (with singing), documentary would have to be in column 1 (with woodworking) or vice versa. But since reggae (and thus climbing) is already placed in relation to these columns, we must fit skiing and documentary around these constraints.

## Step 6: Final Placement Considering All Constraints
- Column 1 has woodworking and reggae.
- Column 2 has singing and climbing.

Considering Statement 4, if lemonade is on the left of Chinese:
- Lemonade cannot be in column 2 because it must be to the left of Chinese. So, lemonade is associated with column 1 (and thus with woodworking or reggae).
- Given coffee and lemonade as options and knowing lemonade's placement relative to Chinese, we can deduce that coffee might not necessarily be directly linked to a specific nationality without further information but must fill the remaining beverage slot.

Given these constraints:
- Column 1: Woodworking (hobby), Reggae (music), Lemonade (beverage), Documentary or Satire (movie-genre), and one of the nationalities.
- Column 2: Singing (hobby), Climbing (sport), Indie (the remaining music genre), and the other movie-genre, nationality.

Since lemonade is to the left of Chinese and considering all other placements:
- The Chinese cannot be in column 1 if lemonade is to their left, implying an inconsistency with our direct deductions. We must reconsider based on beverage and nationality constraints directly: If lemonade is on the left of Chinese, and given that reggae (and thus climbing) is also on the left, we need to ensure that the placements respect all given conditions.

Reevaluating for clarity and consistency:
- The person who likes documentary movies is adjacent to the skier. Given our constraints, if skiing were in column 2 with singing, documentary would fit well in column 1, aligning with woodworking.
- The fan of reggae is on the left of the climber, supporting climbing being in column 2.

Let's correct and finalize based on direct information:
- Since the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the Chinese, and considering all other constraints, we deduce that lemonade must be with woodworking (column 1), making coffee go with singing (column 2).
- The Chinese must then be in column 2 because lemonade (column 1) is to their left.
- Reggae is in column 1 (with woodworking and lemonade), leaving indie for column 2.
- Climbing is in column 2, which aligns with our deductions.
- Skiing, being adjacent to documentary, must then be in column 1 if we consider documentary's placement flexibility.

Given these considerations, let's finalize the table based on logical deductions:


#############
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade   | Coffee     |
| Hobby         | Woodworking| Singing    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary| Satire     |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae     | Indie      |
| Nationality   | Indonesian | Chinese    |
| Sport         | Skiing     | Climbing   |

The final answer is:

Lv3-6x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the hobby of each person
Given that the people have 2 different hobbies: puzzles and sudoku, we can start by placing these hobbies in the table but won't be able to determine their exact positions yet.

## Step 2: Apply clue 4 - The fan of salsa is the person who's hobby is puzzles
This means the person whose hobby is puzzles also likes salsa music. This connection doesn't directly tell us where they are, but it links two categories.


## Step 3: Consider clue 5 - The owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rabbit
Since there are only two pets and this clue gives a direct relationship between their owners, we can infer that one person has a dog (on the left) and the other has a rabbit (on the right), but without knowing which column is left or right for these specific categories yet.


## Step 4: Apply clue 3 - The owner of the rabbit is on the far left or far right
Given there are only two people, if one is on the far left or far right with a rabbit, and considering clue 5 that places the dog's owner to the left of the rabbit's owner, we can infer the arrangement for pets but not their exact placement in the table without more information.


## Step 5: Use clue 1 - The person driving the tram is on the right of the lawyer
This clue directly relates two categories (job and transport) but doesn't give us enough to place them without considering other clues.


## Step 6: Apply clue 2 - The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku
This gives another relationship but, like the others, needs cross-referencing with other clues for precise placement.


## Step 7: Combine all clues to find a solution
- From clue 4, puzzles = salsa.
- Clue 5 and clue 3 suggest dog is on the left of rabbit, and rabbit could be far right.
- Clue 1 suggests tram (transport) is on the right of lawyer (job).
- Clue 2 places scientific movies to the right of sudoku hobby.


Given these relationships:
- If we place ""puzzles"" as a hobby for person 1, then by clue 4, person 1 likes salsa.
- Person 2's hobby must be sudoku by elimination, and thus likes soul music (since puzzles = salsa).
- From clue 5, the dog owner is to the left of the rabbit owner. If we place the dog with person 1 (puzzles), then person 2 has the rabbit.
- Clue 3 suggests the rabbit could be far right, which fits our current setup.
- The lawyer cannot be on the right because the tram driver is to their right (clue 1), so the lawyer must be person 1, and thus person 2 drives the tram.
- Person 2 watches scientific movies (to the right of sudoku hobby, clue 2), which fits since person 1's hobby is puzzles.


Thus, we can start filling in the table with this information:


|               |      1       |       2        |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | sudoku        |
| Job           | lawyer      | police-officer|
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts| scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | salsa       | soul          |
| Pet           | dog         | rabbit        |
| Transport     | skateboard  | tram          |

The final answer is:

|               |      1       |       2        |
| Hobby         | puzzles     | sudoku        |

Lv3-6x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


From clue 5, we know:
- The person watching western movies is the person eating avocado.

From clue 1, we have:
- The person drinking water is on the right of the person watching western movies.
  
Given these clues, we can start filling in the table with what we know so far:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |             |           |
| Food          |             |           |
| Hobby         |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             |           |
| Sport         |             |           |
| Transport     |             |           |

Let's assign the person watching western movies and eating avocado to column 1 for now, as we don't have enough information to definitively place them in either column without considering other clues.


Clue 2 tells us:
- The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.

This means photography cannot be associated with the motorbike directly.


Clue 3 states:
- The person driving the scooter is the person who's sport is lacrosse.

So, we have a direct association between lacrosse and scooter.


Clue 4 says:
- The person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite.

This clue doesn't give us a specific placement yet but indicates a relationship between reading and sprite.


Given all these clues, let's try to fit them into our table. We know from clue 5 that the western movie fan eats avocado, and from clue 1, water is on the right of western movies. Clue 3 links lacrosse with scooter directly, and since western and avocado are paired (clue 5), we can start building around this information.


Let's place western and avocado in column 1 for now, based on clue 1 and the fact that we need to establish a reference point:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |             | Water    |
| Food          | Avocado    |           |
| Hobby         |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   | Western    |           |
| Sport         |             |           |
| Transport     |             |           |

Since water is on the right of western (clue 1), and given that we have to place the other options around these fixed points, let's consider clue 2 and clue 3 for further placement:


- Photography is to the left of motorbike.
- Lacrosse is with scooter.

Given these clues and our current setup, if we place photography in column 1 (to satisfy being on the left), it conflicts with needing a direct association with motorbike unless motorbike is in column 2. However, clue 3 says lacrosse (and thus scooter) can be directly associated, suggesting:


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |             | Water    |
| Food          | Avocado    |           |
| Hobby         | Photography|           |
| Movie-Genre   | Western    |           |
| Sport         |             | Lacrosse |
| Transport     |             | Scooter  |

But this doesn't satisfy clue 2 directly unless we reconsider the placement based on all clues:


Given that photography must be to the left of motorbike, and considering lacrosse is with scooter (which could be in either column but seems more likely to be in column 2 given our current setup), let's adjust our understanding:


If western and avocado are in column 1, and water is in column 2 (as per clue 1), we should also consider the direct associations and placements more carefully.


|               |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Sprite    | Water    |
| Food          | Avocado   | Peas     |
| Hobby         | Photography| Reading  |
| Movie-Genre   | Western   | Fantasy  |
| Sport         | Badminton | Lacrosse |
| Transport     | Motorbike | Scooter  |

This arrangement seems to satisfy all given conditions:
- Water is on the right of western movies (clue 1).
- Photography is to the left of motorbike (clue 2), assuming the table's structure implies left and right relationships.
- Lacrosse is associated with scooter (clue 3).
- Reading is next to sprite, as required by clue 4, assuming ""left or right"" refers to the column arrangement.
- Western movies are associated with avocado (clue 5).


Therefore, the solution table, considering all clues and their implications on the arrangement, looks like this:


#############
|               |      1      |     2     |

Lv3-6x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 to establish a relationship between horror movies and magic-tricks.
The person watching horror movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

## Step 2: Use clue 1 to place the Malaysian relative to magic-tricks.
The Malaysian is on the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. Combining with step 1, we have: magic-tricks -> horror movies -> Malaysian (as a sequence from left to right).

## Step 3: Apply clue 2 to relate carrot eating to horror movies.
The person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since the sequence from step 2 already places something to the left of horror movies (magic-tricks), and considering the Malaysian must be after horror movies based on clue 1, we deduce carrot can either be with magic-tricks or before it but this needs further refinement.

## Step 4: Consider clue 4 regarding surfing and tea.
The person whose sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking tea. This doesn't directly relate to our established sequence yet but indicates a separate relationship that will help in final placement.

## Step 5: Integrate all clues for final table construction.
Given:
- Magic-tricks -> Horror movies (from clue 3)
- Horror movies -> Malaysian (from clue 1)
- Carrot can be on either side of horror movies but must fit with other constraints (clue 2)

We also know there are only two positions. Let's assume the first position is magic-tricks, and the second is horror movies based on clue 3.

For sports: since surfing is after tea (clue 4), if we consider that magic-tricks could be paired with a beverage (and assuming it's not tea because then surfing would have to be in the first column which contradicts our established sequence for horror and Malaysian), this gives us flexibility. However, without direct clues linking beverages directly to hobbies or nationalities beyond their relative positions, we must infer based on given constraints.

Given the direct clue that the Malaysian is after horror movies (which follows magic-tricks), and knowing surfing follows tea, a possible arrangement considering all constraints could be:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | mirinda/tea | tea/mirinda|
| Food          | carrot      | watermelon |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| drawing    |
| Movie-Genre   | crime       | horror     |
| Nationality   | indonesian  | malaysian  |
| Sport         | lacrosse    | surfing    |

However, this doesn't perfectly fit all clues without making some assumptions. Let's correct the approach based on strict clue adherence:

1. Magic-tricks must be before horror movies (clue 3).
2. The Malaysian is after horror movies (clue 1), which means horror movies cannot be in the second column if we strictly follow the ""right of"" clues.
3. Carrot's eater is next to horror movies (clue 2), suggesting a direct adjacency.

Given these points, and revisiting clue 4 (surfing after tea), let's align with the most direct implications:

- If magic-tricks is in column 1, and horror movies follow it (thus in column 2), this satisfies clues 1 and 3 directly.
- The Malaysian then must be associated with column 2 as well, given horror movies are there, fitting clue 1.
- Carrot being next to horror movies suggests it should be the food for either magic-tricks or horror movies, but since we've established a sequence, carrot could logically align with magic-tricks if considering adjacency requirements.

However, upon careful reconsideration of all clues and acknowledging the constraints provided:

The most accurate approach is to directly apply each clue without over-assuming. Given this, let's finalize based on direct inferences:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | tea         | mirinda    |
| Food          | carrot      | watermelon |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks| drawing    |
| Movie-Genre   | crime       | horror     |
| Nationality   | indonesian  | malaysian  |
| Sport         | lacrosse    | surfing    |

This setup respects the sequence and adjacency requirements outlined by the clues, ensuring that each constraint is met without overstepping into assumptions not directly supported by the provided information.

Lv3-6x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we can deduce it.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person eating apple is on the right of the person driving the roller. This means the roller cannot be on the far right since there needs to be space for the apple eater to its right.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The fan of funk is on the far left or far right. This clue gives us two possible positions but doesn't specify which person or their other preferences yet.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The software-developer is on the left or right of the mechanic. This means these two jobs must be adjacent to each other, but we don't know which one is on the left or right yet.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the fan of indie. This gives us a relationship between movie-genre and music-genre preferences but doesn't specify their positions relative to other categories yet.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The american is on the right of the mechanic. This clue starts to give us some concrete positioning information regarding nationality and job.


## Step 6: Combining Information
From Clue 3 and Clue 5, we can start forming a sequence: Mechanic - Software-developer - American (since the American must be to the right of the mechanic). However, this does not necessarily mean the software-developer is directly next to the American.


## Step 7: Further Deductions
Given that there are only two positions and considering Clue 1, if the roller is on the left (because the funk fan could be on the far left or far right), then apple must be on the right. This means asparagus would be on the left.


## Step 8: More Positioning
With the software-developer and mechanic needing to be next to each other (Clue 3) and knowing the American is to the right of the mechanic (Clue 5), if we assume the roller is driven by one of these individuals, it would likely be the mechanic or the software-developer. But since the American must be to the right of the mechanic, and considering Clue 1 about the apple eater's position relative to the roller driver, we can infer some positions.


## Step 9: Finalizing Positions
Let's place the roller on the left (to satisfy the condition that funk could be far left or far right, and other conditions). If asparagus is with the roller (on the left), then apple must be on the right. Given the American is to the right of the mechanic and assuming the software-developer is also near them, we can try placing the jobs, nationalities, and foods.


## Step 10: Placing Movie and Music Genres
The person watching superhero movies is to the left of the indie fan (Clue 4). If we have asparagus on the left with the roller, this could fit with someone who likes superhero movies. The funk fan being on the far left or right (Clue 2) means if they're not on the far left with asparagus and the roller, they must be associated with apple on the right.


## Step 11: Combining All Clues
Considering all clues:
- Asparagus is likely with the roller on the left.
- The mechanic and software-developer are next to each other.
- The American is to the right of the mechanic.
- Apple is on the right, eaten by someone who could be the funk fan or associated with another category that fits the remaining clues.


## Step 12: Final Table Construction
Given all deductions:
1. Left: Asparagus (Food) - Roller (Transport) - Mechanic (Job) - Superhero (Movie-Genre) - Funk (Music-Genre) - German (Nationality)
2. Right: Apple (Food) - Skateboard (Transport) - Software-developer (Job) - Scientific (Movie-Genre) - Indie (Music-Genre) - American (Nationality)

Given clue 5, the chinchilla owner is next to the kiwi eater. Since the cat's owner (left side) cannot be next to the chinchilla due to the pet arrangement implication from clue 1 and the need for variety in each category, the kiwi eater must be on the right.

Lv3-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 1
The fan of trance is the person watching action movies. This doesn't directly tell us which column (1 or 2) these preferences belong to, but it links two categories: Music-Genre (trance) with Movie-Genre (action).


## Step 2: Apply clue 3
The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the dressmaker. This implies that if we place the dressmaker in column 1, the comedy movie watcher must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The owner of the guinea-pig is the person drinking fanta. This links Pet (guinea-pig) with Beverage (fanta), but doesn't specify which column yet.


## Step 4: Apply clue 2 and refine with clue 3
Initially, clue 2 says the dressmaker is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Given clue 3 refines this to say the comedy movie watcher is on the right of the dressmaker, we can place the dressmaker in column 1 and the comedy movie fan in column 2.


## Step 5: Apply clue 4
The spanish is on the right of the owner of the bird. This doesn't give us exact positions yet but indicates a relationship between Nationality (spanish) and Pet (bird), with the bird owner being to the left of the Spanish person.


## Step 6: Combine all clues for final placement
Given that:
- The dressmaker is in column 1, and the comedy movie fan is in column 2.
- The trance fan watches action movies (from clue 1).
- Since the comedy movie fan is in column 2, the action movie fan must be in column 1 to satisfy clue 1 indirectly, as we have to link trance with action.
- The guinea-pig owner drinks fanta (clue 5), and since this links directly to a beverage, it's possible for the guinea-pig owner to be either person, but considering other clues, if the dressmaker is in column 1 and likes comedy (which we haven't directly established but are testing placements), then perhaps the guinea-pig owner could fit into column 2 if it aligns with other preferences.
- The Spanish person is on the right of the bird owner. If the bird owner were in column 2, this would place the Spanish person out of the table's bounds, so the bird owner must be in column 1, making the Spanish person in column 2.


## Step 7: Finalize placements based on all clues
Let's try to fit the remaining pieces:
- Dressmaker is in column 1.
- Comedy movie fan is in column 2 (from clue 3).
- Since the action movie fan must be linked with trance and is likely in column 1 (to oppose comedy), this could align with the dressmaker or another category not directly stated but implied through elimination.
- Bird owner is in column 1, making them possibly the dressmaker if we combine clues about job and pet indirectly.
- Spanish person is in column 2, which fits with being on the right of the bird owner.


Given these steps and considering all clues:
- Column 1 could have: Dressmaker, Action movies, Trance music, Bird as a pet, and Fanta or Sprite (with Fanta being more likely linked to another category directly).
- Column 2 could have: Project-manager, Comedy movies, Dubstep music, Guinea-pig as a pet, and the remaining beverage.


However, without direct statements for every category's placement in the clues provided, some assumptions are made based on elimination and indirect links. The exact solution must fit all given clues perfectly:


Given clue 5 (guinea-pig owner drinks fanta) and assuming other categories can be linked indirectly:
- If the guinea-pig is in column 2 with comedy movies and possibly dubstep (since trance is taken by action), then Fanta could indeed be in column 2, making Sprite likely for column 1.


Let's finalize based on direct clues and logical deductions:


The dressmaker watches comedy movies (inferred from clue 3 and the process of elimination), placing them in column 1 doesn't fit directly with our current understanding; thus, let's correct our approach considering all clues again for a precise fit:


- The person who likes trance music also likes action movies.
- The dressmaker is to the left of the comedy movie fan (clue 3).
- The Spanish person is to the right of the bird owner (clue 4).


Directly from clue 5, if Fanta is linked with the guinea-pig, and considering other clues for indirect links:


The correct table based on all given information should directly reflect these relationships without contradiction.


Given this analysis, let's construct the final solution table ensuring all clues are respected:


#############
|               |     1      |        2        |
| Beverage      |  Sprite   |      Fanta     |
| Job           | Dressmaker| Project-manager|
| Movie-Genre   |  Action   |     Comedy     |
| Music-Genre   |  Trance   |     Dubstep    |
| Nationality   |  Polish   |     Spanish    |
| Pet           |   Bird    |  Guinea-pig    |

The final answer is: ########.I apologize, but it seems there was an issue with the response format. Here is the revised version:


The correct table based on all given information should directly reflect these relationships without contradiction.

Lv3-6x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the person driving the boat. This clue doesn't give us specific positions yet but tells us about a relationship between two people's hobbies and transport.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. This clue links movie genre with hobby but does not specify which side.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the software-developer. This gives us a direct relationship between beverage preference and job, but we still don't know the positions.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The american is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This clue links nationality with beverage preference and gives a directional hint.


## Step 5: Combining Clues for Initial Placement
From Clue 3, we know the hot-chocolate drinker is on the left of the software-developer, which means the software-developer cannot be in column 1.
From Clue 4, since the American is to the right of the hot-chocolate drinker, and considering the arrangement from Clue 3, the hot-chocolate drinker must be in column 1 (to allow for someone to their right), making the software-developer and thus the American in column 2.


## Step 6: Further Placement
Given that the person hiking is on the left of the boat user (Clue 1) and considering we have limited options, if the hot-chocolate drinker (column 1) is also the hiker, it fits because the boat user could then be in column 2, satisfying Clue 1.


## Step 7: Finalizing Placement
- The person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 1 and must be a hiker to satisfy multiple conditions at once.
- This means the software-developer (column 2) cannot be a hiker but could be skydiving, fitting with our earlier deduction that places them in column 2 based on Clue 3.
- Since the American is on the right of the hot-chocolate drinker and we've placed the hot-chocolate drinker in column 1, the American must be in column 2.
- The western movie watcher being next to the hiker (Clue 2) means if the hiker is in column 1, the western fan could also be in column 2, fitting with our need for a western fan and an American (who could watch any genre but is placed here due to other constraints).
- The boat user must then use the subway since the other transport option is taken by the boat, which places the boat user in column 2 based on earlier deductions about hobbies and transport.
- This leaves us with needing to assign jobs, beverages, and movie genres that fit all clues.


## Step 8: Assigning Remaining Categories
Given our placements:
- Column 1 (hot-chocolate drinker, hiker) cannot be the software-developer or American based on earlier deductions. So, this person must be Indian and watch family movies to satisfy the constraints about nationalities and movie genres not yet directly assigned.
- Column 2, being the American software-developer who skydives and watches westerns (to fit next to the hiker as per Clue 2), drinks iced-tea since hot-chocolate is taken.


The final answer is:
