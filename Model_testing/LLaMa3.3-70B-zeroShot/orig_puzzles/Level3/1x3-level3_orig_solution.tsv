Lv3-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The fan of trance is on the far left or far right.
2. The fan of soul is to the left of the fan of trance.


Given these rules, there are two possible arrangements for the music genres since the position of trance dictates two main scenarios (trance being on the far left or the far right), and then soul must be to its left.


If trance is on the far left:
- Soul must be to its left, but since trance is already on the far left, this scenario cannot happen as there's no space to the left of the far left position for soul. Thus, trance cannot be on the far left based on rule 2.


Therefore, trance must be on the far right (position 3), making the arrangement:
- Soul to the left of trance.
- The only position left for rock is the far left since soul and trance have to occupy positions that satisfy both rules.


So, the order from left to right is: Rock, Soul, Trance.


Here's the final solution table:

Lv3-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the snake's owner
Given that the owner of the snake is in the middle (from clue 2), we can place the snake in position 2.


## Step 2: Determine the relative positions of the hamster and horse owners
From clue 3, since the owner of the snake is on the right of the owner of the hamster, the hamster's owner must be to the left of the snake. This means the hamster can only be in position 1.


## Step 3: Place the horse owner
Given that the owner of the horse is on the far left or far right (from clue 1), and since position 1 is taken by the hamster's owner, the horse's owner must be on the far right, which is position 3.


## Step 4: Construct the solution table
With all pets placed according to the clues, the final arrangement is:


|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
| Pet   | Hamster | Snake | Horse |


The final answer is: ########.###|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |

Lv3-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues:


1. The person driving the tram is on the far left or far right.
2. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the taxi.


From clue 2, we know the tram cannot be on the far left because it must be to the right of the taxi. Therefore, based on clue 1, the tram must be on the far right.


Given this information:


- Tram must be on the far right (column 3).
- Taxi must be to the left of the tram, so it can only be in column 1 or 2.
- Since the tram is in column 3 and must be to the right of the taxi, the taxi cannot be in column 3. If the taxi were in column 2, there would be no space for the train (as per clue 1, tram is on the far right). Therefore, the taxi must be in column 1.
- The only position left for the train is column 2.


So, the arrangement from left to right is: Taxi, Train, Tram.


Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person whose hobby is dancing is on the far left.
2. The person whose hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.

Given that there are three hobbies (dancing, sudoku, and writing) and three positions (left, middle, and right), we can start by placing the person who enjoys dancing on the far left as per statement 1.


|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Dancing |        |         |

Now, considering statement 2, which says the person whose hobby is writing is on the far left or far right, we have a conflict for the far left position because dancing is already placed there. Therefore, the person who enjoys writing must be on the far right.


|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Dancing |        | Writing |

The only hobby left to place is sudoku, which must go in the middle since the other two positions are taken.


|         |    1    |   2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Dancing | Sudoku | Writing |

Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it is:

Lv3-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the techno fan.
The fan of techno is on the far right, which means the techno fan occupies position 3 in the table.

## Step 2: Determine the possible positions of the classical fan.
The classical fan can be either on the far left or the far right. However, since the techno fan is already on the far right (position 3), the classical fan must be on the far left if we are to follow the instructions precisely and not overlap genres in a single position.


## Step 3: Place the remaining genre.
With classical on the far left (position 1) and techno on the far right (position 3), folk, the only remaining genre, must be placed in the middle (position 2).


The final answer is:

Lv3-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The first clue states that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person watching documentary movies. However, since there are only three positions and the documentary watcher must be in the middle (as per clue 3), this means the martial-arts watcher can only be to the right of the documentary watcher because if they were to the left, it would contradict clue 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The second clue directly states that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. This confirms our deduction from step 1 and establishes a fixed position for the martial-arts movie watcher relative to the documentary movie watcher.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The third clue tells us that the person watching documentary movies is in the middle. Given this, we can start placing people based on the clues:
- The documentary movie watcher is in the middle (position 2).
- Since the martial-arts movie watcher must be to the right of the documentary movie watcher (from clue 2), they go in position 3.
- By process of elimination, the adventure movie watcher must then be in position 1.


## Step 4: Constructing the Final Table
Given the analysis above, we can construct our final table as follows:


|               |     1     |      2      |      3       |

Lv3-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions:

1. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
2. The person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right.

Given there are three positions and three beverages (coffee, hot-chocolate, tea), we can deduce as follows:

- Condition 2 tells us that coffee must be either in position 1 or position 3.
- Condition 1 tells us that since coffee must be to the left of hot-chocolate, if coffee is in position 1, hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1 (which it wouldn't be anyway because coffee is there), so hot-chocolate must be in either position 2 or 3. However, since coffee has to be to the left of hot-chocolate and we are considering coffee being in position 1, hot-chocolate can only be in position 2 or 3, but not position 1.
- If coffee were in position 3 (far right), it couldn't be to the left of hot-chocolate unless hot-chocolate is also on the right, which contradicts the premise since there's no one to the right of the far right person. Thus, considering the arrangement, coffee must be on the far left to satisfy both conditions given.

Given these deductions:

- Coffee must be in position 1 because it has to be on the far left to allow for hot-chocolate to be to its right.
- Hot-chocolate then can only be in position 2 since it needs to be to the right of coffee and there needs to be space for tea as well.
- Tea, being the remaining beverage, must then occupy position 3.

So, the arrangement is:
#############
|            |   1    |       2       |  3  |
| Beverage   | Coffee | Hot-Chocolate | Tea |

Lv3-1x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues given:

1. The person drinking Mirinda is on the far left or far right.
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.

From clue 2, we know that almond-milk is on the far left. Given this information and considering clue 1, if almond-milk is on the far left, then Mirinda cannot be on the far left (since almond-milk occupies this spot), which means Mirinda must be on the far right.

Now, let's fill in the table based on these deductions:


|            |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   |             |          |         |
 
Given that almond-milk is on the far left (position 1) and Mirinda is on the far right (position 3), we have:

- Position 1: Almond-milk
- Position 3: Mirinda

The only beverage left to place is lemonade, which must be in position 2 since the other two positions are taken.


|            |      1      |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | almond-milk| lemonade | mirinda |

Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############
|            |      1      |    2     |    3    |

Lv3-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to consider the given clues:


1. The manager is on the far left or far right.
2. The fisherman is on the right of the manager.


From clue 1, there are two possibilities for the manager's position: either column 1 (far left) or column 3 (far right).


If the manager is in column 1 (far left), according to clue 2, the fisherman must be to the right of the manager. This means the fisherman cannot be in column 1 but must be in either column 2 or column 3.


However, if we place the fisherman in column 2, there would be no space for the firefighter (since the manager is already in column 1), which contradicts the requirement that all three jobs must be filled. Therefore, in this scenario, the fisherman must be in column 3, and the firefighter must be in column 2.


Now, let's consider the other possibility from clue 1: if the manager is in column 3 (far right). According to clue 2, the fisherman must be to the right of the manager. However, since there are no columns to the right of column 3, this scenario cannot occur under the given constraints.


Given these considerations, the only valid arrangement that satisfies both clues is:


|       |    1    |     2     |      3      |
| Job   | Manager | Firefighter | Fisherman |


This solution respects clue 1 by placing the manager on the far left and clue 2 by placing the fisherman to the right of the manager.

Lv3-1x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Apply the first condition
The Colombian is on the far left. This means the nationality in column 1 must be Colombian.

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Colombian |         |         |

## Step 2: Apply the second condition
The Turkish is on the right of the Mexican. This gives us two possible arrangements for columns 2 and 3: either Mexican in column 2 and Turkish in column 3, or Turkish cannot be in column 2 because it must be to the right of the Mexican.


## Step 3: Apply the third condition
The Mexican is on the left or right of the Turkish. Given that we've already established the Turkish must be to the right of the Mexican from step 2, and knowing the Colombian is in column 1, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is having the Mexican in column 2 and the Turkish in column 3.


## Step 4: Finalize the table
Given all conditions, the final arrangement must be:

|               |     1     |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Mexican | Turkish |
