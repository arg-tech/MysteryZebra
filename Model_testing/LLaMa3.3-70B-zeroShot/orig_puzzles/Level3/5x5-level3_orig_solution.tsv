Lv3-5x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we can.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The project-manager is on the far right (column 5).


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 4 and 13
The person watching time-travel movies is in the middle (column 3), and the engineer is also in the middle. This means the engineer must watch time-travel movies because there can only be one person in the middle.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 19
The pakistani is the project-manager, which means the Pakistani is in column 5.


## Step 4: Analyze Clues 1 and 17
The person whose hobby is cooking owns a bird, but clue 5 also states the Pakistani owns a bird. This implies the Pakistani's hobby could be cooking since they are the project manager and can't have two different hobbies.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 9
The software-developer is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani is in column 5, the software-developer must be in column 4.


## Step 6: Analyze Clues 7 and 18
The person whose hobby is fishing is on the right of the American, and the project-manager (Pakistani) is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. This means the order for these three must be American, Fishing, Pakistani from left to right.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 8
The Australian is between the Pakistani and the owner of the snake. Given the Pakistani is in column 5, this clue doesn't provide immediate placement but indicates the Australian cannot be in column 5.


## Step 8: Analyze Clues 2 and 12
The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is cooking (who owns a bird), and the person whose hobby is camping is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since we know the Pakistani (column 5) has the bird, these clues help us understand potential movie genre placements.


## Step 9: Analyze Clue 16
The person whose hobby is hiking is the owner of the frog. This clue directly connects a hobby with a pet.


## Step 10: Combine Information
Given the engineer watches time-travel movies and is in the middle, we start to piece together:
- Column 3: Engineer watching time-travel movies.
- The Australian is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies (clue 6), placing them in column 4 or beyond, but since the software-developer is in column 4 and the Pakistani/project-manager in column 5, the Australian must be before the Pakistani, which contradicts unless we reconsider based on all clues.


## Step 11: Reconsider Placement Based on Nationality Clues
Given the complexity, let's directly apply some nationality clues:
- The American and fishing hobbyist (with the project-manager/Pakistani to their right) need placement. If the Australian is between the Pakistani and snake owner, and considering other constraints, we have a puzzle piece that needs careful consideration.


## Step 12: Finalize Placement
Given all clues, especially about nationalities, jobs, hobbies, pets, and movie genres, let's fill in what we can directly:
- Column 5: Pakistani, project-manager.
- The Australian is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies but must be before the Pakistani if they are between the Pakistani and snake owner.


## Step 13: Apply Remaining Clues
Clue 15 says the person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the British. With the engineer in the middle watching time-travel, we need to fit other movie genres around them.


The final answer is:

Lv3-5x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 9 - The Argentine is on the far right.
Given that the Argentine is on the far right (Clue 9), and combining it with Clue 13 which states the Argentine is the lawyer, we can start filling in the table:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            |          |            |           |
| Job           |               |            |          |            |  Lawyer   |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            |           |
| Nationality   |               |            |          |            | Argentine |
| Sport         |               |            |          |            |           |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 14 - The person drinking water is the lawyer.
Since the Argentine (who is also the lawyer) drinks water (Clue 14), we update the table:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            |          |            | Water     |
| Job           |               |            |          |            | Lawyer    |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            |           |
| Nationality   |               |            |          |            | Argentine |
| Sport         |               |            |          |            |           |

## Step 3: Apply Clue 19 - The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left.
Given that the person whose sport is weightlifting is on the far left (Clue 19), we can fill in the sport for position 1:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            |          |            | Water     |
| Job           |               |            |          |            | Lawyer    |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            |           |
| Nationality   |               |            |          |            | Argentine |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |            |          |            |           |

## Step 4: Apply Clue 7 - The person watching epic movies is on the far right.
Since the person watching epic movies is also on the far right (Clue 7), and given that the Argentine is already placed there, we combine these clues:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            |          |            | Water     |
| Job           |               |            |          |            | Lawyer    |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            | Epic      |
| Nationality   |               |            |          |            | Argentine |
| Sport         | Weightlifting |            |          |            |           |

## Step 5: Apply Clue 1 - The Argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.
Combining with Clue 16 which states the Nigerian is the person whose sport is rowing, we place rowing and its associated nationality:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            |          |            | Water     |
| Job           |               |            |          |            | Lawyer    |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            | Epic      |
| Nationality   |               |            | Nigerian |            | Argentine |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Rowing     |          |            |           |

## Step 6: Apply Clue 2 - The person whose sport is swimming is on the right of the Australian.
And from Clue 3, the Australian is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since we don't have direct information about the positions of these yet, we'll move to other clues for more information.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 18 - The photographer is the Egyptian, and Clue 11 - The Egyptian drinks cola.
Also, applying Clue 6 which states the person drinking 7up is the accountant:


|               |       1       |     2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage      |               |            | Cola     |            | Water     |
| Job           |               |            |          |            | Lawyer    |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |          |            | Epic      |
| Nationality   |               |            | Nigerian |            | Argentine |
| Sport         | Weightlifting | Rowing     |          |            |           |

## Step 8: Apply Clue 10 - The person whose sport is golf is on the far left or far right.
Given that weightlifting is already on the far left, golf could potentially be on the far right, but since epic movies (and thus the Argentine) are fixed on the far right, and considering other sports' placements, we need to carefully place golf.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 5 - The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.
And from Clue 15, the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Without direct placement information for these genres yet, we look at other clues.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 4 - The person watching comedy movies is on the far left or far right.
Considering the placements so far and the need to balance the remaining options, we must strategically place comedy, keeping in mind the restrictions on movie genres and sports.


## Step 11: Finalize Placements Based on All Clues
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach to not miss any clue, let's consolidate what we know and make educated guesses where direct information is lacking:


- The far left has weightlifting (Clue 19).
- The Argentine (lawyer) is on the far right with epic movies and drinks water.
- Rowing is associated with the Nigerian and must be to the left of the Argentine.
- Swimming's position relative to the Australian and drama movies needs consideration with zombie movies to its right.
- Golf could potentially fit in one of the middle spots if it doesn't conflict with other placements.


Given these steps and the complexity of directly applying each clue without visual aids or further iterative steps, we recognize that a direct solution requires carefully balancing all given conditions. However, without the ability to visually rearrange and apply each clue in real-time within this format, we'll outline a general approach to solving it:


1. Fix known positions (Argentine on the far right with epic movies and water, weightlifting on the far left).
2. Place rowing and its associated Nigerian nationality.
3. Determine the Australian's position relative to drama movies and swimming.
4. Fit in golf, considering its restriction to the far left or right, though weightlifting occupies the far left.
5. Balance the remaining sports (swimming), nationalities, jobs, and movie genres according to the clues.


The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|}
\hline
Weightlifting & Rowing & Swimming & Golf & \\
\hline
Comedy & Satire & Drama & Zombie & Epic\\

Lv3-5x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 18 and 17 for Initial Placement
From clue 18, the person driving the tram is on the far left. Clue 17 indicates the owner of the chinchilla is also on the far left. Since there can only be one person on the far left, we deduce that the person driving the tram owns the chinchilla.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 10 for Entrepreneur's Position
The entrepreneur is in the middle (clue 10), which means they are in position 3 since there are an odd number of positions (5).


## Step 3: Use Clues 16 and 19 to Place Filmmaking and Fish Owner
Clue 16 states the person who's hobby is filmmaking owns the fish, and clue 19 says this person is in the middle. This means the filmmaker/fish owner must also be in position 3, conflicting with the entrepreneur unless we've misinterpreted ""middle"" as not necessarily position 3 but one of the central positions (2, 3, or 4). Given the direct statement, we'll correct our approach to consider that ""middle"" could imply position 3 for one person, but since both can't occupy the same space, further clues will clarify.


## Step 4: Clarify Middle Position and Apply Clue 19 Accurately
Given the entrepreneur is in position 3 (from clue 10), and considering the fish owner/filmmaker must be central but not necessarily directly in position 3, we might initially think there's a conflict. However, re-evaluating clue 19 with the understanding that ""middle"" could imply positions around the center (2, 3, or 4 for an odd number of total positions), and considering clue 10 places the entrepreneur firmly in position 3, the fish owner/filmmaker should be adjacent to this central position.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 15 for Van Driver's Position Relative to Filmmaker
The person driving the van is on the right of the filmmaker (clue 15). Since we're still clarifying positions around the entrepreneur, let's consider the filmmaker could be in position 2 or 4 to satisfy being central but not directly in position 3.


## Step 6: Consider Clues 1 and Other Music Genre Clues
The musician is between the fan of funk and the person whose hobby is reading (clue 1). This gives us a sequence but no direct positions yet.


## Step 7: Analyze Remaining Clues for Direct Positions or Relations
Clue 2 places the quad-bike driver near rock-climbing, clue 3 places traveling to the right of fish, and so on. Each clue provides relationships that will help fill in the table.


## Step 8: Piece Together Information for Final Placements
- From clue 17 and 18, tram and chinchilla owner is on the far left.
- Entrepreneur (clue 10) is in position 3.
- Filmmaker/fish owner (clues 16 and 19) needs to be central but considering entrepreneur's placement, likely in position 2 or 4.
- Given the complexity and interrelation of clues, let's directly apply all known relationships:
1. Tram/chinchilla on far left.
2. Entrepreneur in the middle (position 3).
3. Filmmaker/fish owner likely adjacent to entrepreneur, so in position 2 or 4.
Considering these placements and re-evaluating for direct positions:
- The filmmaker owns a fish (clue 16) and is central (but with entrepreneur in position 3, let's consider them in position 2 for now).
- Van driver to the right of filmmaker (clue 15), which could place van in position 4 if filmmaker is indeed in 2.


## Step 9: Finalize Positions Based on All Clues
Given the extensive interrelations and without a straightforward linear path from the clues provided, we deduce key positions:
- Tram/chinchilla: Position 1.
- Filmmaker/fish owner: Position 2 (to satisfy central placement and allow entrepreneur in position 3).
- Entrepreneur: Position 3.
- Considering other clues for music genres, pets, jobs, and hobbies, each clue helps to narrow down the possible arrangements.

Since the person eating grapes is on the far left or far right and is also the pilot, let's place them on one of the ends. Given that radish is already on the far right (clue 17), grapes (and thus the pilot) must be on the far left.

## Step 5: Apply clue 3
The person whose hobby is woodworking is the person watching time-travel movies.


We'll come back to this since we don't have enough information yet to place them.


## Step 6: Apply clue 12
The person watching western movies is on the right of the doctor.


This clue gives us a relationship but doesn't give us an exact position yet.


## Step 7: Apply clue 9
The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the turtle.


Again, we'll have to come back to this as we don't know where the turtle's owner is yet.


## Step 8: Apply clue 16
The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.


Too early to apply without more information.


## Step 9: Apply clue 11
The videographer is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.


Since the videographer is already placed (on the far right), this means the horse's owner must be in position 4.

| Pet           |           |             |                    | horse   |              |

## Step 10: Apply clue 1
The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.


Too early without knowing where hiking or the rat is.


## Step 11: Apply clue 4
The person watching drama movies is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the person watching martial-arts movies.


We need more information before applying this clue.


## Step 12: Apply clue 6
The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person eating carrot.


Given that western must be near carrot, but we don't know where either is yet.


## Step 13: Combine clues 12 and 6
Since western is on the right of the doctor (clue 12) and also near carrot (clue 6), let's try to place these pieces together.


However, without direct connections to other known positions, we'll have to wait.


## Step 14: Apply clue 8
The manager is on the right of the person eating plum.


And clue 14 says the manager is on the left of the owner of the rat. This gives us a sequence but not enough to place yet.


## Step 15: Apply clue 10
The person eating orange is on the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.


And from clue 15, the person eating orange is also on the right of the person watching mystery movies.


These clues give us sequences but no fixed positions without more information.


## Step 16: Use clue 13
The person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.


This clue links two pieces but doesn't give enough to place them without other connections.


Given the complexity and the format requirements, let's synthesize what we can directly infer and make educated placements where possible:


- Grapes (pilot) is on the far left.
- Radish (videographer) is on the far right.
- Horse is in position 4.

Let's try to fill in more based on direct clues and logical deductions, keeping in mind that some steps might require revisiting as new information becomes available.


The final answer is:

Lv3-5x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 3
The social-worker is in the middle, which means the social-worker is in position 3.


## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The social-worker is between the person driving the ship and the journalist. Given the social-worker's position, the ship driver must be in position 2, and the journalist in position 4.


## Step 3: Use clue 2
The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the ship driver is in position 2, the filmmaker must be in position 4 or further to the right. However, considering the journalist is in position 4 (from step 2), the filmmaker cannot be in position 4 but could potentially be in position 5.


## Step 4: Apply clue 15
The owner of the mouse is the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This confirms the filmmaker is indeed in one of the positions further to the right, supporting the potential placement in position 5 from step 3.


## Step 5: Use clue 8
The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the chef. Given the filmmaker is likely in position 5 (from steps 3 and 4), the chef must be in either position 4 or 6, but since position 6 does not exist (only 5 positions are available), the chef cannot be to the right of the filmmaker, suggesting a potential conflict unless the filmmaker is actually in position 4, which would place the chef in position 3 or 5. However, clue 1 and step 2 already established the journalist in position 4 and the social-worker in position 3, indicating a need for careful reconsideration based on subsequent clues.


## Step 6: Reconsider positions based on additional clues
Given the complexities and potential conflicts from earlier steps, let's directly apply more specific clues to clarify positions:


- Clue 11 states the engineer is the owner of the bird.
- Clue 14 indicates the person driving the ship is on the right of the owner of the bird, suggesting the bird owner (and thus the engineer) must be in position 1.


## Step 7: Apply clue 9
The owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the jet-ski. Clue 16 states the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig, implying a sequence but not directly placing them without considering other clues.


## Step 8: Use clue 17
The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the roller. This gives another sequence but requires integration with other information for precise placement.


## Step 9: Integrate all relevant clues for final placement
Considering all clues and potential placements, let's construct a coherent solution:


1. Engineer (bird) - Given clue 11 and the need for the engineer to be in position 1 based on clue 14.
2. Ship driver - To the right of the bird owner (clue 14), placing them in position 2 as per earlier deductions.
3. Social-worker - Confirmed in the middle (position 3) by clue 3.
4. Journalist - Placed here due to clue 1 and the established positions around the social-worker.
5. Filmmaker (mouse owner, clue 15) - Must be on the right of the ship driver (clue 2) and considering other placements, likely in position 5.


Given these positions and integrating all clues for hobbies, jobs, pets, sports, and transports:


|             |    1     |    2     |       3       |       4       |     5      |
| Hobby       |          |          |               |               |            |
| Job         | Engineer |          | Social-worker | Journalist    |            |
| Pet         | Bird     |          |               |               | Mouse      |
| Sport       |          |          |               |               |            |
| Transport   |          | Ship     |               |               |            |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information based on the clues:


- Clue 4: Baking is with the frog owner.
- Clue 5: Volleyball is with the mouse owner (position 5).
- Clue 6: Drawing is to the right of rock-climbing.
- Clue 7 and 9: Guinea-pig owner drives a jet-ski, near volleyball (mouse owner).
- Clue 10: Bird owner (engineer) is near swimming.
- Clue 12: Tennis is with the snake owner.
- Clue 13: Cycling is near tennis.
- Clue 16 and 17: Skateboard is to the left of the guinea-pig owner, and rock-climbing is to the left of the roller driver.


Considering all these clues and the already established positions:


The engineer (bird owner) must be near swimming (clue 10), suggesting cycling or tennis could be in position 2 or another adjacent position but given the ship's placement, we adjust our understanding to fit the clues about sports and pets:


Given the filmmaker is also the mouse owner (clue 15) and considering volleyball (clue 5), the filmmaker must indeed be in position 5. The guinea-pig owner (jet-ski driver, clue 9) must be near the mouse owner (volleyball player, clue 7), suggesting a potential conflict unless carefully placed around the established positions.


To fit all clues without direct contradictions and based on the provided sequences and relationships:


The chef must be with filmmaking (clue 8), which we've placed in position 5. The accountant and remaining sports and pets need placement. Given the constraints:


Accountant could fit with rock-climbing or another hobby not directly assigned to a job yet.


Given all considerations, let's finalize based on direct clues and logical deductions where possible:


The final table considering all provided information and attempting to minimize conflicts would ideally look like this, but given the complexity and potential for error in manual step-by-step analysis without visual aids or more straightforward clues, the precise placement of each hobby, job, pet, sport, and transport requires careful integration of all clues:


Given the complexity and the necessity for precision in placing each category based on the clues provided, let's simplify the final presentation to directly reflect a solution that adheres to the given format requirements while acknowledging the detailed step-by-step might not lead to a single, unequivocal placement without further clarification or assumptions beyond the provided clues.

Lv3-5x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
The person eating strawberry is on the far left or far right.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 6
The writer is on the left of the person eating strawberry. This means if strawberry is on the far right, the writer must be in position 4, and if strawberry is on the far left, the writer could potentially be in position 1 but given the phrasing, it suggests a direct adjacency.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 16
The person eating potato is on the far left or far right. Combining with clue 3 (the musician is the person eating potato), this gives us two potential endpoints for musicians and strawberry eaters.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 1
The person watching mystery movies is a fan of gospel. This doesn't give us direct placement but links movie genre to music genre.


## Step 5: Use Clue 15
The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. This clue starts to link transport to movie genres.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 11
The dressmaker is on the left of the person watching epic movies, and the software-developer is on the left of the dressmaker. This starts to build a sequence but doesn't directly place anyone yet.


## Step 7: Analyze Clues for Direct Placement
From clue 10 (the person watching western movies is the person eating peas) and clue 7 (the person watching western movies is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the car), we can start to piece together sequences but still lack direct placements.


## Step 8: Combine Clues for Music Genres
Clue 5 states the fan of r&b is on the right of the fan of gospel. With clue 1, this starts to give us a sequence of music preferences but not direct placements.


## Step 9: Piece Together Remaining Clues
- Clue 8 links spy movies to salsa.
- Clue 9 places trance between cauliflower and strawberry.
- Clue 12 places banana between zombie and spy movies.
- Clue 13 links strawberry to skateboard.
- Clue 14 states the fan of jazz drives a car.


## Step 10: Finalize Placements
Given the complexity and the need for iterative deductions based on multiple clues, we'll summarize key points:
- Strawberry is far left or right (Clue 4).
- Writer is next to strawberry (Clue 6).
- Potato (musician) is far left or right (Clue 16).
- Mystery movies are linked to gospel music and ship transport (Clues 1, 15).
- Dressmaker and software-developer sequence (Clues 2, 11).
- Western movies (peas eater) between taxi and car (Clue 7).
- R&B fan is right of gospel fan (Clue 5).
- Trance fan between cauliflower and strawberry (Clue 9).
- Banana eater between zombie and spy movies (Clue 12).
- Strawberry eater next to skateboarder (Clue 13).
- Jazz fan drives a car (Clue 14).

Given the constraints, we deduce placements iteratively considering all clues together:


Since direct step-by-step deductions without a visual aid can become confusing due to the complexity of interactions between different preferences and jobs, let's directly infer based on key clues that provide clear links or endpoints.

| Transport     | skateboard     | train    | boat       | trike      | ship        |

From clue 17, we know that the police-officer is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
From clue 18, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is the electrician.

Let's add this to our table:

|               |       1        |    2     |     3      |     4      |      5      |

Lv3-5x5-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue carefully and use a step-by-step approach.


From clue 5, the person driving the train is in the middle (position 3).


Clue 6 indicates that the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right. Since the chef drinks soy-milk (clue 2), the chef must be at either end.


Given clue 3, the biathlon enthusiast is on the far right, which means the chef cannot be on the far right because the chef and the person whose sport is biathlon cannot occupy the same position. Thus, the chef must be on the far left.


Clue 1 states that the skateboarder is to the immediate left or right of the project-manager. Clue 4 says the sprite drinker is to the immediate left or right of the dressmaker.


From clue 16, since the fan of funk (the designer) is between the rock fan and the chef, and considering the chef is on the far left, we can start building a sequence but need more information to solidify positions.


Clue 8 tells us that the soul fan is between the punk and rock fans. Clue 9 indicates that the tennis enthusiast is next to the soul fan.


Given clue 10 (the funk fan is the designer), clue 16, and knowing the chef's position, we can start piecing together the music genres and jobs but need more connections.


Clue 7 places the surfing enthusiast to the left of the 7up drinker. Clue 11 indicates that the tennis player is between the 7up drinker and the rowing enthusiast.


From clue 12, the jet-ski driver is to the left of the videographer.


Considering all clues together:


1. Chef (soy-milk) on the far left.
2. Train driver in the middle.
3. Biathlon enthusiast on the far right.
4. Skateboarder next to the project-manager.
5. Designer (funk fan) between rock fan and chef.
6. Soul fan between punk and rock fans, with tennis player next to them.
7. Surfing enthusiast to the left of 7up drinker.
8. Jet-ski driver to the left of videographer.


Let's start filling in based on direct clues:


- The chef is on the far left (1), drinking soy-milk (2).
- The train driver is in the middle (5).
- The biathlon enthusiast is on the far right (3).


Given these constraints and others, we can deduce more specific placements by combining all given information.


The skateboarder being next to the project-manager (1) and other clues about relative positions need to be integrated with job, music, sport, and transport preferences.


Given that there are many interlocking conditions, a systematic approach considering each clue's impact on possible arrangements is necessary. Let's outline potential solutions based on given constraints:


- Far left: Chef (soy-milk)
- Middle: Train driver
- Far right: Biathlon enthusiast


The chef being on the far left and drinking soy-milk helps anchor our starting point.


Since direct deductions lead to complex interactions, we prioritize clues that offer clear positional data relative to others.


Clue 15 indicates almond-milk is near 7up. Clue 14 places the chef (soy-milk) to the right of the snowmobile driver, but since the chef is on the far left, this clue must be interpreted with caution considering our current understanding.


The puzzle requires a detailed step-by-step elimination process based on all given clues. Without manually iterating through each possible combination while applying every rule, we risk overlooking critical interactions between different preferences.


Given the complexity and the need for precise application of all rules in a sequential manner that considers all potential arrangements, let's simplify our approach to directly infer the solution based on provided information:


Considering all constraints and trying to fit them into a coherent table while respecting the format requirements would lead us through a process of elimination and direct placement based on clues. However, without visually laying out each step in a sequential manner here, we must consider how each clue restricts possible arrangements.


Given this complexity, let's outline a potential arrangement that fits all given conditions:


|               |        1        |      2       |     3      |     4      |    5     |

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |      4      |     5      |

| Hobby         |          |           |            |             |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |           |            |             |            |
| Sport         |          |           |      -polo |             |            |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 8
The person who's sport is skiing is the person drinking water. Given Clue 17, this person also likes electronic music.

|               |    1     |     2     |     3      |      4      |     5      |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Water     |            |             |            |
| Food          |          |           |            |             |            |
| Hobby         |          |           |            |             |            |

## Step 3: Apply Clue 10
The person who's sport is skiing is on the far left or far right. Since coffee is already on the far left, skiing (and thus water) must be on the far right, but this conflicts with our current placement based on earlier steps. Re-evaluation is needed considering all clues.


## Step 4: Re-evaluate Placement Based on Clue 10
Given the conflict, let's correctly place skiing/water on one of the ends. Since coffee is on the far left, and considering other clues about endings, we need to adjust our approach to accommodate all conditions.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 11
The fan of house is in the middle.
