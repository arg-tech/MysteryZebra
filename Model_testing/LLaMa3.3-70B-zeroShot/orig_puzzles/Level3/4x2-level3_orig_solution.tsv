Lv3-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step.


1. The social-worker is on the left or right of the person drinking Fanta.
2. The musician is on the right of the social-worker.
3. The person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian.

Given these clues:


- From clue 2, we know the order for jobs is: social-worker -> musician (left to right).
- Clue 1 tells us that Fanta must be either with the social-worker or the musician since they are next to each other.
- Clue 3 indicates the bike is on the right of the Italian.

Let's start filling in what we know:


|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |               |          |
| Job           | Social-worker | Musician |
| Nationality   |               |          |
| Transport     |               |          |

Now, let's apply the remaining clues:


- Since the musician is on the right of the social-worker (clue 2), and considering clue 1, Fanta could be with either, but we need to determine which one based on other clues.
- The bike being on the right of the Italian (clue 3) means if the Italian were in column 1, the bike would have to be in column 2. But since the social-worker and musician are already determined to be in that order, the transport can't directly tell us the nationality without considering beverages.


Given the social-worker is next to Fanta (clue 1), and assuming the simplest scenario where each clue gives unique information:


- If the Italian were on the left (column 1), then the bike must be on the right (column 2). This means the person using the airplane must be on the left.
- Since the musician is on the right, and if we consider Fanta to be with the social-worker based on clue 1 for simplicity, we could have a preliminary setup.


However, let's directly apply what we know without assuming:


The Italian cannot use the bike (since the bike is to the right of the Italian), so the Italian must use the airplane. This means the Mexican uses the bike because it's the only option left.


Given this and applying clue 3 directly:


|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | Fanta        | Soy-milk |
| Job           | Social-worker| Musician |
| Nationality   | Italian      | Mexican  |
| Transport     | Airplane     | Bike     |

This setup respects all given conditions:
- The social-worker is next to the person drinking Fanta.
- The musician is on the right of the social-worker.
- The bike (used by the Mexican) is on the right of the Italian.


Therefore, the solution table, considering all clues provided and logical deductions, is:


#############
|               |       1       |    2     |

Lv3-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given:


1. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
2. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of R&B.
3. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.


Given clue 3, we start with the transport column since we know the scooter is on the far left:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |            |             |
| Pet           |            |             |
| Transport     | Scooter    | Airplane    |


From clue 1, since the scooter is on the far left (position 1), the cat must be in position 1 or 2 because it has to be on the left or right of the scooter. But since the person with the scooter is already determined to be in position 1, the cat's owner can only be in position 2 if we consider ""left or right"" in a general sense without specifying which side must be adjacent. However, considering standard interpretations of such puzzles and given that one option must always be directly next to the other for such clues to make logical sense in these types of puzzles, it implies the cat owner could indeed only logically fit into position 2 if we strictly interpret ""on the left or right"" as requiring direct adjacency.


Given clue 2, watermelon is on the left of R&B. Since the scooter (and thus its rider) is already placed on the far left (position 1), and considering the cat must be adjacent to the scooter's owner based on a strict interpretation of clue 1, we have two possibilities for music genres if we were to ignore other constraints temporarily: either watermelon corresponds with position 1 or it could theoretically correspond with another arrangement but given our current placement of the scooter and considering adjacency requirements, we should focus on how these clues interlock.


Since the person driving the scooter is on the far left (position 1), and if we consider the cat to be in an adjacent position for simplicity (thus position 2, as direct adjacency simplifies the interpretation), we then look at clue 2 more closely. Watermelon being on the left of R&B means that if watermelon were associated with the scooter (position 1), R&B could only fit into position 2, which fits our current placement strategy for simplicity.


However, considering all combinations and directly applying the clues without assuming non-stated direct adjacencies beyond what's explicitly required:


- If the cat is in position 2 (to satisfy being ""on the left or right"" of the scooter under a strict adjacency interpretation), 
- And given watermelon must be to the left of R&B, placing watermelon in position 1 would necessitate R&B being in position 2, which aligns with our need for the cat's owner also being in position 2 if we interpret ""left or right"" as requiring direct proximity.


So, combining all clues directly and efficiently without over-assuming:


- Transport: Scooter is in position 1 (far left), Airplane in position 2.
- Given this setup, if Watermelon (Food) is on the left of R&B (Music-Genre), it suggests:
  - Food: Watermelon could be in position 1 to satisfy being on the ""left"" of R&B in a general sense since specific placement within these constraints isn't directly contradicted.
  - Music-Genre: Thus, if Watermelon is in position 1 and must be on the left of R&B, then R&B would logically fit into position 2.
- Pet: Since the cat's owner must be adjacent to the scooter's rider (position 1), and considering our direct placement for simplicity, Cat could indeed be with the person in position 2, satisfying the condition under a strict interpretation.


Now, applying these deductions directly:


|               |     1      |      2      |
| Food          | Watermelon| Cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   | Punk       | R&B         |
| Pet           | Rabbit    | Cat         |
| Transport     | Scooter    | Airplane    |


Given the clues, this setup seems to fit all conditions directly or indirectly provided:

Lv3-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


Given:
- Hobbies: board-games, hiking
- Jobs: analyst, project-manager
- Music Genres: folk, r&b
- Transport: quad-bike, scooter


Clues:
1. The fan of r&b is on the far right.
2. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst.
3. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of r&b.


From clue 1, we know the music genre for column 2 is r&b.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |                 |             |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 |     r&b     |
| Transport     |                 |             |


From clue 4, since the scooter is to the left of the fan of r&b, and given that the r&b fan is in column 2, the scooter must be in column 1.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 4
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |                 |             |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 |     r&b     |
| Transport     |    scooter      |             |


Given the transport in column 1 is a scooter, and from clue 3, the quad-bike must be in column 2 because the scooter is on the left or right of the quad-bike.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |                 |             |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 |     r&b     |
| Transport     |    scooter      |   quad-bike |


From clue 2, the hiker is to the left of the analyst. Since we don't have any direct information about the positions of the analyst and the project manager yet, let's consider the music genres and hobbies.


The fan of folk must be in column 1 because r&b is already assigned to column 2.


## Step 4: Assign Music Genre
|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |                 |             |
| Job           |                 |             |
| Music-Genre   |     folk        |     r&b     |
| Transport     |    scooter      |   quad-bike |


Given the music genres, and since hiking is to the left of the analyst (clue 2), if we assume hiking is in column 1, then the analyst cannot be in column 1 but must be in column 2. However, this conflicts with our current understanding because we've already established the transport for each column, and clue 2 doesn't directly tell us which job is associated with which music genre or transport.


Let's re-evaluate: If the person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst (clue 2), and considering we have to fill in jobs, hobbies, and we've already determined the music genres and transports, then the only configuration that makes sense is having the hiker in column 1 and the analyst in column 2. This means the project manager must be associated with hiking because if the analyst were on the left, it would contradict clue 2.


## Step 5: Assign Jobs and Hobbies
Since we know the person driving the scooter (column 1) likes folk music and given the constraints about jobs and hobbies:
- Column 1 has folk, scooter, and must be hiking to fit clue 2.
- Column 2 has r&b, quad-bike, and since it's the analyst based on our deduction from clue 2.


The final assignments considering all clues are:


|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |   hiking       | board-games |
| Job           | project-manager|    analyst  |
| Music-Genre   |     folk        |     r&b     |
| Transport     |    scooter      |   quad-bike |


Given the analysis and application of clues:

|               |        1        |      2      |
| Hobby         |   hiking       | board-games |

Lv3-4x2-4	"Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
2. The person drinking tea is the owner of the hamster.
3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies.

From statement 2, we know:
- The person drinking tea owns a hamster.

Combining this with statement 1 and knowing there are only two people (thus two positions: left and right), we can start building our table:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   |         |        |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |

Now, let's use statement 3:
- The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies.

This means the person watching epic movies must be on the left since cola is on the right. Thus:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    |        |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |

The only movie genre left for the right side is action:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Action |
| Music-Genre   |         |        |
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |

Now, considering statement 1 and our current table:
- The fan of disco is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.

Given that the rat's owner is on the right (based on our setup), and we have a person watching epic movies on the left who owns a hamster, the only way for the disco fan to be next to the rat's owner without contradicting any rules is if the disco fan is also the rat's owner or the person on the left. However, since we've already established that the person on the left (drinking tea) watches epic movies and owns a hamster, this means the person who likes disco must be flexible in their position based on initial interpretation. But given our current setup, it makes more sense to assign music genres based on what's left:

- The only music genre left for the person watching action movies (and drinking cola) is trance because epic movie watcher (tea drinker) would logically pair with disco if we were matching based solely on remaining options and the fact that statement 1 suggests a proximity requirement which could be satisfied by having disco on the left, thus:

|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Action |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Trance |
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |

This setup respects all given conditions:
- The fan of disco is next to the owner of the rat (considering our flexible interpretation and the table's constraints).
- The person drinking tea owns a hamster.
- The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies.

Therefore, the solution to the puzzle, respecting the format request, is:

#############
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic    | Action |
| Music-Genre   | Disco   | Trance |
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |

Lv3-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 2
The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale. This means kale must be on the left (1) and kiwi on the right (2).


## Step 2: Apply Statement 1
The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since we know from Step 1 that kiwi is on the right, the person drinking 7up must be on the left to satisfy this condition as well.


## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3
The accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. This means the accountant cannot be on the right side because there would be no one to their left for tennis to be associated with.


## Step 4: Deduce Jobs and Sports
Given that the accountant must be on the left, we can now start filling in jobs and sports based on this rule. If the accountant is on the left (1), then tennis cannot be on the left but must be on the right (2) because it has to be to the right of the accountant.


## Step 5: Fill in Beverages
From Statement 1, if kiwi is associated with person 2 and assuming that person drinks Fanta (since we don't have enough info yet to conclusively place beverages without considering food), then the person eating kale (on the left) would drink 7up.


## Step 6: Finalize Jobs and Sports
Knowing tennis must be on the right, climbing must be associated with the accountant on the left. The entrepreneur, by process of elimination, is on the right.


## Step 7: Construct Solution Table
Based on all deductions:
- Beverage: Left (1) drinks 7up, Right (2) drinks Fanta.
- Food: Left (1) eats kale, Right (2) eats kiwi.
- Job: Left (1) is accountant, Right (2) is entrepreneur.
- Sport: Left (1) prefers climbing, Right (2) prefers tennis.


The final answer is:

| Food       | kale       | kiwi         |

Lv3-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
2. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
3. The person eating asparagus is on the left of the owner of the bird.

From statement 3, we know the person eating asparagus must be on the left of the bird owner. This gives us a starting point.


Let's assign the positions based on the information:


- Since the person eating asparagus is to the left of the bird owner (statement 3), and there are only two people, this means the asparagus eater cannot be on the right side if we consider the bird owner to be on the right. Thus, asparagus must be associated with person 1, and the bird with person 2.


Given statement 2, the person drinking sprite must be next to the bird owner. Since the bird is with person 2 (based on our deduction from statement 3), sprite must also be with person 2 or person 1. However, because mirinda's placement is dependent on skydiving (statement 1) and we don't know its exact position relative to skydiving yet, we need to figure out the hobby first.


Statement 1 says mirinda is next to skydiving. If asparagus (and thus person 1) is to the left of the bird owner (person 2), then for mirinda to be next to skydiving and considering our current setup (asparagus on the left, bird on the right), skydiving must be associated with either person 1 or person 2.


Given that asparagus is already determined to be on the left (with person 1) based on its relation to the bird, we can now figure out the placement of hobbies and drinks:


- If the bird is with person 2 (as deduced), and sprite must be next to the bird (statement 2), then sprite is likely with person 2 because it has to be adjacent to the bird.


Now, considering mirinda's relation to skydiving (statement 1) and knowing asparagus (and thus person 1) is on the left of the bird owner (person 2), we can deduce that if skydiving were with person 2, mirinda would have to be with person 1 to satisfy being ""on the left or right"" of skydiving. However, this leaves us to figure out where garlic and hiking fit.


Since asparagus is already linked to person 1 (because it's on the left of the bird), garlic must then be associated with person 2, because there are only two types of food mentioned.


For hobbies, if we place skydiving with person 2 (to satisfy mirinda being next to it and considering our current placements), hiking would have to go with person 1. This is because each person has a unique hobby, and we've already placed asparagus (food) with person 1 and deduced the bird (pet) is with person 2.


Now, let's summarize what we know into the table:


|            |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | mirinda   | sprite  |
| Food       | asparagus| garlic  |
| Hobby      | hiking    | skydiving|
| Pet        | goldfish  | bird    |


This setup satisfies all conditions given in the puzzle:


1. Mirinda is next to skydiving (person 1 is next to person 2).
2. Sprite is next to the bird owner (sprite is with person 2, who owns the bird).
3. Asparagus eater is on the left of the bird owner (asparagus is with person 1, who is on the left).


Therefore, the solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:


#############
|            |     1     |    2    |

Lv3-4x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:

1. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the owner of the pony.
2. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The person driving the scooter is the person watching drama movies.

From clue 3, we know the scooter is associated with drama movies.

Given the hobbies are video-games and writing, movie-genres are drama and epic, pets are goat and pony, and transports are scooter and skateboard, let's start filling in the information based on the clues:

- Since the person driving the scooter watches drama movies (clue 3), and considering clue 1, this person must be next to the pony owner. However, we don't know if they own a goat or a pony yet.
- Clue 2 tells us the skateboard is to the left of the writing hobbyist. This means the person who likes video-games (the only other hobby) cannot be on the far left because then there would be no one to the left of the writing hobbyist unless the writing hobbyist was on the far right, which we'll explore.

Let's try placing based on clue 2 first:

If skateboard is on the left and associated with the epic movie genre (since scooter is drama), and it must be to the left of the person who likes writing:

|               |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Writing   | Video-games|
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Drama     |
| Pet           | ?         | ?         |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Scooter   |

However, this initial placement doesn't account for the pony and goat owners or fully satisfy clue 1 without more information. 

Considering clue 1 again, if the scooter (drama) is next to the pony owner, we have two scenarios based on our current setup:

1. The person with the scooter could own the pony and be on the right.
2. Or, they are next to the pony owner.

But given our constraints and the need for the skateboard to be to the left of the writing hobbyist, let's correct the approach focusing on satisfying all clues simultaneously:

Given clue 3 (scooter watches drama), and if we consider the scooter might not necessarily own the pony but must be next to it (clue 1), we can deduce that the arrangement needs to satisfy both the proximity of the scooter to the pony and the skateboard being to the left of the writing hobbyist.

Let's correct our understanding with a step-by-step logical approach:

- The person who drives the skateboard is to the left of the person whose hobby is writing (clue 2).
- This means the writing hobbyist cannot be on the far left.
- Given that, the skateboard must be associated with either video-games or writing. However, since it's to the left of the writing hobbyist, and considering the other clues, we'll have to fit the pieces together carefully.

Re-evaluating clue 1 and knowing the scooter is associated with drama:

If the person driving the scooter (drama) is next to the pony owner, but without specifying which side directly in our current analysis, let's assign pets based on clue 1's requirement for proximity:

Considering all clues again with a focus on creating a coherent table:

|               |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Video-games| Writing |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Drama   |
| Pet           | Pony      | Goat    |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Scooter |

This setup seems to satisfy the clues:
- The skateboard is to the left of the writing hobbyist (clue 2).
- The scooter (drama) is next to the pony owner, satisfying clue 1 when considering the person with the scooter could be on either side but here fits with owning a goat and being next to the pony.
- Clue 3 is satisfied as the scooter driver watches drama movies.

However, upon closer inspection, there was an oversight in directly applying all clues without assuming additional information not provided. Let's correct this by ensuring each clue directly informs our placement without over-assuming:

Given the strict format and instructions for answering, let's finalize based on logical deductions made:

#############
|               |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | Video-games| Writing |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Drama   |
| Pet           | Pony      | Goat    |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Scooter |

This final arrangement is based on satisfying the given conditions with a logical approach, ensuring each clue's requirement is met within the constraints provided."
Lv3-4x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 1
The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. This means the roller and sailing cannot be in the same column (since they have to be next to each other), but we don't know which side yet.


## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2
The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is sailing. This links two categories directly, meaning whoever likes sailing also owns a cat.


## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3
The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender. This statement tells us the relative positions of two categories: the quad-bike must be to the left of the bartender.


Given these statements, let's try to fill in the table:


- From Statement 2, we know sailing and cat are linked.
- From Statement 3, quad-bike is to the left of the bartender.
- Since there are only two jobs (bartender and lawyer), if the quad-bike is on the left, it must be associated with either the lawyer or the bartender. Given it's to the left of the bartender, it likely belongs to the lawyer.


## Step 4: Filling in the Table Based on Deductions
Given that sailing is linked with cat (Statement 2) and considering Statement 1 (roller is next to sailing), we can start filling in possible combinations:


- If quad-bike is with the lawyer (as it's to the left of the bartender, placing the bartender in column 2), then:
- Column 1 could have lawyer/quad-bike.
- Since sailing must be with cat and near roller (but not necessarily in that order or directly next to each other without more context on their positioning relative to the transport), we need to figure out how they can fit.


## Step 5: Finalizing Positions
Given the constraints:
- Quad-bike is with lawyer (Column 1).
- Bartender must then be in Column 2.
- Sailing is linked with cat, and roller must be next to sailing.
- The only sport left for Column 1 (with quad-bike/lawyer) is swimming since sailing is taken by the cat owner.


The final positions considering all constraints could look like this:


|             |     1     |     2     |
| Job         | Lawyer   | Bartender |
| Pet         | Dog      | Cat       |
| Sport       | Swimming | Sailing   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike| Roller    |


This setup respects all given conditions:
- The roller is next to the person who likes sailing.
- The cat's owner likes sailing.
- The quad-bike is to the left of the bartender.


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |     1     |     2     |
| Job         | Lawyer   | Bartender |
| Pet         | Dog      | Cat       |
| Sport       | Swimming | Sailing   |
| Transport   | Quad-bike| Roller    |

Lv3-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


## Step 1: Apply the first clue
The owner of the rat is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. This means the rat cannot be with the person whose sport is golf, but we don't know which side yet.

## Step 2: Apply the second clue
The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. This gives us a clear order for at least two items: Scientific -> Golf.

## Step 3: Apply the third clue
The owner of the cat is on the right of the Nigerian. This tells us about the relative positions of the cat and the Nigerian but doesn't give us an exact position yet.

## Step 4: Consider the movie-genres
We know there are two genres: scientific and sports. From clue 2, we have Scientific -> Golf. Since golf is a sport, it's likely that the person who watches sports movies is associated with golf, given the context of the clues.

## Step 5: Combine information to fill in the table
Given that the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person whose sport is golf (clue 2), and considering the other clues:
- If the Nigerian is on the left, then the cat must be on the right (clue 3). This means the rat must be on the left because it has to be next to the golfer (clue 1).
- The person watching scientific movies must be on the left of the golfer. So, if we assume the Nigerian watches scientific movies and is on the left, this fits with clue 2.

## Step 6: Fill in the table based on deductions
Let's fill in what we know:
- Left: Scientific (Nigerian), Right: Sports (Mexican) because the other genre must be sports if one is scientific.
- The cat is on the right of the Nigerian, which means it must be with the Mexican.
- Golf has to be on the right since scientific is on the left of golf. This implies that climbing must be on the left.
- Since the rat's owner must be next to the golfer and the cat is already determined to be on the right (with the Mexican), the rat must be with the Nigerian.

The final table based on these deductions would look like this:


#############
|               |     1      |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Sports  |
| Nationality   | Nigerian  | Mexican|
| Pet           | Rat       | Cat     |
| Sport         | Climbing  | Golf    |
#############


The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{array}{|l|l|l|}\hline\text{}&\text{1}&\text{2}\\\hline\text{Movie-Genre}&\text{Scientific}&\text{Sports}\\\hline\text{Nationality}&\text{Nigerian}&\text{Mexican}\\\hline\text{Pet}&\text{Rat}&\text{Cat}\\\hline\text{Sport}&\text{Climbing}&\text{Golf}\\\hline\end{array}}$"
Lv3-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose sport is basketball is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
2. The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
3. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of folk.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the turtle cannot be in column 2 if the person eating cauliflower is to their right, so the turtle's owner must be in column 1. 

Given this, from clue 3, the fan of folk must be in column 2 because the turtle's owner (in column 1) is on the left of the fan of folk.

Now, let's fill in what we know:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           | Folk        |
| Pet           | Turtle    |             |
| Sport         |           |             |

From clue 1, basketball must be next to the turtle. Since the turtle is in column 1, and considering all other positions, basketball can either be in column 1 or column 2. However, because cauliflower's eater is to the right of the turtle (clue 2), and if we consider that asparagus and cauliflower are the only foods, asparagus must then be with the turtle in column 1, making cauliflower go to column 2.

So, the updated table considering all clues:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   |           | Folk        |
| Pet           | Turtle    |             |
| Sport         |           |             |

Given that basketball is next to the turtle (clue 1), and since we've determined column 1's food and pet, basketball must be in column 1 for it to be ""next"" to the turtle. This leaves climbing for column 2.

The only music genre left is metal, which goes into column 1 because folk is already assigned to column 2.

Lastly, with the pets, since the turtle is in column 1, and considering clue 2 (cauliflower's eater is to the right of the turtle), the ferret must be in column 2 as it's the only pet left unassigned.

So, the final table looks like this:

#############
|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Cauliflower |
| Music-Genre   | Metal     | Folk        |
| Pet           | Turtle    | Ferret      |
| Sport         | Basketball| Climbing    |
