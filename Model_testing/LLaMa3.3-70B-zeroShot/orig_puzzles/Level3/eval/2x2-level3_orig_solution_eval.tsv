Lv3-2x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
2. The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea.

Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- If the person drinking tea is in position 1, then the person drinking juice must be in position 2 because they have to be next to each other.
- If the person drinking tea is in position 2, then the person drinking juice must be in position 1 for the same reason.

Now, considering the second statement:
- The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea. This means if the person drinking tea is in position 1, the person eating lemon cannot be next to them because there would be no one left to drink juice (as per the first condition). Therefore, the arrangement where tea is in position 1 and juice is in position 2 does not work with the given conditions.

Thus, we deduce:
- The person drinking tea must be in position 1, which means the person eating lemon cannot be directly next to them based on my initial analysis. However, considering the constraints again with a focus on the second condition (the person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea), this actually implies that if tea is in position 1, lemon must be in position 2. But since lemon's position is tied to food and not directly to beverage preferences except through their positioning, we need to correctly align beverages with foods based on given clues.

Let's correct the analysis:
- If tea is in position 1 (left), then according to clue 2, lemon must be in position 2 because it has to be on the right of tea. This means kiwi must be paired with tea since lemon is already determined to be in position 2.
- Therefore, we have tea with kiwi in position 1 and juice with lemon in position 2.

So, the solution table should look like this:

#############
|            |  1   |   2   |
| Beverage   | Tea  | Juice |
| Food       | Kiwi | Lemon |

Lv3-2x2-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:


From statement 2, we know that the person drinking water is on the far right. So, the table looks like this:

|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   |             | water |
| Sport      |             |       |

Now, let's consider statement 1: ""the person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person drinking water"". Since the person drinking water is on the far right, the person whose sport is surfing must be on the left.

So, the table now looks like this:

|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   |             | water |
| Sport      | surfing     |       |

The only sport left is golf, which must be on the right. But we already have water on the right, so golf must be paired with almond-milk on the left.

The final solution table is:


#############
|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | water |

Lv3-2x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two different movie genres: sports and western.
2. There are two different nationalities: French and Nigerian.
3. The French person is to the left of the person watching Western movies.

Given that there are only two columns (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- Since the French person must be to the left of the person watching Western movies, and considering the layout:
  - If the French person is in column 1, then the person watching Western movies must be in column 2 because there's no one to the left of column 1.
  - This means the French person cannot watch Western movies (because they are to the left of the Western movie watcher), so they must watch Sports.

Given this information, we can fill out the table as follows:

|               |   1    |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports | Western  |
| Nationality   | French | Nigerian |

This arrangement satisfies all conditions given:
- The French person is to the left of the person watching Western movies.
- There are two different movie genres and two different nationalities.

So, the final solution table is:


#############

Lv3-2x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two different favourite beverages: Fanta and Sprite.
2. There are two different types of food: Apricot and Tomato.
3. The person eating apricot is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.
4. The person drinking Fanta is on the far left or far right.

Given these conditions, let's try to fill in the table:

- From point 4, since the person drinking Fanta must be on the far left or far right, and considering we only have two positions (1 and 2), this means one of these positions must have Fanta.
- From point 3, if the person eating apricot is on the right of the person drinking Sprite, it implies that the person drinking Sprite cannot be on the far right because there would be no space to the right for the apricot eater. Therefore, Sprite must be on the left (position 1), and since apricot is to the right of Sprite, apricot must be in position 2.
- Given that apricot is in position 2 and Sprite is in position 1, the only beverage left for position 2 is Fanta, but according to point 4, Fanta should be on the far left or far right. However, since Sprite occupies the far left (position 1), Fanta must go to the far right, which is position 2. But we've established apricot is in position 2 based on the arrangement with Sprite. This indicates a misunderstanding in the initial placement based on the conditions.
- Correcting the approach: Since the person drinking Fanta can only be on the far left or far right and considering the constraint about Sprite and apricot, let's correctly place them according to the rules:
    - If Sprite is in position 1 (to satisfy the condition that apricot is to its right), then Fanta must be in position 2 because it has to be on the far right if not on the far left.
    - However, this doesn't align with our need to place apricot to the right of Sprite. So, let's correct the logic:
        - If Sprite is in position 1, and considering Fanta must be on one of the ends, then for apricot to be to the right of Sprite (as per point 3), apricot should indeed be in food position 2.
        - The beverage in position 2 then has to be Fanta because it's the only option left that fits all conditions given.

So, correcting my initial interpretation based on the clues provided:
- Position 1 (left) must have Sprite as its beverage to allow apricot to be to its right.
- The food for position 1, therefore, cannot be apricot but must be tomato since there are only two types of food and apricot is placed to the right of Sprite.
- Position 2 (right) has apricot as its food, fulfilling the condition that it's to the right of Sprite.
- Given Fanta must be on one of the ends and considering Sprite occupies position 1, Fanta must then be paired with apricot in position 2.

The final solution table should look like this:

#############
|            |   1    |    2    |
| Beverage   | Sprite | Fanta  |
| Food       | Tomato | Apricot|

Lv3-2x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The Australian is on the right of the fan of salsa.
2. The fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of ambient.

Given that we have two positions (1 and 2) and two music genres (ambient and salsa), and two nationalities (American and Australian), let's start by placing the fan of salsa, as this gives us the most direct clue involving both a music genre and a nationality.

- If the fan of salsa is in position 1, then according to statement 1, the Australian must be in position 2. This setup looks like:
  
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa    |            |
| Nationality   |          | Australian |

Given that the fan of salsa is now placed and we know the Australian's position, we need to determine the music genre for position 2 (which must be ambient since there are only two genres) and the nationality for position 1 (which must be American since there are only two nationalities). This results in:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa    | Ambient   |
| Nationality   | American | Australian |

This setup satisfies both conditions given: the Australian is to the right of the fan of salsa, and the fan of salsa is to the left of the fan of ambient.

Let's consider if placing the fan of salsa in position 2 could work:
  
- If the fan of salsa is in position 2, then according to statement 1, there would need to be an Australian in a position to the right of the salsa fan. However, since position 2 is the last column, this scenario cannot occur because there's no position to the right of it for the Australian.

Thus, the only viable arrangement based on the clues provided is with the fan of salsa in position 1 and the ambient fan (who must be American) in position 2, alongside the Australian.

The final solution table is:
#############
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Salsa    | Ambient   |

Lv3-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


1. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the Mexican.
2. The Mexican is on the right of the Malaysian.

From point 2, we know the order of nationalities must be: Malaysian, Mexican.


Given that there are two music genres (ambient and d&b) and two positions (1 and 2), and considering the rules:


- If the Malaysian is in position 1, the Mexican must be in position 2 to satisfy rule 2.
- Since the ambient fan must be on the left or right of the Mexican, and given the Mexican's fixed position at 2, the ambient fan cannot be to the right of the Mexican (as there are no more positions to the right). Therefore, the ambient fan must be in position 1.


Considering these points:


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  |  d&b    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian| Mexican |


This arrangement satisfies both conditions: the ambient fan is to the left of the Mexican, and the Mexican is to the right of the Malaysian.


The final solution table is:

Lv3-2x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze the first clue
The first clue states that ""the Thai is on the left or right of the Malaysian."" This means the two nationalities cannot be in the same column; they must be adjacent to each other horizontally. Since we have only two columns, this implies one nationality per column.


## Step 2: Apply the second clue
The second clue says ""the owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai."" This gives us more specific information about the arrangement. If the owner of the snake must be to the left of the Thai, and considering the first clue that the Thai and Malaysian are adjacent, it implies the snake's owner cannot be Thai because then there would be no one to the left of the Thai.


## Step 3: Determine the nationality of the snake's owner
Given the second clue and knowing we only have two nationalities (Malaysian and Thai), if the Thai is not the owner of the snake, then the Malaysian must be. Moreover, since the snake's owner is to the left of the Thai, this means the Malaysian (owner of the snake) must be in column 1.


## Step 4: Place the nationalities
Based on step 3, we place the Malaysian in column 1 and the Thai in column 2 because the Malaysian has to be to the left of the Thai according to clue 2.


## Step 5: Determine the pets for each nationality
We know from clue 2 that the owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai, which means the Malaysian owns the snake. Since there are only two pets (cat and snake), and the snake belongs to the Malaysian, the cat must belong to the Thai.


The final answer is: ########. 
|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Thai |
| Pet           |    Snake  | Cat  |

Lv3-2x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify hobbies and their positions
Given that the person whose hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing, we can start filling in the hobby row of our table as follows:

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Singing |
| Job     |             |         |

## Step 2: Determine job positions based on the second clue
The manager is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is woodworking. Since the woodworking hobbyist is already placed in column 1, the manager must be either in column 1 (which would mean they are also the woodworking hobbyist) or in column 2 (meaning they are next to the woodworking hobbyist). However, given that there's a direct relationship between the manager and the woodworking hobbyist but not necessarily a shared column for both jobs and hobbies of an individual as per the clue, we need to consider all possibilities.


## Step 3: Apply the second clue more precisely
Considering the second clue that ""the manager is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking,"" if we place the manager in column 1 (left), it directly conflicts with no rule since the manager can indeed have woodworking as a hobby. However, we need to consider all job-hobby combinations given the constraints.


## Step 4: Finalizing job positions
Given that there are only two jobs and two hobbies, and considering the placement of hobbies from step 1, let's finalize the jobs based on clue 2. If the manager is next to the woodworking hobbyist (who is in column 1), then the manager could either be in column 1 or column 2. But since we have established that the person with the hobby of woodworking is in column 1, and considering typical logic puzzle structures where each person has a unique job and hobby, we need to place the manager in relation to this setup.


## Step 5: Combine all information for final table
Considering all clues:
- The person who likes woodworking is on the left.
- The manager must be next to the woodworking hobbyist.

Given these constraints and that each individual has a unique job and hobby, we can deduce:

- If the manager were in column 2, it would not directly violate any rule since they are ""on the right"" of the woodworking hobbyist (in terms of job placement flexibility), but this scenario doesn't help us place the chef without conflicting information.
- Thus, placing the manager in column 1 (as the woodworking enthusiast) or ensuring they are next to the woodworking hobbyist in a way that respects all given conditions is key.

The final answer is: 
#############
|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Singing |
| Job     | Manager     | Chef    |

Lv3-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.

Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- From statement 2, since the person drinking coffee must be on either side of the person drinking iced-tea, and there are only two positions, it means that one position must have a person drinking coffee and the other iced-tea.
- Statement 1 tells us that avocado is to the right of iced-tea. This implies that if iced-tea is in position 1, then avocado must be in position 2 (since it has to be to the right). If iced-tea were in position 2, there would be no space for avocado to its right.

So, considering these points:

- If iced-tea is in position 1, then coffee must be in position 2 because coffee has to be on either side of iced-tea. According to statement 1, avocado must be to the right of iced-tea, so it goes with coffee.
- However, we need to consider that if iced-tea is in position 2, then coffee would have to be in position 1 (to satisfy being on either side of iced-tea), and papaya would be left for position 1 since avocado has to be to the right of iced-tea.

Given these conditions:

- If we place iced-tea in position 1, it contradicts our need to have avocado directly to its right because coffee needs to be on either side of iced-tea.
- Thus, iced-tea should be in position 2. This means coffee is in position 1 (as it has to be next to iced-tea), and since avocado must be to the right of iced-tea, but there's no space to its right, this initial deduction seems to have a flaw.

Re-evaluating:
- Coffee can be on either side of iced-tea.
- Avocado is to the right of iced-tea.

The correct setup considering all conditions must align with both rules. If coffee and iced-tea are in positions 1 and 2 respectively, then avocado can indeed be to the right of iced-tea (in position 2), but this means papaya must be paired with coffee in position 1, which fits because there's no restriction on what food item is with coffee.

So, a correct table considering the constraints could look like this:

#############
|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Coffee  | Iced-tea|
| Food       | Papaya  | Avocado |

- The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
- The person eating avocado is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea."	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'iced-tea'], 'food': ['papaya', 'avocado']}	True	2	False

## Step 1: Identify the movie genres and transport means
We have two movie genres: comedy and musical, and two means of transport: quad-bike and van.


## Step 2: Apply the first condition
The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the van and quad-bike cannot be in the same position (since there are only two positions), so they must occupy both positions but in a specific order that we will determine with the next conditions.


## Step 3: Apply the second condition
The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. This gives us the first clue about the arrangement. If the quad-bike is on the left, then comedy must be on the right because the quad-bike has to be to the left of the comedy watcher.


## Step 4: Determine the genres for each transport
Since the quad-bike is to the left of the comedy movies (from step 3), and knowing there are only two positions and thus the van must be associated with musical, we have:


- Quad-bike on the left associated with musical (because if it were associated with comedy, it would contradict our understanding from step 3 that the quad-bike is to the left of comedy).
- Van on the right associated with comedy.


## Step 5: Construct the final table
