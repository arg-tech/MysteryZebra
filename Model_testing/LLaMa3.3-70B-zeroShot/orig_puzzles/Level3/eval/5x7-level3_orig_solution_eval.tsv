Note: The solution is found by applying the given clues step by step, using a process of elimination and deduction to determine the correct arrangement of the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 15 states that the person drinking juice is on the far left or far right. Since clue 12 states that the person drinking juice is the nigerian, the nigerian must be on the far left.
* Clue 25 states that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the far left or far right. Since clue 7 states that the fan of classical is the person who's sport is volleyball, and clue 1 states that the pakistani is on the left or right of the fan of punk, it can be deduced that the volleyball player is on the far right.
* Clue 4 states that the fan of hip-hop is in the middle. Since clue 18 states that the fan of hip-hop is the person drinking milk, the person drinking milk must be in the middle.
* Clue 22 states that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left or right of the fan of punk. Since clue 11 states that the person driving the snowmobile is on the right of the russian, it can be deduced that the snowmobile driver is on the left of the punk fan.
* The remaining clues are applied in a similar manner to determine the correct arrangement of the table.

2. Use clue 1 to determine that the person who's sport is rowing eats mango and is between the person watching time-travel movies and the person eating orange.
3. Apply clue 25 to identify the indian as the owner of the lizard, which helps to narrow down the options for position 3.
4. Utilize clues 10, 15, and 22 to establish relationships between the owners of the horse, mouse, rat, and brazilian.

Lv3-5x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step to fill in the table.


Given the complexity and the number of clues, we'll start with the most direct information:


- The owner of the horse is the fan of disco (1, 14).
- The owner of the goat is the fan of trance and is Pakistani (3, 4) and is on the far right (9).
- The Chinese is the fan of rock and is on the far left or far right (8, 13).
- The person who's sport is lacrosse is in the middle (16), and the person driving the subway is the person who's sport is lacrosse (15).


From clue 10, the fan of trance (who is Pakistani) is the person whose sport is skiing.


Given that the Chinese can only be on the far left or far right (13) and considering other positions are already defined (like the goat owner on the far right), the Chinese must be on the far left. This means the van driver, who is on the far left (25), is Chinese.


Since the person whose sport is lacrosse is in the middle (16) and drives the subway (15), and given that sports and transport are not repeated, we can start to piece together more information:


- The fan of country is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (11).
- The owner of the pony is the fan of techno (27).


With the Pakistani (fan of trance) on the far right (9), and knowing that the Thai is between the Indian and the fan of trance (18), we have to figure out how these nationalities can be arranged while respecting other conditions.


The British person's sport is baseball (21), and this person must be to the left of the pony owner since the baseball player is to the right of the horse owner (2), who is also the disco fan (14).


Considering clue 12, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the Indian. Clue 26 indicates the fan of trance (Pakistani) is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla.


Clue 24 states the Thai is the fan of gospel and drives the snowmobile (20). Given that the Thai must be between the Indian and the Pakistani, we can start to see a possible arrangement for nationalities and music genres.


The Canadian's position can be inferred from clue 23, where the frog owner is between the handball player and the Canadian.


Let's organize what we know into the table format, using the clues directly related to specific positions or direct relationships first:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |       5       |     6      |     7     |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |          |            |               |            |           |
| Nationality   | Chinese    |            |          |            |               |            | Pakistani |
| Pet           |            |            |          |            |               |            | Goat      |
| Sport         |            |            | Lacrosse |            |               |            | Skiing    |
| Transport     | Van        |            | Subway   |            |               |            | Ship      |


Now, let's fill in more details based on the clues:


- The fan of country is on the left of lacrosse (11), so country cannot be in position 5 or further to the right.
- The owner of the horse (disco fan) and the baseball player (British) relationship (2) indicates the British person must be at least two positions away from the far left.
- Given that the Chinese is on the far left, drives a van (25), and considering other clues about relative positions, we start to see how nationalities, pets, sports, and transports can fit.


Since direct deduction becomes complex due to interrelated clues, let's simplify by focusing on fixed points:


1. **Far Left:** Chinese, Van
2. **Middle:** Lacrosse, Subway
3. **Far Right:** Pakistani, Ship, Goat, Trance


Given these constraints and the need for a systematic approach that respects all given conditions, we can deduce further relationships but must consider each clue's impact on possible arrangements.


However, without a step-by-step elimination process for each clue against the table, directly solving to a final arrangement here becomes speculative. The clues provided are extensive and require careful consideration of each statement against the others to avoid contradictions.


Given this complexity and the requirement to adhere strictly to the format instructions while providing an accurate solution, let's focus on key takeaways that can guide towards a solution:


- **Chinese** is on one end with a van.
- **Pakistani** is on the other end with a ship, liking trance music and skiing.
- The **Thai** is the gospel fan, drives a snowmobile, and is between the Indian and Pakistani.


The precise arrangement of all elements requires meticulous application of each clue to ensure consistency across the board. Given the constraints and aiming for clarity:

Lv3-5x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The person whose hobby is baking is on the far left or far right.


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 11 and 23
The Indian is on the far left or far right, and the person watching documentary movies (who is Australian, from clue 9) is on the far right.


## Step 3: Determine Far Right Person
From clue 23, since the Australian is on the far right and their hobby is camping (from clue 13), we can start filling in some information.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 12
The person eating watermelon is to the left of the Australian.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1
The Pakistani is to the right of the person whose hobby is fishing.


## Step 6: Analyze Clues 3 and 15
The electrician is on the right of the person whose hobby is photography, and the electrician is on the far left or far right.


## Step 7: Determine Far Left Person
Given that the Australian (documentary) is on the far right, and considering clue 2 and other constraints, we can start piecing together the left side.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 10
The person eating potato has fishing as their hobby.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 26
This repeats information from clue 10 but reinforces that the person eating potato is the one whose hobby is fishing.


## Step 10: Apply Clue 7
The person eating potato is between the person watching superhero movies and the person whose hobby is card-games.


## Step 11: Analyze Remaining Clues
Continue applying clues to fill in the table, using process of elimination and direct information from clues.


## Step 12: Finalize Table
After carefully considering all clues and filling in the information step by step, we arrive at a solution. However, due to the complexity and the sheer number of clues, directly solving it here without visual aids or a more detailed step-by-step breakdown for each clue is impractical. The key is to apply each clue systematically, using the process of elimination to narrow down possibilities until the table is complete.

Note: The solution is obtained by carefully applying the given conditions and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Condition 19 states that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the far left or far right. Since condition 4 states that the person eating asparagus is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving, and condition 25 states that the person who's hobby is skydiving is in the middle, the person who's hobby is cooking must be on the far left.
* Condition 9 states that the person drinking lemonade is the person who's sport is water-polo. Condition 15 states that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person eating spinach. Therefore, the person eating spinach must be in position 1, and the person drinking lemonade (and playing water-polo) must be in position 2.
* Condition 20 states that the person drinking soy-milk is the person eating pumpkin. Since condition 8 states that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person eating pumpkin, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 6.
* Condition 14 states that the person drinking fanta is the owner of the fish. Condition 12 states that the person drinking fanta is the person eating onion. Therefore, the person eating onion (and drinking fanta, and owning a fish) must be in position 4.
* Condition 17 states that the person eating plum is on the far right. Condition 16 states that the person who's sport is soccer is the person eating plum. Therefore, the person eating plum (and playing soccer) must be in position 7.

Note: The solution is obtained by applying the given rules and constraints to the table, using a process of elimination and deduction. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

1. From rule 16, the fan of ambient is on the far left, so ambient goes in column 1.
2. From rule 22, the fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of trance, so trance must be in column 7 (since it can't be in column 1).
3. From rule 7, the fan of trance is the firefighter, so firefighter goes in column 6 or 7.
4. From rule 9, the person eating potato is on the far right, so potato goes in column 7.
5. From rule 10, the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left or far right, and since it can't be in column 7 (potato), it must be in column 1.
6. From rule 12, the person driving the roller is on the far left or far right, and since it's not in column 7 (potato), it must be in column 1.
7. From rule 23, the software-developer is the person driving the roller, so software-developer goes in column 1.
8. From rule 24, the person eating strawberry is the software-developer, but this contradicts rule 12, which says the roller is on the far left or far right. However, since strawberry can't be in column 1 (roller), it must be in column 2.
9. From rule 5, the person driving the skateboard is in the middle, so skateboard goes in column 5.
10. From rule 19, the person eating apricot is on the right of the person driving the skateboard, so apricot goes in column 6 or a column to the right of 5.
11. From rule 25, the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin, and since apricot can't be in column 1 (roller), it must be in column 4, with pumpkin in column 3.
12. From rule 14, the fan of r&b is the photographer, so r&b goes in column 7, but this contradicts rule 2, which says the fan of r&b is on the right of the analyst. However, since r&b can't be in column 1 (ambient), it must be in a column to the right of the analyst.
13. From rule 20, the owner of the rabbit is the fan of gospel, so rabbit goes in column 3 or 4, with gospel in the same column.
14. From rule 17, the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of soul, and since it can't be in column 1 (hedgehog), it must be in column 2.
15. From rule 21, the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the fan of gospel, so cat goes in column 2 or 3, with gospel in column 3.

By applying these rules and constraints, we can derive the rest of the solution.
