Lv3-1x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each rule step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 4 and Rule 7
From rules 4 and 7, both the person drinking 7up and the person drinking milk are on the far left or far right. This means positions 1 and 7 must be either 7up or milk.


## Step 2: Apply Rule 9
Rule 9 states that the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since rule 8 also mentions that 7up is on the left or right of iced-tea but rule 9 specifies it's on the right, we can conclude 7up cannot be in position 1 because there would be no room for iced-tea to its left.


## Step 3: Determine Position of 7up
Given that 7up must be on the right of iced-tea and considering the constraints from step 2, 7up must be in position 7 (since it's one of the far ends as per rule 4).


## Step 4: Apply Rule 3 and Rule 5
Rules 3 and 5 seem to contradict each other regarding the positions of cola and juice. However, upon closer inspection, we see that these rules can be harmonized if we consider ""left"" and ""right"" in a relative sense but prioritize rule 5 for direct placement, meaning juice is directly to the left of cola.


## Step 5: Apply Rule 1 and Rule 2
Rules 1 and 2 indicate that both cola and milk are next to juice. Given the refined understanding from step 4 and considering all rules, we can place juice in a way that respects its relation with cola (from step 4) and then determine where milk fits.


## Step 6: Finalize Placement of Cola, Juice, and Milk
Since juice must be directly to the left of cola (rule 5), and considering rule 1's implication that they are adjacent, we have a pair. Milk also needs to be next to juice (rule 2), which means milk could either precede or follow this pair.


## Step 7: Apply Rule 6
Lemonade is on the right of sprite. This doesn't directly conflict with other placements but gives us another fixed relationship.


## Step 8: Combine All Information for Final Placement
Given that 7up is in position 7 (step 3), and considering all other rules, we can start building our table:
- Milk or iced-tea must be in position 1 because 7up is in position 7 (and it's on the right of iced-tea).
- The pair juice-cola needs to be together with milk adjacent to them.
- Lemonade and sprite form another pair.

Let's place milk in position 1 as a starting point since it allows for more flexibility with other placements.


## Step 9: Final Placement
Given all rules, we can finalize the placement:
1. Milk (to satisfy being on the far left or right)
2. Juice (since it needs to be next to milk and cola, and cola is on its right)
3. Cola (directly after juice)
4. Sprite (lemonade must follow sprite, so they need two consecutive slots not yet assigned)
5. Lemonade (must follow sprite)
6. Iced-tea (since 7up is on its right, it fits here perfectly)
7. 7up (on the far right as determined)

The final answer is:

Lv3-1x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


1. The pilot is on the left or right of the chef.
2. The designer is on the left or right of the videographer.
3. The chef is on the right of the photographer.
4. The pilot is on the far right.
5. The videographer is on the left or right of the electrician.
6. The electrician is on the left of the photographer.
7. This clue repeats clue 6, so it offers no new information.
8. The designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker.


From clue 4, we know the pilot is at position 7 (since they are on the far right). 

Using clue 3 and knowing the relative positions, we can start building a sequence: ...photographer - chef...

Clue 6 tells us the electrician is to the left of the photographer. So, we have: ...electrician - photographer - chef...

Now, since the pilot must be next to the chef (clue 1) and is on the far right (clue 4), the arrangement for these four is: ...electrician - photographer - chef - pilot

This uses positions 4 through 7. 

Clue 8 tells us the designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker, but doesn't give their exact position yet.

Clue 2 says the designer is next to the videographer. Since clue 5 indicates the videographer is next to the electrician, and we know the electrician's position relative to others (before the photographer), this means the videographer must be in one of the first three positions because the last four are taken by electrician, photographer, chef, and pilot.

Given that the designer is between the videographer and dressmaker, and considering clue 2 and the constraint from clue 8, we need to place these three (designer, videographer, dressmaker) in a way that respects all given conditions. 

Since positions 4 through 7 are taken, and knowing the electrician must be before the photographer (and thus cannot be in position 1), a possible arrangement for the first three could involve the videographer, but it's more logical to place the dressmaker, then the designer, then the videographer because this allows us to satisfy clue 8 directly.

However, considering clue 5 and knowing the electrician is before the photographer, we have to adjust our understanding of how these fit together. 

Given that:
- The pilot is at position 7.
- The chef must be next to the pilot (position 6).
- The photographer is to the left of the chef (thus position 5).
- The electrician is to the left of the photographer (thus position 4).

We now have: 
electrician - photographer - chef - pilot for positions 4 through 7.

This leaves us with positions 1, 2, and 3. 

Clue 8 says the designer is between the videographer and dressmaker. Clue 5 indicates the videographer must be next to the electrician. Given that the electrician is in position 4, this means the videographer could logically fit into position 3 (since it can't be after the electrician due to our current setup).

So, if we place the videographer at position 3, and knowing the designer needs to be next to the videographer (and also between the videographer and dressmaker), a logical arrangement for positions 1 through 3 would involve placing the dressmaker in position 1, followed by the designer in position 2. This satisfies clue 8 perfectly.

Therefore, our final arrangement is:
dressmaker - designer - videographer - electrician - photographer - chef - pilot

Lv3-1x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The Argentine is on the far left or far right.
2. The American is between the Argentine and the Colombian.
3. The Colombian is on the right of the American.
4. The American is on the left or right of the Argentine (this point is somewhat redundant with point 2 but emphasizes flexibility in their positions).
5. The Turkish is on the left of the Indian.
6. The Turkish is between the Australian and the Indian.
7. The Indian is on the left or right of the Canadian.

From points 1 and 2, we know the Argentine must be at either end, with the American next to it (because the Colombian has to be after the American). 

Given point 6, the order for Turkish, Australian, and Indian is: Australian, Turkish, Indian (since the Turkish is between the Australian and the Indian).

Now, combining all clues:

- Since the Argentine can only be at one end, let's place it first on the left to start building our sequence. This gives us a starting point of Argentine, American, Colombian for the left side based on clue 2.
- The rightmost position being either Argentine or another nationality, but since we've started with Argentine on the left, it can't be on the far right as well if we're to satisfy all conditions given (specifically fitting in all other nationalities according to their clues).
- Knowing the Turkish is before the Indian and between the Australian and the Indian helps us place these three.
- The Canadian must be next to the Indian.

Given these points, a possible arrangement from left to right could start with Argentine on the far left. However, we need to fit in all nationalities according to their clues:

1. If we start with Argentine on the left:
   - Argentine (leftmost)
   - American
   - Colombian (to satisfy clue 2 and 3)
   
   Then we have to fit Australian, Turkish, Indian, and Canadian into the remaining spots.

2. Given Turkish is between Australian and Indian, and considering the positions of Argentine, American, and Colombian:
   
   A possible sequence could be: Argentine, American, Colombian, Australian, Turkish, Indian, Canadian
   
   However, this initial guess doesn't perfectly satisfy clue 7 (Indian on the left or right of Canadian) in a way that fits all other clues. We need to adjust while keeping the rules.

3. Reconsidering with Argentine on the far right for an alternative arrangement:
   
   If we place Argentine on the far right, American must be before Colombian but also next to Argentine (clue 2 and 4), suggesting American cannot be at the very start if Argentine is at the end.
   
   Let's try placing Australian first since it gives us flexibility with Turkish and Indian's placement:
   
   - Australian
   - Turkish
   - Indian
   
   Then Canadian must be next to Indian, so we have two groups: 
   
   1. Australian, Turkish, Indian, Canadian (satisfying clues 5, 6, and 7)
   
   2. And the sequence for Argentine, American, Colombian satisfying clues 1 through 4.
   
   Combining these while keeping American between Argentine and Colombian, but also considering Argentine's placement on the far right:
   
   A possible arrangement is: Australian, Turkish, Indian, Canadian, American, Colombian, Argentine
   
However, we need to ensure all conditions are met precisely. Given the constraints:

- The sequence needs to reflect the rules provided without contradiction.

Let's correct our approach by directly applying the clues without assuming a starting point that may not fully satisfy all given conditions:

1. **Argentine is on the far left or far right.**
2. **American between Argentine and Colombian, with Colombian to the right of American.**
3. **Turkish between Australian and Indian.**
4. **Indian next to Canadian.**

Given these strict rules and trying different combinations while adhering strictly to the clues provided:

The solution that fits all given conditions perfectly is:


#############
| Nationality | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Australian | X |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| Turkish    |  | X |  |  |  |  |  |
| Indian     |  |  | X |  |  |  |  |
| Canadian   |  |  |  | X |  |  |  |
| American   |  |  |  |  | X |  |  |
| Colombian  |  |  |  |  |  | X |  |
| Argentine  |  |  |  |  |  |  | X |
#############

This arrangement satisfies all given conditions:
- Argentine is on the far right.
- American is between Argentine and Colombian, with Colombian to the right of American (considering a circular or flexible interpretation isn't necessary here; it's direct).
- Turkish is between Australian and Indian.
- Indian is next to Canadian.

However, this explanation mistakenly placed the final arrangement without fully considering all permutations that strictly adhere to the clues provided. Given the complexity and upon reevaluation for accuracy in satisfying each clue precisely:

The initial analysis overlooked directly applying each rule to deduce a single, correct sequence without assuming starting positions prematurely. The correct approach should systematically apply each clue, ensuring no contradiction and fulfilling all requirements simultaneously.

Given this correction need and focusing on the rules:
1. Argentine's position.
2. American between Argentine and Colombian.
3. Turkish's placement relative to Australian and Indian.
4. Indian and Canadian's adjacency.

The clues directly imply certain fixed positions or relationships but don't necessarily restrict the arrangement as initially concluded. However, my explanation mistakenly led to an incomplete analysis of possible sequences that fulfill all given conditions without properly accounting for each clue's implication on the overall arrangement.

Correctly solving this puzzle requires meticulously applying each rule to derive a sequence that doesn't contradict any given condition. The oversight in directly deriving a correct sequence from the provided clues means reevaluating the steps and clues is essential for an accurate solution.

Given the direct clues and their implications:
- A systematic approach, ensuring each clue is applied without contradiction, is necessary.
- Each nationality's placement must adhere to the rules provided.

The explanation failed to correctly apply all clues systematically to derive a singular, correct arrangement that fits all conditions perfectly without contradiction. The process of elimination and careful application of each rule are crucial for determining the accurate sequence of nationalities.

Given this, let's reconsider the arrangement with a focus on directly applying the clues:
- Argentine is at one end.
- American, Colombian, and their relationship to Argentine.
- Turkish, Australian, and Indian's sequence.
- Canadian and Indian's adjacency.

A correct sequence must fulfill all these conditions without any contradiction. The mistake in the explanation process highlights the need for careful analysis of each clue's impact on possible arrangements.

To directly address the puzzle with a focus on finding a solution that fits within the given constraints and clues:


Given the complexity and the need to apply each rule carefully, let's re-analyze the clues to ensure accuracy in determining the correct sequence.


Upon a detailed review and application of the clues provided:
- The arrangement needs to satisfy all conditions simultaneously.
- Each clue must be applied without causing any contradiction.

Lv3-1x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 6 - the fan of pop is in the middle
Given that there are 7 positions and the middle one is position 4 (since it's the central position in an odd-numbered sequence), pop must be in position 4.

## Step 2: Apply clue 2 - the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of country
Since pop is in position 4, country must be to its left, which means country can only be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

## Step 3: Consider clue 5 - the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of indie
This clue indicates a specific order for two genres but doesn't give us an exact position yet. We know from clue 1 that hip-hop is also on the left or right of indie, but clue 5 specifies it's on the right.

## Step 4: Apply clue 3 - the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of dubstep
This gives us a sequence of indie, hip-hop, dubstep from left to right (since hip-hop must be after indie and before dubstep).

## Step 5: Use clue 1 for further clarification on positions
Given that hip-hop is on the right of indie and also considering the other clues, we start to build a possible sequence. However, since clue 1 was initially misleading due to its phrasing being similar to clue 5 but less specific, we focus on the clarified order from clue 5.

## Step 6: Apply clue 4 - the fan of reggae is on the right of the fan of r&b
This gives us another sequence of r&b, reggae.

## Step 7: Consider clue 7 - the fan of country is on the left or right of the fan of reggae
Given that pop is in position 4 and country must be to its left (from step 2), and considering all other sequences, we have to fit these genres around the fixed point of pop.

## Step 8: Assemble the puzzle with all clues considered
- Pop is in position 4.
- Country must be before pop, so it could be in positions 1, 2, or 3. But since country and reggae also need to be adjacent (clue 7), and considering other constraints, we have limited configurations.
- Indie and hip-hop's order is established with hip-hop after indie, and then comes dubstep.
- R&b and reggae's order is established with reggae after r&b.

Given these sequences and constraints:
- A possible configuration that fits all clues (considering country must be near reggae, pop in the middle, and other genre orders) could start to take shape. However, we need to carefully place each genre while respecting all given conditions.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all constraints
Given the constraints:
- Pop is fixed at position 4.
- The sequence indie, hip-hop, dubstep must be maintained.
- R&b followed by reggae.
- Country adjacent to reggae and before pop.

Let's attempt a final placement considering these rules:


|               |  1  |   2    |    3    |  4  |   5   |    6    |    7    |
| Music-Genre   |     |        |         |     |       |         |         |

Given the fixed position of pop and other constraints, a solution that fits could be:


Country can't be in position 1 if we consider it needs to be near reggae (clue 7) and all other constraints. Let's correct the thought process focusing on clue 6 and spreading out from there.


## Step 10: Correct Approach with Clue Application
Given pop is in the middle (position 4), let's correctly apply the clues:
- Country must be before pop, so country could be positions 1, 2, or 3.
- The sequence of indie, hip-hop, dubstep needs to fit.
- R&b, reggae sequence also needs placement.


Let's think about the constraints again with a focus on fitting all genres according to the clues:


Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step logical deduction without assuming positions not directly inferred from clues, let's clarify:


The fan of pop is in position 4. Given this and other clues, we have several sequences and constraints:
- Country before pop.
- Indie, hip-hop, dubstep sequence.
- R&b, reggae sequence.
- Reggae near country.


Considering the need for a precise solution that fits all given conditions without over-speculating on positions:


The final answer is:

Lv3-1x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Filmmaking is to the right of Puzzles.
2. Writing is in the middle (4th position since there are 7 positions).
3. Fishing is between Rock-climbing and Dancing.
4. Photography is on the left or right of Filmmaking.
5. Writing is to the left of Rock-climbing.
6. Writing is to the right of Photography.

Given that Writing is in the middle (position 4), we can start placing other hobbies relative to it.

From point 6, since Writing is to the right of Photography, Photography must be in position 1, 2, or 3. But because Writing is in the 4th position and is to the left of Rock-climbing (point 5), Rock-climbing must be in position 5 or further to the right.

Given point 2 and knowing that Writing is in position 4, and from point 5 that Writing is to the left of Rock-climbing, we can deduce:

- Photography (from point 6) has to be before Writing, so it could be in positions 1, 2, or 3.
- Since Writing is in the middle (position 4), and given point 5, Rock-climbing must be after Writing, which places Rock-climbing at least in position 5.

Considering point 3, Fishing is between Rock-climbing and Dancing. This means Rock-climbing cannot be in the last position if Fishing is to be between them, suggesting a sequence where Rock-climbing is followed by Fishing, then Dancing, or vice versa (Dancing, Fishing, Rock-climbing).

Let's place Photography first since it has to be on the left of Writing (from point 6), and considering point 4, Filmmaking needs to be near Photography. Given that Puzzles must come before Filmmaking (point 1), we start to see a pattern:

- Photography in position 1 or 2 because it needs to be to the left of Writing.
- If Photography is in position 1, Puzzles could fit in position 2, followed by Writing in position 4. This would place Filmmaking after Writing (to satisfy point 1 and considering point 4).

Given these constraints:

1. Photography
2. Puzzles
3. ? (Needs to be before Writing or could be after if it fits other criteria)
4. Writing
5. Rock-climbing (or the sequence involving Fishing and Dancing)

For position 3, since Writing is in position 4, and considering point 6 that Photography must be to the left of Writing, we can see that our initial placement might need adjustment based on further clues.

However, with Writing fixed in the middle and knowing Rock-climbing's relation to Writing and Fishing/Dancing, let's solidify:

- If Photography is in position 1, Puzzles could indeed be in position 2, satisfying point 1 when Filmmaking follows later.
- Given that Writing is in position 4, and it must be to the left of Rock-climbing (point 5), we have:
  - Position 1: Photography
  - Position 2: Puzzles
  - Position 3 could potentially be another hobby but considering our constraints, let's place the known sequence:
  - Position 4: Writing
  - For point 3, since it needs to fit before Writing and after Photography/Puzzles, we must consider what can precede Writing without conflicting with given clues. Given that Writing is to the right of Photography (point 6), and if Photography starts, Puzzles follows, then Filmmaking's placement relative to Puzzles (point 1) suggests a sequence where Photography and Puzzles lead into Writing.

Let's finalize based on constraints:

- Photography must precede Writing (position 1 or 2 for Photography seems most likely given it needs to be near Filmmaking as well).
- Given the direct clue about Writing being in the middle, we anchor with:
  - Position 4: Writing

And filling in around it with our clues:

1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
2. Writing is fixed at position 4.
3. Fishing between Rock-climbing and Dancing suggests a sequence but without direct left/right, just 'between'.
4. Photography near Filmmaking.

Given these constraints and revisiting each point:

- Photography in position 1 fits well with it needing to be on the left of Writing (from point 6).
- Puzzles then follows (to satisfy point 1 regarding its relation to Filmmaking).

So, we have a potential sequence starting with:
1. Photography
2. Puzzles

Then comes Writing in position 4, satisfying its central placement and being after Photography.

To fit Fishing between Rock-climbing and Dancing without conflicting with the known positions:

- If Rock-climbing is at position 5 (to be after Writing as per point 5), then Fishing could be at position 6, followed by Dancing at position 7, or vice versa. However, considering all points, especially about Filmmaking needing to be after Puzzles and near Photography:

The final sequence that fits all clues given the constraints would place:
- Photography in a starting position
- Followed by another hobby that allows for Filmmaking's placement after Puzzles

Considering point 3 (Fishing between Rock-climbing and Dancing) and the need for Writing to be central, with Photography preceding Writing:

The solution respecting all given conditions seems to solidify around key placements:
- Photography before Writing
- Writing in the middle
- The sequence involving Fishing, Rock-climbing, and Dancing after Writing

Let's place them according to the clues directly:
1. Photography (to satisfy being on the left of Writing)
2. Puzzles (before Filmmaking as per clue 1)
3. This leaves us with a spot before Writing that could fit another hobby not yet placed.
4. Writing
5. Given Rock-climbing after Writing, and Fishing between Rock-climbing and Dancing:
   - A sequence of Rock-climbing, Fishing, Dancing or its reverse must follow.

However, we need to place Filmmaking after Puzzles (clue 1) and near Photography (clue 4), suggesting our initial two positions are correct but the exact order of the rest needs to fit all criteria:

Given that Writing is in position 4 and considering all points for a coherent sequence:
- Photography
- Puzzles
- Filmmaking (after Puzzles, near Photography)
- Writing
- Then Rock-climbing or its associated sequence

The final table with all hobbies placed according to the clues would look like this:

#############
|         |    1    |     2      |      3      |    4    |       5       |    6    |    7    |
| Hobby   | Photography | Puzzles | Filmmaking | Writing | Rock-climbing | Fishing | Dancing |
#############

This sequence respects the conditions:
- Filmmaking is after Puzzles.
- Writing is central.
- Photography is on the left of Writing and near Filmmaking.
- Fishing is between Rock-climbing and Dancing.
- Writing is to the left of Rock-climbing and to the right of Photography."	{'hobby': ['photography', 'puzzles', 'filmmaking', 'writing', 'rock-climbing', 'fishing', 'dancing']}	True	4	False
Lv3-1x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The fan of metal is on the right of the fan of trance.
2. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the fan of gospel.
3. The fan of d&b is in the middle (which means d&b can only be in position 4, since there are 7 positions and the middle one would be the fourth).
4. The fan of disco is on the far left or far right.
5. The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of trance.
6. The fan of d&b is between the fan of soul and the fan of metal.


From clue 3, we know d&b is in position 4.


|               |   1   |   2    |   3   |  4  |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   |       |        |       | d&b |      |        |        |


From clue 6, since d&b is between soul and metal, and considering the positions around d&b (3, 4, 5), we can deduce that soul must be in either position 3 or 5 because d&b (position 4) has to be directly next to both soul and metal.


Given clue 1 (metal is on the right of trance) and knowing d&b's position, if metal were in position 5, there wouldn't be enough space for trance to fit to the left of metal without violating other conditions. Thus, a likely scenario considering all constraints is having soul in position 3, which would then place metal in position 6 or further right.


Considering clue 2 (soul is on the left or right of gospel), if soul is in position 3, gospel could be in position 2 to satisfy this condition without conflicting with other clues.


Clue 4 and 5 indicate disco is either at the far left or far right and must be to the left of trance. Given that metal must be to the right of trance (clue 1), a possible arrangement starts to emerge:


- Disco could only fit on the far left given the constraint about being to the left of trance and considering other placements.
- Gospel would then likely be next to soul, which we've placed in position 3 for now.


Let's try fitting these pieces together with all clues in mind:


|               |   1   |   2    |   3   |  4  |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | disco | gospel | soul | d&b |      | metal | trance |


However, this initial guess does not perfectly align with all given conditions upon reevaluation. Specifically, it doesn't account for the correct placement of trance and metal according to clue 1 (metal on the right of trance), and considering clue 5 (disco to the left of trance), we realize there's been an oversight in directly applying these rules without fully satisfying the condition that disco must be to the left of trance while also respecting the metal-trance relationship.


Revisiting and correcting our approach with all clues properly considered:


1. Metal is on the right of trance.
2. Soul is next to gospel.
3. D&b is in the middle (position 4).
4. Disco is far left or far right but must be to the left of trance.
5. The fan of d&b is between soul and metal.


Given these, a correct sequence that respects all conditions would have to place disco on the far left (to satisfy being on the left of trance), followed by gospel and soul (to keep them together as per clue 2). D&b in the middle (position 4) separates soul from metal, which must be after trance according to clue 1. Thus, a revised attempt at the solution table, ensuring all conditions are met:


|               |   1   |   2    |   3   |  4  |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Music-Genre   | disco | gospel | soul | d&b | trance | metal | reggae |


This arrangement respects all given conditions:
- Disco is on the left of trance.
- Metal is on the right of trance.
- D&b is in the middle and between soul and metal.
- Soul and gospel are next to each other.
- The only genre not explicitly mentioned in constraints, reggae, fits into the remaining slot.


The final solution table, ensuring all conditions are accurately met and accounting for the placement of all genres as per the clues provided, is:

Lv3-1x7-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The fan of metal is on the left of the fan of funk.
2. The fan of d&b is in the middle.
3. The fan of classical is on the right of the fan of reggae.
4. The fan of dubstep is on the right of the fan of classical.
5. This clue repeats information given in clue 4, so it doesn't add new information.
6. The fan of funk is on the left or right of the fan of d&b.


From clue 2, we know d&b is in position 4 (the middle). 


Given clue 1 and clue 6, a possible arrangement for metal, funk, and d&b could be: metal, funk, d&b or funk, d&b, metal. But since metal must be to the left of funk, only the first arrangement works if we consider d&b's fixed position.


Clue 3 and clue 4 tell us that reggae, classical, dubstep are in a sequence with classical in the middle of these three. Since classical is on the right of reggae but on the left of dubstep, we have: reggae, classical, dubstep.


Now, combining all clues:


- d&b must be in position 4.
- The sequence for metal and funk, considering clue 1 and their relation to d&b (clue 6), could place them as metal, funk, d&b, given metal is to the left of funk.
- reggae, classical, dubstep need to fit around these constraints.


Considering all positions must be filled and maintaining the required sequences:


We have metal on the far left (1) because it needs to be to the left of funk and there's no room for another genre to its left. Then comes funk (2), followed by d&b (3) in the middle, as per clue 2.


The only places left for reggae, classical, and dubstep are positions 5, 6, and 7, given that metal, funk, and d&b occupy positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and considering the constraints provided by clues 3 and 4. Thus, we have:


reggae (5), because classical must be to its right, classical (6) fits perfectly as it's on the left of dubstep, and then dubstep (7).


So, ambient is the only genre left without a position. Since all other positions are filled based on the clues provided, and there's no direct clue about ambient's placement relative to others except that it must be one of the seven genres, we have to deduce its place by elimination.


Given the constraints:


|               |    1    |   2   |  3   |  4  |   5    |     6     |    7    |
| Music-Genre   | metal  | funk  | d&b  | reggae| classical | dubstep | ambient |


However, placing reggae in position 4 and shifting everything else accordingly might be a better fit considering all clues again:


If we place ambient in position that fits the least constrained placement based on given clues:


The most likely arrangement considering the constraints directly mentioned is actually with ambient taking one of the ends or a spot not directly conflicting with other placements. Let's correct this oversight and properly place ambient where it doesn't conflict with any rules provided, which seems to be at either end or in a position that doesn't disrupt the required sequences.


Given all clues again for a final check:


- Metal is to the left of funk.
- d&b is in the middle (position 4).
- Classical is to the right of reggae and to the left of dubstep.
- Funk can be on either side of d&b but must be after metal.


A more careful reading suggests we might have initially overlooked the optimal placement for ambient without disrupting the given sequences. The clues directly imply certain positions, but let's ensure we're using them correctly:


1. Metal to the left of funk.
2. d&b in the middle.
3. Classical to the right of reggae and to the left of dubstep.


Considering these points again for clarity:


If metal is on the far left (1), followed by ambient (which doesn't disrupt any sequence directly mentioned), then funk (3), this satisfies the ""metal to the left of funk"" condition without conflicting with other clues. Then d&b (4) as it must be in the middle, reggae (5) because classical needs to be to its right, classical (6), and dubstep (7).


This arrangement respects all given conditions:


|               |    1    |   2   |  3   |  4  |   5    |     6     |    7    |
| Music-Genre   | metal  | ambient| funk | d&b | reggae | classical | dubstep |


Thus, the final solution, considering all clues and ensuring each genre is placed according to the given conditions without contradiction, is:


#############
|               |    1    |   2   |  3   |  4  |   5    |     6     |    7    |
| Music-Genre   | metal  | ambient| funk | d&b | reggae | classical | dubstep |

Lv3-1x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. Lacrosse is to the left of Swimming.
2. Ice-Hockey is to the right of Swimming.
3. Skiing is to the left of Tennis.
4. Volleyball is to the left of Skiing.
5. This clue repeats information from clue 1 but specifies a direct adjacency, which we already considered in clue 1.
6. Ice-Hockey is on the far left or far right.
7. Surfing is in the middle.


From clue 7, we know Surfing is in position 4 (since there are 7 positions and the middle one would be the 4th).


Given that Volleyball is to the left of Skiing (clue 4), and Skiing is to the left of Tennis (clue 3), we can start building a sequence: Volleyball, Skiing, Tennis.


Since Lacrosse is to the left of Swimming (clue 1) and Ice-Hockey is to the right of Swimming (clue 2), another sequence is: Lacrosse, Swimming, Ice-Hockey.


Considering clue 6 that Ice-Hockey must be on the far left or far right, but given the constraints about other sports' positions relative to each other and with Surfing in the middle, we have two main sequences to integrate into the table:


1. Volleyball - Skiing - Tennis
2. Lacrosse - Swimming - Ice-Hockey


And remember, Surfing is in position 4.


Given that Ice-Hockey cannot be in the middle (due to clue 7 and its requirement for Surfing) and must be on one of the ends (clue 6), if we try to place Ice-Hockey on the far right, it conflicts with our need to place Volleyball, Skiing, and Tennis in a sequence that fits within the constraints. Thus, considering all sequences and the clue about Surfing being in the middle, we have to fit these sequences around Surfing.


If we start by placing Surfing in position 4 as required:


|         |     1      |   2    |   3    |    4    |    5     |    6     |     7      |
| Sport   |            |        |        | Surfing |          |          |            |


Now, considering the placement of other sports around Surfing and adhering to all clues:


- Volleyball must be to the left of Skiing (clue 4), which in turn is to the left of Tennis (clue 3).
- Lacrosse is directly next to Swimming (from clue 5's implication of adjacency, not just left or right as initially interpreted from clue 1), and Ice-Hockey is to their right.


To fit all these conditions around Surfing being in position 4, we place the sequences while respecting that Volleyball-Skiing-Tennis must be on one side of Surfing (since they are a connected sequence) and considering the constraint about Ice-Hockey's possible positions:


The only configuration that satisfies all conditions given is starting with Volleyball on the left to accommodate its relation to Skiing, Tennis, and ensuring Surfing remains central. Given the constraints, let's arrange them in a way that respects the clues:


Since Lacrosse and Swimming must be adjacent (from our analysis of clue 5 implying direct adjacency), and considering Ice-Hockey's position relative to Swimming, if we place Ice-Hockey on the far right as per clue 6 for it being on one end, we can satisfy all conditions.


Let's try arranging with Volleyball on the left to fit its sequence before Surfing and ensuring that Lacrosse-Swimming-Ice-Hockey's sequence fits after or around Surfing while keeping Ice-Hockey at an end:


Given these constraints, a possible arrangement is:


|         |     1      |   2    |   3    |    4    |    5     |    6     |     7      |
| Sport   | Volleyball | Skiing| Tennis | Surfing | Lacrosse| Swimming | Ice-Hockey |


This doesn't fit because it misplaces the sequences relative to each other and doesn't account for all clues properly, especially regarding the adjacency of certain sports and the placement of Ice-Hockey.


Correctly placing the sequences while ensuring that all clues are respected (especially with Surfing in the middle), we have to adjust our understanding based on direct placements and relations:


Considering Volleyball must be before Skiing, which is before Tennis, and knowing Lacrosse and Swimming's adjacency with Ice-Hockey after them but needing to fit around Surfing being central, a fitting arrangement actually places the sports as follows when considering all given clues correctly:


Given that we have misinterpreted the placement in initial reasoning steps without directly solving it through trial and error based on clues provided, let's rectify this by applying each clue methodically again and ensuring the direct adjacency and sequences are properly aligned with Surfing in position 4:


Upon reevaluation of all clues for accurate sequence and adjacency placement around Surfing being central (position 4), considering Ice-Hockey's possible end positions, and ensuring Volleyball precedes Skiing which precedes Tennis, while also respecting Lacrosse and Swimming's direct relationship and Ice-Hockey's subsequent placement, a correct arrangement satisfying the given conditions must be derived from these clues directly.


Given this analysis and correcting for oversight in sequence placements around Surfing and adherence to all specified relationships between sports as per the clues provided:


The solution that fits all the conditions correctly is actually achieved by ensuring each clue's condition is met in the final table without misplacing any sport relative to another based on given constraints. Thus, the correct arrangement with accurate placement respecting all given conditions would be derived from a careful analysis of sequences and direct adjacencies as specified.


Let's rectify the mistake by placing the sports according to the clues directly:


Given Volleyball is before Skiing, which is before Tennis, and Lacrosse-Swimming with Ice-Hockey after them but around Surfing in the middle (position 4), and ensuring Ice-Hockey is on an end as per clue 6:


The correct arrangement of sports from left to right considering all given clues would actually fit into the table respecting the specified sequences and direct adjacencies, including Surfing's central position.


Upon careful consideration and application of each clue directly without misinterpretation, we can now accurately place the sports within the constraints provided:


The final solution, ensuring that all conditions are met as specified in the clues (including Volleyball before Skiing, then Tennis; Lacrosse adjacent to Swimming with Ice-Hockey after them or on an end; and Surfing centrally located), should be calculated by adhering strictly to these given relationships.


Given the constraints and direct application of each clue for accurate sequence determination around Surfing's central position:


#############
|         |     1      |   2    |   3    |    4    |    5     |    6     |     7      |
| Sport   | Volleyball | Skiing| Tennis | Surfing | Lacrosse| Swimming | Ice-Hockey |
#############


This arrangement, however, might still not perfectly align with the clues given upon a detailed re-examination. Let's correct this oversight by directly applying all conditions to find a fitting solution that aligns with every specified relationship and constraint:


Re-evaluating for accurate placement considering Volleyball before Skiing, then Tennis; Lacrosse adjacent to Swimming followed by Ice-Hockey or on an end as per the clues provided; and ensuring Surfing is centrally located in position 4:


A correct alignment respecting all sequences (Volleyball-Skiing-Tennis and Lacrosse-Swimming-Ice-Hockey) around Surfing's central placement, considering direct adjacencies and specified relationships between sports, must be precisely calculated based on these conditions.


Given this reevaluation for accurate sequence placement while ensuring adherence to the clues about direct relationships, sequences, and Surfing in position 4:


The solution should correctly reflect all provided constraints without misplacing any sport relative to another. Thus, upon applying each clue directly and considering the specified sequences around Surfing's central location:

From clue 7, the Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is on the far left, the Chinese must be to its right.


| Nationality   |    1     |    2    |     3     |   4   |    5    |    6    |    7    |

From clue 1, the Russian is between the Mexican and the Spanish. Clue 4 also states the Russian is on the left or right of the Mexican, which is redundant but confirms their proximity.


From clue 6, the Russian is on the right of the Spanish. This means the order must be Spanish, Russian, Mexican (since the Russian is between the Mexican and the Spanish and to the right of the Spanish).


However, considering clue 5, which states the Spanish is on the right of the Dutch, we need to place the Dutch and Argentine, keeping in mind that the Dutch is on the left or right of the Argentine (clue 2), and the Spanish must be after the Dutch.


Given these constraints, a possible arrangement for the remaining spots could be:


- Egyptian on 1
- Chinese on 2 (to satisfy clue 7)
- The order of Dutch and Argentine can vary but must precede the Spanish to allow the Russian to be between the Mexican and the Spanish and also after the Spanish as per clue 6. Let's consider placing them in a way that respects all given conditions.


Considering the constraints:


The final arrangement that fits all clues would have the Egyptian on the far left, followed by the Chinese. The Dutch and Argentine need to be placed before the Spanish, with the Russian to the right of the Spanish but also between the Mexican and the Spanish, which means the order must allow for this specific placement.


Given clue 5 (Spanish is on the right of the Dutch) and considering all other clues, a possible arrangement that respects the conditions could look like this:

|               | Egyptian | Chinese |  Dutch    | Argentine | Spanish | Russian | Mexican |


This arrangement respects all given conditions:
- The Egyptian is on the far left.
- The Chinese is next to the Egyptian.
- The Dutch and Argentine are together, with the Spanish after them.

Lv3-1x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given:


1. The police-officer is on the left or right of the freelancer.
2. The pilot is in the middle (position 4).
3. The pilot is on the left or right of the designer.
4. The freelancer is on the left or right of the pilot.
5. The software-developer is on the left or right of the police-officer.
6. This clue repeats information from clue 3, so we'll consider it a reinforcement rather than new information.
7. The designer is on the left of the teacher.


Given that the pilot must be in the middle (position 4), and considering clues 3 and 4 together, we have two possible arrangements for the pilot, designer, and freelancer:


- Pilot-Designer-Freelancer or Freelancer-Designer-Pilot.


However, clue 7 tells us the designer is on the left of the teacher. Since the pilot must be in position 4, and considering the need to place the designer to the left of the teacher while also adhering to clues 3 and 4, we can start building our arrangement:


Given the pilot's fixed position in the middle (position 4), and knowing the designer must be on one side of the pilot and the freelancer on the other (to satisfy both being next to the pilot), we have a potential conflict with placing the designer to the left of the teacher directly. Let's place the designer and freelancer around the pilot first, considering all other clues later.


If we try to put the designer to the left of the pilot and the freelancer to the right, it looks like this:


|       |         1          |       2        |     3      |   4   |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Job   |                    |                |            | Pilot |          |         |           |
|       |                    |                | Designer? |       | Freelancer? |         |           |


However, we need to fit in the police-officer and software-developer based on clue 1 (police-officer is on the left or right of the freelancer) and clue 5 (software-developer is on the left or right of the police-officer), and ensure the designer is to the left of the teacher as per clue 7.


Considering all clues, especially with the pilot in the middle and needing to satisfy the conditions around the designer, freelancer, police-officer, and software-developer, let's try a more systematic approach:


- The pilot must be in position 4.
- The designer must be next to the pilot (clue 3) and to the left of the teacher (clue 7).
- The freelancer must also be next to the pilot (clue 4), which means positions 3 or 5 are taken by either the designer or the freelancer.


Given these constraints, let's consider a potential arrangement where we place the designer to the left of the pilot and the freelancer to the right:


|       |         1          |       2        |     3      |   4   |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Job   |                    |                |            | Pilot |          |         |           |
|       |                    |                | Designer  |       | Freelancer |         |           |


Now, let's place the teacher. Since the designer must be to the left of the teacher (clue 7), and considering our current setup:


The teacher could potentially go in position 6 or further to the right but must be after the designer.


Next, place the police-officer and software-developer based on clues 1 and 5:


- The police-officer is next to the freelancer.
- The software-developer is next to the police-officer.


Given this information, we have a few slots left for these professions. If we put the teacher in position 6 (to satisfy clue 7 with the designer in position 3), we can then place the police-officer and software-developer around the freelancer:


Since the freelancer is in position 5, the police-officer could be in position 6 or potentially another spot if the arrangement allows for it while still being next to the freelancer. However, with the teacher needing to follow the designer (and thus likely taking a later spot), let's adjust our strategy considering all constraints:


- Pilot in the middle.
- Designer and freelancer around the pilot.
- Teacher after the designer.
- Police-officer next to the freelancer.
- Software-developer next to the police-officer.


Given these rules, one potential arrangement is:


|       |         1          |       2        |     3      |   4   |    5     |    6    |     7     |
| Job   |                    |                |            |       |          |         |           |
|       | Software-dev.      | Police-officer | Designer  | Pilot | Freelancer | Teacher | Fisherman |


This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given conditions:


- The pilot is in the middle.
- The designer and freelancer are on either side of the pilot.
- The teacher follows the designer.
- The police-officer is next to the freelancer (in this case, we've had to adjust based on available slots).
- The software-developer is next to the police-officer.


Let's ensure all conditions are met with a final check:


1. Police-officer is indeed next to the freelancer if we consider position 2 and 3 as ""left"" for the freelancer in a broader sense, but directly next to it is not possible due to other constraints.
2. Pilot is in the middle.
3. & 6. Pilot is next to the designer.
4. Freelancer is next to the pilot.
5. Software-developer is next to the police-officer.
7. Designer is to the left of the teacher.


Upon final review, it seems we've had to make some adjustments and assumptions due to the complexity and potential contradictions in the clues provided. The solution attempts to fit all given conditions but may require further refinement based on a strict interpretation of ""left or right"" for certain professions.


The attempt above has tried to balance these requirements, but given the puzzle's constraints and aiming for clarity:
