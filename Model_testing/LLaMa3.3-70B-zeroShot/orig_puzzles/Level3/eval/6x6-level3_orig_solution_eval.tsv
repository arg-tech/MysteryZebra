Note: The solution is obtained by applying the given clues one by one and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* From clue 13, the owner of the rabbit is on the far left.
* From clue 23, the fan of house is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the rabbit is already on the far left, the fan of house must be on the far left as well.
* From clue 22, the person driving the ship is on the far left.
* From clue 14, the fan of classical is on the left of the person driving the train.
* From clue 10, the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left or far right. Since the far left is already occupied by the owner of the rabbit, the person who's sport is soccer must be on the far left as well.
* From clue 8, the fan of rock is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
* From clue 7, the fan of rock is on the far left or far right. Since the fan of rock is already on the left of the person who's sport is badminton, it must be on the far right.
* From clue 12, the person driving the taxi is on the far right.
* From clue 27, the person who's sport is surfing is the person driving the trike.
* From clue 1, the person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is surfing. 
* The rest of the clues are applied similarly to fill in the table.

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and logical deductions. Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clue 16 states that the person driving the motorbike is on the far left, so the motorbike is at position 1.
* Clue 21 states that the owner of the mouse is the teacher, and clue 14 states that the owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right. Since the motorbike is already at position 1, the teacher and mouse must be at position 1.
* Clue 1 states that the Chinese is the person driving the train, so the Chinese and train are at position 2.
* Clue 17 states that the person watching time-travel movies is the owner of the lizard, and clue 3 states that the person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the photographer. Since the Chinese and train are already at position 2, the photographer must be at position 3.
* Clue 24 states that the person driving the train is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret, so the ferret must be at position 3.
* Clue 11 states that the paramedic is on the left or right of the photographer, and clue 8 states that the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the paramedic. Since the motorbike is already at position 1, the paramedic must be at position 2.
* Clue 4 states that the manager is on the left of the Egyptian, so the manager and Egyptian are at positions 4 and 5, respectively.
* Clue 28 states that the person driving the skateboard is the manager, so the skateboard is at position 4.
* Clue 6 states that the person driving the car is the owner of the hamster, and clue 9 states that the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the manager and skateboard are already at position 4, the car must be at position 5.
* Clue 10 states that the person watching western movies is on the left of the person driving the car, so the western movies must be at position 1.
* Clue 12 states that the person watching satire movies is on the right of the Turkish, and clue 23 states that the owner of the goat is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the Egyptian is already at position 5, the Turkish and satire movies must be at positions 3 and 4, respectively.
* Clue 20 states that the chef is the Argentine, and clue 22 states that the Argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the teacher is already at position 1, the chef and Argentine must be at position 6.
* Clue 19 states that the person who's sport is rowing is on the far right, so the rowing must be at position 6.
* The remaining clues can be used to fill in the remaining positions.

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions provided in the puzzle. 

To solve this puzzle, I used a combination of logical deductions and trial-and-error approach. Here's a brief overview of the steps:

1. Start by using the most restrictive clues, such as clue 7 (the person drinking mirinda is on the far left or far right) and clue 13 (the architect is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk).
2. Use the clues related to the sport (climbing, water-polo, parkour, etc.) to determine the relative positions of these individuals.
3. Apply the clues related to food (broccoli, tomato, zucchini, etc.) to narrow down the possible combinations.
4. Utilize the clues about pets (goat, hamster, goldfish, etc.) and jobs (analyst, security-guard, chef, etc.) to further constrain the possibilities.
5. Finally, use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps and arrive at a solution that satisfies all conditions.

Please note that this puzzle has many possible solutions, and the provided solution is just one of them.
