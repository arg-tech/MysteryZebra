Lv3-5x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each rule step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 12
Given that the person eating kiwi is on the far left or far right (Rule 12), let's start by placing kiwi at position 1, as starting with a fixed point can simplify our approach. This gives us an initial setup:
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4   |
| Beverage      |         |         |           |       |
| Food          | Kiwi    |         |           |       |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |           |       |
| Pet           |         |         |           |       |
| Transport     |         |         |           |       |

## Step 2: Apply Rule 7
Since the person eating kiwi is on the left of the person driving the scooter (Rule 7), and assuming kiwi is at position 1, the scooter must be at position 2 or further to the right. Let's tentatively place the scooter at position 2 for now:
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4   |
| Beverage      |         |         |           |       |
| Food          | Kiwi    |         |           |       |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |           |       |
| Pet           |         |         |           |       |
| Transport     |         | Scooter |           |       |

## Step 3: Apply Rule 6
The person eating kiwi is on the left of the owner of the lizard (Rule 6), so the lizard must be at position 2 or further to the right. However, since we've tentatively placed the scooter at position 2, and given that each transport, food, etc., can only be used once, let's adjust our approach considering all rules will guide the final placement.

## Step 4: Apply Rule 3
The person eating kale is a fan of indie (Rule 3), and from Rule 10, we know this person also drinks milk. From Rule 9, this person drives the bus. Let's place kale (and thus indie and milk and bus) at position 4 for now because it gives us a solid block to work with:
|               |    1    |    2    |     3     |   4   |
| Beverage      |         |         |           | Milk  |
| Food          | Kiwi    |         |           | Kale  |
| Music-Genre   |         |         |           | Indie |
| Pet           |         |         |           |       |
| Transport     |         | Scooter |           | Bus   |

## Step 5: Apply Rule 4
The owner of the bird is on the left of the fan of indie (Rule 4). Given indie is at position 4, the bird must be at either position 1, 2, or 3. Since kiwi is already at position 1 and associated with another set of preferences, let's consider other placements.

## Step 6: Apply Rule 11
The person eating peas drinks coffee (Rule 11), and from Rule 1, this person must be on the left of the fan of hip-hop. This doesn't give us an exact position yet but indicates a relationship between peas/coffee and hip-hop.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate Placements with New Information
Considering all rules together:
- Kiwi is at position 1 (from Step 1).
- Scooter could be at position 2 based on Rule 7, but we need to fit in the lizard, bird, and other preferences.
- The person eating kale (also a fan of indie, drinks milk, and drives the bus) is at position 4 (from Step 4).

Let's solidify placements:
- Given kiwi's placement and its relation to scooter (Rule 7), let's place the lizard at position 3, as it must be to the right of kiwi (Rule 6).
- The bird, being on the left of indie (Rule 4), could fit at position 1 or 2. Since kiwi is at position 1 and associated with other preferences, we need to carefully place other items.
- Coffee (and thus peas) must be on the left of hip-hop (Rule 1). If we place coffee/peas at position 1 (kiwi), it conflicts with our current kiwi placement. So, let's consider coffee/peas for position 2 or 3, keeping in mind the bird and lizard placements.

## Step 8: Finalize Placement Considering All Rules
Let's finalize:
- Position 1: Kiwi (already placed).
- Given the constraints, let's place the bird at position 2 to satisfy Rule 4 (bird on the left of indie) and other considerations.
- This leaves us with coffee/peas, which must be on the left of hip-hop. If we place coffee/peas at position 3, it conflicts with lizard placement based on kiwi's position. Thus, coffee/peas could fit at position 2 if we adjust other placements accordingly.

However, considering all rules and avoiding conflicts:
- Position 1: Kiwi (and its associated transport, which must be the airplane to satisfy Rule 13 when considering scooter's placement).
- Position 2: Coffee/Peas (to be on the left of hip-hop), Bird.
- Position 3: Lemonade (Rule 5 and Rule 2 indicate lemonade is near metal and rat; its exact position depends on satisfying these rules without conflict).
- Position 4: Kale/Milk/Indie/Bus (solidified from previous steps).

Let's correct the approach for clarity and accuracy in solving:
Given the complexity and the need to apply each rule carefully, we should directly solve based on given conditions without assuming placements that might lead to conflicts.

## Step 9: Direct Solution Approach
1. **Kiwi at Position 1**: Given kiwi is far left or right (Rule 12), let's keep it at position 1 for simplicity.
2. **Kale/Indie/Milk/Bus at Position 4**: From Rules 3, 9, and 10, kale is associated with indie, milk, and the bus.
3. **Coffee/Peas and Hip-Hop**: Coffee (and peas) must be on the left of hip-hop (Rule 1).
4. **Bird on the Left of Indie**: The bird must be at position 1, 2, or 3 since it's on the left of indie (Rule 4). Given kiwi is at position 1 and associated with other preferences, we adjust.
5. **Lemonade and Metal**: Lemonade is near metal (Rule 5), and considering rat's placement relative to lemonade (Rule 2), these must be positioned to satisfy all conditions without conflict.

Considering the need for a step-by-step logical deduction without incorrect assumptions:
- The direct approach should involve placing items based on the most restrictive rules first, such as kiwi's position, kale/indie/milk/bus at position 4, and then deducing other positions based on the given relationships.

The final answer is:

Lv3-5x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 1
The person eating carrot is on the far left.

|               |    1    |      2      |     3     |    4     |
| Food          | Carrot |             |           |          |

## Step 2: Apply clue 3
The person whose sport is surfing is the person eating carrot.

|               |    1    |      2      |     3     |    4     |
| Food          | Carrot |             |           |          |

| Sport         | Surfing|             |           |          |

## Step 3: Apply clue 10
The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.

This doesn't change our table directly but sets up a relationship for later use.


## Step 4: Apply clue 7
The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the fan of funk.

Given the arrangement so far and considering clue 10, we can infer that the fan of funk must be to the right of the surfing person (since documentary comes after surfing), but we don't have enough information yet to place them directly.


## Step 5: Apply clue 8
The fan of funk is on the left of the person eating garlic.

This gives us another relationship but not enough to fill in the table directly.


## Step 6: Apply clue 2
The person eating blueberry is the owner of the cat.

We can't place this information yet, but we know it will be crucial for determining pet ownership.


## Step 7: Apply clue 5
The fan of pop is on the right of the owner of the cat.

Again, not enough to place directly, but we're building relationships between categories.


## Step 8: Apply clue 11
The person whose sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person whose sport is surfing.

Given that surfing is already placed at position 1, basketball must be either before (which is impossible since surfing is first) or after surfing. Thus, basketball could potentially be in position 2.


## Step 9: Apply clue 6
The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person whose sport is sailing.

This clue sets up another relationship but doesn't give us enough to directly place any categories yet.


## Step 10: Piece together remaining clues and logic.
From clue 4, we know the fan of house is between the owner of the lizard and the fan of funk. Clue 9 tells us the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person watching horror movies.

Given all these relationships, let's try to fit them into our table.


Since surfing (and thus carrot) is at position 1, and considering clue 10 (surfing before documentary), we can start building a sequence. However, without direct connections between many categories, we need to deduce based on the process of elimination and known relationships.


The person eating garlic must be after funk (clue 8), and since the fan of pop is on the right of the cat owner (clue 5), and knowing the cat owner eats blueberries (clue 2), we can start building a sequence but need to fit in the sports, music genres, and pets around these food items.


Considering all clues together:
- The person eating carrot (1) also surfs.
- Documentary movies are after surfing (10).
- Funk is after documentary (7) and before garlic (8).
- Since surfing is at 1, basketball could be at 2 if we consider it must be next to surfing (11).
- Given the constraints, let's place sailing at 3 (to fit in with other sports and allow for the spy movie watcher to be after sailing, clue 6).
- The hamster owner is before horror movies (9), which could help us place pets and movies.


However, given the complexity and without direct clues linking many categories directly to specific positions beyond these relationships, let's organize what we can with certainty:


1. Carrot - Surfing
2. ? - Basketball or another sport (considering basketball must be next to surfing)
3. ? - Sailing (to fit the spy movie clue later)
4. Blueberry - Cat owner


And for music:
- Funk is after documentary, which is after surfing.
- Pop is on the right of the cat owner.


Given these constraints and trying to fit all clues together:


## Step 11: Attempt a Final Placement
Considering all relationships and the need to satisfy every clue simultaneously, let's attempt a final placement. Remember, some steps may require deduction based on multiple clues at once.


Given the complexity, we deduce:
- Carrot (1) with Surfing.
- To fit basketball next to surfing, it could be at 2, but we must consider other sports and their placements relative to each other and the food/movie/music/pet categories.


Let's finalize based on known relationships:


The final answer is:

Lv3-5x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of d&b is on the far left. This gives us a starting point for one column.


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 5 and 12
The person eating blueberry is on the right of the owner of the hamster, and the person eating blueberry is on the far left or far right. Given that the d&b fan is on the far left, if blueberry were also on the far left, it would contradict clue 5 since there must be a hamster owner to the left of blueberry. Thus, blueberry cannot be on the far left with the current information.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the hamster is on the right of the person eating carrot. This means carrot and hamster must be in two consecutive columns.


## Step 4: Analyze Clues 3 and 9
The fan of house is on the right of the person eating carrot, and the fan of house is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Given that house is to the right of carrot, and considering clue 1 (hamster to the right of carrot), we can start forming a sequence.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 4
The person eating mango is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since blueberry's position is restricted by its relation to hamster and potentially being on the far right, mango must be near it.


## Step 6: Analyze Clues 6 and 13
The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the Brazilian, and the Brazilian is on the left of the Canadian. This gives us a sequence for nationalities but doesn't directly tell us about other preferences yet.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 11
The Chinese is on the right of the Canadian. With clue 13 (Brazilian to the left of Canadian), we have a partial nationality order: Brazilian, Canadian, Chinese.


## Step 8: Combine Information
Given that blueberry cannot be on the far left and must be near mango, and considering all other clues about relative positions, let's start placing items based on the most restrictive clues first.


## Step 9: Final Placement
1. D&b fan is on the far left (Clue 2).
2. Since the person eating blueberry is on the right of the hamster owner (Clue 5) and cannot be on the far left, it likely must be on the far right to satisfy all conditions when considering other clues about relative positions.
3. The fan of house is to the right of carrot (Clue 3), which means if we place carrot in column 1 or 2, house must follow it.
4. Given that the hamster owner is to the right of carrot (Clue 1) and the cat owner is to the right of the hamster owner (Clue 14), we have a sequence for pets: carrot, hamster, cat.
5. The Brazilian is to the left of the Canadian (Clue 13), and the Chinese is to the right of the Canadian (Clue 11).
6. Zombie movies are to the right of the Brazilian (Clue 6), which helps place movie genres relative to nationalities.


## Step 10: Finalize Table
Let's fill in the table based on our deductions:

Lv3-5x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the Australian's position and its implications.
From clue 12, the Australian is on the far left. This means column 1 is the Australian.


## Step 2: Place the Canadian based on their relation to the Australian.
Clue 7 states the Australian is on the left or right of the Canadian. Since the Australian is at the far left, the Canadian must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Determine the beverage for the Australian and its implications.
Given clue 10, which states the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate, and clue 3, which says the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right, we can deduce that if the Australian were drinking hot-chocolate, they would have to be watching family movies because of their position. However, we cannot confirm this without further information.


## Step 4: Identify the beverage for the Canadian.
From clue 4, the person drinking milk is on the left of the Dutch. Since the Canadian is in column 2 and clue 13 states the fan of rock is the person drinking milk, we can place milk in column 2 (Canadian) because there's no one to the left of the Australian for the milk drinker to be.


## Step 5: Place the Dutch nationality.
Since the milk drinker (Canadian) is to the left of the Dutch, the Dutch must be in column 3 or 4. But we need more information to precisely place them.


## Step 6: Determine the positions based on music genres and other clues.
Clue 1 says the fan of dubstep is on the far left or far right. Clue 11 states the person eating plum is on the left of the fan of dubstep, which means if dubstep were on the far right (column 4), plum would have to be in column 3 at the latest, given the other constraints.


## Step 7: Analyze the movie genres and their implications.
Clue 8 states the person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating asparagus. This clue, combined with others, will help us narrow down the possibilities for each column.


## Step 8: Use the clues about food to further narrow down positions.
From clue 5, the person eating plum is the person drinking juice. This means we need to find a spot for plum (and thus juice) that fits all other criteria.


## Step 9: Combine all information to start filling in the table.
Given the Australian's position and the implications of the clues about beverages, food, movie genres, music genres, and nationalities, let's try to place each item:
- Australian is on the far left (column 1).
- Canadian is next to the Australian (column 2), drinks milk, and listens to rock.
- The person drinking hot-chocolate could be on the far left or far right. If on the far left, it conflicts with the Australian's fixed position unless the Australian drinks hot-chocolate.
- Dubstep fan is on the far left or far right. Given plum must be to the left of dubstep and considering other placements, we'll have to see how this fits with other clues.


## Step 10: Finalize positions based on all constraints.
Considering clue 9 (lime is on the right of western movies), clue 2 (horror movies are on the left or right of techno), and all other constraints:
- If the Australian drinks hot-chocolate (to satisfy clue 3 and considering they're already placed), this fits with being on the far left.
- The Canadian, as established, drinks milk and listens to rock, placing them in column 2.


## Step 11: Place remaining nationalities, beverages, foods, movie genres, and music genres.
Given all constraints:
- Dutch must be after the Canadian (since the milk drinker is before the Dutch), potentially in column 3 or 4.
- Indonesian's position relative to jazz (clue 6) needs consideration with other placements.


## Step 12: Final table construction.
Let's construct a possible solution based on all clues:


Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction that fits all given conditions without contradiction, we must ensure each clue is satisfied. However, the exact placement of every item requires considering all interactions between clues simultaneously.

Lv3-5x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing clue 1
The software-developer is the Mexican. This gives us a direct correlation between a job and a nationality but doesn't tell us the position yet.


## Step 2: Analyzing clue 2
The fisherman eats strawberry. This clue correlates a job with a type of food.


## Step 3: Analyzing clue 3
The person whose sport is basketball owns the cat. This gives us a correlation between a sport and a pet.


## Step 4: Analyzing clue 4
The person eating pepper is on the far left. This gives us a specific position for one of the foods.


## Step 5: Analyzing clue 5
The person eating cabbage is to the right of the Chinese. This clue doesn't give us an exact position but a relative one.


## Step 6: Analyzing clue 6
The Mexican is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since we know from clue 1 that the software-developer is Mexican, this gives us a relationship between the software-developer and the goldfish owner.


## Step 7: Analyzing clue 7
The person eating avocado is to the right of the person whose sport is handball. This gives another relative position.


## Step 8: Analyzing clue 8
The owner of the snake is to the right of the firefighter. Another relative position clue.


## Step 9: Analyzing clue 9
The owner of the fish is to the left of the firefighter. This clue, combined with clue 8, gives us a sequence: fish owner, firefighter, snake owner.


## Step 10: Analyzing clue 10
The Japanese person eats strawberry. Combining this with clue 2, we know the Japanese fisherman eats strawberry.


## Step 11: Analyzing clue 11
The person whose sport is basketball eats pepper. Combining this with clue 4, we know the person who likes basketball and owns a cat is on the far left and eats pepper.


## Step 12: Analyzing clue 12
The Japanese person is on the far left or far right. Given that the Japanese fisherman eats strawberry (from clues 2 and 10), and considering other clues about positions, we need to determine if they can fit on the far left or must be on the far right.


## Step 13: Analyzing clue 13
The person whose sport is cricket is between the person eating strawberry and the person eating cabbage. This gives us a relative position that will help in final placement.


Given all these clues, let's start building the table:


- From clue 4 and 11, the far left person eats pepper and likes basketball.
- Clue 3 tells us this person also owns a cat.
- The Japanese fisherman (from clues 2 and 10) eats strawberry. Given the constraints, especially with clue 12, if the Japanese were on the far left, it would conflict with clue 4. Thus, the Japanese must be on the far right, eating strawberry.
- Clue 13 tells us cricket is between strawberry and cabbage. Since strawberry is on the far right (Japanese fisherman), this means cabbage must be to the left of the Japanese, and cricket's position is between them.

Now, let's place the software-developer (Mexican) and consider clue 6. The Mexican (software-developer) must be next to the goldfish owner.


- Clue 9 and 8 give us a sequence: fish owner, firefighter, snake owner.
- Clue 1 and 6 suggest the Mexican (software-developer) is near the goldfish owner. Given the constraints, the goldfish is already placed in position 3 in the original table, suggesting the Mexican could be in position 2 or 4, but since the Japanese (and thus strawberry eater) is in position 4, the Mexican must be in position 2.


So, we update:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper        |                    |             | strawberry|
| Job           |                | software-developer|             | fisherman |
| Nationality   |                | Mexican           |             | Japanese  |
| Pet           | cat            |                    | goldfish    |           |
| Sport         | basketball     |                    |             |           |


Now, let's fill in the rest using the clues:


- Clue 5 says cabbage is to the right of the Chinese. Since strawberry (Japanese) is on the far right, cabbage must be in position 3, and the Chinese must be in one of the first two positions.
- Clue 13 tells us cricket is between strawberry and cabbage, so cricket must be in position 3 for sport, but since cabbage is in position 3 for food, this means our initial interpretation needs adjustment; cricket's placement as a sport doesn't directly dictate the food column's order but indicates a sequence that must fit within the constraints of other clues.
- Clue 7 says avocado is to the right of handball. Given the placements so far, if we consider the need for cricket to be between strawberry and cabbage (and knowing cabbage can't be in position 4 because strawberry is there), we have to adjust our understanding based on the clues about sports and food.


Considering all clues again with a focus on fitting the remaining pieces:


- The person eating pepper (position 1) likes basketball and owns a cat.
- The software-developer (Mexican, position 2) needs to be next to the goldfish owner, which fits as the goldfish is in position 3.
- Given the cricket must be between strawberry and cabbage, and knowing the Japanese fisherman eats strawberry on the far right, we deduce that cricket's position as a sport is actually in position 2 or 3. However, since basketball is already placed in position 1, and considering the constraints around the placement of cabbage (to the right of Chinese), cricket must fit into the sequence in a way that respects all other placements.


Let's finalize with the correct application of clues:


- The far left eats pepper, likes basketball, and owns a cat. This is not the Mexican or Japanese.
- The software-developer (Mexican) is in position 2, next to the goldfish owner.
- Given the constraints, especially around the Chinese, cabbage, cricket, and the fixed positions of pepper and strawberry, we must place the remaining elements carefully.


The final solution, considering all clues correctly and filling in the gaps based on logical deductions:


|               |       1        |         2          |      3      |     4      |
| Food          | pepper        | avocado            | cabbage    | strawberry|

Lv3-5x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we can.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The person whose sport is basketball is on the far left or far right.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 12
The scientist is on the far right. This means that if basketball is on the far right, it must be paired with the scientist, but we don't have enough information yet to confirm this.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clues 5 and 3
The person whose sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person eating strawberry, and the person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating peach. This gives us a partial sequence: ..., strawberry, ..., peach.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 9
The person eating papaya is the person whose sport is cycling.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clues 6 and 10
The pilot is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling, and the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person whose sport is cycling. Since the pilot must be to the left of cycling (and thus papaya), we have a sequence for these two: ..., pilot, ..., papaya/cycling.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 11
The security-guard is on the left of the musician.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clues 1 and 8
The person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, and the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means we have a sequence: ..., hot-chocolate, drama, adventure.


## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 7
The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.


## Step 9: Combining Information from Previous Steps
From steps 3 and 5, considering surfing's position relative to strawberry and cycling's fixed food (papaya), we can start building a more complete sequence.


## Step 10: Finalizing Positions Based on All Clues
- Basketball must be at one end (clue 4).
- The scientist is at the far right (clue 12), which means basketball cannot be at the far right if it's to be paired with another sport or activity directly.
- Given clue 13, the pilot can't be next to the scientist without breaking other rules about cycling and papaya.
- Sprite is before hot-chocolate (clue 7).
- Hot-chocolate is before drama (clue 8), which is before adventure (clue 1).
- Orange is before scientific movies (clue 2), but we don't know where this fits yet.
- Strawberry is before peach (clue 3), and surfing is next to strawberry (clue 5).


## Step 11: Constructing the Table
Given all clues, let's construct a table that satisfies all conditions.


The final answer is:

Lv3-5x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 1
The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left or far right.

## Step 2: Analyze clue 6
The person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right.

## Step 3: Analyze clue 13
The person who's hobby is photography is on the far left or far right.

## Step 4: Combine clues 1, 6, and 13
Given that there are only two far left or far right positions and considering the other constraints, we can start by placing one of these individuals on either end. However, we need more information to decide which specific activities or beverages go with each.

## Step 5: Analyze clue 11
The person driving the motorbike is the person who's hobby is chess.

## Step 6: Analyze clue 4
The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess.

## Step 7: Analyze clue 10
The person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is photography.

## Step 8: Combine clues 5, 9, and 3
The fan of salsa plays badminton. The person whose sport is biathlon is on the right of the fan of salsa. The person playing badminton is between the tram user and the classical music fan.

## Step 9: Analyze clue 8
The fan of dubstep drinks fanta, which means this person also has photography as a hobby (from clue 10).

## Step 10: Combine all relevant clues to fill in the table
Given the constraints:
- The almond-milk drinker is on an end.
- The motorbike driver (who likes chess) is on an end.
- The photography enthusiast (who drinks fanta and likes dubstep) could be on an end but must consider other placements based on further clues.

## Step 11: Finalize placements
Let's start with fixed positions:
1. If the person driving the motorbike (and likes chess) is on one end, and considering clue 4, coffee must be next to chess.
2. The fan of salsa (badminton player) has biathlon to their right and is between tram and classical music (clue 9).
3. Cricket is between salsa and chess (clue 12), which helps in arranging the sports.

## Step 12: Determine exact positions
Given all constraints, we can attempt a solution:
- If motorbike/chess is on one end, coffee must be next to it.
- Salsa/badminton must have biathlon to its right and be between tram and classical.
- Cricket fits between salsa and chess.

## Step 13: Final arrangement
Let's arrange based on clues:
1. Motorbike/Chess/Coffee (considering clue 4).
2. Dubstep/Fanta/Photography could fit on the other end or near the middle, depending on the placement of almond-milk.
3. Salsa/Badminton with biathlon to its right and between tram and classical.

Given the complexity and without direct step-by-step elimination for each clue in this format, we deduce based on key clues:
- Motorbike (chess) is likely on an end.
- Coffee is next to chess.
- Dubstep (fanta, photography) could be on an end or near it, considering almond-milk's placement.

Lv3-5x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person eating raspberry. This gives us a starting point but doesn't provide enough information to fill in any specific slots yet.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The manager is on the left of the engineer. This clue helps with job placement but still doesn't give us exact positions without more context.


## Step 3: Consider Clue 3
The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is handball. This links a pet to a sport, which will be helpful when combined with other clues.


## Step 4: Examine Clue 4
The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the quad-bike and the owner of the bird. This clue starts to give us some spatial arrangement but still needs integration with other information.


## Step 5: Integrate Clues for Initial Placement
Given the complexity, let's start integrating clues that provide direct links or spatial arrangements:
- From Clue 11, we know the person eating pumpkin drives the airplane.
- Using Clue 4 and knowing the airplane driver eats pumpkin, we can start placing these individuals relative to each other.


## Step 6: Apply Remaining Clues for Detailed Placement
Let's apply the rest of the clues systematically:
- Clue 5 places the cat owner (handball player) near the librarian.
- Clue 9 indicates badminton is on the left of handball (cat owner).
- Clue 1 suggests jet-ski is to the right of raspberry, and with other spatial clues, we can deduce positions.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions Based on All Clues
By carefully considering all clues together:
- The engineer must be to the right of the manager (Clue 2) and left of basketball (Clue 10).
- Badminton is to the left of handball (cat owner), which helps place sports.
- Pumpkin eater drives an airplane (Clue 11), helping with transport placement.


## Step 8: Construct Solution Table
Given the complexity and the need for precise placement based on all clues, let's summarize key points:
- Badminton is to the left of handball (cat owner).
- Manager is to the left of engineer.
- Pumpkin eater (airplane) is between quad-bike and bird owner.
- Jet-ski driver is to the right of raspberry eater.


Given these clues and their interconnections, we can attempt a solution. However, without direct, step-by-step filling based on each clue's interaction with others in real-time, the exact table might vary based on interpretation. The final solution should carefully consider all spatial relationships and attribute assignments.

Lv3-5x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one.


From clue 5 and 10, we know the person eating garlic watches documentary movies and does weightlifting.

Clue 9 is redundant as it doesn't provide any new information.


Given that there are only four positions (1 through 4), we'll use the process of elimination and direct placement based on the clues.


From clue 2, the crime movie fan is to the left of the cherry eater.


Clue 3 tells us the pony owner is between the cherry eater and the hedgehog owner.


Clue 4 says the pony owner is to the left of the surfer.


Combining these clues, we start getting a possible arrangement:


- The person eating cherry cannot be in position 4 because the pony owner needs to be to their right (clue 3), and the surfer must be to the right of the pony owner (clue 4).
- Since the crime movie fan is to the left of the cherry eater (clue 2), and considering the restrictions, a possible starting point could be:
  - Position 1: Crime movie fan
  - Position 2: Cherry eater


However, we must integrate all clues:


Clue 6 indicates the martial-arts and drama movie fans are next to each other.


Clue 8 says the orange eater is next to the documentary movie fan (who eats garlic and does weightlifting, from clues 5 and 10).


Given clue 1 (techno fan to the right of the pony owner), clue 7 (techno fan to the left of the parkour enthusiast), and considering all other restrictions:


- The techno fan cannot be in position 4 because they need to be to the left of the parkour enthusiast (clue 7).
- Since the pony owner is between the cherry eater and the hedgehog owner (clue 3) and to the left of the surfer (clue 4), and considering the techno fan's placement relative to the pony owner and the parkour enthusiast, we have a complex set of relationships.


Let's summarize key points before finalizing:


- Garlic eater watches documentaries and does weightlifting (clues 5 and 10).
- Crime movie fan is to the left of the cherry eater (clue 2).
- Pony owner between cherry eater and hedgehog owner (clue 3) and to the left of surfer (clue 4).
- Techno fan to the right of pony owner (clue 1) and to the left of parkour enthusiast (clue 7).


Considering all these restrictions and knowing we have four distinct categories (food, movie genre, music genre, pet, sport), let's attempt a solution:


Given clue 13, the blues fan watches martial-arts movies.


Clue 11 says the goat owner is to the right of the lizard owner.


Since the person eating garlic does weightlifting and watches documentaries (clues 5 and 10), and combining this with other clues about positions relative to each other:


The direct solution requires integrating all these points. Let's consider a logical arrangement based on all given clues:


1. The crime movie fan is to the left of the cherry eater, but we also know the pony owner must be between the cherry eater and the hedgehog owner.
2. The techno fan is to the right of the pony owner and to the left of the parkour enthusiast.
3. Given these restrictions and others, let's fill in a possible arrangement considering all clues.


Let's attempt a final table based on logical deductions from the clues:


Given the complexity and interrelation of the clues, we deduce as follows:


The person who eats garlic watches documentary movies and does weightlifting (clues 5 and 10), so this can help anchor some positions.


Considering clue 12 (d&b fan next to documentary movie fan) and clue 8 (orange eater next to documentary movie fan), and knowing the relationships between other preferences:


A possible solution that fits all clues, given the constraints and relationships outlined, is as follows:

Lv3-5x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we can deduce it.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the scooter is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 5 and 11
The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating lime, and the person eating cucumber is also on the left of the person drinking 7up. This implies a sequence but doesn't directly relate to positions yet.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 6 and 2
The person driving the bus is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, and the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person driving the bus. This gives us a partial sequence: Fanta -> Bus -> Lemonade.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 12
The person driving the bus is between the person drinking fanta and the person eating watermelon. Since from clue 3, the person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta, we have to consider how these fit around the bus.

## Step 5: Combining Information
From clue 9, the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Clue 11 also tells us cucumber is to the left of 7up, which starts to build a sequence but doesn't directly link to the other sequences yet.

## Step 6: Further Analysis
Clue 1 says the person whose hobby is woodworking is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Clue 7 indicates the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking, which starts to build a sequence related to hobbies and possibly transport.

## Step 7: Building Sequences
From clue 10, the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane. This, combined with clues 1 and 7, gives us a sequence related to movies and transport but doesn't directly link to food or beverages yet.

## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Considering all clues together:
- Cucumber must be on the left of lime (clue 5) and also on the left of 7up (clue 11).
- The sequence for drinks related to bus and lemonade is Fanta -> Bus -> Lemonade (clues 2 and 6).
- Scooter is linked with magic-tricks (clue 4), which doesn't directly fit into our sequences yet.
- Airplane's position relative to woodworking and zombie movies gives us a sequence but needs linking to the other categories.

Given these clues, we start building from what we know:
1. Cucumber -> Lime (from clue 5)
2. Cucumber -> 7up (from clue 11)
3. Fanta -> Bus -> Lemonade (from clues 2 and 6)
4. Bus is between Fanta and Watermelon (clue 12), implying Carrot could be with Fanta or Watermelon given its relation to Fanta.
5. Romance -> Airplane (from clue 10)
6. Woodworking is on the right of Airplane (clue 1), followed by Zombie (clue 7)

Linking hobbies, movies, transport, food, and drinks together based on the clues provided:
