Lv3-7x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we can.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. This doesn't give us enough to place anything yet.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the horse is on the left of the Malaysian. This clue also doesn't give us enough information to place anything yet.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person whose hobby is reading is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess. Still not enough for direct placement.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This clue needs to be combined with others for useful information.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person whose sport is volleyball is the person whose hobby is reading. Now we have a direct connection between two categories.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The social-worker is the person eating pineapple. This clue gives us our first concrete piece of information to start filling in the table.


Given these clues, let's try to fill in some information:


- From Clue 6, we know one job and food combination: Social-worker eats pineapple.
- From Clue 5, we know the hobby and sport for one person: Reading and Volleyball.
- Since the social-worker eats pineapple (Clue 6), and there are only two foods, the other person must eat raspberry.
- The person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (Clue 4). Given we have two beverages and one is already paired with a potential hobby (via Clue 5's connection to reading and volleyball), we can start making some educated guesses.


Let's combine what we know and make some logical deductions:


1. The social-worker eats pineapple.
2. The person whose hobby is reading also likes volleyball (and thus drinks tea, as the beverage options are hot-chocolate and tea).
3. Given Clue 3 (reading on the left of chess) and knowing reading = volleyball, we can start placing hobbies.


Now, let's try to place nationalities and pets using Clues 2 and 1:


- The owner of the horse is on the left of the Malaysian (Clue 2).
- The chinchilla owner is next to the raspberry eater (Clue 1).


We know there are only two options for each category, so let's see if we can fit everything together logically.


Given all clues and trying to piece them together:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |               |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         |            |               |
| Job           |            |               |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Sport         |            |               |

From Clue 6, the social-worker eats pineapple. Let's place this:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |               |
| Food          | Pineapple | Raspberry    |
| Hobby         |            |               |
| Job           | Social-worker|               |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Sport         |            |               |

Given the social-worker eats pineapple and is likely on one side, we can use Clue 5 to place reading and volleyball together:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |               |
| Food          | Pineapple | Raspberry    |
| Hobby         | Reading   | Chess        |
| Job           | Social-worker| Analyst      |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Golf          |

Now, using Clue 3 (reading on the left of chess) and knowing reading = volleyball:


The person drinking tea must be the reader/volleyball player. The other person drinks hot-chocolate.


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Tea        | Hot-chocolate|
| Food          | Pineapple | Raspberry    |
| Hobby         | Reading   | Chess        |
| Job           | Social-worker| Analyst      |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Golf          |

For nationalities and pets, using Clue 2 (horse on the left of Malaysian) and knowing we have Brazilian as the other nationality:


The horse owner must be Brazilian since they are to the left of the Malaysian.


Using Clue 1 (chinchilla next to raspberry), if the person eating raspberry is also the chess player and golfer, then the chinchilla must belong to this person because the horse belongs to the Brazilian who eats pineapple (as per our deductions).


Thus:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Tea        | Hot-chocolate|
| Food          | Pineapple | Raspberry    |
| Hobby         | Reading   | Chess        |
| Job           | Social-worker| Analyst      |
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Malaysian    |
| Pet           | Horse     | Chinchilla   |
| Sport         | Volleyball| Golf          |

Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Tea        | Hot-chocolate|

This solution satisfies all given conditions and clues."	{'beverage': ['tea', 'hot-chocolate'], 'food': ['pineapple', 'raspberry'], 'hobby': ['reading', 'chess'], 'job': ['social-worker', 'analyst'], 'nationality': ['brazilian', 'malaysian'], 'pet': ['horse', 'chinchilla'], 'sport': ['volleyball', 'golf']}	True	10	False
Lv3-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The Russian is on the right of the person whose hobby is dancing.
2. The fan of folk is on the left of the social-worker.
3. The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
4. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing.

From clue 1, we know the Russian cannot be on the left since they must be to the right of someone whose hobby is dancing.


## Step 1: Determine the position based on nationality and hobby
Given that there are only two people (positions 1 and 2), and from clue 1, if the person whose hobby is dancing is in position 1, then the Russian must be in position 2. If dancing were in position 2, there would be no one to the left of the Russian for dancing to be on the left of, which contradicts the given conditions.


## Step 2: Apply clue 2 regarding music genre and job
The fan of folk is to the left of the social-worker. This means if the social-worker were in position 1, it would contradict this rule since there's no one to the left of them for folk to be on the left of. Thus, the social-worker must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Apply clue 3 regarding transport and movie genre
The person driving the van is to the left of the person watching horror movies. This means if horror movies are watched by the person in position 2 (which we've determined could be a possibility based on previous steps), then the van must be driven by the person in position 1.


## Step 4: Combine information from steps 1-3
From step 1, dancing is likely in position 1 because it allows for the Russian to be in position 2 as per clue 1. From step 2, since folk must be to the left of the social-worker and we've established that position 2 could be where the social-worker is (to accommodate the Russian), folk being on the left means the social-worker can't be in position 1 if they are associated with trance or another genre not mentioned directly in this clue. From step 3, since the van driver must be to the left of the horror movie fan and assuming horror could be in position 2 (which would fit with previous deductions about nationality and job), then the van is likely driven by whoever is in position 1.


## Step 5: Finalize positions based on all clues
- If dancing is in position 1, to satisfy clue 4, the goat owner must either be in position 1 or 2. Since we've established that position 1 could have dancing and thus potentially could also have other characteristics (like a specific pet), let's finalize based on direct information:
- Position 1: Dancing (hobby), Folk (music genre because it has to be to the left of the social-worker), Van (transport, as it must be to the left of horror movies), Goat (pet, satisfying clue 4 directly).
- Position 2: Writing (hobby, by elimination), Trance (music genre, by elimination since folk is taken), Horror (movie genre, because it's on the right and satisfies the van being on the left), Russian (nationality, from clue 1), Social-worker (job, as folk must be to its left), Mouse (pet, by elimination), Snowmobile (transport, by elimination).


The final answer is:

Lv3-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the dancer. This means the taxi driver and the dancer cannot be in the same column but must be adjacent.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Like clue 1, this indicates the rock climber and the soy-milk drinker are also adjacent.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the Argentine. This places the scooter driver next to someone from Argentina.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person eating lettuce. This clue gives us a specific orientation: scooter driver -> lettuce eater.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. This gives another specific orientation: ice hockey -> soy milk drinker.


## Step 6: Combine Clues to Determine Positions
From clue 4, we know the scooter driver must be on the left. If we combine this with clue 3, it suggests the Argentine could be in column 2 because the scooter is on the left (column 1), and from clue 5, we can start building a sequence.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions
Let's place the scooter driver in column 1 since they must be to the left of someone eating lettuce (clue 4). Given that the Argentine must be next to the scooter driver (clue 3) and assuming the scooter driver is not Argentine (since no information directly links them), we can tentatively place the Argentine in column 2.


## Step 8: Apply Remaining Clues
With clue 5, if soy-milk is on the right of ice-hockey, and considering our tentative placements, we start to see a pattern where each person's preferences can be matched with their neighbor's based on the given clues.


## Step 9: Determine Beverage Placement
Since there are only two beverages and from clue 5, we know soy-milk is to the right of ice-hockey. If we assume ice-hockey is associated with column 1 (to satisfy the left-right relationship), then soy-milk must be in column 2.


## Step 10: Final Placement
Given all clues, let's finalize:
- Column 1 (scooter driver) is on the left of lettuce eater (clue 4).
- Argentine is next to scooter driver (clue 3).
- Ice-hockey player is to the left of soy-milk drinker (clue 5).
Considering all relationships, we deduce:
- The dancer and taxi driver are adjacent (clue 1), which could fit below or above other combinations.
- Rock-climbing hobbyist is next to soy-milk drinker (clue 2).


## Step 11: Construct the Solution Table
Given the clues and steps, constructing a table that satisfies all conditions requires careful placement. However, without explicit step-by-step deductions for each category based on the given format, we infer:
- Scooter driver is in column 1.
- Argentine is likely in column 2 to be next to the scooter driver.
- Ice-hockey player is to the left of soy-milk drinker, suggesting ice-hockey could be in column 1 if soy-milk is in column 2.
- Lettuce eater must be in column 2 since the scooter driver (column 1) is to their left.

Lv3-7x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step to the table.


Given:
- 2 favourite beverages: almond-milk, juice
- 2 types of food: apricot, strawberry
- 2 hobbies: card-games, rock-climbing
- 2 music-genres: jazz, salsa
- 2 pets: goldfish, hedgehog
- 2 sports: cycling, water-polo
- 2 means of transport: tram, trike

Clues:
1. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.
2. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the trike.
3. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the fan of salsa.
4. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
5. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person eating strawberry.

Let's start filling in the table based on the clues:


From clue 1, we know the first column starts with almond-milk.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |
| Food          |               |            |
| Hobby         |               |            |
| Music-Genre   |               |            |

| Sport         |               |            |
| Transport     |               |            |

From clue 5, since card-games is on the right of strawberry, and considering the distribution of items, we can place strawberry in column 1 and card-games in column 2.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |

| Transport     |               |            |

From clue 2, the tram is on the right of the trike. Since we have a structure now, let's place the trike in column 1 and the tram in column 2.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |

| Sport         |               |            |
| Transport     | trike         | tram       |

From clue 4, the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is water-polo. Given our current setup, we can place water-polo in column 1.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |

| Sport         | water-polo   | cycling    |
| Transport     | trike         | tram       |

From clue 3, the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the fan of salsa. This means salsa must be in column 1, and since jazz is the only music genre left, it goes into column 2. The goldfish then belongs to column 2.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |

| Sport         | water-polo   | cycling    |
| Transport     | trike         | tram       |

The only hobby left is rock-climbing, which must go into column 1.


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | juice      |

Lv3-7x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each rule step by step.


From clue 3, we know the person drinking soy-milk is driving the subway. Given the table format, this means the second column (since it's specified as ""soy-"") corresponds with the subway for transport.


Clue 4 tells us the person eating peas has a hobby of traveling.


Clue 5 indicates the jet-ski user is to the left of the cooking hobbyist. Since there are only two columns, this means the jet-ski must be in column 1, and thus the subway (and soy-milk drinker) is in column 2.


From clue 2, we understand the thriller movie watcher is to the right of the soccer sport person. This implies the soccer person cannot be in the second column because there would be no one to their right for the thriller fan to be next to.


Clue 6 suggests the thriller watcher is near the rabbit owner, but since the rabbit can only be on the far left or far right (clue 1), and considering clue 2's implication that soccer (and thus potentially the rabbit if they align) must be on the left, we need to carefully place these elements.


Given all clues, let's start building:


- Column 1 has jet-ski (from clue 5).
- Column 2 has subway (from clue 3), soy-milk drinker.
- The person eating peas travels (clue 4).
- Soccer is on the left (implied from clue 2 and considering possible placements with other clues).


Let's fill in what we can based on these deductions:


|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      |           | soy-milk |
| Food          |           |          |
| Hobby         |           |          |
| Movie-Genre   |           |          |
| Pet           |           |          |
| Sport         | soccer    |          |
| Transport     | jet-ski   | subway   |


Now, let's place the thriller movie fan and the rabbit owner. Since the thriller fan must be to the right of the soccer person (clue 2), they go in column 2.


For pets, given clue 1 and that the rabbit can't be with the soy-milk drinker (because we don't have enough information to definitively place them together or apart based on pet ownership alone at this stage), let's consider the implications:


- If the rabbit is on the far left, it contradicts with our current understanding of placements unless the rabbit's owner also likes soccer and drinks milk. However, we must also consider the placement of other preferences.


Given clue 6 (thriller watcher near the rabbit owner) and knowing thriller is in column 2, let's adjust:


The person who watches drama could be on the left since we haven't placed drama yet, allowing the thriller fan to be on the right as required. The rabbit could then potentially align with either the left or right based on further clue analysis.


Considering clue 4 (traveling and peas), if traveling is in column 2 (because peas are likely opposite of apricots which we haven't directly placed yet), it would mean peas are in column 2, and thus apricots must be in column 1.


The hobby of cooking hasn't been placed but since the jet-ski user is to the left of the cooking hobbyist (clue 5), cooking must be in column 2.


Now, combining all these deductions:


- Column 1: Milk drinker, eats apricots, soccer, jet-ski, rabbit owner (based on clue 1 and the need for the rabbit to be on an end), drama movies (as it's the only genre left for this side), and the hobby of traveling doesn't fit here due to peas being in column 2.


- Column 2: Soy-milk drinker, eats peas, thriller movies, subway, cooking as a hobby (since jet-ski is to the left of cooking), and thus must own the pony to fulfill all pet conditions.


So, the final table looks like this:


#############

Lv3-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking cola. This means the sports movie fan cannot be in column 2 if the cola drinker is in column 2, but we don't know their exact positions yet.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The Brazilian is the person drinking iced-tea. Since there are only two beverages and the Brazilian drinks iced-tea, the other person must drink cola.


## Step 3: Use Clue 4
The person drinking cola is the person whose sport is handball. This links a beverage to a sport directly.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 2
The fan of pop is on the left or right of the videographer. This clue gives us a relationship between music genre and job but doesn't specify which side yet.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the firefighter. This clue helps us understand the transport and job relationship but does not give us exact positions without considering other clues.


## Step 6: Combine Information
From Clue 3, we know the Brazilian drinks iced-tea. From Clue 4, since the person drinking cola likes handball, and using Clue 1, which states the sports movie fan is on the left of the cola drinker, we can infer that if the cola drinker (handball fan) is in column 2, then the sports movie fan must be in column 1.


## Step 7: Further Deductions
Given the information and clues:
- The Brazilian drinks iced-tea (Clue 3).
- The person drinking cola likes handball (Clue 4), implying the other person (Brazilian) likes rugby since there are only two sports.
- Since the sports movie fan is on the left of the cola drinker (Clue 1), and if we assume the cola drinker is in column 2 (since we don't have enough info to place them directly from this clue alone but will use it to test consistency with other clues), then the sports movie fan must be in column 1.
- The skateboard user is on the left of the firefighter (Clue 5). This means if the firefighter were in column 2, the skateboard user would have to be in column 1.


## Step 8: Finalize Positions Based on Clues
Let's place the Brazilian in column 1 since they drink iced-tea (Clue 3), and we can deduce other preferences based on this placement:
- The Brazilian drinks iced-tea, so they cannot drink cola. This means the non-Brazilian (Russian) must drink cola.
- Since the person drinking cola likes handball (Clue 4), and assuming the sports movie fan is in column 1 (to be on the left of the cola drinker as per Clue 1), this would mean the Russian (in column 2, because they drink cola) likes handball and watches documentaries or another genre not specified directly by these clues but inferred through elimination.
- The skateboard user is on the left of the firefighter (Clue 5). Given our setup, if the Brazilian is in column 1 and drinks iced-tea, they could use the skateboard to fit this clue, placing the firefighter in column 2.


## Step 9: Resolve Remaining Preferences
Given that:
- The pop fan is on the left or right of the videographer (Clue 2), and assuming we place the videographer in a way that respects other clues.
- We have not directly placed jobs, music genres, or movie genres yet besides the sports movie clue.


## Step 10: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
1. The Brazilian is in column 1, drinks iced-tea, could be the skateboard user (to satisfy Clue 5 if we place the firefighter in column 2), and likes rugby.
2. The Russian is in column 2, drinks cola, likes handball, and could watch sports movies or documentaries based on earlier deductions but must fit the remaining clues.

Lv3-7x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The fan of techno is on the left of the Pakistani. This means the person who likes techno cannot be in column 2 if the Pakistani is in column 2, but since we don't know the position of the Pakistani yet, we'll keep this in mind for later.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person watching western movies is on the left of the person whose sport is rowing. This gives us a relationship between movie genre and sport but doesn't give us exact positions without more information.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person eating plum is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since we don't know the position of either yet, we'll have to wait for more clues to place these.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the skateboard is the security-guard. This gives us a direct link between transport and job but doesn't specify which column this person is in.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The Pakistani is the person driving the van. Now we know the nationality and transport method for one of the columns, and from clue 1, we can infer that the techno fan must be on the left since the Pakistani (van driver) cannot be on the left of themselves.


## Step 6: Combining Clues
Given the skateboard driver is a security guard (clue 4), and knowing the Pakistani drives a van (clue 5), if we place the Pakistani in column 2 (since they drive a van and clue 1 suggests techno fan is to their left), we can start building our table.


## Step 7: Placing the Skateboard Driver
Since the skateboard driver is a security guard, and considering clue 3 which links plum eater with skateboard driver's position, we need to decide where to place the skateboard driver. Clue 4 directly states this person is a security guard but doesn't specify the column.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions Based on Remaining Clues
Given that the Pakistani drives a van and must be in column 2 (based on clue 1 and the fact we need to place individuals according to the given restrictions), we can start filling in more details:
- The techno fan is on the left, so they are in column 1.
- The person watching western movies is on the left of the rower, which means if the rower is associated with the Pakistani (van driver in column 2), then the western movie watcher must be in column 1.


## Step 9: Completing the Table
Given all clues and deductions:
- Column 1 has a techno fan who watches animation (since western is ruled out by clue 2 for column 2's rower), eats avocado (because plum can't be directly associated without conflicting clues, and one food type per person), is a doctor (security guard is taken by skateboard driver), prefers basketball (since rowing is linked to column 2), and drives a skateboard.
- Column 2 has the Pakistani who drives a van, listens to R&B (techno is in column 1), watches western movies, eats plum, works as a security guard, and prefers rowing.


The final answer is:

Lv3-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


1. The owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
2. The person eating orange is the owner of the cat.
3. The person watching superhero movies is the lawyer.
4. The person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the dog.
5. The person whose sport is surfing is on the left of the person whose sport is cricket.
6. The analyst is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.


Given these clues, let's start filling in the table:


- From clue 3, we know the lawyer watches superhero movies.
- Clue 2 tells us the person eating orange owns a cat.
- Clue 5 indicates that surfing is to the left of cricket.
- Clue 4 says the trike is to the left of the dog.


Let's start with the most restrictive clues:


Since the lawyer watches superhero movies (clue 3), and given the options, we can start by placing ""superhero"" under Movie-Genre for one of the people. This person must be a lawyer.


Clue 2 directly links orange to the cat owner, but doesn't specify which column yet.


Clue 5 gives us a direct relationship between two sports: surfing and cricket, with surfing on the left.


Given clue 4 (trike to the left of dog) and clue 1 (dog near juice), we start seeing some restrictions on placement.


Let's place ""surfing"" under Sport for person 1 and ""cricket"" for person 2, based on clue 5. This gives us a starting point for sports.


Now, let's consider the jobs and beverages:


- The analyst must be near someone drinking iced-tea (clue 6).
- The lawyer watches superhero movies (clue 3).


Given these clues and knowing we have to place ""lawyer"" and ""analyst"", ""superhero"" and one other genre, ""surfing"" and ""cricket"", ""trike"" and ""snowmobile"", ""cat"" and ""dog"", ""orange"" and ""kale"", and ""juice"" and ""iced-tea"", let's try to fill in the table logically.


First, place surfing on the left (person 1) and cricket on the right (person 2), as per clue 5.


Next, since the trike must be to the left of the dog (clue 4), and considering the arrangement of sports, we can deduce that the dog's owner is more likely on the right side because if the dog were on the left, there would be no room for the trike to its left given our current placements.


Considering clue 2, orange is linked with the cat. Since the person eating orange owns a cat and this hasn't been directly placed yet, let's link it with the remaining options.


Clue 6 tells us the analyst is near iced-tea, but since we don't know if they drink it or not, let's consider their placement relative to other clues.


Given all these considerations and trying to fit all pieces together while respecting each clue:


The direct links are:
- Superhero movies with the lawyer (clue 3).
- Orange food with the cat owner (clue 2).
- Surfing to the left of cricket (clue 5).
- Trike to the left of the dog (clue 4), implying the dog is on the right since trike must precede it.


Let's finalize based on these direct clues and the process of elimination for the others:


Given clue 3, the lawyer watches superhero movies. Clue 2 links orange with the cat owner but doesn't specify which person yet.


If we consider clue 1 (dog near juice), clue 4 (trike left of dog), and knowing surfing must be on the left (clue 5), we can start to piece together the table, keeping in mind that each category has only two options and they must all fit according to the given clues.


Considering all clues together for a coherent solution:


Let's assume person 1 is associated with surfing (as it must be to the left of cricket) and thus could potentially own the cat since we don't have enough information yet to directly link any other category to them besides their sport. Person 2 would then be associated with cricket.


The lawyer watches superhero movies, so let's place ""superhero"" under Movie-Genre for person 2 (the lawyer), as this is a direct clue.


Since the analyst must be near someone drinking iced-tea and we have no direct link to their sport or transport yet, let's consider job placements. If person 2 is the lawyer, then person 1 must be the analyst to satisfy clue 6 indirectly by proximity.


Now, linking food with pets (clue 2), if orange is associated with the cat owner, and considering our current setup, we might initially think to place ""cat"" with person 1. However, this step requires careful consideration of all clues together.


Given that the dog's owner must be near juice (clue 1) and the trike is to the left of the dog (clue 4), if surfing is on the left (and thus potentially linked with the cat or another category not directly specified yet), we have a bit of a puzzle. The direct clue about the lawyer watching superhero movies gives us one fixed point.


If person 1 surfs and is an analyst, and considering clue 6 (analyst near iced-tea), let's tentatively place ""iced-tea"" with person 1, as this satisfies proximity without direct assignment.


Now, let's fill in what we can based on these deductions:


For the sport, we have surfing on the left and cricket on the right. For jobs, if person 2 is a lawyer (watching superhero movies), then person 1 could be an analyst.


Considering transport: since the trike must be to the left of the dog, and assuming the dog's owner drinks juice based on clue 1, we might place ""trike"" with person 1 (to satisfy being to the left of the dog) and thus ""snowmobile"" with person 2.


However, without direct clues linking every category to a specific person directly, the process involves deducing from given information:


- Person 1: surfing, analyst, iced-tea, trike (based on deductions).
- Person 2: cricket, lawyer, superhero movies, snowmobile (direct clue for job and movie genre).


For pets and food, given orange is linked with the cat owner (clue 2), if we place ""cat"" with person 1 (surfing, analyst), this could fit. Then ""dog"" goes with person 2, and since dog's owner is near juice (clue 1), we place ""juice"" with person 2.


Lastly, food: orange with cat (thus person 1), kale with dog (person 2).


This gives us a filled table based on logical deductions from the clues:


#############
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea |   juice    |

Lv3-7x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue and apply it to the table step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 5
From clue 5, we know the fan of disco is the person eating orange. This doesn't directly tell us which column the disco fan or the orange eater is in, but it links two categories.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 4
Clue 4 states the librarian is on the left of the person eating papaya. This means the person eating papaya cannot be in column 1 because there would be no one to the left of them for the librarian to be.


## Step 3: Determine Position of Papaya Eater and Librarian
Given clue 4, if the librarian is in column 1, the papaya eater must be in column 2. This setup satisfies the condition that the librarian is to the left of the papaya eater.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
Clue 3 states the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since we've established the papaya eater is in column 2, and given that clue 3 must be true, it means the quad-bike driver could potentially be in either column but must be adjacent to the papaya eater.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1
The owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon. This clue doesn't specify which column they are in relative to our current setup but gives us a relationship between two categories.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 2
The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person whose hobby is drawing. Similar to clue 1, this gives us another relationship without specifying columns directly.


## Step 7: Synthesize Information
Given the clues and steps above:
- The librarian (column 1) eats orange (from clue 5 and inference) because if the papaya eater were in column 2 and the librarian had to be to their left, it fits.
- The person eating papaya is in column 2.
- Since the disco fan eats orange and is likely the librarian based on our deductions, this places disco in column 1 as well.


## Step 8: Finalize Based on Clues
Given all clues:
- Column 1 has the librarian, eats orange, and likes disco.
- The papaya eater is in column 2.
- Since the quad-bike driver must be next to the papaya eater (clue 3), and considering other placements, we can start filling in based on adjacency requirements.


## Step 9: Apply Remaining Clues for Final Placement
Considering all relationships:
- If the chinchilla owner is to the left of the biathlon enthusiast, and given our setup, this likely places the biathlon enthusiast in column 2 (since the librarian is already determined to be in column 1).
- The hedgehog owner being to the right of the drawing hobbyist suggests that if the drawing hobbyist were in column 1, it would conflict with other placements based on the directionality given.


## Step 10: Complete Table
Based on all deductions:
|               |     1      |      2       |

Lv3-7x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


From clue 1 and 2, we know the person on the far right enjoys rock-climbing and is an electrician.

Clue 3 tells us the electrician owns a pony.

Clue 4 indicates the scooter driver is to the left of the climber.

Clue 5 places the carrot eater to the right of the funk fan.

Clue 6 suggests the pony owner is on either far left or far right, but since the electrician (who owns the pony) is already determined to be on the far right, this clue doesn't add new information.


Given these clues:


- The electrician (far right) has a pony and enjoys rock-climbing.
- Since the person on the far right is the electrician and also enjoys rock-climbing, and given that the scooter driver must be to the left of the climber (clue 4), it means climbing as a sport cannot be associated with the electrician/rock-climber because there would be no one to their left. Thus, golf must be associated with the electrician/rock-climber.
- The person on the far right is an electrician and enjoys rock-climbing, meaning they also like gospel music (since funk's fan has someone eating carrot to their right, placing funk and its opposite, which we don't know yet but can deduce by elimination, in a particular order).
- Given that the scooter driver must be to the left of the climber, if rock-climbing is on the far right with the electrician, then climbing as a sport (not hobby) cannot be associated with this person because there's no one to their left. So, golf and funk/gospel are associated with the electrician/rock-climber, but we must determine which music genre goes where.
- Since the carrot eater is to the right of the funk fan (clue 5), and considering the rock-climbing/electrician/pony owner is already on the far right, it implies the person who eats cucumber must be associated with funk because if funk were on the right, there'd be no one to its right for carrot to satisfy clue 5. Therefore, cucumber goes with funk.
- This leaves carrot to go with gospel (as per clue 5 and deduction), meaning the electrician/rock-climber (golf) cannot have carrot but must have cucumber based on our deductions so far, which is incorrect given the previous step's implication that we should associate carrot with the rightmost person due to the arrangement of funk and its fan. Let's correct this: The rock-climbing/electrician/pony owner/golf enthusiast (far right) listens to gospel (since they can't listen to funk because the carrot eater is to the right of the funk fan, and the only position left for such an arrangement considering other clues is having funk on the left).
- Therefore, cucumber must be associated with funk (on the left), and carrot with gospel (on the right).
- The person who likes video-games must then drive a jet-ski since the scooter driver is to the left of the climber.
- And finally, since the electrician/rock-climber has a pony, the other pet (cat) goes to the person on the left.


So, summarizing all associations:


|               |      1      |       2       |
