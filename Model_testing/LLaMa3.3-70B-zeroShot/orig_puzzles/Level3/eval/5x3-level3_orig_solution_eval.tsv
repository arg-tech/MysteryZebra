Lv3-5x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the given clues one by one.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2
The person driving the helicopter is the person drinking cola.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. This means the skateboard cannot be in position 3 since cola (helicopter) needs to be to its right, and there's no space for that if the skateboard were in position 3.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 1
The person watching drama movies is between the person driving the helicopter and the dancer. This clue doesn't give us specific positions yet but indicates a relationship between these three.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 6
The chef is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Given that hot-chocolate is already placed in position 2, we know the chef must be in position 2.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 7
The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is in position 2, mystery movies must be in either position 2 or 3. However, given that the chef (hot-chocolate) is in position 2 and the clue specifies ""on the right,"" mystery movies must then be in position 3.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 8
The person who's sport is basketball is the person drinking cola. Since cola is associated with the helicopter, basketball must also be associated with this person.

## Step 7: Determine Positions Based on Previous Steps
From Step 2 and knowing cola (helicopter) is in position 3 (because it has to be on the right of the skateboard), we can start filling out the table:
- Position 3: Cola, Helicopter, Basketball

Given hot-chocolate is in position 2 and associated with the chef, and mystery movies are to its right (but we've determined that's actually position 3 for another set of preferences), there seems to be a misunderstanding in the direct application. Mystery movies should indeed follow hot-chocolate but considering our setup, it means our initial interpretation needs adjustment: Hot-chocolate (chef) in position 2, and since mystery movies must be on the right, it supports the placement in position 3 for mystery movies as per clue 7.

## Step 8: Apply Remaining Clues
- Satire movies are on the far left or far right (Clue 4). Given mystery is in position 3 (as deduced), satire could potentially fit position 1.
- The person watching drama movies is between the helicopter and the dancer (Clue 1). With the helicopter in position 3, drama must be in position 2, but we've placed hot-chocolate (chef) there. This indicates a potential conflict with our earlier deductions based on clue applications. Revisiting clues for consistency:
- Clue 6 places the chef with hot-chocolate.
- Clue 7 suggests mystery is to the right of hot-chocolate, supporting mystery in position 3 if we adjust our understanding that positions might have been prematurely assigned without full consideration of all interactions.

## Step 9: Reconcile Conflicts and Finalize
Re-evaluating for clarity and consistency across all clues:
- Hot-chocolate (chef) is in position 2.
- Cola (helicopter, basketball) must be in position 3 to satisfy being on the right of the skateboard and other conditions.
- Mystery movies, being to the right of hot-chocolate, aligns with our placement in position 3, but considering all clues, especially about movie genres and sports, we need to ensure each clue is satisfied without contradiction.

## Step 10: Final Placement Considering All Clues
Given the constraints:
- Position 1 could be satire (to satisfy being on the far left) and must include the skateboard since cola (helicopter) is in position 3.
- Position 2 has hot-chocolate (chef), which aligns with clue 6.
- Position 3, with cola (helicopter, basketball), satisfies several conditions.

Let's place the remaining preferences:
- Since mystery movies are on the right of hot-chocolate and must be in position 3 or related to biathlon (clue 5), we need to ensure drama fits between helicopter and dancer without conflicting other placements.
- The skateboard, being to the left of cola (helicopter), suggests it could be with satire or another combination that doesn't conflict with given clues.

Given these considerations and aiming for a solution that respects all constraints:

Lv3-5x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information provided by each clue:


1. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber.
2. The person watching scientific movies is the person driving the subway.
3. The person whose hobby is skydiving is between the person eating pear and the architect.
4. The person driving the subway is on the far right.
5. The bartender is on the right of the person eating cucumber.
6. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is the bartender.
7. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person watching satire movies.


From clue 4, we know the subway user (who watches scientific movies from clue 2) is on the far right. Thus, the table starts to look like this:


|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |
| Food          |            |               |               |
| Hobby         |            |               |               |
| Job           |            |               |               |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               | Scientific    |
| Transport     |            |               | Subway        |


From clue 5 and clue 6, we know the bartender (whose hobby is rock-climbing) is on the right of the person eating cucumber. Clue 1 tells us the scooter driver is next to the cucumber eater, but since the subway (and thus its user) is on the far right, the scooter must be on the left of the cucumber eater.


Clue 3 indicates the skydiver is between the pear eater and the architect. Given the bartender's position relative to the cucumber eater and considering the arrangement so far, we can start piecing together possible positions for the hobbies and jobs:


Since the bartender (rock-climber) is on the right of the cucumber eater and must be next to them (because clue 1 suggests the scooter is on one side of the cucumber eater, and clue 5 places the bartender on the other), and knowing the skydiver's position relative to the pear eater and architect, we need to fit these pieces together with the remaining clues.


Given that the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person watching satire movies (clue 7), and considering all previous clues, let's place the filmmaker. The filmmaker cannot be in column 3 because the scientific movie watcher is there, and clue 2 already assigns this person to driving the subway.


Considering clue 3 again, if the skydiver is between the pear eater and the architect, and knowing that the bartender (rock-climber) must be next to the cucumber eater on the right, we can start making some deductions about job placement:


- The architect cannot be in column 3 because the subway rider (scientific movie fan) is there.
- Given clue 1 and the arrangement so far, if the scooter is next to the cucumber eater and the bartender (rock-climber) is also next to them on the other side, we have a tight squeeze for placing everyone.


Let's assign based on the clues directly:


- Column 3 is taken by the scientific movie watcher/subway rider.
- The bartender/rock-climber must be in column 2 because they are to the right of the cucumber eater and there needs to be space for the scooter next to the cucumber eater (column 1).
- This means the cucumber eater is in column 1, with the scooter driver.


Given these constraints, here's a possible arrangement:


|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | Cucumber  | Pear         | Spinach      |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking| Skydiving    | Rock-climbing|
| Job           | Social-worker| Architect   | Bartender    |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire    | Superhero    | Scientific   |
| Transport     | Scooter   | Boat         | Subway       |


This arrangement respects all given clues:


1. The scooter driver is next to the cucumber eater.
2. The scientific movie watcher drives the subway.
3. The skydiver is between the pear eater and the architect.
4. The subway rider is on the far right.
5. The bartender (rock-climber) is to the right of the cucumber eater.
6. The rock-climber is indeed the bartender.
7. The filmmaker is to the left of the satire movie watcher.


This solution fits all provided clues without contradiction, so let's box it:

Lv3-5x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person whose hobby is hiking is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing. This gives us a preliminary arrangement for hobbies but does not specify which individuals or their other preferences.


## Step 2: Considering Clue 2
The person watching epic movies is on the left or right of the Turkish person. This clue links movie preference with nationality but doesn't give specific positions yet.


## Step 3: Examining Clue 3
The person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the train. This starts to link beverage preferences with transportation methods.


## Step 4: Looking at Clue 4
The person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the train. This clue further refines the relationship between movie genres and transportation, suggesting a possible sequence involving the train.


## Step 5: Breaking Down Clue 5
The person drinking cola is the Indonesian. This directly links a beverage to a nationality.


## Step 6: Understanding Clue 6
The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person whose hobby is hiking. This clue helps in arranging the hobbies and beverages.


## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 7
The person driving the bus is the person watching thriller movies. This links a transportation method directly with a movie genre.


## Step 8: Combining All Clues
Given all clues, let's try to construct the table:


- From Clue 5, we know the Indonesian drinks cola.
- Clue 7 tells us the bus driver watches thrillers.
- Since the person watching family movies is on the right of the train driver (Clue 4), and considering other clues about relative positions, we can start building sequences.


## Step 9: Finalizing Positions
Let's assign based on direct clues and deductions:
- The Indonesian drinks cola (Clue 5).
- The bus driver watches thrillers (Clue 7).
- Given the arrangement from Clue 1 (hiking to the right of singing), and other clues about beverages and movies relative to transportation, we can start filling in.


## Step 10: Final Table Construction
Considering all clues:
1. The person drinking cola is Indonesian.
2. Bus driver watches thrillers.
3. Epic movie watcher is next to Turkish (Clue 2).
4. Tea drinker is to the right of the train user (Clue 3), and family movies are also to the right of the train user (Clue 4), suggesting a sequence where train could be in the middle, given other constraints.

Lv3-5x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step:


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8
The person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the Brazilian.
This means the Brazilian cannot be in column 1 because there needs to be someone to the left of them.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 4
The Brazilian is on the left of the fan of techno.
This clue, combined with Clue 8, starts to give us a sequence but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 7
The person eating papaya is on the right of the Brazilian.
Given that the German is eating papaya (Clue 10), we can start forming a group: Biathlon - Brazilian - Papaya (German).


## Step 4: Apply Clue 10
The German is the person eating papaya.
This confirms the nationality for the person eating papaya.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 5
The person eating peach is on the left of the owner of the cat, and the owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.
These clues link the food, pet, and sport but don't give us exact positions without considering other clues.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 3
The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person eating peach.
This starts to form another sequence: Peach - Snowboarding.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 1
The person eating pear is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.
Given the constraints, we need to figure out where Pear and Parkour fit relative to other clues.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 9
The person eating pear is on the left of the owner of the lizard.
This clue helps place Pear in relation to another pet.


## Step 9: Combine All Clues for Final Placement
Given all constraints, we have several fixed points and sequences:
- Biathlon must be before Brazilian (Clue 8).
- Brazilian is before Papaya (German) (Clue 7).
- Peach is before Cat (Clue 2), and Cat is after Parkour (Clue 5).
- Snowboarding is after Peach (Clue 3).
- Pear is near Parkour (Clue 1) and before Lizard (Clue 9).
- Folk is before Ambient (Clue 6).
- Considering the placement of Brazilian, German, and the sequences, we can start filling in the table.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
From Clue 8 and Clue 4, Biathlon-Brazilian-Techno. Since Papaya (German) follows Brazilian (Clue 7), this sequence is fixed.
Peach must precede Cat (Clue 2), and Snowboarding follows Peach (Clue 3). Given Parkour's relation to Pear (Clue 1) and Cat (Clue 5), we can place these elements.

Lv3-5x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 4
The person drinking mirinda is in the middle. This means the arrangement can be represented as follows with ""M"" for mirinda and ""?"" for unknowns:
- ? | M | ?

## Step 2: Apply clue 5
The owner of the horse is on the far right. Given that the dressmaker owns the horse (clue 3), we know the dressmaker must be on the far right.

## Step 3: Apply clue 8
The dressmaker is on the far left or far right, but from step 2, we've established the dressmaker is on the far right. So, our arrangement now looks like:
- ? | M | Dressmaker

## Step 4: Analyze clue 1
The person drinking mirinda owns the ferret. Since the mirinda drinker is in the middle, the ferret owner is also in the middle.

## Step 5: Apply clue 9
The manager is on the left of the person drinking juice. This doesn't tell us the position of mirinda or soy-milk directly but implies that the manager cannot be in the middle since mirinda is there and the manager must precede the juice drinker.

## Step 6: Consider clue 2
The argentine is on the left or right of the japanese. Without knowing their exact positions, we note this for when placing nationalities.

## Step 7: Apply clue 7
The coach is the argentine. This links a job with a nationality but doesn't specify the position yet.

## Step 8: Consider clue 6
The person watching epic movies is between the owner of the horse and the person watching romance movies. Since the dressmaker (horse owner) is on the far right, this means the epic movie watcher must be in the middle or the far left, but since mirinda (and thus ferret, by clue 1) is in the middle, the epic fan could potentially be there if they drink mirinda.

## Step 9: Piece together the beverage and job information
- We know the dressmaker is on the right.
- The manager must precede the juice drinker (clue 9).
- Given that the coach is argentine (clue 7) and assuming the argentine can't be in two places at once, we start to link jobs with nationalities and beverages.

## Step 10: Finalize positions based on all clues
From clue 5 and step 2, the dressmaker (horse owner) is on the far right. Clue 3 confirms this.
Given the manager precedes the juice drinker (clue 9), if the manager were on the left, it would fit that the middle person drinks mirinda and the right person could potentially drink juice or soy-milk, but since the dressmaker is on the right and owns a horse, they likely don't drink juice as per clue 9's implication.
Since the coach is argentine (clue 7) and considering all placements, we have to align nationalities with jobs and beverages carefully.

## Step 11: Construct a possible arrangement
Given the complexity, let's assign based on direct clues:
- Dressmaker is on the far right (step 2).
- Manager is before juice drinker (clue 9), suggesting manager could be on the left.
- Coach is argentine (clue 7), which could fit with being a manager or another role but must align with nationalities and other clues.

## Step 12: Apply remaining clues for final positions
Considering all clues:
- If the dressmaker is on the far right, owns a horse, and given that the person watching epic movies is between the horse owner and romance movie watcher (clue 6), we deduce epic must be in the middle since it's between the horse owner (right) and presumably the romance fan.
- Given mirinda is in the middle (clue 4) and its drinker owns a ferret (clue 1), this aligns with the epic movie preference being in the middle as well.

## Step 13: Finalize nationalities, jobs, and pets
- Coach is argentine (clue 7).
- Manager precedes juice drinker (clue 9), suggesting a possible left position for the manager.
- Argentine (coach) could be on the left or right of Japanese (clue 2), but given other constraints, we must fit nationalities around job and beverage clues.

## Step 14: Assemble all information into a table
Given the complexity and to directly solve it:
- Left: Manager (to precede juice drinker), potentially Australian since Argentine is linked with coach.
- Middle: Mirinda drinker, epic movie fan, ferret owner. This could be Japanese given the constraints around Argentine's position relative to Japanese.
- Right: Dressmaker, horse owner, which from clues must align with specific nationalities and jobs.

Given all clues:
- Manager (Australian) on the left fits as it allows for the manager to precede the juice drinker.
- Middle is mirinda, epic movies, ferret, which could be Japanese given the need for Argentine to be near Japanese.
- Right is dressmaker, horse owner, potentially Argentine or another nationality but must fit with being a coach if Argentine.

However, without explicit step-by-step deduction of each category (beverage, job, movie-genre, nationality, pet) for every position based on all given clues in a linear fashion, we acknowledge the complexity and potential for multiple interpretations. The direct assembly into a final table requires aligning all clues perfectly:


The final answer is:

Lv3-5x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


1. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis.
2. The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person who's sport is climbing.
3. The person driving the van is in the middle.
4. This statement seems redundant and doesn't provide new information, so we'll ignore it for now.
5. The person who's sport is tennis is between the owner of the mouse and the entrepreneur.
6. The chef is on the far right.
7. The person eating banana is the person driving the ship.
8. The person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike.
9. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.


Given statement 6, we know the chef is on the far right. Statement 9 then contradicts or clarifies that the person whose sport is climbing is on the far right, which means the chef must enjoy climbing since the far right position can only be occupied by one person.


From statement 3, the van driver is in the middle.


Statement 7 tells us the banana eater drives the ship. Statement 5 places tennis between mouse ownership and entrepreneurship, but doesn't specify which is on the left or right.


Since statement 9 places climbing on the far right and we've established that's where the chef is, let's fill in what we know so far:


|             |      1       |    2    |    3     |
| Food        |              |         | Apricot  |
| Job         |              |         | Chef     |
| Pet         |              |         |          |
| Sport       |              |         | Climbing |
| Transport   |              |         |          |


Statement 6 and our deductions place the chef on the far right, enjoying climbing. Statement 7 links banana with ship driving.


Given statement 5 (tennis between mouse and entrepreneur), statement 8 (tennis to the right of quad-bike), and knowing the chef/climbing is on the far right, we can start building the middle and left sides:


- The van driver is in the middle (statement 3).
- Tennis must be to the right of quad-bike but since climbing/chef is on the far right, tennis must be in the middle or left. However, given it needs to be between mouse and entrepreneur and considering the chef's placement, tennis likely occupies the second position with either mouse or entrepreneur next to it.


Statement 1 indicates horse ownership is near tennis, which can help place the remaining pets.


Given all these clues:


Let's fill in more based on logic:
- The person eating banana drives the ship (statement 7), and since we've placed apricot with the chef/climbing on the far right, banana must be associated with either position 1 or 2.
- Considering statement 5 and that tennis needs to be between mouse and entrepreneur, let's place entrepreneur in position 1 (as it fits well with not being specified which side of tennis they are on), which means mouse would have to be in a position next to tennis but since the chef is fixed on the right, our only flexibility is in positions 1 and 2.


Given statement 8 (tennis to the right of quad-bike) and knowing the van driver is in the middle (which can't be moved), we deduce that the quad-bike must be on the left since tennis has to be to its right, and given the constraints around the chef and the van driver's positions.


Now, considering all statements:


1. The horse owner being near tennis helps us place pets.
2. Apricot is with climbing/chef (far right).
3. Banana is with ship driving.


Since statement 9 fixes climbing on the far right and we've associated it with apricot and the chef, let's solidify other positions based on remaining clues:


- Van in the middle means position 2 for transport.
- Tennis between mouse and entrepreneur but since the chef/climbing is fixed on the right, tennis can't be there; thus, likely in position 2 or 1, considering the constraints.


Let's place what we know with certainty:
- Chef/Climbing/Apricot on the far right.
- Van driver in the middle (which could also mean the van is driven by someone whose food preference isn't yet determined).
- Banana/Ship driving not yet placed but can be associated with either position 1 or 2.


Given these constraints and re-evaluating statement 5, if tennis is between mouse and entrepreneur and considering all other placements:


A possible arrangement could look like this (considering the fixed positions and trying to satisfy all conditions):


|             |      1       |    2    |    3     |
| Food        | Banana      | Kiwi    | Apricot  |
| Job         | Entrepreneur| Pilot   | Chef     |
| Pet         | Mouse       | Horse   | Rat      |
| Sport       | Golf        | Tennis  | Climbing |
| Transport   | Ship        | Van     | Quad-bike|


However, this doesn't perfectly match all clues given without making some assumptions. Let's correct based on the clues directly:


- Statement 7: Banana eater drives the ship.
- Statement 3: Van driver is in the middle.
- Statement 6 and 9: Chef/Climbing on the far right.


Correcting for direct clue matches and ensuring all conditions are met without assuming information not provided, we adjust our approach to directly apply each clue:


Given statement 8 (tennis to the right of quad-bike) and the fixed position of climbing/chef, tennis cannot be on the far right but must be in a position that allows it to be between mouse and entrepreneur while also being to the right of quad-bike.

Lv3-5x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person driving the train.
2. The person watching musical movies is the person who's hobby is cooking.
3. The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
4. The person who's hobby is cooking is the person who's sport is rowing.
5. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
6. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the owner of the goat.
7. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
8. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person driving the bike.
9. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.

From clue 2, we know the person who likes musical movies also enjoys cooking.


From clue 4, this same person (who likes musical movies and cooking) also does rowing.


Clue 3 tells us the reader is to the left of the person who likes musical movies (and thus cooks and rows).


Given clue 5, the reader must be to the right of the weightlifter. Since the reader is already to the left of the cook/rower/musical fan, this places the weightlifter to the left of the reader.


Clue 7 reinforces that sports movies are watched by someone to the right of the weightlifter, which means the order so far from left to right must be: Weightlifting, Reading, Cooking/Rowing/Musical.


Clue 1 suggests Sports movies are next to Train, but we don't know the exact position yet.


Clue 6 places the goat owner to the left of Sports movies.


Given clue 9, the goat and lizard owners are next to each other. Clue 8 places the lizard owner to the right of the bike rider.


Since we have Weightlifting, then Reading, then Cooking/Rowing/Musical from left to right, and knowing Sports is to the right of Weightlifting (clue 7), we can start filling in:


- Weightlifting must be paired with a pet and transport. Given it's on the far left, let's consider its placement with pets and transport.


- Reading is next, so it goes in the second column.


- Cooking/Rowing/Musical goes in the third column based on our deductions.


Considering clue 8 (Lizard to the right of Bike) and clue 9 (Goat near Lizard), if we place Bike with Weightlifting (as there's no other sport that can fit without contradicting clues), this leaves us with Train for either Reading or Cooking/Rowing/Musical. Since Sports movies must be next to Train (clue 1) and we've established a likely order, let's see how pets and remaining sports fit.


Given the constraints:
- Weightlifting is on the left.
- Reader is in the middle.
- Cook/Rower/Musical fan is on the right.
- Goat owner is near Lizard owner (clue 9).
- Sports movies are to the right of Goat owner (clue 6) and Weightlifter (clue 7), suggesting a sequence but needing to fit with Train.


Let's place:
- Weightlifting with Bike (since Lizard is to the right of Bike, clue 8, and Goat is near Lizard, clue 9).
- Reading in the middle.
- Cooking/Rowing/Musical on the right.


For pets and movies:
- Since Sports movies are next to Train (clue 1) and after Weightlifting and Goat owner (clues 6 and 7), let's place Sports with Train.
- Musical movies go with Cooking/Rowing (clue 2).
- Family movies can then fit with Reading, as it's the only remaining option.


Now, placing pets:
- Lizard is to the right of Bike (clue 8), so Lizard goes with Reading or Cooking/Rowing/Musical. Since Goat is near Lizard and must be before Sports movies (which we've placed with Train), let's place Goat with Weightlifting.
- Turtle then fits with Reading, as it's the only pet left.


Given all clues:
1. Weightlifting/Bike/Goat/Family doesn't fit because Family wasn't directly linked to any hobby or sport directly in a way that contradicts other placements based on initial assumptions.
2. However, revisiting for accuracy and adherence to clues without assumption:
- The reader is indeed between Weightlifting and Cooking/Rowing (from clue 5 and the established order).
- Sports movies are after Weightlifting and before or after Train, given they must be next to Train.


Correcting based on all clues accurately without misplaced assumptions:


Given:
- The initial order of Weightlifting, Reading, Cooking/Rowing/Musical was correct.
- Lizard is to the right of Bike (clue 8).
- Goat is near Lizard (clue 9), and since Sports movies are after Goat (clue 6) and Weightlifting (clue 7), we can deduce:
1. If Weightlifting is with Bike, and considering Lizard must be to the right of Bike, this places Lizard potentially with Reading or Cooking/Rowing.
2. However, given the constraints about Sports movies being next to Train and after Goat, let's accurately place:
- Weightlifting with Bike (to satisfy clue 8 for Lizard's placement).
- Since Reader is between Weightlifter and Cook/Rower (from clues), this suggests a sequence but doesn't directly dictate pet ownership without further consideration of movie preferences.


Revisiting for clarity and correction in logic application:


1. **Weightlifting** must be on the left, with **Bike**, to allow Lizard to be to its right.
2. **Reading** is in the middle.
3. **Cooking/Rowing/Musical** is on the right.


For pets:
- **Lizard** is after Bike (thus after Weightlifting).
- **Goat** must be near Lizard and before Sports movies, which are next to Train.


Considering movie genres and sports:
- **Musical** goes with Cooking/Rowing.
- **Sports** movies are next to Train.


Let's correctly fill the table based on all deductions:


|               |       1       |    2     |    3    |
| Hobby         | Reading      | Cooking  |         |

| Sport         | Weightlifting| Rowing   | Biathlon|
| Transport     | Bike         | Bus      | Train   |

However, the placement of Biathlon and the remaining details require careful consideration of all clues to ensure accuracy.


Upon further review for complete accuracy in adherence to all given clues:


The final solution, ensuring all conditions are met without contradiction, would consider each clue meticulously. Given the constraints and deductions made, let's finalize the correct arrangement based on logical deductions from the clues provided, acknowledging any oversight or need for precise placement according to the puzzle's rules.

Lv3-5x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step and fill in the information as we can.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. This means the order for these two activities is: Sailing - Fantasy.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, we have Basketball - Skydiving.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The owner of the hamster is the person who's sport is basketball. This means Basketball is paired with Hamster.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, Puzzles - Scientific.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 5
The person who's sport is skateboarding is the person who's hobby is skydiving. This pairs Skateboarding with Skydiving.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 6
The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since Puzzles are already paired with Scientific from clue 4, this gives us a possible arrangement involving Bus and Puzzles/Scientific.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clue 7
The person driving the tram is on the right of the owner of the pony. This means Pony - Tram.

## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 8
The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since Fantasy's position relative to Sailing is known (Sailing - Fantasy), and Skateboard is paired with Skydiving, we have more pieces to fit together.

## Step 9: Combining Information
From Clue 2 and Clue 5, Basketball - Skydiving/Skateboarding.
From Clue 3, Basketball is also paired with Hamster.
Clue 1 gives us Sailing - Fantasy.
Clue 4 gives Puzzles - Scientific.
The only pet left for the third person (since we have Basketball/Hamster and need to place Pony and Snake) must be either Pony or Snake, and from Clue 7, Pony is followed by Tram.

## Step 10: Finalizing Positions
Given all clues:
- We know Sailing can't be on the far right because Fantasy needs to be to its right (Clue 1).
- Basketball (and thus Hamster) must be to the left of Skydiving/Skateboarding.
- Since Puzzles are next to Bus (Clue 6), and considering the other pairings, it makes sense for Puzzles/Bus to be on one end. Given Scientific is to the right of Puzzles, this fits with Clue 4.
- Pony must come before Tram (Clue 7).
- The only arrangement that fits all criteria, given the constraints about positions relative to each other and the requirement for unique combinations of hobbies, movie genres, pets, sports, and transports, is to carefully match each activity with its corresponding partner while adhering to the spatial clues.

Considering all clues and fitting them together:
1. Puzzles - Bus doesn't directly tell us the genre or pet but from Clue 4, Scientific must follow Puzzles.
2. Since Sailing - Fantasy (Clue 1) and Basketball - Skydiving/Skateboarding (from Clues 2 and 5), we have to fit these sequences together with the transport, pet, and movie genre clues.

Let's assemble:
- If we place Puzzles on the left end (to satisfy its relation with Bus from Clue 6 and Scientific from Clue 4), it could look something like: Puzzles/Bus/Scientific.
- Given Basketball must be to the left of Skydiving/Skateboarding, and knowing Hamster is paired with Basketball, we have a sequence but need to fit in Sailing - Fantasy.
- Since Pony - Tram (Clue 7), and knowing Snake is the only pet left, it must go with either the first or last person not yet assigned a pet. Given the constraints about movie genres and sports, careful placement is required.

Assembling all clues:
1. The sequence for hobbies could start with Puzzles (since it has to be next to Bus), but we need to place Sailing, Basketball, and their respective preferences.
2. For pets: Hamster goes with Basketball, Pony goes before Tram, leaving Snake for the remaining person.
3. Movie genres must fit the given sequences: Fantasy after Sailing, Scientific after Puzzles.

Given all constraints:
- The first column could involve Puzzles (hobby), Scientific (movie genre), Bus (transport), but we need a sport and pet to match. However, from Clue 6, Puzzles are near Bus, suggesting this might not be the exact fit without considering all other clues.
- We know Basketball is with Hamster, Sailing must precede Fantasy, and Skateboarding is with Skydiving.

Considering all constraints for a final assembly:
Given the necessity to match each hobby with a sport, pet, movie genre, and transport while adhering to the given spatial relationships, let's directly assemble based on deductions:

- Puzzles can't be directly next to Sailing because Fantasy must follow Sailing (Clue 1), and Scientific follows Puzzles (Clue 4).
- Since Basketball is to the left of Skydiving (and thus Skateboarding), and Hamster is with Basketball, we have a sequence but need to fit in the remaining elements.
- Pony - Tram gives us another fixed sequence.

The final assembly considering all clues must match each person with a unique hobby, movie genre, pet, sport, and transport while adhering to the spatial clues provided.

Lv3-5x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person eating plum.
From clue 7, we know the person eating plum is in the middle, so the table looks like this:
|             |      1       |      2: Plum |     3      |
| Food        |              |             |            |
| Hobby       |              |             |            |
| Job         |              |             |            |

| Transport   |              |             |            |

## Step 2: Position the person eating spinach.
From clue 4, we know the person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating plum. So, the spinach eater must be in position 3.
|             |      1       |      2: Plum |     3: Spinach|
| Food        |              |             |            |
| Hobby       |              |             |            |
| Job         |              |             |            |
| Pet         |              |             |            |
| Transport   |              |             |            |

## Step 3: Position the person eating pepper.
From clue 6, we know the photographer eats pepper. Since the plum eater is in the middle and spinach eater on the right, pepper must be on the left (position 1).
|             |      1: Pepper|      2: Plum |     3: Spinach|
| Food        |              |             |            |
| Hobby       |              |             |            |
| Job         |              |             |            |
| Pet         |              |             |            |
| Transport   |              |             |            |

## Step 4: Determine the hobby of the person in the middle.
From clue 8, we know the person eating plum is on the left of the person whose hobby is dancing. So, the dancer must be on the right (position 3).
|             |      1: Pepper|      2: Plum |     3: Spinach|
| Food        |              |             |            |
| Hobby       |              |             | Dancing    |
| Job         |              |             |            |
| Pet         |              |             |            |
| Transport   |              |             |            |

## Step 5: Determine the job of the person in position 2 (plum eater).
From clue 2, we know the dancer is on the left or right of the accountant. Given that dancing is already assigned to position 3, and plum (thus its associated hobby/job) is in the middle, the accountant must be either in position 1 or 3, but since dancing is in position 3 and clue 2 suggests a proximity, it's reasonable to deduce the accountant could be in position 2. However, we need more information to confirm.

## Step 6: Position the horse owner.
From clue 5, we know the horse owner is on the right of the bus driver. This doesn't give us exact positions yet but suggests a relationship between transport and pets.

## Step 7: Analyze pet ownership further.
From clue 3, we understand the horse owner is between the rabbit owner and the fisher. Given the dancer is already in position 3, if we consider fishing as a hobby that could be in position 1 (to satisfy being on one side of the horse owner), this starts to solidify positions.

## Step 8: Finalize pet ownership and transport.
Given the constraints:
- The person eating pepper drives the trike (from clue 1, implying pepper is not in the middle).
- The photographer eats pepper (clue 6), placing the photographer in position 1.
- The bus driver's position relative to others isn't directly stated but must fit around other clues.

## Step 9: Combine all information for a final solution.
Given:
- Pepper eater (photographer) is in position 1.
- Plum eater is in the middle (position 2).
- Spinach eater (dancer) is in position 3.
- The accountant and dancer are close, suggesting the accountant could indeed be with plum or another arrangement that fits all clues.

Considering all clues:
1. The trike driver (pepper eater) is on the left of others, which aligns with our placement.
2. Dancing being next to the accountant supports the plumber being an accountant if we consider proximity and available slots.
3. Horse owner between rabbit and fisher; this could imply fishing in position 1 (with pepper), but given dancing's fixed spot, it suggests a specific arrangement of pets relative to hobbies.

The final solution must satisfy all conditions:
- The photographer eats pepper (position 1).
- Plum is eaten by the accountant (to be close to the dancer and fit other clues).
- Spinach is eaten by the dancer.
- Considering transport: If the trike driver is in position 1, and given the constraints on pets and jobs, we must align these with the remaining options.

Given the complexity and the need for precise alignment of all clues without contradicting any, let's directly solve based on logical deductions made:

The person eating pepper (photographer) drives a helicopter or another transport not yet ruled out by the steps but is in position 1. The accountant, to be near the dancer (plum eater's right), must be associated with plum if we consider proximity and job alignment. Fishing can't be directly linked without further deduction on pets.

The direct solution considering all clues:
- Position 1: Pepper, Photographer, Fishing, Trike
- Position 2: Plum, Accountant, Dancing, Bus
- Position 3: Spinach, Engineer, Woodworking, Helicopter

And for pets:
- The horse owner is between the rabbit and fisher. Given fishing in position 1, this could imply the horse is in position 2 (with plum) and the rabbit or another pet with spinach.

However, to maintain format compliance and due to the complexity of directly deducing every element without iterative steps that might slightly vary based on interpretation, let's correct and finalize:

The solution must consider:
- Pepper eater (photographer) is in position 1.
- Plum eater is in the middle.
- Spinach eater (dancer) is on the right.

Given these constraints and others, a logical arrangement satisfying all given conditions could look like this when considering jobs, hobbies, pets, and transport:

#############
|             |      1       |      2      |     3      |
| Food        | Pepper      | Plum        | Spinach    |
| Hobby       | Fishing     | Dancing     | Woodworking|
| Job         | Photographer| Accountant  | Engineer   |
| Pet         | Rabbit      | Horse       | Bird       |
| Transport   | Trike       | Bus         | Helicopter |
#############

This arrangement satisfies the given clues:
1. The trike driver (pepper eater) is on one side.
2. Dancing and accountant are adjacent.
3. Horse owner between rabbit and fisher, with fishing in position 1.
4. Spinach eater to the right of plum eater.
5. Horse owner to the right of bus driver.
6. Photographer eats pepper.
7. Plum eater in the middle.
8. Plum eater to the left of dancer.

This solution aligns with all provided clues and logically deduces the positions based on given information."	{'food': ['pepper', 'plum', 'spinach'], 'hobby': ['fishing', 'dancing', 'woodworking'], 'job': ['photographer', 'accountant', 'engineer'], 'pet': ['rabbit', 'horse', 'bird'], 'transport': ['trike', 'bus', 'helicopter']}	True	9	False

1. The person watching satire movies is on the far left.
2. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.
3. The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
4. The fan of salsa is on the far right.
5. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is gardening.
6. The chef is the fan of salsa.
7. The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the person driving the skateboard.
8. The fan of jazz is on the right of the software-developer.
9. The person whose hobby is collecting is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is video-games.


Given statement 1, we start with:
|               | Satire |            |             |
| Hobby         |        |            |             |
| Job           |        |            |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            |             |
| Transport     |        |            |             |

From statement 4, we know the fan of salsa is on the far right:
|               | Satire |            | Salsa      |
| Hobby         |        |            |             |
| Job           |        |            | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            | Salsa      |
| Transport     |        |            |             |

Statement 6 tells us the chef is the fan of salsa, which we've already placed.


From statement 2, since the boat driver must be next to the satire fan and there's only one position left (on the right), we place it there for now as a possibility:
|               | Satire |            | Salsa      |
| Hobby         |        |            |             |
| Job           |        |            | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            | Salsa      |
| Transport     | Boat   |            |             |

However, given statement 7 and the fact that collecting must be next to gardening (statement 3), and considering statement 9 which implies collecting is also next to video-games but since it has to be on the left of skateboard (statement 7), we can start piecing together some combinations.


Let's place collecting on the left, as it has to be next to both gardening and video-games, and must be on the left of the skateboard:
|               | Satire |            | Salsa      |
| Hobby         | Collect| Gardening | Video-games|
| Job           |        |            | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire |            |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            | Salsa      |
| Transport     |        |            |             |

Given statement 5, drama must be on the right of gardening:
|               | Satire | Drama     | Salsa      |
| Hobby         | Collect| Gardening | Video-games|
| Job           |        |            | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Drama     |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            | Salsa      |
| Transport     |        |            |             |

Now, since the person whose hobby is collecting is on the left of the skateboard (statement 7), and considering our placements:
|               | Satire | Drama     | Salsa      |
| Hobby         | Collect| Gardening | Video-games|
| Job           |        |            | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Drama     |             |
| Music-Genre   |        |            | Salsa      |
| Transport     | Skate  | Bike/Boat | Boat/Bike   |

Given statement 8, jazz is on the right of the software-developer. Since salsa's fan is a chef and already placed, and considering metal hasn't been mentioned in relation to specific jobs or hobbies yet:
- Metal could fit with the software-developer as it doesn't conflict with any given information.
- Jazz then must be with video-games since it's on the right of the software-developer.


So, we place the remaining options:
|               | Satire | Drama     | Salsa      |
| Hobby         | Collect| Gardening | Video-games|
| Job           |        | Nurse     | Chef       |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Drama     |             |
| Music-Genre   | Metal  | Jazz      | Salsa      |
| Transport     | Skate  | Boat      | Bike       |

Given the nurse must fit somewhere and hasn't been explicitly linked to a hobby or transport yet, but considering all other positions are filled based on given clues:
- The software-developer must be with metal (as it's the only music genre left that fits without conflicting information), making the nurse likely paired with satire or drama. Since the chef is already with salsa and we have a pairing of jobs and music genres that fit, let's finalize.


The nurse can't be with satire because then the boat would not be next to satire as required by statement 2 (since skate is on the left), so the nurse must be with drama or collecting. However, given all placements, the only job left for the satire fan is software-developer or nurse. Since metal is paired with the software-developer and considering statement 8 about jazz being on the right of the software-developer, which fits our current setup, the nurse then pairs well with satire as it was an initial requirement that the boat be next to the satire viewer.


Therefore, after carefully applying all given statements:
