Lv3-1x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Apply condition 1 - Blueberry is on the far left.
Given that there are four positions (1, 2, 3, 4) and blueberry must be in position 1, we start with:
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry|           |      |        |

## Step 2: Apply condition 2 - Cranberry is on the left or right of blueberry.
Since blueberry is in position 1, cranberry can only be to its right because there's no position to its left. Thus:
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry| Cranberry|      |        |

## Step 3: Apply condition 3 - Cranberry is on the left or right of kale.
Given cranberry's position in step 2, kale must be either to the left or right of cranberry. However, since cranberry is already next to blueberry, kale can only fit to the right of cranberry:
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry| Cranberry| Kale |        |

## Step 4: Determine radish's position.
The only food left is radish, and there's only one position left for it:
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry| Cranberry| Kale | Radish |

The final answer is: 
#############
|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |   4    |
| Food   | Blueberry| Cranberry| Kale | Radish |

Lv3-1x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person drinking iced-tea
Given that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right, there are two possibilities for iced-tea: it can be in position 1 or position 4.


## Step 2: Position of water relative to iced-tea
Since the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, if iced-tea is in position 4, water must be in position 3 (because it has to be to the left of iced-tea). If iced-tea is in position 1, there's no space for water to its left, which contradicts clue 2. Thus, iced-tea cannot be in position 1 if we are to satisfy all conditions.


## Step 3: Position of coffee and fanta
The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta. This means fanta must come before coffee in the sequence.


## Step 4: Combining all clues for a solution
Given that iced-tea must be at one of the ends and considering clue 2, let's place iced-tea in position 4 as it allows water to be placed to its left. If iced-tea is in position 4, water could be in position 3 (satisfying clue 2), leaving positions 1 and 2 for fanta and coffee.


## Step 5: Final placement of beverages
Since the person drinking coffee must be on the right of the person drinking fanta, and considering the placements from step 4, we can place fanta in position 1 and coffee in position 2. This leaves us with water in position 3 and iced-tea in position 4 as a possible arrangement.


## Step 6: Verify against all clues
- Coffee is to the right of fanta (satisfied).
- Water is to the left of iced-tea (satisfied).
- Iced-tea is on the far right (satisfied).


The final answer is: 
#############
|            |   1   |   2    |   3   |    4     |

Lv3-1x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is fishing.
Given that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right, we can place ""fishing"" in column 4.

|         |   1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |
| Hobby   |        |         |            | Fishing |

## Step 2: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is card-games.
Since the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing, and considering the constraints from step 1, ""card-games"" can be placed in either column 1, 2, or 3. However, because the person whose hobby is baking must be on the far left or far right (and the far right is taken by fishing), we have to consider where ""baking"" can fit as well.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is baking.
Given that ""baking"" must be on the far left or far right and the far right is occupied by ""fishing,"" ""baking"" must go in column 1. This also means ""card-games"" cannot be in column 1.

|         |   1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |
| Hobby   | Baking |         |            | Fishing |

## Step 4: Place the remaining hobbies.
Since ""baking"" is in column 1 and ""fishing"" is in column 4, and knowing that ""card-games"" must be to the left of ""fishing,"" we can start placing the other hobbies. ""Card-games"" cannot be in column 3 because then it wouldn't be directly to the left of ""fishing."" Thus, ""card-games"" should be in column 2 or 3 but must be directly to the left of another hobby that is to the left of fishing if we were considering all positions. However, given our current setup and constraints, ""card-games"" can only fit in column 2 because it needs to be directly to the left of another person whose hobby could potentially allow it to be to the left of ""fishing."" This leaves column 3 for ""drawing.""

|         |   1    |    2    |     3      |    4    |
| Hobby   | Baking | Card-games | Drawing | Fishing |

Lv3-1x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching spy movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
3. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies.

Given these clues:

- Since the person watching spy movies is on the far right (clue 1) and also to the right of the superhero movie watcher (clue 2), the order for these two must be: superhero, spy.
- The animation movie watcher must be next to the superhero movie watcher (clue 3). Since musical is the only genre left without a specified position relative to the others, it must fill in the gaps.

Considering all positions and clues:

- Spy is on the far right, so it's in column 4.
- Superhero must be to the left of spy, placing it in either column 2 or 3. However, since animation has to be next to superhero (and considering musical needs a place), superhero cannot be in column 1 because that would leave no room for animation to be directly next to superhero if musical were on one side.
- Therefore, a possible arrangement with superhero and spy's positions considered is: ???, Superhero, ??, Spy. Given the constraint about animation being next to superhero, and knowing spy is already fixed in column 4, we have two main configurations for the first three columns considering all clues:
    - If Animation were on the left of Superhero, it would fit perfectly with Musical taking the remaining slot not adjacent to Superhero (to satisfy the ""left or right"" condition without conflicting with other rules).
    - However, given that Spy is fixed in column 4 and must be to the right of Superhero, and considering the need for Animation to be next to Superhero while allowing a place for Musical, we find:
        - The only arrangement satisfying all conditions (with Spy on the far right, Superhero to its left, and Animation adjacent to Superhero) is: Musical cannot be directly between Superhero and Spy because Animation needs to be next to Superhero. Hence, considering the ""left or right"" for Animation relative to Superhero, we place Animation in column 1 (as starting point consideration), which leaves us with only one viable arrangement when considering all rules together.

The solution must then fit: 
- Column 1: Animation (to satisfy being next to Superhero and allowing Musical a slot).
- Column 2: Superhero (since it needs to be next to Animation as per our deductions).
- Column 3: Musical (the only genre left without a specified position, fitting here as it doesn't conflict with any given rule).
- Column 4: Spy (as directly stated in the clues).

Therefore, the arrangement is:

Lv3-1x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


## Step 1: Determine the position of basketball
Given that the person who prefers basketball is on the far left or far right, we have two initial possibilities for basketball's position: it can be in column 1 or column 4.


## Step 2: Consider the position of golf relative to surfing
The clue states that golf is to the right of surfing. This means surfing cannot be in column 4, and golf also cannot be in column 1 because it must be to the right of surfing.


## Step 3: Combine basketball and golf's positions
Since basketball must be on the right of golf (from clue 3), and considering basketball can only be in columns 1 or 4, we have a conflict if basketball is in column 1 because golf would then have to be to its left, which contradicts the need for golf to be to the right of surfing. Thus, basketball must be in column 4.


## Step 4: Determine the order of surfing and golf
Given that golf is to the right of surfing (clue 2) and basketball is on the right of golf (clue 3), with basketball in column 4, golf must be in column 3. This leaves surfing to be in column 1 or 2. Since golf is to the right of surfing, surfing cannot be in column 3 or 4 but must precede golf, making it likely that surfing is in either column 1 or 2.


## Step 5: Finalize positions
Given basketball's fixed position in column 4 and golf in column 3 (to satisfy both being on the right of each other and golf being to the right of surfing), we can now place surfing. Surfing must be before golf, so it could only fit into columns 1 or 2. However, since weightlifting hasn't been placed yet and all sports must have a unique position, surfing's placement will dictate where weightlifting can go.


## Step 6: Place surfing and weightlifting
If surfing were in column 2, then golf would be in column 3 (as deduced), basketball in column 4. This leaves column 1 for weightlifting as the only option not conflicting with any rule. However, this arrangement does satisfy all given conditions without contradiction.


## Step 7: Construct the final table
Given the above analysis:
- Surfing can be in column 1 or 2 but considering all placements and to avoid conflict, let's place it in column 1 (to allow weightlifting a position).
- Weightlifting then goes into column 2.
- Golf follows surfing, so it's in column 3.
- Basketball is on the far right, so it's in column 4.


The final answer is:

Lv3-1x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies.
2. The person watching mystery movies is on the left or right of the person watching crime movies.
3. The person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching zombie movies.
4. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching mystery movies.

From clue 4, we know the order for mystery and crime movies is: Mystery - Crime.

Clue 2 supports this ordering since it says mystery can be on the left or right of crime, but clue 4 specifies that crime is to the right of mystery.

Given clue 1 (Animation is to the left of Mystery) and knowing Mystery is followed by Crime from clue 4, we have: Animation - Mystery - Crime.

Clue 3 tells us that Crime is to the left of Zombie. So, combining all clues, we get the full order as: Animation - Mystery - Crime - Zombie.

Here's how this looks in a table format with '#############' around it:

Lv3-1x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person drinking Fanta is to the right of the person drinking Iced-Tea.
2. The person drinking Iced-Tea is to the right of the person drinking Juice.
3. The person drinking Fanta is either to the left or to the right of the person drinking Coffee.

From points 1 and 2, we can deduce a sequence: Juice, Iced-Tea, Fanta. Since Fanta must be to the right of Iced-Tea, and Iced-Tea must be to the right of Juice, this order makes sense.

Now, considering point 3, since Fanta is already determined to be at position 4 (to fit the sequence from points 1 and 2), Coffee can either be to the left or to the right of Fanta. However, given that we have a fixed sequence for three beverages and only one spot left (which is between Juice and Iced-Tea or after Fanta), Coffee must fit into this remaining structure.

Given the constraints:
- Juice cannot be in position 4 because it must be to the left of Iced-Tea.
- Iced-Tea cannot be in position 4 because it must be to the left of Fanta.
- Fanta is in position 4, as deduced from combining points 1 and 2.

So, we have Juice, then Iced-Tea, followed by Coffee (since Coffee has to be next to Fanta and there's no space after Fanta for another drink), and finally Fanta. This order respects all conditions: 
- Juice is to the left of Iced-Tea.
- Iced-Tea is to the left of Fanta.
- Fanta is next to Coffee (in this case, to the right).

Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

Lv3-1x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the given clues step by step.


1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.
2. The person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
3. The person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.
4. This clue repeats information from clue 1, so it doesn't add new information.


From clue 2 and clue 1, we can deduce the order for documentary, disaster, and comedy as follows: Documentary, Disaster, Comedy.


Given clue 3, and since we already know the order of Documentary, Disaster, and Comedy, Sports must fit into this sequence in one of two ways:
- Either on the left of Documentary (which contradicts our established order based on clues 1 and 2).
- Or on the right of Comedy (since it has to be next to Comedy), which fits because we have not determined its position relative to the others except that it must be adjacent to Comedy.


So, combining all clues, we get: Documentary, Disaster, Comedy, Sports.


Here is the final solution table:

Lv3-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
2. The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right.
3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
4. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far right.

From point 4, we know the arrangement ends with Fantasy. From point 2, Epic must be on the far left since if it were on the far right, it would conflict with Fantasy being on the far right as per point 4.

So, we start with Epic on the far left:

|               |  1   |    2     |     3     |    4    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic |          |           | Fantasy |

Given that Adventure is to the left of Fantasy (point 3), and considering Disaster must be next to Epic (point 1) but cannot be on both sides, we have two initial possibilities for the second and third positions: either Disaster or Adventure could potentially be in the second position. However, since Adventure must be to the left of Fantasy, and given the constraint that Disaster is next to Epic, the only arrangement that satisfies all conditions is having Disaster next to Epic (to satisfy point 1) and ensuring Adventure precedes Fantasy.

So, considering all constraints:

- Epic is on the far left.
- Disaster must be next to Epic, so it can only fit in the second position since Epic occupies the first.
- Adventure must come before Fantasy, which means it has to be in the third position because Fantasy is fixed on the far right.

Thus, the arrangement looks like this:

Lv3-1x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person eating strawberry.
2. The person eating broccoli is between the person eating avocado and the person eating strawberry.
3. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.

From point 2, we know the order must be either Avocado-Broccoli-Strawberry or Strawberry-Broccoli-Avocado because broccoli is between avocado and strawberry.

Given point 1, it cannot be Strawberry-Broccoli-Avocado since broccoli must be to the right of strawberry. So, the order for these three foods is Avocado-Broccoli-Strawberry.

Now, incorporating point 3, which says avocado is on the left or right of pumpkin, and knowing that the position of pumpkin hasn't been directly related to broccoli or strawberry yet, we have two possible positions for pumpkin: either before avocado or after strawberry. 

However, if pumpkin were after strawberry (considering our current order Avocado-Broccoli-Strawberry), it would mean avocado is not on the left or right of pumpkin, which contradicts point 3 unless pumpkin is directly next to avocado.

Given these constraints and since we have four slots, let's place pumpkin next to avocado as required by point 3. This gives us two possible arrangements considering all points:
- Pumpkin-Avocado-Broccoli-Strawberry
- Avocado-Pumpkin-Broccoli-Strawberry

Both of these satisfy the conditions given: 
1. Broccoli is on the right of strawberry.
2. Broccoli is between avocado and strawberry.
3. Avocado is on the left or right of pumpkin.

However, we must choose one that fits all given constraints perfectly without assuming additional information not provided. Given no further details to distinguish these two arrangements based on the clues provided, both technically satisfy the conditions outlined in the puzzle.


Therefore, considering the constraints and the requirement for a singular final solution table, and acknowledging that the puzzle as stated allows for more than one interpretation based on the given clues, I'll present one possible arrangement that fits all criteria:


#############
|        |     1      |    2     |    3    |    4    |
| Food   | Pumpkin  | Avocado | Broccoli| Strawberry|
#############


Please note, this solution is based on the direct interpretation of the clues provided and assumes that when avocado is on the left or right of pumpkin, it can be in either position. The puzzle's constraints could potentially allow for another arrangement (Avocado-Pumpkin-Broccoli-Strawberry) depending on how one interprets the relative positions without additional context."	{'food': ['pumpkin', 'avocado', 'broccoli', 'strawberry']}	True	0	False
