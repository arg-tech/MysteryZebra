Lv3-6x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 6
The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right. This means the last column (4) is for almond-milk.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 9
The person drinking milk is the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in column 4, and given the arrangement of drinks and movie genres, we start to build connections but cannot directly place yet without further analysis.

## Step 3: Use Clue 7
The person watching disaster movies is the person driving the quad-bike. Given the table's initial setup, the quad-bike is in column 3, which means the person watching disaster movies must also be in column 3.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 10
The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. This implies the helicopter cannot be in column 3 (since the disaster movie watcher is already there and cannot be to their own left), suggesting it could be in column 2 or 4, but given almond-milk's fixed position in column 4, the helicopter must be in column 2.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
The software-developer is on the right of the indonesian. Without specific positions for these roles yet, we note this for later use when more information is available.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 8
The mexican is the engineer. This gives us a nationality-job pair but does not specify a column without further clues.

## Step 7: Use Clue 14
The russian is the person watching drama movies. This gives another nationality-movie genre pair, helping to narrow down possibilities.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 11
The russian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since we know the russian watches drama movies, this clue helps in placing the russian relative to cola but requires further analysis for exact placement.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 5
The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person drinking milk. Given that milk drinkers watch time-travel movies (from Clue 9), we can start building a sequence.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 12
The person who's sport is sailing is the person watching mystery movies. This connects a sport to the mystery movie genre, further helping in narrowing down possibilities.

## Step 11: Use Clue 3
The person whose sport is golf is between the person drinking milk and the person whose sport is cricket. Since we know the milk drinker watches time-travel movies, this clue helps in arranging sports preferences relative to drinks.

## Step 12: Apply Clue 2
The architect is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies. Given that the disaster movie watcher is in column 3 (from Clue 7), the architect must be in either column 2 or 4, but since column 4 is for almond-milk and likely has a different profession (given the variety of clues), the architect's placement becomes more constrained.

## Step 13: Finalize Positions
Considering all clues:
- Column 1 can start with soy-milk (the only drink not yet fixed to a specific position or clue directly).
- The person watching mystery movies (and thus sailing) must be on the left of the milk/time-travel movie pair, suggesting an order.
- Given the constraints, especially around the quad-bike/disaster movies and almond-milk's fixed position, we can start filling in jobs, nationalities, sports, and transports.

Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, let's synthesize the key points:
- Column 3 is for disaster movies and the quad-bike.
- Column 4 is for almond-milk and must align with other clues (like software-developer being to the right of Indonesian, which could imply the Indonesian is in column 3 or earlier).
- The russian watches drama movies and is near cola, fitting into one of the earlier columns.
- The engineer (mexican) and architect's placements are constrained by their relationships to other categories.

The final answer is:

Lv3-6x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one.

From clue 8 and 12, we know the person who's hobby is writing is on the far left.

Clue 6 tells us the photographer is a fan of gospel, and from clue 3, the photographer must be on the far left or far right. However, since the writer is already on the far left (clue 12), if the photographer were also on an end, it would have to be the far right.

Clue 2 tells us the person watching musical movies is a fan of disco, and clue 15 states this person is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Clue 1 also places the musical movie watcher near the comedy movie watcher but doesn't specify which side.

From clue 16, the architect can be on the far left or far right, but since the writer is already on the far left and potentially the photographer could be considered for the far right based on earlier deductions, we'll have to see how this fits with other clues.

Given clue 9 (the architect is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling) and knowing the writer is on the far left, if we try to place the architect on the far left, it creates a conflict because there wouldn't be enough space to satisfy all conditions for unique placements. Thus, considering other constraints, especially with clue 12 locking the writer into the far left spot, let's proceed with integrating more clues.

Clue 13 tells us the person who's hobby is card-games owns the chinchilla, and from clue 4, this person must be to the right of the lizard owner. Clue 5 indicates the ambient fan owns fish, but we don't know their position yet relative to others except for potential relationships through other clues.

Given the constraints and aiming to satisfy all conditions without direct conflicts:

1. The writer is on the far left.
2. The photographer could potentially be on the far right based on earlier considerations but let's confirm with further analysis.
3. Clue 11 (musician is on the left of the entrepreneur) starts to give us job order hints.

Let's integrate more clues directly into a potential solution table, considering all given constraints:

Given clue 17 (the person drinking fanta is on the left of the fan of disco), and knowing from clue 2 that the musical movie watcher is a fan of disco, this relationship can help us place people relative to each other.

However, let's directly apply clues to fill in the table based on given constraints without over-speculating on individual positions before considering all clues:

- **Far Left (1):** Writer
- Considering clue 6 and others about the photographer and their potential end position:
- **Far Right (4):** Could potentially be the photographer, but let's see how other clues fit.

Directly solving this puzzle through logical deduction without a step-by-step table fill-in for each clue is complex due to the interwoven nature of the clues. The key is finding a starting point that satisfies multiple conditions simultaneously and then building outwards.

Given all constraints and aiming to find a coherent solution, let's attempt to construct a final answer based on integrating these clues into a cohesive whole:

Considering the placement of individuals based on their hobbies, jobs, preferred movie genres, music genres, pets, and beverages, we must ensure each clue is respected. 

For instance:
- The architect being on the left or right of the hedgehog owner (clue 7) and on the left of the traveler (clue 9), combined with other clues about job placements and preferences, helps narrow down possible configurations.

However, to directly solve this puzzle in a step-by-step manner without guessing would require systematically applying each clue to eliminate impossible configurations until only one remains. This process involves creating a matrix of possibilities and iteratively refining it based on the given constraints.

Let's attempt a final configuration based on all clues provided:

Given the complexity and the need for iterative refinement, let's focus on key placements:
- Writer on the far left.
- Photographer potentially on the far right, but this must align with other job and preference clues.

The solution involves carefully matching each person with their respective hobby, job, movie genre, music genre, pet, and beverage while respecting all given constraints. This puzzle requires a systematic approach to ensure all conditions are met accurately.

Given the intricate nature of these clues and without showing each intermediate step due to complexity, let's consider how these might align in a final solution, keeping in mind the goal is to satisfy every condition provided:

Lv3-6x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue carefully and fill in the information step by step.


From clue 12, we know the person driving the ship plays badminton. Clue 7 tells us this person is on the far left or far right. Given the constraints about other positions (e.g., bike also being on the far left or right), and considering all clues together, let's start by placing the ship/badminton combination.


Clue 16 mentions the train is between the rabbit owner and the badminton player. Clue 2 places the helicopter between the hamster owner and the train driver. The hedgehog owner is on the far right (clue 13), which helps us place some pets.


Let's combine these clues with others for a more comprehensive approach:


- The Colombian is to the left of the grapefruit eater (5) and either side of the freelancer (14).
- The Mexican is to the left of the Thai (11), who is a mechanic (6).
- The pony owner is near the swimming sport person (4) and the Thai (9).
- Pear eater is to the left of the surfer (1), and the rabbit owner is to the left of the zucchini eater (3).


Considering all these, we need to align nationalities, jobs, pets, sports, transports, and foods in a way that respects all given conditions.


After analyzing all clues and trying different combinations while respecting the constraints:


The solution becomes apparent when we start with fixed points like the hedgehog owner on the far right and build our way through the other clues, ensuring each condition is met without contradiction. However, due to the complexity of directly solving this puzzle step-by-step in text without visual aids or iterative refinement based on feedback from previous steps, I'll outline a direct approach to fill the table based on deducing from given conditions.


Given the format requirements and for clarity, let's simplify by directly stating the solution that fits all conditions:

Lv3-6x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 11 to determine the food for column 1.
The person eating pepper is on the far left. This means column 1's food is pepper.


## Step 2: Use clue 12 to narrow down the sport options for columns 1 and 2 or 3, considering pepper is already placed in column 1.
Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person eating pepper, and given that pepper is in column 1, baseball must be in either column 2 or there's a misunderstanding in direct application since pepper being far left doesn't directly dictate baseball's position without further context.


## Step 3: Apply clue 4 to determine possible positions for cycling.
The person whose sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. Given pepper (and thus potentially baseball) is already on the far left, if cycling were on the far left, it would conflict with the placement of pepper as per clue 11. Thus, cycling could be on the far right, but this needs further refinement.


## Step 4: Use clue 2 to place fishing in relation to cycling.
The person whose sport is cycling is on the left of the person whose hobby is fishing. If cycling is on the far right (as considered in step 3), this would mean fishing cannot be placed as cycling's position suggests it should be to the right of cycling, creating a conflict unless we reconsider cycling's placement based on further clues.


## Step 5: Apply clue 1 regarding juice and puzzles.
The person drinking juice is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles. Without specific positions for juice or puzzles yet, we note this for later use.


## Step 6: Consider clue 7 about the roller and sprite.
The person driving the roller is the person drinking sprite. This links a transport method directly to a beverage but doesn't give us a column without more context.


## Step 7: Use clue 3 regarding the chinchilla and roller.
The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person driving the roller. This gives us a relationship between a pet and a transport method, useful once we know the roller's position.


## Step 8: Apply clue 5 about raspberry and the chinchilla.
The person eating raspberry is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This further refines the potential order involving food, pets, and by extension, transports.


## Step 9: Use clue 6 to place 7up in relation to baseball.
The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person whose sport is baseball. This gives another relationship but requires knowing where baseball or 7up are positioned.


## Step 10: Apply clue 8 regarding golf and fish.
The person whose sport is golf is on the left or right of the owner of the fish. This adds another layer of complexity without direct placement yet.


## Step 11: Consider clue 9 about juice and the motorbike.
The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person drinking juice. This links a beverage to a transport method, helpful once we place juice or the motorbike.


## Step 12: Use clue 10 regarding the van and hedgehog.
The person driving the van is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Another relationship between transport and pets.


## Step 13: Apply clue 14 about hiking and nectarine.
The person whose hobby is hiking is the person eating nectarine. This directly links a hobby to a food type.


## Step 14: Consider clue 15 about skateboarding.
The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the far right. This gives us a fixed point for one of the sports.


## Step 15: Combine all clues to find a solution that fits all given conditions.
Given the complexity and interrelated nature of these clues, we must systematically apply each clue to the grid, ensuring that each step's deductions are compatible with all previous steps. The process involves trial and error, using each clue to narrow down possible arrangements until a coherent solution emerges that satisfies all conditions.

Applying the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:


- Clue 4: The person eating artichoke is on the left or right of the person watching family movies.
- Clue 6: The person driving the ship is between the person driving the boat and the person watching comedy movies.
- Clue 7: The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke.
- Clue 11: The person who's hobby is drawing is between the accountant and the fan of trance.
- Clue 13: The fan of r&b is on the left or right of the person driving the roller.
- Clue 14: The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person eating peach.


Given the constraints, let's deduce:


- Since the dancer is on the left of the boat and collecting is already on the far left, the dancer must be in the second position, with collecting on the far left (position 1) and baking (thus the pilot) in the third position.
- The person eating artichoke must be next to the person watching family movies. Given the current arrangement, this could fit if artichoke is in the second position, but we've placed the dancer there. Thus, considering the placements so far, artichoke could potentially be in the fourth position or another arrangement that fits all clues.
- The fan of pop drives the boat (second position), which aligns with our current setup.
- Cauliflower is on the far right, and since peach is also on an end, it confirms our initial placement.


Considering all placements and to fit the remaining clues without contradicting any given information:

From clue 5, we know the person drinking milk is also a fan of classical music.

From clue 9, the person driving the boat is on the far right.

From clue 3 and 10, the person drinking milk must be on the far right because they are on the right of the person drinking cola.


Let's start filling in what we know:

From clue 4, the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is on the far right, the taxi must be in position 3.


|               |     1      |      2      |       3       |       4       |

| Transport     |            |             |  taxi         |  boat         |


From clue 13, the person driving the boat is on the right of the fan of gospel. This means gospel cannot be in position 4, so it must be in one of the first three positions.


From clue 8, the person who's hobby is singing is also the person whose sport is weightlifting.


From clue 2, the fan of ambient is on the left of the person whose sport is lacrosse.


From clue 6, the fan of funk is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.


From clue 16, the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person whose sport is swimming.


Let's try to place some hobbies and sports:


Since the person drinking milk (and loving classical music) is on the far right, and given the constraints about the taxi and the boat, we have limited options for placing the other items.


From clue 11, the person driving the skateboard is also the person whose hobby is sudoku. From clue 15, this person must be next to the person whose hobby is board-games.


Given clue 7 (the person whose hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is sudoku) and clue 1 (the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is skydiving), we can start piecing together the hobbies and movie genres.


Let's place some items based on the given clues:


From clue 14, the person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Given that milk is in position 4, cola must be in one of the first three positions (from clue 10), and since the person drinking milk is on the far right, we have to place cola, juice, and 7up accordingly.


Considering all clues, let's try to fit everything together:


Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction that fits all given conditions without contradicting any clue, we must ensure each piece of information is used to narrow down the possibilities.


However, due to the format requirements and the extensive deductions needed for each step which would involve trial and error with the clues provided, let's summarize the key points:


1. Milk and classical music are paired.
2. The boat is on the far right.
3. Taxi is in position 3.
4. Cola is to the left of milk.


Given these conditions and the need for a systematic approach that considers all interactions between clues, we deduce the following solution based on logical reasoning:

Lv3-6x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 1 - The fan of gospel is on the far left.
Given that the software-developer is the fan of gospel (clue 11), we can place the software-developer on the far left.


## Step 2: Apply clue 3 and clue 7 - The security-guard is the owner of the bird, and the fan of folk is the owner of the bird.
Since both clues point to the same person owning a bird, this person must be in column 2 or 3 because the software-developer (and gospel fan) is already on the far left.


## Step 3: Apply clue 9 - The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the security-guard.
Given that the eggplant eater and the lacrosse player are both on the far right (clues 4 and 5), this places the security-guard and the lacrosse player in columns 3 and 4, with one of them eating eggplant.


## Step 4: Apply clue 2 - The person eating peach is the owner of the bird.
Since the security-guard owns the bird (clue 3) and we've established the security-guard must be in column 2 or 3, this means the peach eater is also in one of these positions.


## Step 5: Apply clue 8 - The person watching comedy movies is the owner of the pony.
This clue doesn't give us a specific position yet but tells us about movie genre and pet ownership.


## Step 6: Apply clue 10 - The fan of country is on the left or right of the person whose sport is basketball.
This gives another relationship but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 7: Apply clue 12 - The owner of the snake is the fan of country.
Another relationship without specific positions.


## Step 8: Combine information from clues 6 and 16 - The person whose sport is biathlon is the freelancer, and the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon.
This gives us more relationships but still lacks direct positional information.


## Step 9: Apply clue 14 - The person whose sport is swimming is on the left of the person eating watermelon.
This clue starts to give us some positioning, especially when combined with other clues about food and sports.


## Step 10: Apply clue 15 - The person eating watermelon is on the left or right of the person watching sports movies.
This helps in placing individuals based on their movie preferences and dietary choices.


Given these steps and considering all relationships:


- Software-developer (gospel fan) is on the far left (column 1).
- Since the security-guard owns a bird and is associated with peach (through being the bird's owner), they likely eat peach, given the direct association isn't explicitly forbidden.
- The lacrosse player and eggplant eater are on the far right (column 4).
- Biathlon (freelancer) must be before lacrosse in the sequence because zombie movies come before biathlon, and considering positions, it fits that the freelancer is in column 2 or 3 but must be before the security-guard to accommodate the zombie movie fan.
- The fan of country (snake owner) being next to basketball suggests a configuration where country and basketball are central or near each other.


Let's fill in what we can directly:


|               |         1          |     2      |       3        |    4     |
| Food          |                    |            |                |          |
| Job           | Software-developer|            |                |          |
| Movie-Genre   |                    |            |                |          |
| Music-Genre   | Gospel             |            |                |          |
| Pet           |                    |            |                |          |
| Sport         |                    |            |                | Lacrosse |


Now, let's finalize based on clues:


1. Software-developer is a gospel fan (column 1).
2. Security-guard owns the bird and likely eats peach, placing them in column 2 or 3.
3. Biathlon (freelancer) must be before lacrosse, suggesting column 2 for freelancer/biathlon.
4. Zombie movies are before biathlon, so the zombie fan is in column 1 with gospel, but since software-developer is there, this suggests an initial misplacement; instead, the zombie fan should be next to the biathlon player (freelancer), indicating a possible mistake in direct placement without considering all relationships.


Given these complexities and direct clues:


- Column 1: Software-developer, Gospel, ?, ?, ?
- Column 2: Freelancer, Biathlon, Zombie, ?, Bird
- Column 3: Security-guard, Peach, Folk, Bird, ?
- Column 4: ?, Eggplant, ?, ?, Lacrosse


Now, let's correct the approach based on all clues and fill in directly what we know for sure:


1. Software-developer (Gospel) is in column 1.
2. The person watching zombie movies must be before biathlon (clue 16), which means they cannot be in column 4 or necessarily directly next to the lacrosse player but before the freelancer.
3. Since the security-guard owns a bird and eats peach, and considering the freelancer's position with biathlon, we place the security-guard in column 3.


Direct placements based on clues without overcomplicating:


- Software-developer (column 1) watches zombie movies (to fit clue 16), listens to gospel.
- Freelancer (column 2) does biathlon, watches sports (since comedy is after sports and before pony, which we can't directly place yet).
- Security-guard (column 3) eats peach, owns a bird, listens to folk.
- The eggplant eater (column 4) does lacrosse.


Now filling in the rest:


- Country fan is next to basketball player (clue 10), and since country fan owns a snake, this suggests a configuration where these are central or near each other but not directly next to gospel or on the far ends.
- The person eating watermelon is next to the sports movie watcher (clue 15), which places watermelon in column 2 or 3.


Given all relationships and correcting for direct clue applications:

Lv3-6x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person watching superhero movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
3. The person eating potato is on the far left or far right.
4. The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry.
5. The person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi.
6. The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
7. The person driving the subway is the person watching family movies.
8. The owner of the pony is the person watching family movies.
9. The person whose hobby is skydiving is the owner of the guinea-pig.
10. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person whose sport is soccer.
11. The person whose hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini.
12. The person eating potato is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
13. The person eating potato is on the right of the person whose hobby is video-games.
14. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left.


From clue 14, we know the first column's transport is jet-ski.

Clue 7 and 8 tell us that the subway rider watches family movies and owns a pony.

Given clue 1, superhero movies must be to the left of crime movies.

Since the person eating potato can only be on the far left or far right (clue 3), and considering other clues about relative positions, we have to carefully place each activity.


Let's start filling in what we know for sure:


|               |     1      |    2     |      3       |       4       |
| Food          |            |          |              |               |
| Hobby         |            |          |              |               |
| Movie-Genre   |            |          |              |               |
| Pet           |            |          |              |               |
| Sport         |            |          |              |               |
| Transport     | jet-ski    |          |              |               |

From clue 9, the person whose hobby is skydiving owns a guinea-pig.


Given the constraints and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously, let's continue deducing:


- Clue 7 links subway with family movies.
- Clue 8 links pony with family movies.
- Since jet-ski is on the far left (clue 14), and considering clue 3 that potato can only be on the far left or right, we must place other foods and activities carefully.


Because the puzzle involves a lot of interrelated conditions, let's consider key clues again:


- The person eating potato is on the far left or far right.
- Subway (and thus family movies and pony) needs to be placed considering it's on the left or right of taxi.
- Time-travel movies are to the left of puzzles.


To satisfy all these conditions without direct contradictions, we need a systematic approach that considers each clue in relation to the others. However, given the complexity and the format requirements, let's synthesize what can be directly inferred and fill in the table based on logical deductions from the clues provided:


Given the interdependencies, a step-by-step deduction for each category while ensuring consistency across all clues is necessary but would lead to an excessively long explanation without the ability to visually rearrange or test configurations easily in this format.


However, let's attempt to synthesize some key points and potential configurations based on the given clues:


1. **Transport**: Jet-ski is on the far left.
2. **Food**: Potato is on the far left or right.
3. **Movie-Genre**: Superhero is to the left of Crime, Time-travel to the left of Puzzles, Family linked with Subway and Pony.


Considering these points and others, a potential arrangement that respects all given conditions could be derived through careful analysis, but direct inference for each cell from the clues provided without trial and error or a more visual approach is challenging.


Let's attempt to create a solution table based on logical deductions:


Given the complexity of directly solving this in a linear text format without iterative refinement, let's outline a potential solution that could satisfy all conditions, noting that some combinations might require adjustments based on the specific clues provided:


Since we cannot visually or interactively adjust the table here and must follow a linear explanation, deriving an exact solution that meets every condition precisely as stated requires careful consideration of each clue in relation to the others.


Given this complexity, let's provide a synthesized potential arrangement while acknowledging that direct calculation from the given set of clues in this format may not fully capture all possible configurations or adjustments needed for a complete and accurate solution:

From clue 10, we know the person driving the jet-ski is between the person drinking milk and the person whose hobby is board-games.


Since the person with board-games is already in column 1, the person driving the jet-ski must be in either column 2 or 3.


However, from clue 14, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person whose hobby is collecting.


This means the person driving the jet-ski cannot be in column 4 (because then there would be no space to the right for the person whose hobby is collecting).


Let's place the person drinking milk in column 3 and the person driving the jet-ski in column 2.


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |

| Transport     | motorbike    | jet-ski |            |          |

From clue 5, we know the fan of blues eats zucchini.


From clue 2, we know the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person whose hobby is hiking.


Let's place the person eating nectarine in column 1 and the person whose hobby is hiking in column 4 (because if we placed them in columns 1 and 2 or 1 and 3, there wouldn't be enough space for all the other clues).


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | juice        |         | milk       |          |
| Food          | nectarine    |         |            | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games  |         |            | hiking   |
| Music-Genre   |               |         |            | blues    |
| Sport         |               |         |            |          |
| Transport     | motorbike    | jet-ski |            |          |

From clue 6, we know the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person driving the taxi.


The only place left for the taxi is column 4, which means the fan of dubstep must be in either column 1 or 2.


However, from clue 11, we know the fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of dubstep.


If the fan of dubstep were in column 1, there wouldn't be enough space for the fan of jazz to the right.


So, the fan of dubstep must be in column 2 or 3, and since column 3 already has milk, it makes sense to place the fan of dubstep in column 2 (and then we can put the taxi in column 4).


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | juice        |         | milk       |          |
| Food          | nectarine    |         |            | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games  | dubstep |            | hiking   |
| Music-Genre   |               | dubstep |            | blues    |
| Sport         |               |         |            |          |
| Transport     | motorbike    | jet-ski |            | taxi     |

From clue 8, we know the person drinking mirinda is the fan of funk.


From clue 15, we know the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the fan of funk.


Let's place the person drinking mirinda (and fan of funk) in column 3.


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | juice        |         | mirinda    |          |
| Food          | nectarine    |         |            | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games  | dubstep | collecting | hiking   |
| Music-Genre   |               | dubstep | funk       | blues    |
| Sport         |               |         |            |          |
| Transport     | motorbike    | jet-ski |            | taxi     |

From clue 4, we know the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person whose sport is surfing.


Let's place the person whose sport is skateboarding in column 1 and the person whose sport is surfing in column 2 or 3 (but since column 3 already has mirinda/funk, it makes sense to put surfing in column 4).


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | juice        |         | mirinda    |          |
| Food          | nectarine    |         |            | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games  | dubstep | collecting | hiking   |
| Music-Genre   |               | dubstep | funk       | blues    |
| Sport         | skateboarding|         |            | surfing  |
| Transport     | motorbike    | jet-ski |            | taxi     |

From clue 13, we know the person driving the skateboard is between the fan of funk and the person eating potato.


Let's place the person eating potato in column 2 (because if we placed them in column 1 or 4, there wouldn't be enough space for all the other clues).


|               |       1       |    2    |     3      |    4     |
| Beverage      | juice        | lemonade| mirinda    |          |
| Food          | nectarine    | potato  | orange     | zucchini |
| Hobby         | board-games  | dubstep | collecting | hiking   |
| Music-Genre   |               | dubstep | funk       | blues    |
| Sport         | skateboarding| handball|            | surfing  |
| Transport     | motorbike    | skateboard|            | taxi     |

From clue 12, we know the person drinking lemonade is not mentioned anywhere.


Let's place the person drinking lemonade in column 2 (which fits with our current table).


We also need to fill in the last beverage spot, which must be the only remaining option: the person drinking orange juice must go in column 4.
