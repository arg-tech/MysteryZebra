Lv3-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right.
2. The person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the following:

- If the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left (position 1), then the person drinking fanta must be on the right (position 2), because the fanta drinker must be to the right of the soy-milk drinker.
- If the person drinking soy-milk is on the far right (position 2), there's no position left for the fanta drinker to be to the right of the soy-milk drinker, as required by rule 2. Therefore, this scenario does not satisfy both conditions.

So, the only arrangement that satisfies both rules is:

|            |    1     |   2   |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Fanta |

This means the person drinking soy-milk is in position 1 (far left), and the person drinking fanta is in position 2 (to the right of soy-milk).

Lv3-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:


## Step 1: Understanding the first statement
The first statement says the architect is on the left or right of the electrician. This means the architect and electrician are in adjacent positions.


## Step 2: Understanding the second statement
The second statement specifies that the electrician is on the right of the architect. This gives us a clear arrangement where the architect must be to the left of the electrician.


## Step 3: Applying the statements to the table
Given there are only two positions (1 and 2) and based on the second statement, we can conclude that:


- The architect must be in position 1.
- The electrician must be in position 2.


The final answer is: 
#############
|       |     1     |      2      |
| Job   | Architect | Electrician|

Lv3-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Understanding the Statements
The first statement says that the person whose hobby is woodworking is either on the left or the right of the person whose hobby is camping. This gives us two possibilities for their positions relative to each other.


## Step 2: Analyzing the Second Statement
The second statement specifies that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This directly tells us the arrangement of the hobbies.


## Step 3: Applying the Information to the Table
Given the information from both statements, we can determine the arrangement as follows:

- The person with the hobby of woodworking must be in position 1 (on the left) because statement 2 specifies that woodworking is on the left of camping.
- Consequently, the person with the hobby of camping must be in position 2 (on the right).

Therefore, the solution table should look like this:


#############
|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Camping |
#############


The final answer is: $\boxed{\begin{vmatrix} & 1 & 2 \\ Hobby & Woodworking & Camping \end{vmatrix}}$"	{'hobby': ['woodworking', 'camping']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:


1. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of house.
2. The fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of soul.


Given these conditions, we can deduce the arrangement as follows:


- From statement 1, we know the order must be: Soul, House (because the fan of soul is to the left of the fan of house).
- Statement 2 is automatically satisfied by this arrangement since it allows for the fan of house to be either on the left or right of the fan of soul.


Therefore, the solution table with the music genres filled in according to the conditions provided is:


#############
|               |  1   |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | Soul | House |
#############"	{'music-genre': ['soul', 'house']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the manager.
The manager is on the far left, which means the manager must be in column 1.


## Step 2: Determine the possible positions of the scientist.
Given that the scientist is on the left or right of the manager and since the manager is already on the far left (column 1), the scientist cannot be to the left of the manager. Therefore, the scientist must be to the right of the manager, which places the scientist in column 2.


## Step 3: Construct the solution table based on the analysis.
Given the information from steps 1 and 2, we can fill in the jobs for each column as follows:


|       |    1    |     2     |
| Job   | Manager | Scientist |


The final answer is: 
#############
|       |    1    |     2     |
| Job   | Manager | Scientist |

Lv3-1x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Understanding the first statement
The first statement says that the person whose hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is card-games. This implies that the two hobbies are adjacent to each other in the table.


## Step 2: Understanding the second statement
The second statement specifies that the person whose hobby is card-games is on the left of the person whose hobby is camping. This gives us a specific order for the hobbies.


## Step 3: Combining the information from both statements
From the second statement, we know the order must be card-games followed by camping. Since there are only two positions in the table and based on the given conditions, the arrangement that satisfies both statements is:


|         |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Card-games | Camping |


The final answer is: ########. 
|         |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Card-games | Camping |
#############"	{'hobby': ['card-games', 'camping']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. This statement essentially repeats the first one in a slightly different wording, indicating the same relationship without adding new information.


Given there are only two means of transport (bike and bus) and two positions (1 and 2), we can deduce the arrangement based on the first statement:


- The person driving the bike must be in position 1 because the bus driver is to their right.
- Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in position 2.


So, the solution table looks like this:


#############
|             |  1   |  2  |
| Transport   | Bike | Bus |
#############"	{'transport': ['bike', 'bus']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:


## Step 1: Understanding the first statement
The first statement says the freelancer is on the left or right of the coach. This means there are two possible arrangements: Freelancer - Coach or Coach - Freelancer.


## Step 2: Understanding the second statement
The second statement specifies that the freelancer is on the right of the coach. This eliminates one of the possibilities from the first step, leaving us with only one arrangement: Coach - Freelancer.


## Step 3: Applying the information to the table
Given there are two jobs and two positions (1 and 2), we can fill in the table based on the conclusion from the second step. The coach must be in position 1, and the freelancer must be in position 2.


The final answer is: 
#############
|       |   1   |     2      |
| Job   | Coach | Freelancer|
#############"	{'job': ['coach', 'freelancer']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given statements.


## Step 1: Determine the positions based on statement 2.
Given that ""the social-worker is on the left of the bartender,"" we can place the social-worker in position 1 and the bartender in position 2.


## Step 2: Confirm if statement 1 is satisfied with this arrangement.
Statement 1 says, ""the social-worker is on the left or right of the bartender."" Since we've placed the social-worker to the left of the bartender based on statement 2, this condition is also met.


The final solution table should reflect that the social-worker is in position 1 and the bartender is in position 2. Here is the solution:


#############
|       |       1       |     2     |
| Job   | Social-worker | Bartender |
#############"	{'job': ['social-worker', 'bartender']}	True	2	True
Lv3-1x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues:


## Step 1: Understanding the first clue
The first clue states that the person drinking Sprite is either on the left or right of the person drinking cola. This means there are two possible arrangements for their positions relative to each other.


## Step 2: Understanding the second clue
The second clue specifies that the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking Sprite. This directly tells us the arrangement of the two individuals based on their beverage preferences.


## Step 3: Combining the clues
Since the second clue explicitly states the position of the cola drinker relative to the Sprite drinker, we can conclude that the correct arrangement must have the person who drinks cola on the left and the person who drinks Sprite on the right. This directly answers the puzzle without needing further analysis.


## Step 4: Creating the solution table
Based on the clues, especially the second one, we know the person drinking cola must be in position 1 (on the left), and the person drinking Sprite must be in position 2 (on the right). Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:


|            |  1   |   2    |
| Beverage   | Cola | Sprite |


The final answer is: 
#############
|            |  1   |   2    |
| Beverage   | Cola | Sprite |
