| Transport     |              |            |              |

## Step 5: Apply Clue 9
The person drinking cola is the fan of pop.

|               |      1       |     2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | iced-tea    | cola       |              |

| Transport     |              |            |              |

## Step 6: Apply Clue 2
The fan of techno is the person who's hobby is woodworking.

Since we don't have enough information to directly place techno and woodworking, we'll move on to other clues.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 11
The person driving the subway is the photographer.

|               |      1       |     2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | iced-tea    | cola       |              |

| Sport         |              | climbing   |              |
| Transport     |              | subway     |              |

## Step 8: Apply Clue 5
The person who's sport is sailing is the person driving the train.

Given the current state, we can't directly apply this clue without conflicting with other information. We need to consider the arrangement of sports and transports together with other clues.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 7
The person who's sport is sailing is between the person driving the bike and the person driving the subway.

This clue suggests a specific arrangement for transport and sport, but without direct placement, we must infer from given data and clues not yet applied.

## Step 10: Consider Clues 3, 8, and 10
- The person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
- The coach is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking.
- The fan of pop is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.

These clues provide relationships but require a comprehensive approach considering all given information.

## Step 11: Comprehensive Approach
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach, let's analyze and fill in the gaps with the clues provided, keeping in mind the restrictions and relationships established.


From Clue 7 and knowing the entrepreneur is on the far right, we can deduce that sailing must be in the middle since it's between bike and subway. Given cola (and thus climbing) is already placed next to iced-tea, and considering the placement of the entrepreneur and turtle, we start seeing a possible arrangement for sports and transports.


Clue 5 tells us sailing is with the train, but without direct conflict, we place sailing in the middle. The subway is already associated with the photographer (Clue 11), and since the entrepreneur is on the far right, the bike must be on the left to satisfy Clue 7's condition that sailing is between bike and subway.


The fan of techno is into woodworking (Clue 2), but without direct placement, we look at hobbies. Baking and filmmaking have a relationship (Clue 3), as do baking and coaching (Clue 8). Since the coach can't be on the far right (entrepreneur's place), and considering the relationships between hobbies, jobs, and other preferences, we start to see potential arrangements.


Given the complexity of direct application without visual aids for each step beyond this point, let's summarize the key takeaways and apply them to reach a final solution:


- Iced-tea is on the far left.
- Cola (and thus climbing and pop) is in the middle column based on given clues.
- The entrepreneur (with turtle) is on the far right.
- Sailing is associated with the train, but its exact placement depends on satisfying all conditions including being between bike and subway.


Given these constraints and applying all clues systematically:


The final answer is:

Lv3-7x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue and apply it step by step to fill in the table:


1. The paramedic is on the left of the fan of d&b.
2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person who's sport is handball.
3. The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the frog.
4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the software-developer.
5. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the boat.
6. The fan of house is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is camping.
7. The person driving the car is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
8. The person who's sport is handball is between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the boat.
9. The software-developer is the fan of r&b.
10. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
11. The person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
12. The owner of the rabbit is the person drinking 7up.

From clue 9, we know the software-developer likes r&b.

From clue 11, the skateboarder's hobby is filmmaking.

Clue 8 tells us handball is between skateboard and boat. Since skiing (clue 2) must be to the left of handball, and given the restrictions, a possible order for sports could start with skiing, followed by handball, but we need to integrate this with other clues.


Given clue 1 (paramedic on the left of d&b fan), clue 3 (paramedic on the left of frog owner), and knowing from clue 9 that the software-developer likes r&b, if we consider the paramedic's position relative to others, they must be in column 1 because they have to be on the left of both the d&b fan and the frog owner.


Clue 4 indicates cola is next to the software-developer, and clue 5 says cola is to the left of boat. Clue 7 tells us car is to the right of lemonade.


Let's start filling in based on what we can deduce:


- The paramedic must be in column 1 (from clues 1 and 3).
- Given clue 9, if the software-developer likes r&b, and from clue 4 that cola is next to the software-developer, and knowing from clue 5 that cola is to the left of boat, we can start forming a possible arrangement.


Considering all clues together:


|               |     1      |    2     |         3          |
| Beverage      |            |          |                    |
| Hobby         |            |          |                    |
| Job           |            |          |                    |
| Music-Genre   |            |          |                    |
| Pet           |            |          |                    |
| Sport         |            |          |                    |
| Transport     |            |          |                    |

Given the complexity and the need to directly apply each clue in a structured manner, let's deduce step by step:


1. Paramedic (Job) is on the left of d&b (Music-Genre), so paramedic could be column 1.
2. Skiing (Sport) is to the left of handball (Sport).
3. Paramedic is to the left of frog (Pet).
4. Cola (Beverage) is next to software-developer (Job).
5. Cola (Beverage) is to the left of boat (Transport).
6. House (Music-Genre) fan is next to camping (Hobby).
7. Car (Transport) is to the right of lemonade (Beverage).
8. Handball (Sport) is between skateboard (Transport) and boat (Transport).
9. Software-developer (Job) likes r&b (Music-Genre).
10. Hedgehog (Pet) owner is next to frog (Pet) owner.
11. Skateboard (Transport) owner's hobby is filmmaking (Hobby).
12. Rabbit (Pet) owner drinks 7up (Beverage).


Directly applying each clue to fill the table requires careful consideration of all interactions:


- Column 1 could have paramedic, skiing, lemonade (to fit with clue 7 and other constraints), d&b (since paramedic is to its left), frog (since paramedic is to its left), and given other constraints, possibly filmmaking doesn't fit here due to skateboard's placement needs.
- Column 2 then could have software-developer (r&b), cola (next to software-developer and before boat), handball (between skateboard and boat), hedgehog (next to frog), and camping or drawing as a hobby. However, given the skateboard is with filmmaking (clue 11) and must be on the left of handball (from clue 8), this starts to clarify some positions.
- Column 3 then has what's left: boat (after cola), tennis (the remaining sport), car (to the right of lemonade, which fits if lemonade is in column 1), rabbit (with 7up), and the remaining hobby.


Considering all clues for a coherent arrangement:


Given the software-developer likes r&b and must be with cola, and knowing the paramedic's position relative to d&b and frog, we can place these pieces. The skateboarder does filmmaking, placing them likely in column 1 or 2 based on handball being between skateboard and boat.


A possible solution considering all clues could look like this (though it requires meticulously applying each clue to ensure correctness):


#############
|               |     1      |    2     |         3          |
| Beverage      | Lemonade  | Cola    | 7up                |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking| Camping | Drawing            |
| Job           | Paramedic | Software| Lawyer             |
| Music-Genre   | d&b       | r&b     | house              |

| Sport         | Skiing    | Handball| Tennis             |
| Transport     | Skateboard| Car     | Boat               |

Lv3-7x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The owner of the hamster is on the far right. This means column 3 is the hamster's owner.

## Step 2: Analyze Clues 7 and 8
The Chinese person's hobby is writing, and this person also likes country music. So, we can fill in ""writing"" under Hobby and ""country"" under Music-Genre for the Chinese person.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the boat is on the left of the Chinese. Since we don't know the Chinese person's position yet except that they are not on the far right (because of the hamster owner), this clue will be used later for positioning.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 2
The owner of the pony is on the left of the person who cycles. This gives us a relative position but no absolute positions yet.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 9
The person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. This clue links two categories but doesn't give us an immediate solution without knowing more about the fantasy movie watcher's position.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 10
The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the Turkish person. Since we know the Chinese person's hobby and music preference, and given that there are only three nationalities, this clue helps in narrowing down positions based on nationality.

## Step 7: Combine Information
From Clues 7 and 8, we have the Chinese person liking country music and having writing as a hobby. Clue 10 tells us the fantasy movie fan is to the left of the Turkish person, but we don't know their exact positions yet.

## Step 8: Analyze Remaining Clues for Direct Links
Clue 4 tells us the Chinese person is on the right of the person who watches scientific movies. Clue 6 places the hedgehog owner relative to the ice-hockey player. Clue 11 says the folk music fan is on the right of the cycling person.

## Step 9: Building Positions
Given that the hamster owner is on the far right (Clue 3), and using other clues for relative positioning:
- The Chinese person can't be on the far right because the hamster's owner is, so they must be in column 2 to satisfy Clue 1 (boat driver to their left) and other positioning clues.
- The Turkish person must then be in column 3 or 1, but since the fantasy movie fan is to their left (Clue 10), and considering the Chinese person's placement, the Turkish person likely ends up in column 3, but this conflicts with the hamster owner's fixed position. Thus, careful reconsideration of all clues is necessary for accurate placement.

## Step 10: Reconsidering Nationality and Pet Clues
Given the complexity and potential for error in step-by-step deduction without a visual aid, let's directly infer from key clues:
- The Chinese person writes and likes country music (Clues 7 and 8).
- The hamster owner is on the far right (Clue 3).
- The boat driver is to the left of the Chinese (Clue 1), suggesting the Chinese can't be in column 1.
- The fantasy movie fan is to the left of the Turkish person (Clue 10), and since the card-games person is to the right of the fantasy movie fan (Clue 9), this gives us a sequence but not exact positions without considering all clues together.

## Step 11: Finalizing Positions
Given the direct links and sequences:
1. Column 1 must have the boat driver (to be left of Chinese) and likely watches scientific movies (since Chinese is to their right, Clue 4).
2. Column 2 has the Chinese person who writes and likes country music.
3. Column 3 has the hamster owner.

Considering all clues for a coherent solution:


Given the constraints and clues provided, let's attempt to fill in the table directly based on deductions:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |
| Hobby         | singing   | writing | card-games |

From clue 8, we know the person drinking milk watches comedy movies.

Clue 2 tells us the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking milk.

Clue 4 indicates the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the paramedic.

Given these clues, let's start filling in the table with what we know:

Lv3-7x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 6 to determine the possible position of hot-chocolate.
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right. This means positions 1 and 3 are potential spots for hot-chocolate.

## Step 2: Use clue 4 to place the dancer.
The dancer is in the middle, so the dancer must be in position 2.

## Step 3: Apply clue 7 to determine the relative positions of the dancer and the fisherman.
The dancer is on the right of the fisherman. Since the dancer is in position 2, the fisherman must be in position 1.

## Step 4: Use clue 2 to place mystery movies and hot-chocolate.
The person watching mystery movies is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Given that hot-chocolate can only be on the far left or far right (from clue 6), and considering the dancer's fixed middle position, hot-chocolate must be associated with either position 1 or 3.

## Step 5: Apply clue 9 to place water relative to the Australian.
The person drinking water is on the left of the Australian. This gives us a relationship but doesn't fix positions yet without knowing where the Australian is.

## Step 6: Use clue 10 to determine the hobby and pet of one person.
The person whose hobby is fishing is the owner of the chinchilla. This doesn't give us a direct position but helps with associations.

## Step 7: Apply clue 3 to place almond-milk relative to fishing and the cat.
The person drinking almond-milk is between the person whose hobby is fishing and the owner of the cat. Given that the fisherman (and thus, the chinchilla owner) must be in position 1 (from step 3), this means almond-milk cannot be in position 1 or 3 if we consider the constraints about the dancer and the fixed positions.

## Step 8: Piece together the information from clues 4, 7, and the fact that hot-chocolate can only be on the ends.
Given the fisherman is in position 1, the dancer in position 2, and knowing the person drinking hot-chocolate must be on an end (clue 6), if hot-chocolate were in position 3, it would conflict with other clues about the placement of sports and nationalities. So, let's place hot-chocolate in position 1, which aligns with clue 2 and allows us to start building a more complete picture.

## Step 9: Use clue 5 to place swimming relative to the Dutch.
The person whose sport is swimming is on the right of the Dutch. This clue helps in finalizing positions based on nationality and sports preferences.

## Step 10: Apply clue 1 to place ice-hockey with the Japanese.
The person whose sport is ice-hockey is the Japanese. This, combined with other clues about sports and nationalities, helps in fixing positions.

## Step 11: Combine all clues to finalize positions.
Given the constraints:
- Hot-chocolate must be on an end (clue 6), let's place it in position 1 as per step 8.
- The dancer is in position 2 (clue 4).
- Ice-hockey is with the Japanese (clue 1).
- Swimming is to the right of the Dutch (clue 5).
- Water is to the left of the Australian (clue 9).
- Almond-milk is between fishing and the cat owner (clue 3), but since fishing is with the chinchilla owner, this relationship needs careful placement considering the dancer's fixed position.
- The person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the cat owner (clue 11).

Let's finalize:
1. Hot-chocolate, Mystery, Fisherman, Japanese, Ice-hockey, Goat (as it fits with other constraints and doesn't conflict with given clues).
2. Dancer, Musical, Bartender, Dutch, Weightlifting, Cat (the dancer is fixed here, and musical fits as a genre not yet placed; the cat's placement here satisfies clue 11 when considering fantasy's placement).
3. Water, Fantasy, Writer, Australian, Swimming, Chinchilla (water to the left of the Australian, fantasy can be next to the cat owner in position 2, and swimming is to the right of the Dutch, fitting all constraints).

The final answer is:

Lv3-7x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the turtle owner and the dog owner.
From clue 9, the owner of the turtle is on the far left. Clue 1 indicates the dog owner is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike, but since the turtle owner is already on the far left, the dog owner must be to the right of the motorbike driver if we consider the arrangement linearly for now.


## Step 2: Establish the position of the person eating tomato.
Clue 2 states the person eating tomato is on the far right. This means the lacrosse player (from clue 7) and the tomato eater are the same person since they both occupy the far right position.


## Step 3: Determine the positions based on transport clues.
From clue 6, the jet-ski driver is to the right of the bus driver. Clue 1 also indicates the dog owner's relation to the motorbike driver but doesn't specify which side directly without considering other clues.


## Step 4: Integrate music and movie preferences with existing information.
Clue 10 links the metal fan with rock-climbing, and clue 11 places this person to the left of the dubstep fan. Clue 3 indicates the plum eater is to the left of the metal fan.


## Step 5: Analyze sport preferences for further placement.
Clues 5 and 12 suggest a relationship between ice-hockey and musical movies or jet-ski driving, indicating these activities are likely in the middle positions due to the constraints on both ends.


## Step 6: Compile all information into a coherent table.
Given the constraints:
- The turtle owner is on the far left (Clue 9).
- The person eating tomato (and thus playing lacrosse) is on the far right (Clues 2 and 7).
- The bus driver must be to the left of the jet-ski driver (Clue 6), and considering other clues, likely in the middle or towards the left.
- The metal fan (who likes rock-climbing) is to the left of the dubstep fan (Clues 10 and 11).
- The plum eater is to the left of the metal fan (Clue 3), suggesting a sequence for food and music preferences.


## Step 7: Finalize positions based on hobby, pet, and remaining clues.
The chess player is to the left of the dog owner (Clue 8). Given the constraints, we must fit these pieces together with the understanding that some clues directly imply positions while others provide relative placements.


## Step 8: Create a draft table.
Based on the steps above, let's try to create a table. However, due to the complexity and interdependence of clues, we'll summarize key points:
- Turtle owner on the far left.
- Tomato eater/lacrosse player on the far right.
- Bus driver to the left of jet-ski driver.
- Metal fan (rock-climbing) to the left of dubstep fan.
- Plum eater to the left of metal fan.


Given these constraints and without a straightforward step-by-step solution due to the puzzle's complexity, we deduce:
1. The owner of the turtle is on the far left, which could be associated with lime (since tomato is on the right and plum's position relative to metal doesn't directly dictate its column yet).
2. The person eating plum is to the left of the metal fan, suggesting a sequence but not direct placement without considering other clues.
3. The jet-ski driver is between the bus driver and the motorbike driver (considering clue 1's implications with other transport clues).

Let's attempt a solution based on deductions:


|               |     1      |       2       |     3     |
| Food          | lime      | plum         | tomato   |
| Hobby         | chess     | rock-climbing| cooking  |

Lv3-7x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 - The person eating lemon is on the far right.
Given the table structure, the far right column is column 3. So, the food for column 3 is lemon.

## Step 2: Apply clue 9 - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.
This means the beverage for column 3 is hot-chocolate.

## Step 3: Apply clue 1 - The person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
Since there are only three positions, this implies handball must be in either column 1 or 2, and badminton must be to its right.

## Step 4: Apply clue 4 - The person eating apple is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
And from clue 10, the person driving the quad-bike is the person eating apple. This means the food for either column 1 or 2 is apple (since lemon is already assigned to column 3), and the corresponding sport is ice-hockey.

## Step 5: Apply clue 7 - The dancer is on the far left or far right.
Given that clue 9 has already placed hot-chocolate on the far right, if the dancer were on the far right, it would conflict with other placements. So, we'll consider the dancer being on the far left as a possibility.

## Step 6: Apply clue 5 - The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.
Since hot-chocolate is already placed on the far right (column 3), coffee must be in column 2.

## Step 7: Apply clue 8 - The person watching sports movies is on the left of the software-developer.
This implies that sports movies cannot be in column 3, as there would be no one to its right. Thus, sports movies could be in either column 1 or 2.

## Step 8: Apply clue 6 - The person watching sports movies is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking milk.
Since coffee is in column 2, and hot-chocolate is in column 3, milk must be in column 1. This places sports movies in column 2, as it needs to be between sudoku (which could be in column 1 or 3) and milk (in column 1).

## Step 9: Apply clue 2 - The person driving the tram is between the person watching disaster movies and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
Given that sports movies are now in column 2, and considering other placements, disaster movies could fit into column 1 or 3. However, since column 3 has lemon and hot-chocolate, and we have a lot of information pointing towards specific hobbies and jobs being on the ends, let's consider how magic-tricks and disaster movies can fit with the tram in between them.

## Step 10: Finalizing placements based on all clues.
- Column 1 (far left): Given milk is here, and considering other clues, we place the dancer here as per clue 7 to avoid conflicts.
- Column 2: Coffee is here. Sports movies are also here, placing it between sudoku and milk as per clue 6.
- Column 3 (far right): Hot-chocolate and lemon are here.

Let's summarize:
- Beverage: Milk (1), Coffee (2), Hot-Chocolate (3)
- Food: Apple (for ice-hockey, which could be in column 1 or 2 due to handball and badminton's positioning) doesn't fit with milk directly without more specific clues, but we know lemon is in column 3. Given apple must be with quad-bike and ice-hockey, it likely aligns with column 1 (to satisfy the condition that the person eating apple is also into ice-hockey and drives a quad-bike).
- Hobby: Sudoku could fit with column 1 or 3 but considering sports movies are in column 2, sudoku might be more likely in column 1 to satisfy clue 6.
- Job: Dancer on the far left (column 1) as considered.
- Movie-Genre: With sports in column 2, and disaster needing to be placed with magic-tricks and the tram, we can infer disaster could be in column 1 or 3. However, given the constraints, it seems more likely that action or disaster would fit into column 1 or 3, with sports already in column 2.
- Sport: Handball on the left of badminton places handball likely in column 1 (if we consider ice-hockey and its conditions).
- Transport: The person driving the tram is between disaster movies and magic-tricks. Given coffee and sports movies are in column 2, this suggests a possible arrangement but requires precise placement of magic-tricks, which could be in column 3 to satisfy being near hot-chocolate and lemon.

Given these considerations and the clues:
- Column 1 seems likely to have milk, apple (thus ice-hockey), sudoku (to fit with sports movies in column 2), dancer (as it's on the far left or right and other jobs can fit elsewhere), handball (as it must be to the left of badminton), and quad-bike (since apple and quad-bike align).
- Column 2 has coffee, sports movies, badminton (to the right of handball), and considering other clues, it might have magic-tricks or disaster but given tram's placement between disaster and magic-tricks, this column likely includes the tram.
- Column 3 has hot-chocolate, lemon, and by deduction, could include software-developer (since sports movies are to its left), action or disaster if not in column 1, and a remaining hobby.

Let's fill in the table based on deductions:
```

## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 3
The person eating lettuce is the electrician. This clue directly links a food type with a job but doesn't specify the position yet.


## Step 2: Using Clue 4
The person eating lettuce (electrician) is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. Now we know the relative positions of two categories but still need to determine their exact placement in the table.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 7
The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person eating lettuce, which means this person is also the electrician (from Clue 3) and watches zombie movies to their left.


## Step 4: Utilizing Clue 2
The person driving the helicopter is the person whose sport is rugby. This clue links a transport method with a sport but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 5: Examining Clue 6
The person whose sport is biathlon is between the person watching documentary movies and the electrician. Given that the electrician watches zombie movies (from Clue 4), we can start building sequences.


## Step 6: Breaking Down Clue 9
The designer is on the far left or far right. This clue helps us with the job category but doesn't specify which end without further information.


## Step 7: Integrating Clue 10
The person eating grapes is the person drinking juice. This links a food type with a beverage but doesn't give us positions yet.


## Step 8: Using Clue 11
The German is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since we know from Clue 10 that the person eating grapes drinks juice, this helps us place nationalities relative to beverages and foods.


## Step 9: Considering Clue 1
The Indonesian is on the right of the person drinking cola. This clue gives us another nationality-beverage relationship but still lacks specific positions.


## Step 10: Analyzing Remaining Clues for Final Placement
- Clue 5 indicates the person eating cranberry is next to the electrician.
- Clue 8 states the train driver is on the right of the dressmaker, which can help with job and transport placement.

Given all these clues, let's fill in the table based on logical deductions:

## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The Turkish person is a fan of techno.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 5 and 13
The Thai person's sport is weightlifting, and the Thai person is to the left of the person whose sport is volleyball. Since the Spanish person's sport is volleyball (Clue 8), the order for these two nationalities is established as Thai to the left of Spanish.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 9
The person watching disaster movies has video-games as a hobby.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 3
The owner of the pony watches disaster movies. Combining this with Clue 9, we know the pony's owner plays video-games and watches disaster movies.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 2
The person whose hobby is dancing is to the left of the pony's owner. Since the pony's owner watches disaster movies (and has video-games as a hobby), this gives us a partial order.

## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 10
The fan of classical music has dancing as a hobby. This means the person who likes classical music is to the left of the pony's owner.

## Step 7: Analyzing Clues 1 and 6
The metal fan is on the left or right of the family movie watcher, and the motorbike rider is on the left or right of the dancer. We don't have enough information yet to place these precisely.

## Step 8: Analyzing Clue 12
The person whose hobby is reading drives a scooter.

## Step 9: Analyzing Clue 7
The Spanish person is to the right of the reader. Since the reader drives a scooter, this gives us another piece of information about the possible arrangement.

## Step 10: Combining Information
From Clues 5 and 13, we know the Thai person (weightlifting) is to the left of the Spanish person (volleyball). The Turkish person likes techno (Clue 4), but we don't yet know their position. The person who watches family movies must be either the Turkish or the Spanish person since the metal fan is on the left or right of the family movie watcher, and we've established some positions.

## Step 11: Finalizing Positions
Given that the Thai person is to the left of the Spanish (Clue 13), and combining all clues about hobbies, sports, and music genres:
- The pony's owner watches disaster movies and plays video-games.
- The dancer likes classical music and is to the left of the pony's owner.
- The reader drives a scooter and must be to the left of the Spanish person (who does volleyball).
- The Turkish person likes techno.

Let's try to place them:
1. Since the Thai is to the left of the Spanish, and considering other clues about sports and hobbies, we start with the Thai on the left.
2. The dancer (classical music fan) must be to the left of the pony's owner but after the Thai because the Thai is weightlifting, and there's no direct connection between the Thai's hobby and dancing or video-games that would place them next to each other based on given clues.
3. The reader drives a scooter and is to the left of the Spanish, which means the reader cannot be the Thai (since the Thai is already placed with weightlifting) or the Spanish (volleyball), suggesting the reader might be associated with a different nationality or hobby not yet directly linked.

Considering all clues:
- The Turkish person likes techno.
- The metal fan is on the left or right of the family movie watcher.
- The motorbike rider is near the dancer.

Given these constraints and trying to fit all pieces together, let's deduce the final table:


|               |       1       |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby         | video-games  | dancing   | reading    |

Lv3-7x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to determine the correct placement of each characteristic.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1 - Filmmaking Hobby on the Far Left
Given that the person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the far left, we can start by placing ""filmmaking"" in the hobby column of person 1.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2 - Engineer on the Far Right
The engineer is on the far right, so we place ""engineer"" in the job column of person 3.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3 - Goldfish Owner's Position Relative to Drawing Hobby
The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person whose hobby is drawing. This means drawing cannot be on the far right, so it must be either person 1 or 2. However, since filmmaking is already on the far left (person 1), drawing must be the hobby of person 2.

## Step 4: Determine Goldfish Owner
Given drawing is the hobby of person 2, the goldfish owner must be person 3, as they are to the right of the person with the drawing hobby.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 11 - Epic Movies and Western Movies Relationship
The person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. This clue will help us determine the movie genre preferences but needs to be combined with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 9 - Epic Movie Viewer Drives a Bike
The person watching epic movies drives a bike. This gives us a direct link between a movie genre and a means of transport.

## Step 7: Combine Clues for Movie Genres and Transport
Since the epic movie viewer is on the left of the western movie viewer (Clue 11) and drives a bike (Clue 9), we can start building relationships but need more information to finalize placements.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 4 - Western Movie Viewer's Position Relative to Horse Owner
The person watching western movies is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. This clue, combined with others, will help determine the arrangement of movie genres and pets.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 10 - Funk Fan's Position Relative to Horse Owner
The fan of funk is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. This gives us another relationship between music genre and pet but requires integration with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 6 - Hamster Owner's Position
The owner of the hamster is between the fan of reggae and the analyst. This clue helps determine the arrangement of pets, jobs, and music genres.

## Step 11: Analyze Remaining Clues for Final Placements
Considering all clues together:
- The engineer (Clue 2) and goldfish owner (deduced) are on the far right.
- Filmmaking is on the far left (Clue 1).
- Drawing is the hobby of person 2 (deduced from Clue 3).
- Epic movie viewer drives a bike (Clue 9) and is on the left of the western movie viewer (Clue 11).
- Western movie viewer is near the horse owner (Clue 4), and the funk fan is also near the horse owner (Clue 10).
- Hamster owner is between reggae fan and analyst (Clue 6).
- Basketball player is on the left of the bartender (Clue 7).
- Subway user is on the left of the cycling enthusiast (Clue 8).

## Step 12: Finalize Placements
Given the complex interrelationships, we deduce:
1. Person 1: Filmmaking hobby, epic movies, bike (from Clues 1, 9, and 11).
2. Person 2: Drawing hobby, western movies or satire (since epic is taken), horse owner (because goldfish is on the right of drawing, and by process of elimination for pets and movie genres).
3. Person 3: Engineer job, goldfish owner, remaining preferences (satire if not already placed, reggae or funk if not already placed, and snowmobile or subway if bike is taken).

Given these deductions and ensuring all clues are satisfied:
- Filmmaking matches with epic movies and bike.
- Drawing matches with satire (as western's placement is flexible), and the horse owner could match with western or funk, but considering all relationships, western seems more likely to be with the horse owner or near them.
- Engineer matches with goldfish, and by elimination, other preferences can be filled in.

The final answer is:
