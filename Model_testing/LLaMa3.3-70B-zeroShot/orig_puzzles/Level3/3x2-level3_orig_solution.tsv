Lv3-3x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing the first clue
The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the fan of d&b. This means that d&b cannot be on the right side because then surfing would have to be to its right, which is not possible since there are only two columns.

## Step 2: Placing d&b and surfing
From Step 1, we deduce d&b must be on the left. Since surfing has to be to the right of d&b, surfing goes on the right.

## Step 3: Analyzing the second clue
The person eating mango is on the left or right of the fan of soul. This clue does not directly tell us where mango or soul is, but it implies that mango and soul cannot be in the same column because then mango would not be to the ""left or right"" of soul; they would be in the same position.

## Step 4: Combining clues for d&b and surfing with the second clue
Since we've established d&b is on the left, if soul were also on the left, it would contradict our need for mango to be next to soul (since there's no room for mango next to d&b without being in the same column as one of them). Thus, soul must be on the right.

## Step 5: Placing mango
Given that mango needs to be next to soul and since we've placed surfing (and by association, its corresponding food) on the right, mango cannot be on the right with soul because then it wouldn't fulfill being ""on the left or right"" of soul distinctively. Therefore, mango must be in a position where it's directly next to soul but without conflicting with our established placements.

## Step 6: Finalizing placements based on given options
Given that we have d&b and surfing placed (with d&b on the left and surfing on the right), and knowing soul has to be on the right, the only configuration that works is having mango on the left. This means avocado must go with surfing on the right because mango is already accounted for.

## Step 7: Creating the final table
Based on our deductions:
- The person who likes d&b is on the left.
- Mango has to be next to soul, but since soul is on the right (with surfing), and considering the restrictions, we actually have to place mango with d&b or have it opposite soul if we consider ""next to"" in a broad sense across rows. However, our clues don't directly support placing food directly based on music without sport consideration.
- The correct interpretation of ""the person eating mango is on the left or right of the fan of soul"" considering our setup means that if soul and surfing are on the right, mango must indeed be on the left to fulfill this condition because we're looking at a scenario where direct adjacency might not fully apply across different categories but rather within the structure provided.

Therefore, combining all clues correctly with logical deductions about positions relative to preferences:

The person who likes d&b is on the left, and since surfing is on the right of d&b, and considering mango's placement in relation to soul, we actually finalize based on direct clue implications:


|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Mango    | Avocado |
| Music-Genre   | d&b      | Soul    |
| Sport         | Badminton| Surfing |

Given the nature of the clues and the logical steps taken, let's correct any oversight in interpreting clue implications directly into table form without misrepresenting the logic puzzle's requirements.

Lv3-3x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding the Given Information
We have two jobs (paramedic and videographer), two nationalities (German and Nigerian), and two means of transport (car and quad-bike). The clues are:
1. The videographer is on the right of the person driving the car.
2. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the Nigerian.


## Step 2: Applying the First Clue
From clue 1, we know the videographer must be in column 2 because they have to be on the right of the person driving the car, meaning the car driver cannot be in column 2. Thus, the car driver is in column 1.


## Step 3: Applying the Second Clue
Clue 2 tells us that the Nigerian is either in column 1 or column 2 because the car driver (who we've determined to be in column 1) must be on the left or right of the Nigerian. However, since the videographer (in column 2) cannot drive the car according to clue 1, and given that the car driver is already placed in column 1, the Nigerian can only be in column 2 if we consider all possible arrangements.


## Step 4: Determining Nationality and Job for Column 1
Since the car driver is in column 1 and cannot be the videographer (because the videographer is to their right), they must be the paramedic. Also, because the Nigerian has to be next to the car driver and considering our current setup, if we place the Nigerian in column 2, it fulfills the condition of being next to the car driver.


## Step 5: Finalizing the Table
Given that the videographer is on the right (column 2) and must be driving a quad-bike since the car is driven by someone in column 1, we can conclude:
- Column 1: Paramedic (driving a car), German (since if the Nigerian were in column 1, it would contradict our current deduction that allows for both conditions to be met).
- Column 2: Videographer (driving a quad-bike), Nigerian.


The final answer is:

## Step 1: Understanding the Clues
- The Chinese person is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
- The person whose sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies.

## Step 2: Applying the First Clue
Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), if the Chinese person is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, it means the Chinese person cannot be watching fantasy movies because they have to be in position 1 for this condition to be true. Thus, the Chinese person must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Determining Movie-Genre
Since there are only two movie genres (fantasy and thriller), and given that the Chinese person is to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, it implies the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 2. Therefore, the Chinese person in position 1 must be watching thriller movies.


## Step 4: Applying the Second Clue
The clue states that the person whose sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since we've established that the person watching thriller movies is in position 1 (and also Chinese), and there are only two positions, the person into climbing must be in position 2 because they have to be next to the person watching thriller movies.


## Step 5: Determining Nationality for Position 2
Given that the Chinese person is in position 1, the person in position 2 must be Australian since there are only two nationalities mentioned.


## Step 6: Finalizing Sport for Position 1
Since climbing has been associated with position 2 (because it's next to thriller movies and fantasy is in position 2), ice-hockey must be the sport for the Chinese person in position 1.


## Step 7: Compiling the Information
- Position 1: Chinese, watches Thriller, plays Ice-Hockey.
- Position 2: Australian, watches Fantasy, does Climbing.

Lv3-3x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the given information and apply it step by step.


Given:
1. Two movie genres: satire, superhero
2. Two nationalities: British, French
3. Two pets: hedgehog, snake


Clues:
1. The British person is on the left of the person watching satire movies.
2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1 to Determine Positioning Based on Nationality and Movie Genre
From clue 1, since the British person must be on the left of the person watching satire movies, and given there are only two positions (1 and 2), if satire is in position 2, then the British person can only be in position 1 because they have to be to the left of satire. This gives us an initial setup:


|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Satire |
| Nationality   | British   |        |
| Pet           |           |        |


However, we should consider all possibilities based on the clues given.


## Step 2: Consider Alternative Placement Based on Clue 1
If satire were in position 1, there would be no one to the left of it, contradicting clue 1. Thus, our initial setup seems correct, but let's ensure we apply all clues correctly.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 Regarding Pet Ownership and Nationality
Clue 2 states the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French. Given our current setup:


|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Satire |
| Nationality   | British   |        |
| Pet           |           |        |


If the French person must be next to the hedgehog owner, and considering the British is already in position 1, the French can only fit into position 2 (since there are no other positions), meaning the hedgehog's owner could either be in position 1 or 2. However, since the British person is already determined to be in position 1 based on clue 1 and our initial analysis, this means the French must be in position 2 if we consider the strict interpretation of clue 2 in relation to possible positions.


## Step 4: Finalize Nationality Placement
Given the above steps and considering the constraints:


- The British person is in position 1.
- Satire movies are in position 2 (based on clue 1).
- French nationality must be next to the hedgehog owner, but since British is fixed in position 1 and satire in position 2, French can only logically fit into a scenario where it's either associated directly with these positions or we've misunderstood the direct application of clues.


## Step 5: Finalize Movie Genre, Nationality, and Pet
Since the British person is on the left of satire (in position 2), and considering our setup:


|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Satire |
| Nationality   | British   | French |
| Pet           | Hedgehog  | Snake  |


This seems like a plausible solution, but let's ensure we haven't missed any critical logical steps.


## Step 6: Verify Against Clues
1. The British is on the left of the person watching satire movies: **Verified**.
2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French: If we place the hedgehog with the British (as done), this clue holds because the hedgehog's owner (British) is to the left of the French, satisfying the condition.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1     |   2    |

| Nationality   | British   | French |

Lv3-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the fisherman. This means if the fisherman is in column 1, the lemonade drinker must be in column 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The Brazilian is on the left or right of the fisherman. This clue does not specify which side but indicates a relationship between the Brazilian's position and the fisherman's.


## Step 3: Combining Clues to Deduce Positions
Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2) and three categories (Beverage, Job, Nationality), we must use the clues to deduce the possible arrangements. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the fisherman, if the fisherman were in position 2, there would be no one to the right of him for the lemonade drinker to be. Thus, the fisherman must be in position 1.


## Step 4: Determining Nationality and Beverage
With the fisherman in position 1, the Brazilian can either be in position 1 or 2 according to clue 2. However, since the fisherman is already determined to be in position 1, if we place the Brazilian also in position 1 (as the fisherman), it satisfies clue 2 directly because there's no one to the left of position 1 for the fisherman to be next to the Brazilian. This leaves position 2 for the scientist and the other nationality (Australian). Given that lemonade must be to the right of the fisherman, the beverage in position 2 must be lemonade.


## Step 5: Finalizing Positions
- Position 1 (fisherman) can't drink lemonade because lemonade is to the right of the fisherman.
- The only beverage left for position 1 (assuming lemonade is in position 2) is water.
- Nationality for position 1 is Brazilian (because the fisherman and the Brazilian are related by clue 2, and we've established the fisherman is in position 1).
- Position 2 must be a scientist (since there are only two jobs), drinking lemonade (from clue 1), and of Australian nationality (the only one left).

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1      |     2     |

Lv3-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person drinking Fanta is on the left or right of the fan of Rock.
2. The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of Rock.

Given:
- Beverages: Fanta, Tea
- Hobbies: Chess, Photography
- Music Genres: Rock, Soul

From statement 2, we know that Photography is to the left of Rock. This means the arrangement for Hobby and Music-Genre could look like this:

|               |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage      |             |       |
| Hobby         | Photography| Chess |
| Music-Genre   | Soul        | Rock  |

Now, considering statement 1, Fanta must be on the left or right of Rock. Since we've placed Rock in column 2 (based on the arrangement deduced from statement 2), and given that Photography is to the left of Rock, it means Fanta cannot be in column 1 because then it wouldn't be next to Rock. Therefore, Fanta must be in column 2, which implies Tea is in column 1.

So, our final table looks like this:

| Beverage      |     Tea     | Fanta |

Lv3-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Two movie genres: martial-arts and mystery.
2. Two music genres: d&b (drum and bass) and trance.
3. Two means of transport: ship and tram.

Given clues:
1. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person driving the tram.
2. The person driving the ship is on the left or right of the fan of d&b.

Let's analyze:

From clue 1, if the person watching martial-arts is on the right of the tram driver, this implies the tram driver cannot be in column 2 (since there would be no one to their right), so the tram must be in column 1. Thus, martial-arts must be in column 2.

From clue 2, since the ship driver is on the left or right of the d&b fan and we've determined the tram (and thus its driver) is in column 1, it means the ship cannot be driven by the person in column 1 because there would be no one to their left. Therefore, the ship must be associated with either the same person as the martial-arts movies or the mystery movies, but since we've established the tram's position and its relation to martial-arts, the ship's driver must be in a position that allows them to be next to the d&b fan.

Given the constraints:
- The person driving the tram is in column 1.
- Martial-arts is in column 2 (because it's to the right of the tram driver).
- The ship's driver is next to the d&b fan, and since the tram driver is already in column 1, this means the d&b fan must also be in column 1 if we are to satisfy all conditions without contradicting any given information.

This leaves us with:
- Column 1: Tram (transport), d&b (music-genre), Mystery (movie-genre) because the other options have been assigned to column 2 based on our deductions.
- Column 2: Martial-arts (movie-genre), and since ship's driver must be next to d&b fan but we've placed d&b in column 1, this implies an error in my initial logical deduction regarding the placement of ship and its implications. Given the constraints, if martial-arts is indeed in column 2 and the tram (thus its driver) is in column 1, and considering clue 2 about the ship's position relative to d&b, we must correct our approach.

Correcting the logic:
- The person watching martial-arts is on the right of the tram driver, placing martial-arts in column 2.
- This means mystery must be in column 1 because there are only two movie genres mentioned.
- Since the ship's driver is on the left or right of the d&b fan and considering our corrected understanding that martial-arts (and thus its associated transport and music) is in column 2, we should actually align the preferences as follows:
    - Column 1: Mystery (movie), Tram (transport), and because the ship must be next to d&b but we've established a specific placement for martial-arts and by extension its related items, this forces d&b into column 1 if the ship were to be considered for column 2. However, this would contradict our need to place trance somewhere, indicating a mistake in my reasoning about how to allocate based on given clues.

Let's realign with correct deductions:
- Martial-arts is in column 2.
- The tram driver being in column 1 means mystery movies are likely in column 1 (to satisfy the two different genres condition and because martial-arts has been assigned to column 2).
- D&b must be next to the ship, but since we have the tram in column 1, this implies the person who likes d&b could either be in column 1 or column 2. However, if the ship's driver is on the left or right of the d&b fan and considering our placements, it seems there was an oversight in how I initially applied these rules to determine exact positions.

Re-evaluating clue 2 with corrected understanding:
- If the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the fan of d&b, this doesn't directly tell us which column the ship or d&b is in without considering the first clue. Given martial-arts must be to the right of the tram driver, it confirms martial-arts in column 2 but does not directly dictate where d&b can be based on the ship's placement alone.

Finalizing with proper logic:
Given the constraints and correcting my approach for a coherent solution:
- Column 1: Tram (because martial-arts is to its right), Mystery (since martial-arts is in column 2), and d&b (as it fits with being next to the ship or having the ship next to it, considering the corrected understanding that placements must satisfy both clues without contradiction).
- Column 2: Martial-arts, Ship (because the person driving the ship is on the left or right of the d&b fan, and given our established positions, this would place the ship here if we consider the arrangement where the tram is in column 1), Trance (since it's the remaining music genre).

Thus, aligning all information correctly:

Lv3-3x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking mirinda is either to the left or right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.

Let's consider the possibilities:

* If the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person whose sport is skateboarding, then the person watching satire movies must be to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding (clue 1). This means that the order would be: mirinda - skateboarding - satire.
* If the person drinking mirinda is to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding, then the person watching satire movies must still be to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding (clue 1), which means that the order would be: skateboarding - mirinda - satire. However, this is not possible since there are only two columns.

So, the correct order is: mirinda - skateboarding - satire (no, this is also not possible because we have only 2 columns) or 
skateboarding - mirinda is not possible as per clue 1 and hence we consider: 
fanta - skateboarding - epic - mirinda - satire.

However we need to put one of the movie genres in column 1 and another in column 2 and similarly for sports. So considering all possibilities:
skateboarding can be on either side but since satire has to be to the right of skateboarding, 
epic and parkour should go in column 1.
fanta - epic - parkour 
and hence mirinda, satire and skateboarding goes to column 2.

From clue 1: The person watching western movies is on the left of the fan of disco.
This means that Western must be on the left (column 1), and Disco must be on the right (column 2).

From clue 2: The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the fan of disco.
Since Disco is in column 2, Weightlifting must be either in column 1 (on the left) or column 2 (on the right). But given that Western is already placed in column 1 and Sports can't occupy the same cell as Movie-Genre, we infer Weightlifting's placement based on other clues indirectly.


We have two movie genres: sports and western. Western is placed.
Two music genres: disco and house. Disco is placed.
Two sports: tennis and weightlifting.


Given that Western is in column 1 for movies, the only option left for Movie-Genre in column 2 is Sports.

| Music-Genre   |               |  Disco |
| Sport         |               |        |


For Music-Genre, since Disco is placed in column 2, House must be in column 1.

| Sport         |               |        |


Lastly, for Sport, we have Tennis and Weightlifting. Given that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left or right of the fan of disco (and considering the placements so far), Weightlifting cannot be in column 2 because it would not be directly next to Disco if it were in column 1 with Western and House. However, our initial interpretation needs adjustment based on the clues' direct implications:


- Since Western is on the left of Disco (as per clue 1), and considering the final arrangement must satisfy all conditions including Weightlifting being on the left or right of Disco, we adjust our understanding to fit the sports into the remaining slots.


Given the constraints and aiming for clarity:
- The person watching Western movies is on the left of the fan of Disco.
- The person whose sport is Weightlifting is on the left or right of the fan of Disco.


If we place Weightlifting in column 1 (to satisfy it being ""on the left"" of Disco), it aligns with Western and House's placement. Then, Tennis must be in column 2 to satisfy the condition that each person has a unique preference.


Thus, the corrected table reflecting all conditions accurately should look like this:
