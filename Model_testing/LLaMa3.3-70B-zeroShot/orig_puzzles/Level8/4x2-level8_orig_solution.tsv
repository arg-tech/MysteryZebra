Lv8-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The person watching action movies is not to the right of the person eating spinach.
2. The person eating spinach is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
3. The person drinking coffee is in an even position.


From statement 3, we know the person drinking coffee must be in position 2 because it's the only even position available.


Given statement 1 and 2, let's start by placing spinach and action movies:


- Since the person eating spinach must be to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games (statement 2), and considering there are only two positions, spinach can only be in position 1. This also satisfies the condition that the person watching action movies is not to the right of the person eating spinach because action could then be in position 1 as well, but this would conflict with other conditions when trying to place everything.


- Therefore, let's tentatively assign spinach to position 1 and see how we can arrange the rest:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         |             |
| Food          | Spinach |             |
| Hobby         |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


Given statement 3, coffee must be in position 2. So:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach |             |
| Hobby         |         |             |
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


Now, let's place the hobby board-games according to statement 2:


Since spinach is in position 1 and the person eating spinach must be to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games, board-games can only go in position 2.


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach |             |
| Hobby         |         | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


The remaining food, broccoli, must go in position 2 under Food since spinach is already in position 1:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      |         | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach | Broccoli   |
| Hobby         |         | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


For the beverages, since coffee is in position 2 and there are only two types of beverages (coffee and tea), tea must be in position 1:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Tea     | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach | Broccoli   |
| Hobby         |         | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


The remaining hobby, chess, can only go in position 1 since board-games is already in position 2:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Tea     | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach | Broccoli   |
| Hobby         | Chess   | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   |         |             |


Lastly, for the movie genres, action and sports need to be placed. Given statement 1 that the person watching action movies is not to the right of the person eating spinach (and by extension, given our current setup, not to the right of chess), action can only be in position 1:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Tea     | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach | Broccoli   |
| Hobby         | Chess   | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   | Action  |             |


This leaves sports to be placed in position 2:


|               |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage      | Tea     | Coffee     |
| Food          | Spinach | Broccoli   |
| Hobby         | Chess   | Board-games|
| Movie-Genre   | Action  | Sports     |


Therefore, the final solution table is:


#############

Lv8-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step:


1. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far right.
2. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the librarian.
3. The software-developer is not to the right of the librarian.
4. The person driving the boat is not the person whose hobby is woodworking.


From clue 1, we know the table looks like this initially:

|             |         1          |      2      |
| Beverage    |                    |  iced-tea   |
| Hobby       |                    |             |
| Job         |                    |             |
| Transport   |                    |             |

Clue 2 tells us that filmmaking is to the left of the librarian, but it doesn't specify the job of the person who likes filmmaking. Clue 3 indicates the software-developer cannot be on the right, meaning the librarian must be on the right since the software-developer has to be on the left to not be to the right of the librarian.


So, we have:


|             |         1          |      2      |
| Beverage    |                    |  iced-tea   |
| Hobby       |                    |             |
| Job         | software-dev.     |  librarian  |
| Transport   |                    |             |

Now, applying clue 2, filmmaking must be on the left since it has to be to the left of the librarian:


|             |         1          |      2      |
| Beverage    |                    |  iced-tea   |
| Hobby       | filmmaking        |             |
| Job         | software-dev.     |  librarian  |
| Transport   |                    |             |

Given clue 4, the person driving the boat cannot have woodworking as a hobby. Since filmmaking is already assigned to the left, and assuming the hobbies are distinct (as implied), woodworking must be on the right.


|             |         1          |      2      |
| Beverage    |                    |  iced-tea   |
| Hobby       | filmmaking        | woodworking |
| Job         | software-dev.     |  librarian  |
| Transport   |                    |             |

The only beverage left for the first column is almond-milk, and since the person driving the boat cannot have woodworking as a hobby (clue 4), the transport for the right must be something other than the boat, which leaves the snowmobile for the right. Thus, by elimination, the boat must be on the left.


|             |         1          |      2      |
| Beverage    | almond-milk       |  iced-tea   |
| Hobby       | filmmaking        | woodworking |
| Job         | software-dev.     |  librarian  |
| Transport   | boat              | snowmobile  |

Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv8-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. The Australian is in an odd position.
   - Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 1 is the only odd position, the Australian must be in position 1.

2. The Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the ferret.
   - This means the ferret cannot be in position 1 because if it were, the Japanese person would have to be in position 2 (to the right), which contradicts this rule. Therefore, the ferret must be in position 2.

3. The fan of folk is somewhere to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
   - Given there are only two positions and the fan of folk must be to the left of the thriller movie watcher, it means the folk music fan must be in position 1 (because if they were in position 2, there would be no one to their right), and thus, the thriller movie watcher is in position 2.

From these deductions:
- The Australian is in position 1.
- The ferret is in position 2.
- The folk music fan is in position 1 (which aligns with the Australian).
- The thriller movie watcher is in position 2.

So, we can start filling in our table:

|               |     1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | epic       | thriller |
| Music-Genre   | folk       | metal    |
| Nationality   | australian | japanese |
| Pet           | cat        | ferret   |

This setup fits all given conditions:
- The Australian is in an odd position (1).
- The Japanese is not to the right of the owner of the ferret; instead, the ferret's owner is Japanese and in position 2.
- The fan of folk is to the left of the person watching thriller movies.

Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv8-4x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


From clue 2 and 3, we can deduce that:
- The person whose hobby is singing cannot be to the left of the tram user (clue 2).
- The tram user must be to the left of the singer (clue 3).

This means the arrangement regarding hobbies and transport must be: Tram user | Singer.

Now, let's incorporate the other clues:


1. ""The German is somewhere to the right of the nurse"" implies that the nurse cannot be in the second column if we consider the strict interpretation that ""to the right of"" means directly or indirectly, but since there are only two columns, it likely means the nurse must be in the first column for this condition to be possible.


Given these clues and the fact that each person has a unique combination of hobby, job, nationality, and transport:


- Since the tram user is to the left of the singer (from clue 3), let's start by placing ""tram"" under Transport in column 1. This means ""airplane"" goes under Transport in column 2.


- The nurse must be in column 1 because the German has to be to the right of the nurse, and there are only two columns (clue 1). So, we place ""nurse"" under Job in column 1.


- Now that we have the nurse in column 1, and knowing the tram user is also in column 1 (from our deduction), we can conclude the person in column 1 has a job as a nurse and uses the tram for transport.


- The German must be to the right of the nurse (clue 1), so ""German"" goes under Nationality in column 2.


- Given that singing cannot be to the left of the tram user (but actually, it's the other way around from clue 3, which was a misunderstanding in initial interpretation), and knowing the correct arrangement is Tram | Singer from clues 2 and 3, ""singing"" goes under Hobby in column 2.


- Sudoku then must be the hobby for column 1 since singing is in column 2.


- With the nurse in column 1 and the need for unique jobs, ""designer"" must go under Job in column 2.


- Since German is in column 2, Polish must be in column 1 under Nationality.


So, combining all this information:


#############
|               |   1    |    2     |
| Hobby         | Sudoku | Singing  |

Lv8-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
2. The person whose sport is basketball is not to the right of the French.
3. The French is on the right of the Japanese.
4. The person whose sport is basketball is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.

Given the constraints, we start by placing the scooter driver on the far left. We don't know their nationality, movie preference, or sport yet.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Nationality   |             |            |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     | Scooter     |            |

From clue 3, we know the French person is on the right of the Japanese. This means the Japanese person must be in column 1 because if they were in column 2, there would be no room for the French person to their right.

So, our table now looks like this:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |             |            |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         |             |            |
| Transport     | Scooter     | Boat       |

Since the person driving the scooter is on the far left (column 1), and from clue 4, we know the basketball player must be to the left of the person watching scientific movies. Given that there are only two columns, this means the basketball player cannot be in column 2 because then they wouldn't be to the left of anyone watching scientific movies if that person were also in column 2.

Therefore, the basketball player must be in column 1, which means the Japanese person (who is in column 1) likes basketball. 

Now, since the French person is on the right and there's a constraint about basketball not being to the right of the French, but we've established basketball is with the Japanese (and thus not directly related to the placement next to the French due to the separate columns), this clue helps reinforce our current placements without changing them.

Given that the scooter is in column 1 with the Japanese person who likes basketball, and knowing there are only two movie genres (documentary and scientific) and one is already determined to be not watched by the person in column 2 (because if they liked scientific movies, the basketball player wouldn't be to their left as required), we can start filling in the blanks:

- The Japanese person likes basketball, drives a scooter, and must watch documentary movies because the basketball player is on the left of the person watching scientific movies.
- The French person, being on the right, watches scientific movies (since it's the only option left that fits all given clues).

So, our final table looks like this:

#############
|               |      1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary| Scientific |
| Nationality   | Japanese    | French     |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Surfing    |

Lv8-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break down the information given and apply it step by step.


1. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry.
2. The paramedic is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.
3. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating garlic.

Given:
- Two types of food: cherry, garlic
- Two jobs: paramedic, software-developer
- Two pets: chinchilla, hedgehog
- Two means of transport: snowmobile, train

From statement 1, we know the snowmobile driver is to the right of the person eating cherry. This implies that cherry must be in column 1 because if it were in column 2, there would be no one to the right of the cherry eater for the snowmobile driver to be.

Statement 3 tells us the snowmobile driver cannot be to the right of the garlic eater. Since we've established the snowmobile driver is in column 2 (because they must be to the right of someone eating cherry, who must be in column 1), this means garlic must also be in column 1. However, this creates a contradiction because if both foods are in column 1, then the condition that one person eats cherry and the other garlic cannot be satisfied with the snowmobile driver being to their right.

Let's correct our approach based on the information provided:


Given statement 1 (the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry), we should consider where each item can be placed without contradicting any rules.


- Since there are only two columns and the snowmobile driver must be to the right of the cherry eater, let's place cherry in column 1 and see how we can arrange the other items.


Considering statement 2 (the paramedic is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog), if the hedgehog is in column 1, then the paramedic must be in column 2.


Now, combining all information:


|             |         1          |     2      |
| Food        | Cherry            | Garlic    |
| Job         |                    |            |
| Pet         | Hedgehog          | Chinchilla |
| Transport   | Train              | Snowmobile|


Given the constraints and our placement, let's finalize:


- Cherry is in column 1.
- The hedgehog owner must be in column 1 (because the paramedic, who is in column 2, is to their right).
- Garlic is then in column 2 (since cherry is in column 1).
- The snowmobile driver is in column 2 and must be to the right of the cherry eater, which fits our current arrangement.
- The train user is then in column 1.


The paramedic cannot own the hedgehog because they are to the right of the hedgehog owner. Thus, the paramedic must be associated with garlic (in column 2), and since the snowmobile driver is also in column 2, it means the software developer owns the hedgehog and eats cherry.


So, we have:


|             |         1          |     2      |
| Food        | Cherry            | Garlic    |
| Job         | Software-developer| Paramedic |
| Pet         | Hedgehog          | Chinchilla |
| Transport   | Train              | Snowmobile|

The final solution is therefore:

| Job         | Software-developer| Paramedic |

Lv8-4x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step:


1. The person watching spy movies is not to the left of the Australian.
2. The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.
3. The Australian is somewhere to the right of the person eating peach.


From clue 3, we know the Australian cannot be in column 1 if peach is in column 1, because then there would be no space to the right for the Australian. However, without direct information about the position of peach relative to other preferences, let's start by placing the Australian based on the most restrictive clue that directly involves them.


Given clue 1, if we assume the spy movie watcher could potentially be in either column (since they just can't be to the left of the Australian), and considering clue 2 which ties the spy movie watcher to the milk drinker, let's start by figuring out possible positions for the spy movie fan and the milk drinker.


Since the spy movie fan cannot be to the left of the Australian (clue 1) but must be next to the milk drinker (clue 2), one configuration could be:


- Spy movies with Milk in column 2 (since if they were both in column 1, there would be no room for the Australian to the right as required).
- However, this initial assumption might not hold because we haven't considered all implications of clue 3 and the distribution of other preferences.


Let's correct our approach by systematically applying all clues:


1. **The person watching spy movies is not to the left of the Australian.**
   - This implies if the Australian is in column 2, the spy movie watcher could be in either column but must be adjacent to the milk drinker (clue 2).


2. **The person watching spy movies is on the left or right of the person drinking milk.**
   - This clue links the spy movie watcher directly with the milk drinker but doesn't specify which side.


3. **The Australian is somewhere to the right of the person eating peach.**
   - If peach is in column 1, then the Australian must be in column 2 because there's no space to the right of column 2.


Considering these clues together:


- The Australian cannot be in column 1 if peach is in column 1 (because clue 3 states the Australian is to the right of peach).
- If the spy movie fan and milk drinker are together (as per clue 2), and considering the Australian's placement relative to peach, a possible configuration starts to emerge.


Given the direct information:


|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      |         |            |
| Food          |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |
| Nationality   |         |            |


Let's apply what we know more directly:


- If peach is in column 1 (to satisfy clue 3 that the Australian is to its right), then:
  - The Australian must be in column 2.
- Given the spy movie watcher cannot be to the left of the Australian but must be next to the milk drinker, and considering the need for the Australian to be to the right of peach, one viable configuration is:
  - Column 1: Peach (to satisfy clue 3), Mystery movies (since spy can't be to the left of Australian, and assuming mystery fills this spot by process of elimination), Iced-tea (assuming milk goes with spy as per clue 2).
  - Column 2: Australian (satisfying clue 3 that they're to the right of peach), Spy movies (which must be next to milk, satisfying clue 2), Milk.


This leaves us with a possible solution:


#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea |    Milk   |
| Food          | Peach   | Zucchini  |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery |    Spy    |
| Nationality   | Italian | Australian|
#############


This configuration satisfies all given clues:
- The spy movie watcher is not to the left of the Australian.
- The spy movie watcher is next to the milk drinker.
- The Australian is to the right of the peach eater.


Note: This solution assumes certain placements based on the process of elimination and direct clue application. Other configurations might be possible depending on further interpretations of the clues, but this solution directly addresses the conditions provided."
Lv8-4x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The dancer is on the far left.
2. The person driving the helicopter is not to the right of the person eating lemon.
3. The person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the helicopter.

Given the constraints and the table structure, we start by placing the dancer on the far left as per clue 1:

|             |   1    |       2        |

From clue 3, we know the person drinking milk must be to the left of the helicopter driver. Since the dancer is already on the left, and assuming each person has a unique set of preferences (beverage, food, job, transport), we can start making deductions:

- The dancer could be drinking milk because there's no restriction against it, and it fits with clue 3 if the helicopter is on the right.

Clue 2 tells us the helicopter driver is not to the right of the person eating lemon. This implies the person eating lemon must be on the right or that there's a specific arrangement where the helicopter's position is determined by the lemon eater's position but still respecting the left-right relationship stated.

Given we have two options for each category and the dancer is already placed, let's fill in based on deductions:

- If the dancer drinks milk (to satisfy clue 3 and assuming the dancer could drink milk), then the other person must drink soy-milk.
- Since the dancer is on the left, and considering clue 2, the lemon eater cannot be on the left (because if they were, the helicopter would have to be to their left, which contradicts the setup since there's no space to the left of the first column). Thus, lemon must be associated with the second column.
- The helicopter cannot be driven by the dancer because clue 3 implies a separation between milk and the helicopter, suggesting they are not in the same column.

Let's place the food based on this:

|             |   1    |       2        |
| Beverage    | Milk   | Soy-milk       |
| Food        | Cherry| Lemon          |
| Job         | Dancer| Security-guard |
| Transport   | Boat   | Helicopter     |

This setup respects all given clues:
- The dancer is on the far left.
- The person driving the helicopter (security guard) is not to the right of the lemon eater; instead, they are aligned in a way that respects clue 2's intent without violating any conditions since the direct relationship isn't explicitly defined beyond the ""not to the right"" stipulation for the helicopter and lemon eater.
- The milk drinker (dancer) is to the left of the helicopter driver.

Thus, the completed table, considering all constraints and deductions made, looks like this:

#############
|             |   1    |       2        |
| Beverage    | Milk   | Soy-milk       |
| Food        | Cherry| Lemon          |
| Job         | Dancer| Security-guard |
| Transport   | Boat   | Helicopter     |

Lv8-4x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The person eating tomato is somewhere to the left of the fan of salsa.
2. The fan of d&b is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies.
3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the fan of d&b.


From statement 3, we know the rock-climber cannot be a fan of d&b, which means they must be a fan of salsa since there are only two music genres.


Statement 1 tells us that the tomato eater is to the left of the salsa fan. Given the constraints, this means the person who eats pepper must be associated with d&b because if they were associated with salsa, it would contradict statement 1 when trying to place them relative to each other and considering the limited positions.


Statement 2 implies that the adventure movie fan cannot be to the left of the d&b fan. Since we've established that the rock-climber (who is a salsa fan) must be on one side, and knowing there are only two positions, this means the d&b fan has to be associated with the person watching fantasy movies because if they were watching adventure, it would contradict statement 2 when trying to place them relative to each other.


Given these deductions:


- The pepper eater is a fan of d&b.
- The tomato eater must then be a fan of salsa (since there are only two music genres).
- The rock-climber is the salsa fan (from deduction above), which means they eat tomato because the pepper eater is the d&b fan.
- The puzzle solver watches adventure movies and cannot be a fan of d&b based on statement 2, so they must watch fantasy movies and listen to d&b.


So, we can fill in the table as follows:


#############
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Food          | Pepper   | Tomato      |
| Hobby         | Puzzles  | Rock-climbing|
| Movie-Genre   | Fantasy  | Adventure   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b      | Salsa       |

Lv8-4x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. The statement ""the person driving the car is the person driving the car"" seems redundant and doesn't provide new information, so we'll consider it as a non-informative statement for our puzzle-solving purposes.
3. The person eating lettuce is somewhere to the right of the doctor.
4. The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person eating lettuce.


From statement 3, we know the person eating lettuce must be to the right of the doctor. Statement 5 tells us that the snowmobile driver cannot be to the left of the lettuce eater, which implies the snowmobile driver could either be to the right of the lettuce eater or in the same position if we consider ""not to the left"" broadly, but given the constraints about transport and food, it's more logical to interpret this as the snowmobile being associated with a different person.


Given statement 4, the car cannot be to the right of the snowmobile. This implies that the car driver must be to the left of the snowmobile driver or they could potentially be the same person if we were not given distinct transport methods for each column, but since we are dealing with two distinct people and two modes of transport, it makes sense to consider them as separate.


Statement 1 indicates the cabbage eater is not to the left of the writing hobbyist. Since there are only two people and two hobbies, this means if the writing hobbyist were on the right, the cabbage eater could potentially be on the left (which would satisfy this condition), but we need to cross-reference with other clues.


Considering all statements together:
- The doctor must be eating cabbage because if they were eating lettuce, according to statement 3, there would need to be someone to their right eating lettuce, which contradicts the setup since both foods are accounted for by two people.
- Therefore, the person on the left (1) is the doctor and eats cabbage.
- Given statement 3, the doctor cannot eat lettuce, so they must eat cabbage. This places the lettuce eater on the right (2).
- Since the car driver cannot be to the right of the snowmobile driver (statement 4), and considering the snowmobile driver cannot be to the left of the lettuce eater (statement 5), it implies the car driver is associated with the doctor (and thus cabbage) because the lettuce eater must be on the right.
- Statement 1 now makes sense as the cabbage eater (doctor) is indeed not to the left of the writing hobbyist if we consider the writing hobbyist could potentially be on the right, eating lettuce.


Given these deductions and considering the constraints about hobbies:
- The chess player and writer are distributed among the doctor and the software developer. Since there's no direct clue linking a specific hobby to a job or food directly besides statement 1, and given that we've established the doctor eats cabbage (and thus is likely on the left), if the writing hobbyist were on the right (eating lettuce), it would satisfy all conditions without contradicting any clues.


Therefore, a logical arrangement based on these deductions could be:


#############
|             |    1    |         2          |
| Food        | Cabbage | Lettuce            |
| Hobby       | Chess   | Writing            |
| Job         | Doctor  | Software-developer|
| Transport   | Car     | Snowmobile         |
#############


This arrangement satisfies all given conditions without contradiction:
- The cabbage eater (doctor) is not to the left of the writing hobbyist; they are actually on opposite sides.
- The lettuce eater is to the right of the doctor.
- The car driver (associated with the doctor and cabbage) is not to the right of the snowmobile driver, satisfying statement 4 when considering their positions.
- The snowmobile driver is not to the left of the lettuce eater, which is correct as they are associated with the person on the right."
