Lv8-5x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1
The person whose sport is lacrosse is on the far right. This means the sport for column 2 is lacrosse.

## Step 2: Analyze Statement 6
The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the far left. This gives us the hobby for column 1 as puzzles.

## Step 3: Analyze Statement 5
The person eating banana is on the right of the paramedic. Since we don't know the exact position of the paramedic yet, we'll come back to this later.

## Step 4: Analyze Statement 2
The paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. This statement links two pieces of information but doesn't give us a direct placement without more context.

## Step 5: Analyze Statement 3
The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person eating banana. Like statement 2, this links two types of food but doesn't give a direct placement.

## Step 6: Analyze Statement 4
The person whose sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person whose sport is lacrosse. Since lacrosse is on the far right (column 2), volleyball must be in column 1.

## Step 7: Compile Information
- Column 1 has puzzles as a hobby and volleyball as a sport.
- Column 2 has lacrosse as a sport.

Given statement 6, the person with puzzles as a hobby is on the far left, which means their sport is volleyball (from step 6).

## Step 8: Further Compilation
Considering statement 5, if the banana eater is to the right of the paramedic and assuming the paramedic could be in column 1 (since we don't have enough information to place them definitively yet), this would mean the banana eater must be in column 2. However, statement 3 indicates that cucumber and banana eaters are next to each other.

## Step 9: Placing Foods
Given that lacrosse is on the far right and considering statements 3 and 5, a possible arrangement could be:
- Column 1: Puzzles (hobby), Volleyball (sport), Paramedic (job), Cucumber (food), Hedgehog (pet)
- Column 2: ?, Lacrosse (sport), ?, Banana (food), Horse (pet)

However, this initial guess doesn't fit all criteria perfectly, especially with the paramedic's placement relative to the horse owner and the banana eater being on the right of the paramedic.

## Step 10: Revisiting Statement 5 and Placing Jobs
The person eating banana is on the right of the paramedic. If we consider the paramedic to be in column 1 (to satisfy the condition that the banana eater is to their right), this creates a conflict with our earlier guess because it would place the banana eater out of proximity with the cucumber eater.

## Step 11: Correcting Placement
Given the constraints:
- The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the far left.
- The sport for column 2 is lacrosse.
- Volleyball cannot be to the right of lacrosse, so it must be in column 1.
- The paramedic and horse owner are adjacent.
- Banana and cucumber eaters are adjacent.

A correct arrangement that satisfies all conditions would actually require precise placement based on the clues:
- If puzzles (hobby) is on the far left with volleyball (sport), and considering the paramedic must be next to the horse owner, we might have initially misplaced some elements.

## Step 12: Finalizing Placement
Given all constraints, let's finalize:
1. The person whose hobby is puzzles (far left) and sport is volleyball.
2. The lacrosse player is on the far right.
3. The paramedic is next to the horse owner, but since the banana eater must be to the right of the paramedic and adjacent to the cucumber eater, we need to ensure these conditions are met while also considering the placement of jobs, pets, and foods.

Given the complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction without assuming information not given:
- Column 1: Puzzles (hobby), Volleyball (sport)
- Column 2: ?, Lacrosse (sport)

Considering all statements again with careful placement:
- The paramedic being on the left or right of the horse owner, and the banana eater being on the right of the paramedic, suggests a specific arrangement where these conditions are met.

The final answer is:

Lv8-5x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is baking is on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking.
   - This means the left column has ""baking"" and the right column has ""filmmaking"".

2. The fan of pop is on the far right.
   - This places ""pop"" in the music genre for the person in the right column.

3. The fan of pop is not to the right of the owner of the pony.
   - Since the pop fan is already determined to be on the far right, this means the pony must be in the left column because the statement would be contradictory if the pony were also on the right (since there's no one to the right of the rightmost person).

4. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person whose sport is soccer.
   - This clue indicates that ""romance"" is in the left column and ""soccer"" must be associated with either filmmaking or another category not yet determined, but definitely not baking since baking is in the left column.


Given these clues, let's try to fill out the table:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Hobby         | Baking   | Filmmaking |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance  | Family     |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep  | Pop        |
| Pet           | Pony     | Goat       |
| Sport         | Climbing | Soccer     |

This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:
- The baker is to the left of the filmmaker.
- The pop fan is on the far right.
- The pony owner (left column) is not to the right of the pop fan, which fits because the pony owner is actually to the left of the pop fan.
- The romance movie watcher is to the left of the soccer player.


Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv8-5x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement given:


1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues.
2. The Italian is not to the right of the person watching animation movies.
3. The Italian is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
4. The owner of the rabbit is the fan of ambient.


From statement 4, we know the owner of the rabbit likes ambient music. Let's start by placing this information in the table:


|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |             |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  |             |
| Nationality   |          |             |
| Pet           | Rabbit   |             |


Now, let's use statement 3. Since the Italian must be on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, and we've already placed the rabbit in column 1, the turtle must be in column 2, and the Italian can either be in column 1 or column 2. However, given that there are only two nationalities (Italian and Japanese), if the Italian is not next to the turtle, it violates the condition since there's no other position for the Italian to be ""on the left or right"" of the turtle owner without being directly adjacent.


|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |             |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  |             |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Rabbit   | Turtle      |


Statement 2 says the Italian is not to the right of the person watching animation movies. This implies that if the Italian were in column 1 (as we've tentatively placed), then column 1 must be watching a movie genre other than animation because otherwise, it would violate this rule when considering the placement of animation and the constraint on Italian nationality's position relative to animation fans.


Statement 1 indicates the person whose hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the right of the fan of blues. Since we've already placed ambient in column 1 (which means blues must be in column 2 because there are only two music genres mentioned), this implies that woodworking cannot be in column 1; it must be in column 2, as there's no further ""right"" to go beyond column 2.


Given these constraints and looking at our partially filled table:


|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   |          |             |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Blues       |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Rabbit   | Turtle      |


The only hobby left for column 1 is cooking, and since woodworking must be to the right of blues (and thus in column 2 because blues is already determined to be in column 2 based on ambient being in column 1), we can fill in the hobbies:


|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         | Cooking | Woodworking|
| Movie-Genre   |          |             |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Blues       |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Rabbit   | Turtle      |


For the movie genre, considering statement 2 that the Italian (in column 1) is not to the right of the person watching animation movies, this means the Italian must be watching animation or another genre that doesn't violate any given rules. However, since there are only two genres and we've already established a possible conflict with placement based on other criteria, let's correct our understanding: Given the constraints about nationalities and pets, and knowing that the Italian cannot be to the right of the animation fan (which would place animation in column 2 if Italian were in column 1), it suggests that animation should indeed be associated with the Japanese person to avoid any rule violations since we've already determined the music genres' placements.


So, placing animation with the Japanese (column 2) and thus thriller with the Italian (column 1) doesn't directly conflict with our current setup:


|               |    1     |      2      |
| Hobby         | Cooking | Woodworking|
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller| Animation  |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient  | Blues       |
| Nationality   | Italian  | Japanese    |
| Pet           | Rabbit   | Turtle      |


Given all constraints and placements:


The final solution table is:

Lv8-5x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze the first clue
The first clue states that ""the polish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate."" This means if hot-chocolate is in column 1, Polish must be in column 2. If hot-chocolate were in column 2, there would be no space to the right for Polish.


## Step 2: Analyze the second clue
The second clue states that ""the person watching sports movies is not to the right of the fan of soul."" This implies that either the sports movie fan is to the left of the soul music fan, or they are in the same column but we cannot determine their positions relative to each other based solely on this clue.


## Step 3: Analyze the third clue
The third clue states that ""the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies."" This means if musical movies are in column 1, skiing must be in column 2. If musical movies were in column 2, there would be no space to the right for skiing.


## Step 4: Combine the clues
From clue 1, we know hot-chocolate cannot be in column 2 because Polish needs to be to its right. So, hot-chocolate is likely in column 1, making almond-milk in column 2 (since there are only two beverages mentioned).

From clue 3, since skiing must be to the right of musical movies, and considering the layout, musical movies should be in column 1, which places skiing in column 2.

Given these placements, sports movies would then have to be in column 2 as well because it cannot be to the right of soul (clue 2), but since musical movies are already in column 1, and we've determined skiing (and thus likely its corresponding preferences) is in column 2, sports movies must also be in column 2. However, this creates a conflict with our need to place soul music's fan relative to sports movies without violating clue 2.

Let's reconsider based on the beverage placement deduced: If hot-chocolate is indeed in column 1 (because Polish needs to be to its right), and almond-milk is in column 2, we can then align other preferences.


## Step 5: Finalize placements
Given hot-chocolate in column 1 and almond-milk in column 2:
- Musical movies must be in column 1 because skiing (which is to the right of musical movies) needs to be in column 2.
- Sports movies, therefore, should be in column 2 to avoid being to the right of soul (as per clue 2), but this was initially misinterpreted. Since sports movies can't be to the right of soul, and we've established a structure, let's correct: If musical is in column 1, sports could indeed be in column 2 without violating any rules directly since we need to ensure the fan of soul isn't to the left of sports movies if they were in the same column or overall arrangement.
- The Polish nationality being to the right of hot-chocolate places it in column 2.
- Mexican would then be in column 1, as there are only two nationalities mentioned.

Considering music genres: R&B and soul. Since we've established that sports movies (which could be paired with either music genre but must avoid being to the right of soul) are in column 2, and Polish (thus likely its corresponding preferences) is also in column 2, we pair soul with column 2's preferences to avoid conflict with clue 2. Thus, R&B would go with column 1.

For sports: Skiing is in column 2 because it's to the right of musical movies. Volleyball then goes to column 1.


## Step 6: Construct the solution table
Based on our deductions:
- Column 1: Mexican, Musical Movies, Hot-Chocolate, R&B, Volleyball
- Column 2: Polish, Sports Movies, Almond-Milk, Soul, Skiing

The final answer is:

Lv8-5x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The person whose sport is snowboarding is on the far left. This means the leftmost column (column 1) must have ""snowboarding"" as its sport.


## Step 2: Applying Clue 3
The fan of folk music is to the left of the Indonesian. Since we've established that column 1 has snowboarding, and assuming this person could also be the fan of folk (as there's no direct contradiction yet), we can tentatively place ""folk"" in column 1 for music-genre. However, we cannot conclude the nationality of column 1 without further information.


## Step 3: Examining Clue 2
The person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person watching western movies. This implies that if the person watching western movies is in column 2 (the rightmost column), then coffee could be in either column, but if western movies were somehow in column 1, coffee would have to be in column 2. However, since we don't know the movie-genre of column 1 yet, we'll keep this in mind for now.


## Step 4: Applying Clue 1
The person watching thriller movies is not the person whose sport is cricket. Given that snowboarding (and potentially folk) is in column 1, and considering cricket must be in one of the columns, if column 1 has snowboarding, then column 2 could have cricket, making the movie-genre in column 1 ""western"" or vice versa for the genres but keeping in mind the other clues.


## Step 5: Integrating All Clues
- From Clue 4 and Step 1, snowboarding is on the far left.
- Considering Clue 3, folk could be on the left (in column 1), which aligns with the possibility of the Indonesian being in column 2.
- Since coffee cannot be to the left of western movies (Clue 2), if we place western movies in column 2, coffee must also be in column 2 because there's no other option for coffee that doesn't violate this rule directly or indirectly given our current understanding.
- However, Clue 1 indicates thriller and cricket cannot match. If snowboarding is with thriller (to satisfy the conditions without direct contradiction), then western would have to pair with cricket.


## Step 6: Finalizing Nationality and Beverages
Given folk must be to the left of Indonesian, and assuming snowboarding (thus potentially folk) is in column 1, we could place ""Indonesian"" in column 2. This means coffee (which can't be to the left of western movies) would go well with being in column 2 alongside western movies and potentially cricket as its sport.


## Step 7: Piecing Together the Final Table
Given all clues:
- Column 1 has snowboarding, which must watch thriller movies to avoid direct contradiction with other clues.
- Folk music-genre is on the left (column 1), aligning with Clue 3 and our deductions.
- Since coffee can't be to the left of western, and assuming the arrangement where snowboarding (thus folk) is in column 1, we place soy-milk in column 1 to avoid contradiction.
- Column 2 then has cricket as its sport, watches western movies, listens to indie music (as it's the only option left), drinks coffee, and is Indonesian.

## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The American is not the person watching western movies. This means the person watching western movies must be British.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person eating banana is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies. Since there are only two positions, this implies the person eating banana cannot be in position 2 if the western movie watcher is in position 2.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The freelancer is on the left of the fan of gospel. This clue gives us a relative positioning but does not specify the food or movie genre yet.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person eating blueberry is not to the right of the scientist. This means if the scientist is in position 1, the blueberry eater must be in position 1 as well, or if the scientist is in position 2, the blueberry eater could be in either position but this would contradict other clues when trying to place all elements.


## Step 5: Combining Clues
From clue 3, we know the freelancer is to the left of the gospel fan. If we combine this with clue 4 and consider the scientist's placement, we have a few scenarios but need to ensure all clues are satisfied.


## Step 6: Finalizing Positions
Given that there are only two positions and multiple categories to fill, let's try to place the most restrictive combinations first:
- The American cannot watch western movies (clue 1), so if the American is in position 1, they must watch action movies.
- The banana eater is to the left of the western movie watcher (clue 2), suggesting that if the western movie watcher is in position 2, the banana eater must be in position 1.


## Step 7: Placing Jobs and Music Genres
The freelancer is to the left of the gospel fan (clue 3). If we assume the freelancer is in position 1 (to satisfy being to the left), then the gospel fan must be in position 2. This leaves the scientist for position 1 or 2, but since the freelancer is already placed in position 1 based on our assumption, the scientist must be in position 2.


## Step 8: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
- Position 1 (left) must have the banana eater because they are to the left of the western movie watcher.
- The American cannot watch western movies, so if in position 1, they watch action movies and eat bananas.
- The freelancer is in position 1 (based on step 7's assumption for placement), which aligns with being a scientist or not, but given the blueberry eater's restriction relative to the scientist, we must carefully place these elements.


## Step 9: Correcting Assumptions
Let's correct our approach based on all clues:
- The freelancer is to the left of the gospel fan.
- The banana eater is to the left of the western movie watcher.
- The American does not watch western movies.
Given these, a possible arrangement could be:
- Position 1: American, Freelancer, Banana, Action, Gospel
- Position 2: British, Scientist, Blueberry, Western, Trance


## Step 10: Finalizing Table
However, we need to ensure all clues fit perfectly without contradiction. Let's finalize with the most fitting arrangement considering all restrictions:


The final answer is:

Lv8-5x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze clue 1
The person drinking milk is on the right of the Russian. This means the Russian must be on the left (column 1), and the person who drinks milk must be on the right (column 2).


## Step 2: Analyze clue 2
The person watching thriller movies is the Russian. Since the Russian is in column 1, the movie genre for column 1 is thriller.


## Step 3: Analyze clue 3
The fan of punk is not to the right of the Egyptian. This implies that if the Egyptian were in column 2, the punk fan could only be in column 1. However, we don't know the nationality of column 2 yet, so we keep this in mind for further analysis.


## Step 4: Analyze clue 4
The person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan of rock. Since the thriller movie watcher (the Russian) is already determined to be in column 1, the fan of rock must also be in column 1 because the statement would otherwise contradict itself if considering positions. However, this interpretation seems to misalign with the direct clue implications; correctly, it means the rock fan cannot be in column 2 if the thriller watcher were in column 1, which is the case. This actually supports that the rock fan could indeed be in column 1, but given our setup, it's more about ensuring the rock fan isn't in a position that contradicts other clues directly.


## Step 5: Analyze clue 5
The person watching disaster movies is the videographer. This clue doesn't specify the nationality or beverage preference but gives us a job related to movie genre.


## Step 6: Synthesize information
From clue 2, we know the Russian watches thriller movies and is in column 1.
From clue 1, since the milk drinker is to the right of the Russian, the person in column 2 drinks milk.
Clue 5 tells us the disaster movie watcher is a videographer. Since the Russian (thriller) is already in column 1, and given the job distribution must be unique, the videographer (disaster movies) must be in column 2 because there are only two jobs, and one is already implied to be with the Russian (though not directly stated which job the Russian has).
Given this setup, clue 4 actually helps us place music genres: since the rock fan can't be to the right of the thriller watcher (Russian), and considering our previous steps' implications might have been slightly misinterpreted in direct relation to column placement based on genre alone, we focus on what's directly inferable.


## Step 7: Determine nationality, job, and beverage for each column
Column 1 is Russian, watching thrillers. The job here must be the electrician because the videographer watches disaster movies (clue 5) and is implied to be in column 2 based on our synthesis.
The person in column 2 drinks milk, watches disaster movies, and thus is the videographer.


## Step 8: Finalize music genres
Since clue 3 states the punk fan isn't to the right of the Egyptian, and we've established the Russian (column 1) watches thrillers, if the Egyptian were in column 2, it would contradict because there's no space for the punk fan not to be to the right of someone. Thus, the Egyptian must be in column 1, making the person in column 2 Russian impossible; our initial interpretation needs adjustment based on direct clues: The Russian is indeed in column 1 as per clue 2, watching thrillers.


## Step 9: Correct interpretation and final table setup
- Column 1 (Russian): Watches thrillers, is an electrician (because the videographer is associated with disaster movies), drinks cola (since milk is on the right).
- Column 2 (Egyptian, by process of elimination for nationality and to fit the ""milk drinker"" clue): Watches disaster movies, is a videographer.


Given these steps and correcting for logical flow in interpretation:
The Russian electrician watches thrillers, drinks cola.
The Egyptian videographer watches disaster movies, drinks milk.

For music genres: Since the punk fan can't be to the right of the Egyptian (and assuming an error in previous logic steps regarding direct placements based on clues), we should reconsider how genres and jobs align without misinterpreting clue implications. The Russian (electrician) is a rock fan because the setup doesn't directly contradict this, and it fits with the given information that doesn't specify music genre by job or nationality directly beyond these constraints.

Lv8-5x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person watching musical movies.
2. The person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person eating cherry.
3. The fan of electronic music is somewhere to the right of the software-developer.


From clue 1, we know the order for beverage and movie-genre is: juice - musical.

From clue 2, since musical movies cannot be to the right of cherry, and knowing from clue 1 that juice (and thus its associated columns) must be to the left of musical, we can deduce that cherry must be associated with musical because if it were associated with action (the other movie genre), it would contradict clue 2 by making musical potentially to the right of cherry. So, we have: 
- Juice is on the left.
- Musical movies are also on the left or at least not to the right of cherry.

From clue 3, electronic music must be to the right of the software-developer.


Given these clues and the options:


- Beverages: almond-milk, juice
- Foods: cherry, cranberry
- Jobs: dancer, software-developer
- Movie-genres: action, musical
- Music-genres: electronic, house


Let's fill in what we know:


Since juice is to the left of musical and considering clue 2, a possible arrangement could be:
- Left: Juice, Musical, Cherry (for food), Dancer (as job - because software-developer needs to be to the left of electronic music and thus likely paired with action which isn't specified yet but fits based on elimination), Electronic doesn't fit here due to clue 3, suggesting House.
- Right: Almond-milk, Action, Cranberry, Software-developer, Electronic.


This setup respects all given clues:
1. Juice is to the left of Musical.
2. Musical is not to the right of Cherry (they are together).
3. Electronic is to the right of Software-developer.


Given this analysis, a possible solution table is:

Lv8-5x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each statement and use a process of elimination to determine the correct arrangement.


## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 1
The fan of soul is the person eating pineapple. This means that in the Music-Genre row, ""soul"" must be paired with pineapple in the Food row.


## Step 2: Analyzing Statement 2
The fan of reggae is on the right of the person watching action movies. This statement helps us determine the arrangement of Movie-Genre and Music-Genre but doesn't give direct information about the other categories yet.


## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 3
The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. This gives us a connection between Transport and Hobby, indicating that ""van"" and ""card-games"" must be adjacent.


## Step 4: Analyzing Statement 4
The fan of soul is not to the left of the person driving the van. Since we know from Statement 1 that the fan of soul eats pineapple, this means pineapple (and thus soul) cannot be to the left of the van.


## Step 5: Combining Information
From Statement 2, if reggae is on the right of action, and knowing there are only two options for Movie-Genre (action and sports), it suggests that action must be on the left. This also means sports is on the right because reggae's position is dependent on action's placement.


## Step 6: Determining Food Placement
Since soul is paired with pineapple (Statement 1) and cannot be to the left of the van (Statement 4), if we assume the van is on the left, it would contradict Statement 4 unless pineapple/soul is also on the left. However, considering all statements together, especially with reggae being on the right of action and the need for the van to be adjacent to card-games, we can start building a possible arrangement.


## Step 7: Finalizing Arrangements
Given that:
- Action must be on the left (to allow reggae to be on its right).
- The fan of soul (pineapple) cannot be to the left of the van.
- The van must be next to card-games.

A possible arrangement considering all constraints could be:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | broccoli | pineapple |
| Hobby         | card-games | gardening |
| Movie-Genre   | action    | sports    |
| Music-Genre   | reggae    | soul      |
| Transport     | van       | helicopter|

However, this step requires ensuring that all conditions are met without contradiction. Let's correct the approach based on the clues given:


## Step 8: Correcting Approach Based on Clues
1. Soul is with pineapple.
2. Reggae is to the right of action.
3. Van is next to card-games.
4. Soul (pineapple) is not to the left of the van.

Considering these, if the van were on the right, it would contradict Statement 4 unless pineapple/soul is also on the right, which fits because then reggae can be to the right of action (with action on the left), and the van can still be next to card-games if card-games is on the right or left accordingly.


## Step 9: Revisiting Statements for Accuracy
Given the constraints:
- Action must precede reggae.
- The van's position relative to card-games and soul/pineapple needs clarification based on all statements.

Let's accurately place them considering all interactions:


The final answer is: ########. 
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | pineapple | broccoli |
| Hobby         | gardening | card-games |
| Movie-Genre   | action    | sports    |
| Music-Genre   | soul      | reggae    |
| Transport     | van       | helicopter|
