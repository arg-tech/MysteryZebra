Lv8-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:

1. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.
2. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.

From clue 1, we know the order for climbing is fixed at position 3.

|         |       1       |    2    |    3     |
| Sport   |               |         | Climbing |

Clue 2 tells us that climbing cannot be to the left of sailing. Since climbing is already placed on the far right, sailing can either be in position 1 or 2 without violating this rule.

Clue 3 states that weightlifting must be to the left of sailing. This means sailing cannot be in position 1 because there would be no space to the left of it for weightlifting. Therefore, sailing must be in position 2, and weightlifting must be in position 1.

So, the solution table looks like this:

#############

Lv8-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose hobby is Sudoku is not to the left of the person whose hobby is Chess.
2. The person whose hobby is Sudoku is in the middle.

Given that there are three positions (1, 2, 3) and the hobbies are chess, skydiving, and sudoku, let's apply the clues:

- From clue 2, we know Sudoku must be in position 2 because it's stated to be in the middle.
- From clue 1, since Sudoku is in the middle (position 2), Chess cannot be to its right (in position 3) because then Sudoku would be to the left of Chess. Therefore, Chess must be in position 1.

Now we have:
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | Chess | Sudoku |           |

The only hobby left for position 3 is skydiving, as chess and sudoku are already placed.

Therefore, the completed table is:

Lv8-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step:


1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea.


From clue 1, we have two possible orders for soy-milk and juice: Soy-milk, Juice.


Given that there are three positions and considering clue 2, which states the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea, we can deduce the following:


- If tea were in position 3, then juice could only be in position 1 or 2 without violating any rules. However, since soy-milk must be to the left of juice (clue 1), and if juice were in position 2, soy-milk would have to be in position 1, which fits all conditions so far.


- If tea were in position 1, then juice could not be in any position without violating clue 2, since juice cannot be to the right of tea. This scenario does not work given our current understanding and constraints.


Considering these points, a possible arrangement that satisfies both clues is having soy-milk in position 1, juice in position 2, and tea in position 3, as this setup adheres to both conditions provided:


- Soy-milk is to the left of juice.
- Juice is not to the right of tea.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

Lv8-1x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Apply the first condition
The first condition states that ""the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade."" This means the person drinking lemonade must be either to the left of or in the same position as the person drinking cola, but since they are different beverages, it implies lemonade can't be to the right of cola. However, considering we have three positions and almond-milk also needs to be placed, this condition primarily tells us that lemonade cannot be in position 3 if cola is in position 1 or 2.


## Step 2: Apply the second condition
The second condition states that ""the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola."" This means cola must be to the left of almond-milk. Given there are three positions, this limits our arrangements significantly because if cola were in position 3, almond-milk would have no place to its right.


## Step 3: Combine both conditions
Considering both conditions together:
- If cola is in position 1, lemonade must be in position 1 or 2 (but since they can't occupy the same space and we need to satisfy the second condition as well), this creates a conflict unless almond-milk is in position 3.
- Given that cola cannot be in position 3 (because almond-milk needs to be to its right), cola must be in either position 1 or 2.


## Step 4: Determine possible positions
Given the constraints:
- If cola is in position 1, lemonade could be in position 2 (since it can't be to the right of cola based on a strict interpretation of the first condition and considering we need space for almond-milk), and almond-milk must then be in position 3.
- However, upon reevaluation of the conditions with precision:
1. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade implies lemonade can be to the left or in the same column as cola but given they are distinct, it suggests a specific order based on their placement rules.
2. Almond-milk being to the right of cola means cola cannot be in the last position.


## Step 5: Finalize positions
Considering the misinterpretation and clarifying:
- The condition that ""the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade"" actually suggests that lemonade can be before or with cola but since they are different, it implies an order where lemonade's placement affects cola's possible position. However, this was initially misapplied.
- Correctly applying both rules:
1. Lemonade cannot be after cola (as per the corrected understanding of the first rule).
2. Almond-milk must be after cola.


Given these conditions and correcting the approach for determining the exact order based on the provided clues:


The correct sequence considering all constraints would actually place lemonade first (since it can't be after cola if we are to satisfy both conditions given), followed by cola, and then almond-milk. This satisfies both that cola is not to the left of lemonade (lemonade is to the left) and almond-milk is to the right of cola.


The final answer is: 
#############
|            |    1     |  2   |      3      |
| Beverage   | Lemonade | Cola | Almond-milk |

Lv8-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the possible positions for the Colombian.
Given that the Colombian is in an even position, there are two possibilities: position 2.


## Step 2: Consider the restriction related to the Malaysian's position.
The Colombian cannot be to the right of the Malaysian. This means if the Colombian is in position 2, the Malaysian must be either in position 1 or 2 as well, but since the Colombian is already determined to be in an even position and there can only be one person per position, this clue actually helps us determine that the Malaysian cannot be in position 3 when the Colombian is in position 2. Thus, possible arrangements considering both clues could involve the Brazilian taking any remaining spot.


## Step 3: Apply the first clue to determine a fixed position for the Colombian.
Since the Colombian must be in an even position and there are only three positions (1, 2, 3), with even positions being 2, we can place the Colombian in position 2.


## Step 4: Arrange the remaining nationalities around the fixed Colombian position while respecting the second clue.
Given that the Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian and must be in an even position (which we've determined to be position 2), the Malaysian cannot be in position 3 because then the Colombian would indeed be to the left, which contradicts our setup. However, considering the misinterpretation in step 2 regarding the positioning based on the clues provided, let's correct the approach:


- The Colombian is in an even position (position 2).
- The Colombian cannot be to the right of the Malaysian, meaning the Malaysian must be either in position 1 or 3 for this condition to always hold true because if the Malaysian were in position 2, it would violate the first clue directly.


## Step 5: Finalize the arrangement.
Considering both clues correctly:
- If the Colombian is in position 2 (the only even position available), and
- The Malaysian cannot be to the right of the Colombian but must precede or follow in a way that respects the ""not to the right"" condition, the correct interpretation should focus on feasible placements respecting these rules.


Given the constraints:
1. Colombian in an even position means position 2.
2. Malaysian not being to the right of the Colombian actually implies the Malaysian can be in position 1 or could be considered for position 3 if we were strictly interpreting ""not to the right"" without considering the direct placement implications based on available slots.


However, correctly applying both clues with strict logic:
- The Colombian must be in an even position, so they are in position 2.
- Since the Malaysian cannot be to the right of the Colombian, and given there's a misunderstanding in directly applying these rules to specific positions without considering all implications of ""even"" placement and relative positioning:


Correct interpretation should consider direct placements:
1. The Brazilian can take any remaining spot not taken by the other two nationalities.


Thus, with strict adherence to provided clues without overcomplicating the logic based on available information:


The final answer is: 
#############

Lv8-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break it down step by step based on the given clues.


## Step 1: Determine the order based on the first clue.
The first clue tells us that the person whose hobby is reading is to the left of the person whose hobby is writing. This means the order for these two hobbies is: Reading, Writing.


## Step 2: Incorporate the second clue into our solution.
The second clue states that the person whose hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person whose hobby is reading. Given the first clue's information (Reading, Writing), if Video-Games cannot be to the right of Reading, it must either be to the left of Reading or in between Reading and Writing.


## Step 3: Consider all possible positions for Video-Games.
Given that Reading must come before Writing, we have two main configurations to consider based on where Video-Games can fit:
1. Video-Games, Reading, Writing
2. Reading, Video-Games, Writing


The configuration ""Video-Games, Reading, Writing"" satisfies both clues because Reading is still to the left of Writing, and Video-Games is not to the right of Reading.


## Step 4: Finalize the solution.
Since we have determined that one valid order is Video-Games, Reading, Writing, let's assign these hobbies to the numbers in the table:


|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Hobby   | Video-Games | Reading | Writing |

Lv8-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:


1. The fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of soul.
2. The fan of soul is in an even position.


From statement 2, we know the fan of soul can only be in positions 2, since those are the even positions available.


Given this, let's place soul in position 2 as it's the only even position:


|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   |      | Soul |     |


Now, from statement 1, we understand that funk cannot be to the right of soul. Since soul is in position 2, funk must be in position 1 (because it can't be to the right of soul).


So, we place funk in position 1:


|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk | Soul |     |


The only genre left is pop, which must then go into position 3:


|               |  1   |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk | Soul | Pop |


Therefore, the solution table with '#############' around it is:

Lv8-1x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The fan of trance is on the left of the fan of techno.
2. The fan of techno is not to the right of the fan of electronic.

From statement 1, we know the order for trance and techno is: Trance -> Techno (with possibly electronic in between).

Statement 2 tells us that Techno cannot be after Electronic, meaning Electronic must either be before Techno or they could be in a sequence where Electronic is not directly involved with Techno's position relative to Trance.

Given these rules:

- The only arrangement that fits both conditions and includes all three genres (since each person prefers a different genre) is:
  - Electronic cannot be after Techno because then Techno would be to the right of Electronic, violating rule 2. 
  - Trance must be before Techno as per rule 1.
  
Thus, considering all possibilities:

- If we try placing Electronic first (since it can't be last due to rule 2), followed by Trance and then Techno: Electronic -> Trance -> Techno. This satisfies both conditions because Trance is indeed to the left of Techno, and Techno is not to the right of Electronic.

So, the solution table should look like this:

#############

Lv8-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking milk is not to the left of the person drinking Fanta.
2. The person drinking Fanta is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk.

From clue 2, we know the order must be either Lemonade-Fanta-Milk or Milk-Fanta-Lemonade because Fanta has to be between the other two.

However, from clue 1, if the person drinking milk were on the left (first position), it would mean the person drinking Fanta is to their right, which directly contradicts the condition that the person drinking milk cannot be to the left of the person drinking Fanta. Therefore, Milk cannot be in the first position.

Given this, the only possible arrangement that satisfies both clues is:

Lemonade - Fanta - Milk

So, the solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

Lv8-1x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
2. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.

From statement 1, we know the order for surfing and water-polo is: water-polo -> surfing.

From statement 2, since water-polo cannot be to the left of cycling, but we already have water-polo on the left in our partial solution (water-polo -> surfing), cycling must be on the left. This means the overall order is: cycling -> water-polo -> surfing.
