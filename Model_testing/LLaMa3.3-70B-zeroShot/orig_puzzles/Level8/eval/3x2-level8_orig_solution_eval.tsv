Lv8-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
This means the person watching documentary movies is either to the right of the person driving the helicopter or they are the same person.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
This means the person watching documentary movies cannot be on the right side, so they must be on the left side. The person with the gardening hobby must be on the right side.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     |             |           |

From clue 2, we know the person with the gardening hobby is on the right side. We also know the person watching documentary movies is on the left side.

| Transport     |             |           |

The person watching documentary movies cannot be driving the helicopter (from clue 1), so they must be driving the quad-bike. The person with the gardening hobby must be driving the helicopter.

The only movie-genre left is zombie, which must be on the right side. The only hobby left is skydiving, which must be on the left side.

Lv8-3x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


1. The person drinking Mirinda is in an even position.
   - Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), and position 2 is the only even position, the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 2.

2. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the American.
   - This implies that either the American is driving the jet-ski, or the jet-ski driver is in position 1 (since if they were in position 2, they would be to the right of anyone in position 1).

3. The American is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
   - Given that the Mirinda drinker is in position 2, this means the American must be in position 1.

From clue 3 and knowing the positions of the Mirinda drinker and the American, we can start filling out the table:


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          |  Mirinda   |
| Nationality   |  American|            |
| Transport     |          |            |

Now, let's address clue 2 with our current understanding:
- Since the American is in position 1 and cannot be to the right of the jet-ski driver (according to clue 2), the jet-ski must also be in position 1. This leaves the snowmobile for position 2.

Finally, we have the nationalities and beverages left to place:
- We know the American is in position 1.
- The only beverage left for position 1 is water (since Mirinda is already placed in position 2).
- The only nationality left for position 2 is Spanish.

So, our completed table looks like this:


#############

Lv8-3x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions step by step.


## Step 1: Apply condition 1
The person drinking fanta is not to the right of the french. This means if the french person is in column 1, then the fanta drinker can only be in column 1 as well (because there's no position to the left of column 1). If the french person is in column 2, then the fanta drinker must be in column 1.


## Step 2: Apply condition 2
The project-manager is not the french. This gives us two possibilities for each column regarding job and nationality but does not directly tell us which beverage they prefer.


## Step 3: Apply condition 3
The manager is somewhere to the left of the person drinking water. This means if the manager is in column 1, then water must be in column 2 (because there's no position further to the right than column 2).


Given these conditions:


- From step 3, we know that if a manager is in column 1, water must be in column 2.
- Condition 1 implies that fanta cannot be in column 2 if the french person is in column 1. But since we have to place fanta somewhere and considering condition 3 (manager to the left of water), one possible arrangement could involve placing the manager who drinks fanta in column 1, which then means the french person must also be in column 1 to satisfy condition 1.
- However, this creates a conflict because if the manager is french and drinks fanta, it doesn't directly violate any rules but it limits our options for satisfying all conditions simultaneously.


## Step 4: Combining Conditions
Considering all conditions together:


- The french person cannot be the project-manager (condition 2).
- If the manager (who must be to the left of water) is in column 1, and assuming this manager could potentially be french (since we're trying to satisfy all conditions), then the beverage for column 1 would have to be fanta to not violate condition 1.
- However, since there are only two nationalities, two jobs, and two beverages, and given that the project-manager cannot be french, it means the manager must be one of the nationalities. If we assume the manager is Australian (to satisfy the condition that the project-manager is not French without immediately assigning nationality), this allows us to place an Australian manager in column 1 who drinks fanta.


## Step 5: Final Placement
Given these deductions:


- Column 1 must have the manager (to be to the left of water) who drinks fanta.
- Since the manager cannot be to the right of water, and assuming the manager is in column 1 drinking fanta, column 2 must have water.
- The french person cannot be the project-manager, so if the manager is Australian, then the french person must be the project-manager or vice versa regarding jobs but considering nationalities and beverages as well.


## Step 6: Finalizing Nationality and Job for Each Column
Given that the project-manager is not french, we have two possibilities:
1. An Australian manager who drinks fanta (column 1) and a French project-manager who drinks water (column 2).
2. Or the reverse in terms of job but considering our conditions, this seems to fit best.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |        2        |

Lv8-3x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The architect is on the left of the Spanish.
2. The person whose hobby is card-games is not to the right of the Dutch.

From clue 1, we know the architect cannot be Spanish because they are to the left of the Spanish person. This means the architect must be Dutch (since there are only two nationalities), and the Spanish person must be on the right.

So, we have:
```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Job           | Architect |            |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Spanish    |
```

Now, let's consider the hobbies and clue 2. Since the person who likes card-games cannot be to the right of the Dutch (and the Dutch is on the left), the card-games hobby must belong to the Dutch architect.

The only job left for the Spanish person is dressmaker, and since singing is the only hobby left, it must belong to the Spanish dressmaker.

So, we fill in the hobbies:
```
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Card-games| Singing    |

Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv8-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


Given:
1. Hobbies: chess, puzzles
2. Sports: lacrosse, parkour
3. Transport: scooter, trike


Clues:
1. The person driving the trike is not to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.
2. The person whose sport is parkour is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles.


## Step 1: Apply the first clue
From the first clue, we know the trike cannot be to the right of puzzles. This means if puzzles are in column 1, the trike could be in column 1 or 2 (since it can't be to the right), but if puzzles were in column 2, the trike must also be in column 2 because it cannot be to the right of puzzles.


## Step 2: Apply the second clue
The second clue tells us parkour is to the right of puzzles. This means puzzles cannot be in column 2 because there would be no space to the right for parkour.


## Step 3: Determine the position of puzzles and parkour
From step 2, we conclude puzzles must be in column 1. Therefore, parkour must be in column 2 as it is to the right of puzzles.


## Step 4: Position the trike
Given that puzzles are in column 1 and from clue 1 (the person driving the trike is not to the right of the person whose hobby is puzzles), the trike can only be in column 1 because if it were in column 2, it would be to the right of puzzles.


## Step 5: Fill in the remaining information
With puzzles and the trike in column 1, and parkour in column 2:
- Column 1 must have puzzles as the hobby and trike as the transport.
- Since parkour is a sport in column 2, lacrosse (the other sport) must be in column 1 because each person has a different sport.
- Chess (the remaining hobby) must be in column 2 because each person has a different hobby.
- The scooter (the remaining transport) must be in column 2 because each person uses a different means of transport.


## Step 6: Construct the final table
Based on the deductions:
|             |    1     |    2    |
| Hobby       | puzzles | chess  |
| Sport       | lacrosse| parkour|

Lv8-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
2. The Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple.

Given:
- Foods: Cranberry, Pineapple
- Movie Genres: Fantasy, Scientific
- Nationalities: Italian, Mexican

Let's fill in the table based on the clues:

From clue 2, we know the Mexican is to the left of the person eating pineapple. This means the Mexican cannot be eating pineapple (because they are to the left of the pineapple eater), so the Mexican must be eating cranberry.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Cranberry| Pineapple  |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   | Mexican  | Italian    |

Now, considering clue 1, which states that the person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Given our current setup, if the person watching fantasy movies was on the right (Italian), it would violate this rule because the cranberry eater (Mexican) is already on the left. Therefore, the Mexican must be watching scientific movies (to avoid being to the left of a fantasy movie watcher who doesn't exist in this scenario but based on the logic given), and the Italian must be watching fantasy movies.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Cranberry| Pineapple  |

| Nationality   | Mexican  | Italian    |

Therefore, the solution to the puzzle is:

Lv8-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement carefully.


From statement 1: ""the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the person eating apple,"" it implies that either the person eating an apple is to the right of the person driving a snowmobile, or they are in the same column (since there are only two columns), with the possibility that one could be above the other.


From statement 2: ""the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi,"" this means the person playing ice-hockey cannot be in the left column if the taxi is in the right column, but since there are only two columns and two people, it implies that ice-hockey must be associated with the person who does not use a taxi.


Given these constraints:


- If we place ""apple"" in column 1 (to satisfy the condition that the snowmobile driver isn't to its right), then ""pomegranate"" goes into column 2.
- Since the snowmobile cannot be to the right of apple, and assuming each category has a unique association per person (meaning one food, one sport, one transport per column/person), we can place ""snowmobile"" in column 1 with ""apple"".
- This leaves ""taxi"" for column 2. Given that ice-hockey is to the right of taxi (and thus associated with the second column because taxi must be in the first column for this condition to make sense given our setup), and knowing cricket would then go into the first column, we can start filling out the table.


Given these deductions:


|             |      1      |     2      |
| Food        | Apple      | Pomegranate|

Lv8-3x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


1. The person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian.
2. The person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Colombian.

From clue 2, we know the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be on the left, and since there are only two people (and thus one on the left and one on the right), this means:

- Left: Puzzles
- Right: Writing (since writing is the other hobby)

Now, considering clue 1, which states the person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian, we have two possibilities for the movie genres based on the placement of nationalities:


## Step 1: Determine Nationality Placement Based on Clue 2
Given that puzzles are on the left and writing is on the right, and considering clue 2 (the person whose hobby is puzzles is on the left of the Colombian), we can deduce the Colombian cannot be on the left. Thus, the Colombian must be on the right.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 1 to Determine Movie Genre Placement
Clue 1 says the person watching western movies is not to the left of the Colombian. Since we've established the Colombian is on the right, this means the person watching western movies must also be on the right or there would be no one to the left of them for this condition to apply meaningfully in a two-person scenario. However, given our previous step's conclusion and considering we only have two slots, if the Colombian is on the right and enjoys western (to satisfy being not to the left of themselves), then:


- Right: Western, Writing, Colombian

This leaves us with the other slot being for puzzles, superhero movies, and by elimination, Japanese nationality.


## Step 3: Construct Final Table
Given all deductions:

|               |     1     |     2     |

Lv8-3x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements step by step.


1. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
2. The fan of classical is not to the left of the person driving the train.

From statement 1, we know that ""epic"" must be to the right of ""classical"". This means ""classical"" cannot be in column 2 if ""epic"" is also in column 2 because there's no position to its right within the same column.


Given the genres and transport options:
- Movie-Genres: epic, family
- Music-Genres: classical, disco
- Transport: train, van


From statement 2, since ""classical"" cannot be to the left of ""train"", if we place ""train"" in column 1, ""classical"" must then be in column 2. But this contradicts our first deduction unless ""epic"" is also in column 2, which would not satisfy the condition of being to the right of ""classical"". Therefore, ""train"" should be in column 2 for ""classical"" not to be to its left but still allowing ""epic"" to be to the right of ""classical"".


Let's fill out the table based on these deductions:


If we place ""classical"" in column 1 and considering statement 1, ""epic"" must then be in column 2. Given this setup, ""train"" should also be in column 2 to satisfy statement 2 (since ""classical"" is not to the left of ""train"" but rather to its right or in the same column as per our initial misinterpretation). However, realizing that ""classical"" can indeed be to the left of ""train"" if we consider columns and rows independently for each type of preference, let's correct the understanding:


- If ""classical"" is in column 1 (for Music-Genre), it satisfies being not to the left of ""train"" only if ""train"" is also in column 1 or if there's a specific arrangement that respects both conditions.


Given these conditions and realizing we must satisfy all given statements simultaneously, let's re-evaluate:


1. Epic to the right of Classical.
2. Classical not to the left of Train.


If ""classical"" is in column 1 (Music-Genre), and considering ""epic"" must be to its right, then ""epic"" should indeed be in column 2 for Movie-Genre. For Transport, if ""train"" cannot be to the left of ""classical"", but must be considered with the constraint that includes being in a different column or row setup, we see:


The only way to satisfy both conditions while considering all options is by having ""classical"" and one other category in column 1, and ""epic"" with its corresponding categories in column 2. Since ""train"" cannot be to the left of ""classical"", it suggests a specific arrangement where perhaps ""van"" could accompany ""classical"".


However, we must remember that each person has distinct preferences for movie, music, and transport, leading us to correctly place ""family"" with ""train"" since ""epic"" is already determined to be in column 2 due to its relation with ""classical"". Thus, the correct arrangement respecting all given statements should have ""classical"", ""family"", and ""van"" in column 1, and ""epic"", ""disco"", and ""train"" in column 2.


Therefore, the final solution table looks like this:


#############

Lv8-3x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the goat.
2. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person driving the car.
3. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position.

From clue 2, we know the hamster's owner must be in position 1 because they have to be to the left of the car driver, and there are only two positions. 

Clue 3 tells us that the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position, which means they can only be in position 1 since it's the only odd position available.

Given these points:

- The hamster's owner must eat pomegranate (because they're in position 1, and pomegranate is associated with an odd position).
- The car driver cannot be the hamster's owner (from clue 2), so the car driver must be in position 2.
- Since the goat's owner cannot be to the left of the hamster's owner (clue 1), and we've established the hamster's owner is in position 1, the goat's owner must be in position 2. However, this contradicts our initial interpretation based on the clues provided. Let's correct the approach considering all clues properly:

Correcting the Approach:
- The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position (position 1).
- The hamster's owner is to the left of the car driver (meaning if the car is in position 2, the hamster must be in position 1).
- Since the hamster's owner cannot be to the right of the goat's owner, and considering our setup, it means the goat's owner must also be considered in relation to the transport and food clues correctly.

Re-evaluating:
- If the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position (1), and this is also where the hamster's owner is because they're to the left of the car driver (who must then be in position 2, driving a car), we can start filling in the table.

Given the clues again with corrected understanding:
- Position 1 has pomegranate and the hamster.
- The car is in position 2, driven by the goat's owner because the hamster's owner (in position 1) must be to the left of the car driver.

Thus, we have:
- Food: Pomegranate for position 1, which leaves lime for position 2.
- Pet: Hamster for position 1, goat for position 2.
- Transport: Motorbike for position 1 (since car is in position 2), and car for position 2.

The final solution table looks like this:

#############
|             |      1      |  2   |
