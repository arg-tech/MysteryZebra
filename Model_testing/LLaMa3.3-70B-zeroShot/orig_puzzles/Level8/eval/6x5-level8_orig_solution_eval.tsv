#############

Note: The solution was obtained by carefully analyzing the given clues and using logical deductions to fill in the table. 

Here's a brief explanation of the steps taken:

1. From clue 8, we know the fan of soul is in the middle, so soul must be in column 3.
2. From clue 12, rock is on the left or right of gospel, and from clue 27, r&b is not the person driving the train. This helps us place rock and gospel.
3. Clue 16 tells us gospel is to the right of subway, and clue 1 says subway is not r&b. This helps us narrow down the options for column 4.
4. Using clues 9, 26, and 32, we can determine the order of quad-bike, car, and subway.
5. Clue 19 tells us lime is to the left of peas, and clue 31 says papaya is to the left of japanese. This helps us place lime, peas, and papaya.
6. With clue 22, guinea-pig is to the left of japanese, which means german must be in column 3 or to the left.
7. Clue 10 tells us rock is not to the left of train, so rock must be in column 2.
8. From clues 4 and 35, sports movies are on the left or right of quad-bike.
9. Using clue 21, we can place kale to the right of time-travel movies.
10. Finally, by using all the remaining clues and making logical deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table.

Note that this is a complex puzzle with many interacting constraints, and solving it requires careful analysis and attention to detail."	{'food': ['cranberry', 'lime', 'peas', 'papaya', 'kale'], 'movie-genre': ['animation', 'sports', 'family', 'time-travel', 'disaster'], 'music-genre': ['ambient', 'rock', 'soul', 'gospel', 'r&b'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'british', 'german', 'thai', 'japanese'], 'pet': ['dog', 'hamster', 'guinea-pig', 'turtle', 'goldfish'], 'transport': ['quad-bike', 'car', 'subway', 'train', 'trike']}	True	12	False
Lv8-6x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the information step by step.


Given Clues:
1. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the videographer.
2. The Colombian is not to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
3. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
4. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
5. The Canadian is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
6. The person who's hobby is sudoku is in an even position.
7. The person who's hobby is board-games is not to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
8. The person eating papaya is on the left or right of the freelancer.
9. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the freelancer and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
10. The person eating strawberry is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
11. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere between the person eating cauliflower and the person who's hobby is board-games.
12. The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
13. The person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person who's sport is parkour.
14. The person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person eating peach.
15. The Indonesian is on the left or right of the person driving the car.
16. The person driving the van is on the far right.
17. The Canadian is on the right of the Indonesian.
18. The person eating potato is the Dutch.
19. The person who's hobby is photography is not to the right of the pilot.
20. The person driving the car is the person eating papaya.
21. The Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
22. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the videographer.
23. The person driving the car is somewhere between the Pakistani and the person driving the jet-ski.
24. The Pakistani is on the far left or far right.
25. The pilot is on the left or right of the Canadian.
26. The person who's sport is cycling is between the person eating strawberry and the pilot.
27. The person eating potato is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
28. The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the Dutch.
29. The person who's sport is cycling is the videographer.
30. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the freelancer.
31. The person driving the car is not to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.


Let's start filling in based on direct clues:
- From clue 16, the van driver is at position 5.
- Clue 24 suggests the Pakistani could be at either end; given other constraints about positions and nationalities, we'll have to determine this as we go along.
- Clue 18 tells us the Dutch person eats potato.
- Clue 20 says the car driver eats papaya.


Given these are complex clues, let's analyze further:
- The Canadian is on the right of the Indonesian (clue 17), and considering clue 25, the pilot must be near them. Since the person who's sport is cycling (the videographer) is between the strawberry eater and the pilot (clue 26), this gives us a starting point for some combinations.
- The Colombian being to the right of rock-climbing (clue 21) helps in placing some hobbies relative to nationalities.


Direct Placements:
1. **Position 5:** Van driver
2. **Eats Potato:** Dutch


Now, let's solve it step by step with deductions:


1. From clue 14, cauliflower is before peach.
2. Photography is between cauliflower and board-games (clue 11), and photography is also before videographer (clue 22).
3. The person who eats strawberry cannot be after sudoku (clue 10), suggesting strawberry's position might be limited given sudoku must be in an even position (clue 6).


Given the complexity, let's consider key placements:
- **Board-games and Parkour**: Given parkour is to the right of board-games (clue 3) and considering taxi's placement relative to videographer (clue 1), we need to find a spot that accommodates these conditions along with sudoku being after taxi (clue 4).
- **Sudoku in an even position** limits its possible placements significantly, especially considering it cannot be parkour (clue 13) and must be after taxi.


Using Elimination:
- Since the Pakistani can only be at the ends (clue 24), and given other constraints about nationalities and jobs, we'll use elimination to place individuals.


Let's attempt a solution based on deductions:


Given all clues and attempting to fit them together logically while respecting the format requirements for the answer:

2. Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the owner of the snake, and clue 2 says the owner of the snake is in an even position. This means the snake must be in position 4, and soy-milk in position 5 or further right.
3. Clue 16 places mirinda between the chef and the person driving the bus. Since the bus can't be in position 1 (airplane is more likely to be there), we place mirinda in position 2, with the chef in position 1 or 3.
4. Clue 25 says mirinda is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla, who is the freelancer (clue 21). So, the freelancer must be in position 1, and mirinda in position 2.
