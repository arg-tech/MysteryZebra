Note: The solution is based on the given clues and might not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the puzzle. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. From clue 15, the Malaysian is the person who's sport is basketball.
2. From clue 28, the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
3. From clue 12, the Malaysian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
4. From clue 21, the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
5. From clue 2, the person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
6. From clue 7, the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
7. From clue 36, the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
8. From clue 38, the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
9. From clue 25, the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the Brazilian.
10. From clue 26, the Malaysian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

By combining these clues and using a process of elimination, we can fill in the rest of the table. Note that some clues are used to confirm the solution rather than to directly deduce it. 

This puzzle requires careful attention to detail and a systematic approach to solve. It's recommended to use a step-by-step method, filling in the most obvious information first and then using the remaining clues to make further deductions."	{'hobby': ['hiking', 'gardening', 'woodworking', 'reading', 'chess', 'board-games', 'singing'], 'movie-genre': ['time-travel', 'documentary', 'animation', 'superhero', 'martial-arts', 'western', 'musical'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'australian', 'malaysian', 'brazilian', 'pakistani', 'canadian', 'turkish'], 'sport': ['soccer', 'basketball', 'cycling', 'skateboarding', 'weightlifting', 'tennis', 'cricket']}	True	4	False

To give you an idea of how I approached the problem, here's a high-level overview:

1. Start with the most restrictive conditions, such as the positions of specific nationalities, hobbies, or pets.
2. Use these initial constraints to narrow down the possibilities for other variables.
3. Gradually build upon the established relationships between variables, using the given clues to guide the process.
4. Continuously verify that each new addition satisfies all previously applied conditions.

This iterative approach allows you to systematically reduce the solution space until a valid arrangement is found."	{'hobby': ['baking', 'board-games', 'drawing', 'rock-climbing', 'gardening', 'collecting', 'woodworking'], 'movie-genre': ['action', 'satire', 'adventure', 'disaster', 'superhero', 'family', 'spy'], 'nationality': ['dutch', 'british', 'german', 'thai', 'japanese', 'indonesian', 'malaysian'], 'pet': ['goldfish', 'cat', 'ferret', 'turtle', 'rabbit', 'rat', 'fish']}	True	7	False

Lv8-4x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


Given the complexity and the number of clues, we'll start with the most direct information and build from there.


1. From clue 10, the scientist is on the left of the analyst.
2. Clue 22 states the fisherman is somewhere to the left of the scientist.
3. Clue 24 says the fisherman is on the left of the owner of the rat.
4. The owner of the rabbit is in an odd position (clue 11).
5. The person watching epic movies is in an odd position (clue 23).


Let's start placing people based on these clues and others:


- From clue 21, the australian is not to the left of the journalist.
- Clue 20 states the journalist is the owner of the frog.
- Clue 14 says the owner of the frog is on the right of the analyst.


So, we have an initial sequence: fisherman - scientist - analyst - journalist (frog owner).


Clue 13 indicates the owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony.
Clue 12 says the owner of the fish is not to the right of the owner of the pony, reinforcing clue 13.


Given these clues and considering the positions, let's try to fit in other professions and preferences:


- Clue 25 states the person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the pakistani.
- Clue 4 says the owner of the fish is not to the right of the nigerian.
- Clue 9 places the nigerian between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching satire movies.


We know from clue 19 that the person watching satire movies is somewhere between the owner of the rabbit and the person watching adventure movies.


Let's place the nationalities and movie genres based on these clues:


1. The pakistani can't be in position 7 because the crime watcher is to their right (clue 1), and there must be someone watching crime movies after them.
2. Clue 8 says the mystery movies watcher is to the right of the fish owner, and clue 7 says the epic movies watcher is also to the right of the fish owner.


Considering all clues about positions relative to each other and using elimination:


The final solution table looks like this:

#############
| Job           | Analyst    | Coach      | Doctor     | Fisherman  | Journalist | Nurse      | Scientist |
| Movie-Genre   | Western    | Martial-Arts| Adventure  | Crime      | Satire     | Mystery    | Epic      |
| Nationality   | Spanish    | Pakistani  | Australian | Nigerian   | Malaysian  | Canadian   | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Rabbit     | Snake      | Pony       | Fish       | Frog       | Rat        | Mouse     |
