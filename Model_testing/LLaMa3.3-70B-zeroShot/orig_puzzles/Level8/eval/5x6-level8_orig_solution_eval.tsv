#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the puzzle. 

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

1. Started with clue 36, which states that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left or far right. Since there's already a 'sy' in the movie-genre row at column 6, I placed skydiving at column 1.

2. Used clue 30 to place the person eating pepper (collecting) at column 4.

3. From clue 11, mirinda is between carrot and gardening. Placed mirinda at column 3 and pomegranate as food at column 6 (clue 3).

4. With clue 9, cabbage is to the left of carrot. Placed cabbage at column 2 and carrot at column 3.

5. Clue 14 states baking is to the left of fantasy movies. Placed baking at column 4.

6. Clue 27 says fantasy movies are on the left or right of the skateboard. Placed fantasy movies at column 3.

7. Using clue 8, scooter is to the left of coffee. Placed scooter at column 4 and coffee at column 5 (but later moved due to other clues).

8. Clue 13 places scooter to the left of gardening. Gardening can't be at column 1 or 2 (due to skydiving and magic-tricks), so placed it at column 6.

9. From clue 15, helicopter is not to the left of tram. Placed helicopter at column 6.

10. Clue 20 places sprite to the right of pepper. sprite can only be at column 6.

11. Clue 22 says sprite is not to the left of scientific movies. scientific movies are at column 5.

12. With clue 28, spy movies are to the right of drawing. spy movies can only be at column 4 (between cabbage and fantasy).

13. Clue 10 states family movies are with tram. Placed family movies at column 2.

14. Finally, placed the remaining options in their respective positions based on the given clues.

Note: Some clues were used to verify the solution rather than derive it directly.

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and their corresponding numbers. Each clue was carefully analyzed to ensure that it was correctly applied to the table.


Here's a brief explanation of how some of the clues were used:


1. Clue 14 states that the person drinking tea is on the far left or far right. Since tea is not on the far left (Clue 15), it must be on the far right.


2. Clue 11 states that the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the snake. This means bird and snake cannot be in positions 5 and 6, or 6 and 1, respectively.


3. Clue 40 states that the owner of the goat is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since ice-hockey must be to the left of soccer (Clue 8), and water is to the left of sprite (Clue 43), the possible positions for the goat are limited.


4. Clue 21 states that the person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. This helps place zombie in position 1, as it cannot be in position 6.


5. Clue 33 states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's sport is soccer. Since soccer must be to the right of water (Clue 17), and water is in position 1, soccer must be in a later position.


6. Clue 44 states that the person watching musical movies is the owner of the pony. This helps place musical and pony in positions 5 and 5, respectively.

#############

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may not be unique. However, this solution satisfies all the conditions mentioned in the puzzle. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

1. From clue 37, the polish person is on the far left.
2. From clue 26, the person who's hobby is collecting is the owner of the goldfish. Combining this with clue 33, the owner of the goldfish is in an odd position, so the person who's hobby is collecting must be in either position 1 or 3. However, from clue 31, the person who's hobby is collecting is not to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling, and from clue 25, the indian is not to the right of the person drinking 7up. This implies that the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 1.
3. From clue 23, the person watching sports movies is between the person who's hobby is collecting and the person who's hobby is puzzles. So, the person watching sports movies must be in position 2 or 3 (but not 4, since the person who's hobby is puzzles can't be to the right of the person watching sports movies). However, from clue 22, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Combining this with clue 41, the owner of the fish is somewhere between the person drinking juice and the owner of the chinchilla, it's more likely that the person watching sports movies is in position 2.
4. From clue 38, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person watching musical movies. Combining this with clue 32, the owner of the frog is on the left of the person watching musical movies, and clue 15, the person drinking juice is on the right of the owner of the frog, it can be deduced that the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 4.
5. From clue 9, the owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the indian. Combining this with clue 42, the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies, it can be deduced that the owner of the bird must be in position 6.
6. From clue 5, the owner of the bird is the person watching time-travel movies.
7. The remaining clues are used to fill in the gaps and ensure that all conditions are satisfied.

This solution was obtained by using a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination, applying each of the given clues to narrow down the possibilities until a unique solution emerged. The steps involved are too numerous and complex to detail here, but they included:

1. Starting with the most restrictive clues (e.g., those that specify a direct relationship between two items) and using them to establish initial positions or relationships.
2. Gradually adding more clues to refine these positions and relationships, ensuring consistency across all given conditions.
3. Utilizing the process of elimination to narrow down options for each category when direct clues were not available.
4. Iteratively applying all relevant clues to ensure that no rule was violated, making adjustments as necessary until a solution that satisfied all conditions was found.
