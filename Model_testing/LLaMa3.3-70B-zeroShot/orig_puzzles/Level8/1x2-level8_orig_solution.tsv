Lv8-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given conditions:


1. The fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of funk.
2. The statement ""the fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of funk"" seems redundant or incorrect as written, but it implies that since there are only two positions and the fan of d&b must be to the right of the fan of funk, the fan of funk cannot also be to the right (which would contradict the first condition). Thus, we interpret this as reinforcing the first point without adding new information.


Given these conditions:


- The fan of funk must be in position 1 because they cannot be to the right of themselves or anyone else based on the corrected understanding of the rules.
- The fan of d&b must then be in position 2 since they are to the right of the fan of funk.

The solution table should look like this:


#############
|               |  1   |  2  |
| Music-Genre   | funk | d&b |

Lv8-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


1. The person watching musical movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching musical movies is not to the left of the person watching satire movies.


Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two genres (musical and satire), and from point 1, we know the person watching musical movies must be in position 2 because it's the far right. 


So, if musical is in position 2, then satire must be in position 1 because there are only two positions.


The final solution table looks like this:


#############
|               |   1    |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Musical |

Lv8-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:


1. The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. This clue doesn't add new information since it's already covered by clue 1 that implies their positions are relative, with the goldfish owner being to the left.
3. The owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. This essentially repeats the implication of clue 1.


Given there are only two pets and two positions (1 and 2), and based on clue 1, the arrangement must be:


- Goldfish in position 1
- Hedgehog in position 2


This is because the goldfish owner must be to the left of the hedgehog owner, which can only happen if the goldfish is in position 1.


Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|       |    1     |    2     |
| Pet   | Goldfish | Hedgehog |

Lv8-1x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From statement 1, we know that ""the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the scooter"". This statement seems incomplete or incorrectly transcribed as it mentions ""scooter##8"" without clear context. However, considering typical logic puzzle structures and the given information about two means of transport (scooter and train), we'll focus on statement 2 for clarity: ""the person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the scooter.""


Given there are only two positions (1 and 2) and two modes of transport, and based on statement 2:


- The scooter must be in position 1 because it cannot be to the right of the train according to the given logic.
- The train, therefore, must be in position 2 since it is to the right of the scooter.


Thus, the solution table looks like this:


#############
|             |    1    |   2   |
| Transport   | Scooter | Train |

Lv8-1x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we can follow the given clues step by step:


## Step 1: Identify the hobbies and their possible positions based on clue 1.
The first clue tells us that the person whose hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person whose hobby is hiking. This means the person with the hiking hobby must be either in position 1 or 2, but since the second clue specifies that the hiker is on the far right, we can conclude the hiker is in position 2.


## Step 2: Apply clue 2 to determine the final positions.
The second clue directly tells us that the person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right. This means the hiking hobby must be associated with position 2.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the video-games hobby based on the previous steps.
Given that the hiking hobby is in position 2 and from clue 1, we understand that the video-games hobby cannot be to the right of the hiking hobby. Since there are only two positions and hiking occupies the second one, video-games must be in position 1.


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |      1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | video-games | hiking |

Lv8-1x2-6	"Let's analyze the given clues:


1. The owner of the goldfish is in an odd position.
Since there are only two positions (1 and 2), the odd position refers to position 1.


2. The owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rat.
This statement seems redundant, but it implies that the owner of the rat cannot be in position 1 because then there would be no one to the left. However, given the structure of the puzzle and the first clue, we can infer that this means the rat's owner must be in an even position (2) since if they were in position 1, it would contradict the premise as there's no ""left"" of position 1 to compare with.


Given these clues:


- The goldfish is in position 1.
- The rat is in position 2.


Therefore, the solution table looks like this:


#############
|       |    1     |  2  |
| Pet   | Goldfish | Rat |

Lv8-1x2-7	"Let's analyze the given statements:


1. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train.
2. The person driving the train is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.


From statement 1, we know the order is: train, jet-ski


Since there are only two means of transport and they are in positions 1 and 2, the solution must be:


|             |   1   |    2    |
| Transport   | train | jet-ski |


So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-1x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, we can analyze the given statements.


## Step 1: Analyzing the first statement
The first statement says that the person whose hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. This means in a two-person setup, the chess enthusiast must be in position 1, and the magic-tricks enthusiast must be in position 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing the second statement
The second statement reinforces the first by stating that the person whose hobby is chess is not to the right of the person whose hobby is magic-tricks. This again supports the arrangement where chess is to the left of magic-tricks.


## Step 3: Combining the information
Since both statements lead to the same conclusion, we can confidently place the chess enthusiast in position 1 and the magic-tricks enthusiast in position 2.


The final answer is: ########. 
|         |   1   |      2       |
| Hobby   | Chess | Magic-tricks |

Lv8-1x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given conditions to the table.


Given:
1. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating plum.
2. This condition seems to be a repetition or misprint (""the person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating asparagus""), so we'll focus on the first condition for clarity.

Applying the first condition:


Since there are only two positions and two types of food, and the person eating asparagus must be to the right of the person eating plum, we can deduce the following arrangement:


|        |  1   |     2     |
| Food   | Plum | Asparagus |


This arrangement satisfies the given condition that the person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating plum.


The final solution table is:


#############
|        |  1   |     2     |
| Food   | Plum | Asparagus |

Lv8-1x2-10	"Let's analyze the given statements:


## Step 1: Determine the relative positions based on statement 1.
The person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person driving the car.


## Step 2: Apply the information from statement 1 to the table.
Given that there are only two means of transport mentioned (car and skateboard) and based on statement 1, we can deduce the arrangement as follows:
- The car must be in position 1 because if it were in position 2, the skateboard would have to be to its right, but since this is a two-position setup, there's no room for another position to the right of position 2.


## Step 3: Fill in the table based on our deductions.
The car goes in position 1, and the skateboard goes in position 2 because that's the only way the skateboard can be to the right of the car as per statement 1.


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |  1  |     2      |
| Transport   | Car | Skateboard |
