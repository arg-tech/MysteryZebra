Lv8-2x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two types of food: onion and orange.
2. There are two means of transport: airplane and scooter.
3. The person driving the airplane is to the right of the person driving the scooter.
4. The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.

From point 3, we know the arrangement for transport is:
- Scooter on the left (column 1)
- Airplane on the right (column 2)

Given this, the table starts to look like this:

|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        |         |          |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane |

Now, let's consider point 4: The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is in column 1 (the left), and considering the airplane (and thus its corresponding food) is to the right, this means the onion cannot be associated with the airplane (because that would place it to the right of the scooter). Therefore, the onion must be associated with the scooter.

So, we have:
- Scooter with Onion in column 1
- Airplane with ? in column 2

The only food left for the airplane is orange. Thus, the final arrangement is:

|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange   |
| Transport   | Scooter | Airplane |

Therefore, the solution table surrounded by '#############' is:


#############
|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        | Onion   | Orange   |

Lv8-2x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the given information:


1. The favourite beverages are juice and soy-milk.
2. The preferred sports are cycling and lacrosse.
3. The person whose sport is cycling is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
4. The person whose sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.


From statements 3 and 4, we can infer that the person who drinks soy-milk must be in column 1 because the person who likes cycling has to be to the right of the soy-milk drinker, and since there are only two columns, the soy-milk drinker cannot be in column 2 (as there would be no one to their right).


So, we have:


|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   |
| Sport      |          |         |


Now, given that the cycling enthusiast must be to the right of the soy-milk drinker (and thus in column 2), and knowing there are only two sports (cycling and lacrosse), we can place cycling in column 2:


|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Juice   |
| Sport      | Lacrosse | Cycling |


Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv8-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of R&B.
2. The person eating peach is on the left of the fan of R&B.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating peach must be in column 1, and the fan of R&B must be in column 2.

So, the table looks like this:

| Food          | peach | cabbage |
| Music-Genre   |       |         |

Now, we can fill in the music genres. Since the person eating peach is to the left of the fan of R&B (clue 2), the fan of R&B must be in column 2. And since the person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of R&b (clue 1), the fan of pop must be in column 1.

So, the final solution table is:

Lv8-2x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Understanding Clue 1
The first clue states that ""the owner of the dog is not to the right of the person eating lime."" This implies that either the owner of the dog and the person eating lime are in the same position (which doesn't apply here since we have two distinct positions), or more relevantly, if the dog's owner is on the left, then the lime eater could be on the right.


## Step 2: Understanding Clue 2
The second clue states that ""the person eating lime is on the right of the owner of the dog."" This directly tells us the relative positions of these two entities. Given there are only two positions (1 and 2), this means the owner of the dog must be in position 1, and the person eating lime must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 2 to Determine Positions
Given clue 2 directly places the lime eater on the right and the dog's owner on the left, we can start filling out our table:


|        |   1    |  2   |
| Food   |        | Lime |
| Pet    | Dog    |      |


## Step 4: Determining the Remaining Positions
With the positions of the dog and lime determined, we know that the fish (the only remaining pet) must be paired with the potato (the only remaining food), and this pair must go to position 2 since position 1 is taken by the dog. However, clue 2 already established that lime is in position 2, which means our previous step's direct assignment might have been too hasty without considering all combinations.


## Step 5: Reevaluating for Accuracy
Revisiting the clues with strict adherence to their implications:
- The person eating lime must be on the right of the dog owner (Clue 2).
- This perfectly aligns with clue 1 when understood that ""not to the right"" means the dog's owner can indeed be to the left.
Thus, we correctly place the dog in position 1 and lime in position 2. The only remaining combination is fish with potato, which must then fill the first row since lime is already assigned to the second row.


## Step 6: Finalizing the Table
Given our reevaluation:
- Position 1 has the dog as its pet.
- Since lime is eaten by the person in position 2, and considering clue 2's direct statement, we finalize that potato must be associated with the fish (as it's the only remaining combination), but this association was incorrectly rushed in step 4 without full consideration of all clue implications.


The correct approach to filling out the table based on our clues is:
- The dog is in position 1.
- Lime is eaten by the person in position 2, which places lime correctly according to clue 2.


Given these steps and correcting for the oversight in direct assignment without considering all possible combinations based on the clues provided:


The final answer is: 
#############
|        |   1    |  2   |
| Food   | Potato | Lime |
| Pet    | Dog    | Fish |

Lv8-2x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to apply the given clues step by step.


From clue 2: ""the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile,"" we can deduce that since there are only two columns (1 and 2), if the person playing soccer is in column 1, then the person driving the snowmobile must be in column 2.


Clue 1 states: ""the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter,"" which seems to be a typo or redundant. However, interpreting it as ""the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the snowmobile"" based on typical puzzle structures and considering we have two distinct means of transport (helicopter and snowmobile) and two sports (ice-hockey and soccer), let's proceed with deducing the arrangement.


Given:
- Two sports: ice-hockey, soccer
- Two transports: helicopter, snowmobile


From clue 2, if soccer is in column 1, then snowmobile must be in column 2. This leaves ice-hockey for column 1 (since soccer is already placed there) and helicopter for column 2 or vice versa.


However, considering the possible typo in clue 1 but understanding we need to place these items according to the given clues logically:


- If soccer is in column 1 (to satisfy clue 2), then snowmobile should be in column 2.
- Ice-hockey can then only go with helicopter since soccer is paired with snowmobile indirectly through the clues.


Thus, a logical deduction could be:
|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       | Soccer    | Ice-hockey|
| Transport   | Snowmobile| Helicopter|

This satisfies the given conditions: The person playing soccer (column 1) is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile (which would be in column 2 if we strictly followed clue 2 without additional assumptions), and it respects the constraint that each sport and transport method is used exactly once.


Given the possible misunderstanding or typo in clue 1, this arrangement seems logical based on standard puzzle solving techniques and the information provided.


The final solution table is:
#############
|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       | Soccer    | Ice-hockey|
| Transport   | Snowmobile| Helicopter|

Lv8-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two different favorite beverages: Fanta and soy-milk.
2. The people prefer two different types of sports: baseball and volleyball.
3. The person whose sport is baseball is on the right of the person drinking Fanta.
4. The person whose sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.

From point 3, we know that the person who drinks Fanta cannot be on the right side because the baseball player must be on the right of the Fanta drinker. Therefore, the Fanta drinker must be on the left (column 1), and the baseball player must be on the right (column 2).

Given this arrangement:

- The left column (1) is for Fanta.
- The right column (2) is for baseball.

Now, considering point 4, since volleyball cannot be to the right of baseball, and we've established that baseball is in column 2, volleyball must be in column 1. However, from our initial placement based on point 3, Fanta is already in column 1. This means the person who drinks Fanta must also prefer volleyball because these are the only two options for sports and beverages.

So, we have:

- Column 1: Fanta, Volleyball
- Column 2: Since baseball is here, and the other beverage is soy-milk (because there are only two beverages), soy-milk must be paired with baseball in column 2.

Thus, the final solution table looks like this:


#############
|            |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage   | Fanta     | Soy-milk |

Lv8-2x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the given clues.


## Step 1: Understanding Clue 1
The first clue states that the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person whose hobby is gardening. This means if gardening is in column 1, then pomegranate must be in column 2.


## Step 2: Understanding Clue 2
The second clue seems incomplete or incorrectly stated as ""the person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate##8."" This clue does not provide useful information due to its apparent error or incompleteness. We will proceed with the assumption that there's a misunderstanding in this clue and focus on the first clue for logical deduction.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 1 to the Table
Given that we have two foods (papaya, pomegranate) and two hobbies (chess, gardening), and based on the correctly understood clue, if the person whose hobby is gardening is in column 1, then the person eating pomegranate must be in column 2. This implies the person in column 1 eats papaya and has chess as a hobby or gardens.


## Step 4: Creating Possible Combinations
- If gardening is in column 1, then pomegranate must be in column 2 (based on clue 1), leaving papaya for column 1. The hobbies can be matched as gardening with papaya and chess with pomegranate.
- However, the direct assignment from clue 1 doesn't specify the hobby of the person eating pomegranate but indicates their position relative to the gardener.


## Step 5: Finalizing Based on Logical Deduction
Given the information and focusing on the correctly interpreted clue, we can make a logical deduction about the table's possible arrangement. If gardening is in column 1, then the food in column 1 could be papaya (since pomegranate must be to the right of gardening), and chess would be in column 2 with pomegranate.


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |     1     |      2      |
| Food    |  Papaya   | Pomegranate |
| Hobby   |  Gardening|    Chess    |

Lv8-2x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The jobs are librarian and videographer.
2. The means of transport are helicopter and scooter.
3. The librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.
4. The videographer is on the far left.

From point 4, we know the videographer is in column 1. Now, let's determine their mode of transportation:

- If the videographer (in column 1) uses the scooter, then according to point 3, the librarian cannot be in column 2 because they cannot be to the right of the person driving the scooter.
- However, since there are only two people and two jobs, if the videographer is using the scooter, it forces the librarian into column 2. This contradicts point 3 unless the librarian is also using a mode of transport that doesn't violate any rules when placed to the right of the scooter user.

Given these considerations and looking at point 3 again, we realize that for the statement ""the librarian is not to the right of the person driving the scooter"" to hold true without contradiction, the videographer must be associated with the scooter. This way, if the librarian were in column 2 (which they must be since the videographer occupies column 1), they wouldn't necessarily be to the right of the scooter user based on job alone, but rather their transport method would determine this.

However, the above reasoning simplifies to understanding that since the videographer is on the far left and we have two modes of transport and two jobs, the only configuration that fits without contradicting any rules directly involves assigning the remaining job (librarian) to column 2 and ensuring that the transports are arranged so as not to violate rule 3.

The correct arrangement considering all points:

- The videographer is on the far left, which places them in column 1. Given they must use one of the two modes of transport, let's assign them the scooter for now, as it fits with our initial reasoning about not being able to place the librarian to the right of the scooter user without considering the actual transport used by the librarian.
- The librarian then goes into column 2, and since we've assigned the scooter to the videographer in column 1, the librarian must use the helicopter to fulfill the requirement of having two different modes of transport.

Therefore, the solution table looks like this:

#############
|             |      1       |     2     |
| Job         | Videographer| Librarian |
| Transport   | Scooter     | Helicopter|

Lv8-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching zombie movies is not to the left of the Mexican.
2. The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

From clue 2, we know the American must be to the left of the zombie movie watcher. This means the American cannot be watching zombie movies because, according to clue 1, if the zombie movie watcher were on the left (which would have to be position 1 since there are only two positions), they would be to the left of the Mexican, which contradicts clue 1.

Therefore, given that we have two genres (thriller and zombie) and two nationalities (American and Mexican), and considering the clues:

- The American must watch thriller movies because if they watched zombie movies, there would be no one to the left of them, contradicting clue 2.
- Since the American watches thriller movies and is to the left of the person watching zombie movies, the setup looks like this:
  - Position 1: American watching thrillers (because they have to be to the left of the zombie movie watcher).
  - Position 2: This must be the Mexican watching zombie movies because it's the only combination that satisfies both clues.

Thus, the solution table is:
