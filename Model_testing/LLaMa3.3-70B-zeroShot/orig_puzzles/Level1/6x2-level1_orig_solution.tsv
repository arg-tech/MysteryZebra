Lv1-6x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one.


1. The owner of the goat is on the far left.
2. The accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller.
3. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right.
4. The french is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.

From clue 1, we know:
- The left column has a goat as a pet.

From clue 3, we know:
- The right column drinks mirinda.

Applying these to the table gives us an initial setup:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |            | Mirinda    |
| Job           |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

From clue 2, since the accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller:
- The roller cannot be in column 2 (because there would be no one to the right of it), so it must be in column 1.
- This means the accountant is in column 2.

So, we update our table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |            | Mirinda    |
| Job           |            | Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       |            |
| Transport     | Roller     |            |

Now, since the person drinking mirinda is on the far right and we have determined that column 2 contains an accountant who drinks mirinda:
- The beverage in column 1 must be milk.

The van, being the only remaining transport option, must then go to column 2:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Milk       | Mirinda    |
| Job           |            | Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       |            |
| Transport     | Roller     | Van        |

Given the remaining options, the ferret (the only pet left) must be in column 2.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Milk       | Mirinda    |
| Job           |            | Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       | Ferret     |
| Transport     | Roller     | Van        |

From clue 4, the French is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. Since we have to fit in a journalist and considering the accountant is already placed:
- The journalist must be in column 1 because there's no room for another job in column 2.
- Therefore, the person watching zombie movies cannot be in column 2 (since the French has to be to their right), so they must be in column 1.

This means the movie genre for column 2 must be thriller (the only remaining option):

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Milk       | Mirinda    |
| Job           | Journalist| Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie     | Thriller  |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Pet           | Goat       | Ferret     |
| Transport     | Roller     | Van        |

Lastly, to satisfy clue 4 (the French is on the right of the person watching zombie movies), and given that column 1 watches zombie movies:
- The nationality in column 2 must be French.

The only remaining nationality, Malaysian, goes to column 1:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      | Milk       | Mirinda    |
| Job           | Journalist| Accountant|
| Movie-Genre   | Zombie     | Thriller  |
| Nationality   | Malaysian  | French     |
| Pet           | Goat       | Ferret     |
| Transport     | Roller     | Van        |

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv1-6x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The fan of pop is on the right of the owner of the rat. This means the person who likes pop music cannot be in column 2 if the rat owner is in column 1, but since it says ""on the right,"" it implies the rat owner must be in column 1, and the pop fan in column 2.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person drinking water is the fan of pop. This means we can directly link water with pop music, placing water in column 2 (since the pop fan is on the right, as per clue 1).


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person watching action movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping. This implies that action movies are associated with column 1 and camping with column 2.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the bird. This means the motorbike is in column 1, and the bird must be in column 2.


## Step 5: Combining Information
From clue 1 and clue 2, we know the pop fan (who drinks water) is in column 2. Clue 3 places action movies in column 1 and camping in column 2. Clue 4 puts the motorbike in column 1 and the bird in column 2.


## Step 6: Finalizing Positions
- Column 1: Since action movies are here, and by elimination (since pop is linked with water in column 2), we can deduce folk music must be in column 1. The hobby cannot be camping (which is in column 2), so it's filmmaking. The transport is the motorbike. The pet, by process of elimination (since the bird is in column 2), must be the rat.
- Column 2: We've established water as the beverage and pop as the music genre. Camping is the hobby, and the bird is the pet. By elimination, crime movies must be here (since action is in column 1), and the ship must be the transport (since the motorbike is in column 1).


## Step 7: Assembling the Table
Given all deductions:


|               |     1      |    2    |
| Beverage      | 7up        | Water   |
| Hobby         | Filmmaking| Camping |
| Movie-Genre   | Action     | Crime   |
| Music-Genre   | Folk       | Pop     |
| Pet           | Rat        | Bird    |
| Transport     | Motorbike  | Ship    |

Lv1-6x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given:


1. The owner of the cat is on the left of the person whose hobby is baking.
2. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person eating pepper.
3. The Egyptian is on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon.


Given the structure and clues, let's start filling in what we can deduce:


- From clue 3, since the Egyptian must be on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon, and there are only two columns (1 and 2), this means the Egyptian cannot be in column 2 because then there would be no one to their right for biathlon. Thus, the Egyptian must be in column 1.


- Clue 1 tells us the cat owner is to the left of the baker. Since we've established the Egyptian is in column 1, and assuming each person has a unique combination of attributes (which is typical in these puzzles), this means the cat cannot belong to the Egyptian if baking is not also on the left, as that would place baking in column 1 with no one to its left for the cat owner.


- Clue 2 indicates the martial-arts fan is to the right of the pepper eater. This clue helps us determine possible positions based on food choices but doesn't directly tell us about nationalities or pets yet.


Let's try placing some attributes based on these deductions:


Given:
- Egyptian in column 1 (from clue 3)
- Cat owner must be to the left of the baker (clue 1), suggesting if the cat owner is not Egyptian, then perhaps the cat belongs to someone else who could fit this criterion or it fits with another arrangement considering all clues.


Possible starting point based on deductions:
```
|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | avocado  | pepper      |
| Hobby         | ?        | baking      |
| Movie-Genre   | ?        | ?           |
| Nationality   | Egyptian | Colombian   |
| Pet           | cat      | guinea-pig  |
| Sport         | ?        | biathlon    |
```

Now, let's fill in the rest using all clues:


1. Cat owner is to the left of baker: If we place the cat with the Egyptian (as a starting assumption), this works if baking is indeed on the right, which fits our current setup.
2. Martial-arts fan to the right of pepper eater: Given our food placement (avocado in column 1 and pepper in column 2), martial-arts must be associated with the person eating pepper or another arrangement that respects clue 2.
3. Egyptian to the left of biathlon: This fits our current setup.


Filling in based on these assumptions and checking against all clues:
```
|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | avocado  | pepper      |
| Hobby         | writing  | baking      |
| Movie-Genre   | superhero| martial-arts|
| Nationality   | Egyptian | Colombian   |
| Pet           | cat      | guinea-pig  |
| Sport         | parkour  | biathlon    |
```

This arrangement respects all given clues:
- The cat owner (Egyptian) is to the left of the baker.
- The martial-arts fan is indeed to the right of the pepper eater, fitting if we adjust our initial assumption on movie genres based on clue 2 and considering unique combinations for each person.
- The Egyptian is to the left of the biathlon sport, which fits.


Thus, the final solution table respecting all clues provided is:

Lv1-6x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the ferret is on the left of the bartender. This means the ferret cannot be on the right side because there would be no one for the bartender to be to the right of.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. This gives us a direct relationship between two hobbies but doesn't specify which side they are on yet.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. This clue links a beverage to a sport and indicates their positions relative to each other.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The fan of gospel is on the far right. This clue directly places one music genre on the right side.


## Step 5: Combine Information
Given that the fan of gospel is on the far right (Clue 4), and considering Clue 3, we know soy-milk must be on the right as well because it's to the right of snowboarding. Since gospel is on the far right, soy-milk cannot be on the far right unless snowboarding is also on the right, which would contradict Clue 4 if we consider the arrangement tightly. Thus, snowboarding and soy-milk must occupy the first and second positions in some order to satisfy all conditions when considering the placement of gospel.


## Step 6: Finalize Positions
Given that skydiving is to the left of cooking (Clue 2), and the ferret owner is to the left of the bartender (Clue 1), we start building our table. The fan of gospel being on the far right helps us lock in some positions.


## Step 7: Detailed Placement
- Since the gospel fan is on the far right, and considering Clue 3 about soy-milk and snowboarding, it seems there was an initial misinterpretation in step 5 regarding the direct placement based on Clue 4 alone without integrating other clues fully. We need to align all clues correctly.
- The ferret owner being on the left of the bartender (Clue 1) means if we consider the leftmost position for the ferret, it could potentially match with skydiving being on the left (from Clue 2), given no direct conflict.
- With gospel on the far right (Clue 4), and considering soy-milk must be to the right of snowboarding (Clue 3), we have to fit in the remaining preferences around these fixed points.


## Step 8: Correcting Misinterpretation and Final Placement
Let's correctly apply all clues without assuming positions not directly stated:
- Gospel is on the far right.
- Soy-milk is to the right of snowboarding, but since gospel is on the far right, this means soy-milk and snowboarding must be in the first and second positions or second and first, respectively, to allow for the gospel fan to be at the end.
- The ferret owner is to the left of the bartender. If the ferret owner is also into skydiving (as per our attempt to align clues), this could work if skydiving is on the left, given it's before cooking (Clue 2).
- Given these constraints and re-evaluating for accuracy in placement based on all clues provided:

Lv1-6x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step and fill in the information accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1
The person whose sport is parkour is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing. This means rock-climbing must be on the left.


## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2
The person eating asparagus is on the right of the Mexican. This implies the Mexican cannot be on the right, so they must be on the left.


## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3
The dancer is on the left of the person eating asparagus. Since asparagus is on the right of the Mexican (from step 2), and given that there are only two positions, the dancer must also be on the left, which aligns with the Mexican being on the left.


## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4
The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person eating pepper. Given that asparagus is already determined to be on the right (from statements 2 and 3), pepper must then be on the left.


## Step 5: Combine Information
- The Mexican is on the left.
- The dancer is on the left, which aligns with being the Mexican's job since the dancer has to be on the left of asparagus.
- Pepper is eaten by the person on the left (Mexican), and asparagus by the person on the right.
- Rock-climbing must be on the left because parkour (its counterpart) is on the right, based on statement 1.
- Musical movies are watched by the person on the right.


## Step 6: Determine Remaining Preferences
Given that rock-climbing and the dancer (Mexican) are on the left, and considering all other constraints:
- The job on the right must be dressmaker because the dancer is on the left.
- Since asparagus is on the right, and the person eating pepper watches musical movies can't hold (because musical movies are on the right), fantasy movies must be associated with pepper, placing musical movies with asparagus.
- Sport: parkour on the right means baseball must be on the left.


## Step 7: Finalize Table
Based on all deductions:

Lv1-6x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Analyze the given clues
From clue 1, we know the person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the Polish person.
From clue 2, the Malaysian is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.
From clue 3, the person watching adventure movies is the manager.
From clue 4, the person eating potato is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.


## Step 2: Determine the nationality and music genre
Given that there are only two nationalities (Malaysian and Polish) and from clue 2, we can infer the Malaysian cannot be on the right because they must be to the left of the hip-hop fan. Thus, without loss of generality, let's assume the Malaysian is in column 1.


## Step 3: Apply clue 4
The person eating potato is to the left of the person watching adventure movies. Since the manager watches adventure movies (clue 3), and there are only two people, this implies the potato eater must be in column 1 because they have to be to the left of the manager.


## Step 4: Apply clue 3
The manager watches adventure movies. Given that the person eating potato is to the left of the manager (from step 3), and assuming the Malaysian eats potato (as we placed them in column 1 in step 2 for now), this means the manager must be in column 2.


## Step 5: Apply clue 1
The hiker is on the left of the Polish person. Since the Malaysian is assumed to be in column 1, and there's only one other nationality (Polish) which must then be in column 2, this fits with our current placement as the hiker can indeed be on the left.


## Step 6: Combine all information
Given:
- The manager watches adventure movies and is likely in column 2 based on step 3 and step 4.
- The Malaysian is to the left of the hip-hop fan (clue 2), suggesting if the Malaysian is in column 1, the hip-hop fan must be in column 2.
- However, we also know from clue 1 that the hiker is to the left of the Polish person. If the manager is in column 2 and watches adventure movies, this means the person in column 1 (Malaysian) cannot watch horror movies because there's no one to their right watching adventure movies unless they are the ones watching adventure, which contradicts our assumption about who the manager is based on job alone.


## Step 7: Correcting Assumptions and Final Placement
Let's correct our approach with a focus on clue interactions:
- The Malaysian is to the left of the hip-hop fan.
- The person eating potato is to the left of the adventure movie watcher (who is the manager).
Given these clues, we must place individuals based on job, hobby, food preference, and nationality.


## Step 8: Finalize Placement Based on All Clues
Considering all clues:
1. Hiker is on the left of Polish.
2. Malaysian is on the left of hip-hop fan.
3. Adventure movie watcher is the manager.
4. Potato eater is on the left of adventure movie watcher.

This means, if we follow clue 4 and assume the potato eater is in column 1 (because they must be to the left of the manager), and knowing from clue 2 that the Malaysian must also be in column 1 to be to the left of the hip-hop fan, it suggests our initial assumption about nationality placement might need adjustment based on hobby and job.


## Step 9: Apply Clues Directly to Table
Given the clues directly:
- Column 1 (Malaysian) cannot watch horror because they are to the left of the hip-hop fan, suggesting column 2 watches horror.
- The manager (who watches adventure movies) must be in column 2 based on clue 4 and our analysis.


## Step 10: Final Table Construction
Based on all clues:
- Malaysian is in column 1.
- Polish is in column 2.
- Hiker is on the left of Polish, so hiker must be in column 1 (Malaysian).
- Potato eater is to the left of adventure movie watcher, which places potato with Malaysian and adventure movies with Polish (column 2), fitting our manager placement.
- Hip-hop fan must then be in column 2 since Malaysian is to their left.


The final answer is:

Lv1-6x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the information given in the clues:

1. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
2. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left.
3. The person eating pumpkin is the police-officer.
4. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.
5. The police-officer is on the far right.

From clue 2 and clue 4, we know that the person on the far left watches documentary movies and drinks almond-milk.

From clue 5, we know the police-officer is on the far right.

Given clue 3, the police-officer eats pumpkin. So, we have:

- Far Left: Documentary, Almond-milk
- Far Right: Police-officer, Pumpkin

Clue 1 tells us the hamster owner is to the left of the filmmaker. Since the far left is already occupied by the documentary/almond-milk person, and considering clue 5 which places the police-officer (who eats pumpkin) on the far right, we can deduce:

- Far Left: Documentary, Almond-milk
- Middle/Left: Hamster owner
- Far Right: Police-officer, Pumpkin

Now, let's fill in the blanks with the remaining information:

Given that the person on the far left drinks almond-milk and watches documentaries, and the police-officer (on the far right) eats pumpkin, we can start filling in the table based on the clues provided.

1. **Beverage**: Almond-milk (Far Left), Coffee (must be on the Far Right since there are only two beverages)
2. **Food**: Pumpkin (Far Right with Police-officer), Blueberry (must be on the Far Left or Middle, but since pumpkin is associated with the police-officer on the far right, blueberry goes to the middle)
3. **Hobby**: Since filmmaking's position is relative to the hamster owner and we know the hamster owner cannot be on the far left (taken by documentary/almond-milk) or far right (police-officer/pumpkin), and must be to the left of the filmmaker, this places the filmmaker on the far right, but we already have the police-officer there. Thus, the filmmaker must actually be in the middle, and the hamster owner then has to be on the far left or immediately to the left of the filmmaker if the filmmaker were not on the absolute right. However, given our setup, filmmaking can't fit on the far right because it's taken by the police-officer, so there seems to be a misunderstanding in applying clue 1 directly without accounting for all positions. Correcting this with proper logic:
   - The person who watches documentaries (far left) drinks almond-milk.
   - The police-officer eats pumpkin and is on the far right.
   - This leaves us with the middle position for the remaining combinations.

Given the direct clues:
- Documentary watcher/almond-milk drinker is on the far left.
- Police-officer/pumpkin eater is on the far right.
- Hamster owner to the left of filmmaker, but since we've established positions based on other clues, let's correct and simplify our approach with what we know directly affects positioning:
  - Far Left: Documentary, Almond-milk
  - Far Right: Police-officer, Pumpkin

Considering all hobbies, jobs, pets, etc., must be distributed among only two people (since there are only two columns), and knowing:
- The police-officer is on the far right.
- The documentary watcher/almond-milk drinker is on the far left.

We can directly place:
- **Job**: Police-officer on the Far Right.
- **Food**: Pumpkin with the Police-officer (Far Right), leaving Blueberry for the Far Left.
- **Beverage**: Almond-milk on the Far Left, Coffee on the Far Right.
- **Movie-Genre**: Documentary on the Far Left, Animation on the Far Right (since documentary is already placed).
- **Pet** and **Hobby** are left. Since the hamster owner must be to the left of the filmmaker, but our direct placements based on other clues have filled the far left and far right, we recognize a mistake in logic application given the constraints. The correct approach should directly apply all given conditions without overcomplicating the relative positions.

Let's correctly place what we know without speculation:
- Far Left: Documentary, Almond-milk
- Far Right: Police-officer, Pumpkin, Coffee (since almond-milk is on the left)

Given this, the person who drinks coffee must be the police-officer. Now, for hobbies and pets:

- The filmmaker cannot be on the far right because that's the police-officer. Thus, filmmaking must be on the left.
- Cooking then goes to the right (with the police-officer).
- Since the hamster owner is to the left of the filmmaker but we have a direct placement issue with our previous logic, let's correct:
  - The far left watches documentaries and drinks almond-milk. This person can also be the filmmaker because there's no rule directly stating otherwise given our corrected understanding.
  - The police-officer on the far right eats pumpkin, drinks coffee, and thus must have a hobby (which would be cooking based on elimination) and a pet.

However, let's finalize with correct logic application:
- **Movie-Genre**: Documentary (Far Left), Animation (Far Right).
- **Beverage**: Almond-milk (Far Left), Coffee (Far Right).
- **Food**: Blueberry (Far Left), Pumpkin (Far Right).
- **Job**: Police-officer (Far Right), Paramedic (Far Left by elimination).
- **Hobby**: Since the filmmaker can't be on the far right, and assuming a mistake in logic flow regarding direct placements, we must reconsider hobby placement with correct deductions:
  - The paramedic (by elimination) is on the left. If this person watches documentaries, drinks almond-milk, and considering other clues for hobbies and pets:
    - Filmmaking could indeed be on the left if it's not directly contradicted by our established facts.
- **Pet**: Given the hamster owner is to the left of the filmmaker, but acknowledging a potential mix-up in applying conditions without direct placements for all categories correctly from the start, let's finalize based on what's directly stated and can be logically deduced.

Directly applying clues without incorrect assumptions:
1. Documentary watcher/almond-milk drinker is on the far left.
2. Police-officer/pumpkin eater/coffee drinker is on the far right.
3. Given these positions, other preferences are distributed accordingly.

Given this analysis and correcting for a straightforward application of clues:

Lv1-6x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues given and apply them step by step to the table.


1. The fan of reggae is on the right of the designer.
2. The fan of techno is the person eating carrot.
3. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far right.
4. The person who's sport is handball is the person eating asparagus.
5. The person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is puzzles.


From clue 3 and 5, we know the person on the far right has puzzles as a hobby and drinks Fanta.


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |  Fanta       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         |            |  Puzzles     |
| Job           |            |               |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |
| Sport         |            |               |


Clue 1 tells us the reggae fan is to the right of the designer. Since the far right column is already determined to be the puzzles/Fanta person, and we don't know their music preference yet, let's consider clue 2 for more information.


Clue 2 says the techno fan eats carrot. This means the other food, asparagus, must belong to the person who doesn't eat carrot. Clue 4 tells us that the handball player eats asparagus.


Given this, and knowing from clue 3 that the puzzles person is on the far right, we can start filling in more information based on the clues provided:


- The designer cannot be on the far right because the reggae fan needs to be to their right (clue 1), so the designer must be on the left.
- The techno fan eats carrot (clue 2), which means they could potentially be the designer since we don't have direct information linking the designer's food preference yet.


Let's place the jobs first based on clue 1:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |  Fanta       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         |            |  Puzzles     |
| Job           | Designer  |               |
| Music-Genre   |            |               |
| Sport         |            |               |


From clue 1, since the reggae fan is to the right of the designer, and considering our current setup:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |  Fanta       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         |            |  Puzzles     |
| Job           | Designer  |  Social-Worker|
| Music-Genre   |            |  Reggae      |
| Sport         |            |               |


Clue 4 tells us the handball player eats asparagus. Since the person on the right is already determined to have puzzles as a hobby and drink Fanta, let's fill in more based on other clues.


Given clue 2 (techno fan eats carrot) and knowing the far right person drinks Fanta and has puzzles as a hobby, we can link some preferences:


- The techno fan must be on the left because they eat carrot, and the handball player (who eats asparagus) cannot be on the right due to the puzzle fan being there.
- Since the designer is on the left and the reggae fan is to their right, the social-worker must be the reggae fan.


Let's fill in the music genres based on this:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |            |  Fanta       |
| Food          | Carrot    |               |
| Hobby         | Card-Games|  Puzzles     |
| Job           | Designer  | Social-Worker|
| Music-Genre   | Techno    | Reggae      |
| Sport         |            |               |


Now, let's address the sport and beverage preferences:


- Clue 4 tells us the handball player eats asparagus. Since the person on the right has puzzles as a hobby and drinks Fanta, and we've established the left column likely belongs to the techno fan who eats carrot, the handball player must be associated with asparagus but can't be on the far right.
- Given this, and knowing the sports and beverages, let's finalize:


The person drinking juice must be on the left since Fanta is already assigned to the puzzles fan. The sport for the left column must then be ice-hockey because handball is linked with asparagus (and thus can't be on the far right with Fanta).


So, we have:


|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Juice     |  Fanta       |
| Food          | Carrot    | Asparagus   |
| Hobby         | Card-Games|  Puzzles     |
| Job           | Designer  | Social-Worker|
| Music-Genre   | Techno    | Reggae      |
| Sport         | Ice-Hockey| Handball    |


Given all clues and deductions:


#############
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      | Juice     |  Fanta       |
| Food          | Carrot    | Asparagus   |

Lv1-6x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step:


1. The chef is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
3. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk.
4. The chef is on the far left.


Given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), we can start by placing the chef in position 1, as per clue 4:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Job           | Chef    |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         |               |
| Music-Genre   |         |               |
| Nationality   |         |               |
| Pet           |         |               |


From clue 1, since the chef is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, the chinchilla must be in position 2.


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Job           | Chef    |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         |               |
| Music-Genre   |         |               |
| Nationality   |         |               |
| Pet           |         | Chinchilla    |


Clue 2 tells us the Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since position 1 is taken by the chef, and if we assume the chef could drink either beverage, we need to determine the beverage for each position based on other clues as well.


Clue 3 indicates the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk. This means that in position 1 (the left), we must have someone who watches mystery movies because there's no one to the left of position 1, and thus, the fan of funk must be in position 2.


Given these constraints, let's fill in what we can directly:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Job           | Chef    | Social-Worker |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Western       |
| Music-Genre   | Funk    | Trance        |
| Nationality   | Italian | Nigerian      |
| Pet           | Mouse   | Chinchilla    |


Now, let's address the beverages with clue 2 in mind: The Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means position 1 must drink 7up because the Nigerian is in position 2.


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | 7up     | Milk          |
| Job           | Chef    | Social-Worker |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Western       |
| Music-Genre   | Funk    | Trance        |
| Nationality   | Italian | Nigerian      |
| Pet           | Mouse   | Chinchilla    |


This arrangement satisfies all the given conditions:


1. The chef is indeed on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
3. The person watching mystery movies (in position 1) is on the left of the fan of funk (who must be in position 2, but this was a mistake in deduction; correctly, it should be the other way around based on the direct clues given).
4. The chef is on the far left.


Correcting the logic for music genres based on clue 3: If the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk, and knowing the chef watches mystery movies (as deduced from the arrangement), then the chef must be a fan of mystery, which is correctly placed. However, this means the social worker should be associated with funk to satisfy clue 3 directly.


The corrected table based on re-evaluation of clues should actually reflect:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | 7up     | Milk          |
| Job           | Chef    | Social-Worker |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery | Western       |
| Music-Genre   | Trance  | Funk          |
| Nationality   | Italian | Nigerian      |
| Pet           | Mouse   | Chinchilla    |


Given this correction, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | 7up     | Milk          |

Lv1-6x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the given clues to the information provided.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 1
The videographer is on the far right. This means in the ""Job"" row, the second column will be ""videographer"".

## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since the videographer is already determined to be on the far right, this aligns with clue 1, and we can fill in ""mirinda"" under the ""Beverage"" row for column 2.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 4
The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Given that the motorbike (or ""motor"") is listed in the first column under ""Transport"", this means pomegranate must be in the second column under ""Food"" because it has to be to the right of the motorbike.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 2
The fan of metal is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since we don't have direct placements for these yet, we'll come back to this after figuring out more about the other clues.

## Step 5: Fill in Known Information
- Beverage: ?, mirinda
- Food: ?, pomegranate
- Job: ?, videographer
- Movie-Genre: ?, ?
- Music-Genre: ?, ?
- Transport: motor, ?

## Step 6: Deduce Remaining Information
Given the transport and food clues, we can start making connections:
- The person driving the motorbike eats pineapple (since pomegranate is to the right of the motorbike, implying the motorbike is associated with column 1).
- This means the first column's food is pineapple.

## Step 7: Apply Remaining Clues
- Since the fan of metal is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies, and considering the videographer (who could watch any movie genre) is on the far right, we need to determine who watches time-travel movies. If the person on the left watches romance (the only other option), then the right side must be associated with time-travel for metal's placement to make sense.
- The accountant must be on the left since the videographer is on the right.

## Step 8: Finalize Movie and Music Genres
- Given that metal is to the right of time-travel, but we've established the far right person watches a movie genre (with the videographer watching romance or time-travel), this means the time-travel fan cannot be on the far right. Thus, the left side must watch time-travel movies, and the right side (the videographer) watches romance.
- Metal then must be associated with the right side as well because it's to the right of time-travel, which aligns with our earlier determination that metal is on the right.

## Step 9: Complete the Table
Given all clues:
- Beverage: tea, mirinda (since mirinda is on the far right)
- Food: pineapple, pomegranate
- Job: accountant, videographer
- Movie-Genre: time-travel, romance
- Music-Genre: trance, metal (metal is on the right, so trance must be on the left)
- Transport: motor, bike (since the motor is already listed for column 1, and we need a transport method for column 2)

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1      |      2       |
| Beverage      |     tea     |    mirinda   |
| Food          |  pineapple  |  pomegranate |
| Job           |  accountant |  videographer|
| Movie-Genre   |  time-travel|    romance   |
| Music-Genre   |    trance    |     metal    |
| Transport     |    motor     |      bike    |
