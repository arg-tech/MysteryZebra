Lv1-1x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we can follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the Engineer
The engineer is on the far left, so the table will look like this:
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Job   | Engineer |           |           |

## Step 2: Determine the Position of the Bartender and Librarian
Given that the bartender is on the right of the librarian, there are two possible arrangements for columns 2 and 3:
- Librarian in column 2 and Bartender in column 3
- This arrangement satisfies the condition that the bartender is on the right of the librarian.

## Step 3: Finalize the Table
Given the information from step 2, the only arrangement that fits all conditions is:
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Job   | Engineer | Librarian | Bartender |

The final answer is: 
#############
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Job   | Engineer | Librarian | Bartender |

Lv1-1x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues given:


## Step 1: Identify the positions based on the clues.
- The dancer is on the far left (position 1).
- The photographer is on the far right (position 3).


## Step 2: Place the remaining job in the middle.
Since there are three jobs and we've already placed the dancer and the photographer, the doctor must be in the middle (position 2).


## Step 3: Construct the final table based on the placements.
Given the clues:
- Position 1 is the dancer.
- Position 2 is the doctor.
- Position 3 is the photographer.


The final solution table will look like this:


#############
|       |   1    |   2    |      3       |
| Job   | Dancer | Doctor | Photographer |

Lv1-1x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose hobby is baking is on the far left.
2. The person whose hobby is video-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is reading.

Given there are three people (since we have columns 1, 2, and 3), we can start filling in the information based on the clues:

- Since the baker is on the far left, column 1's hobby must be baking.
- The video-games enthusiast must be to the right of the reader. This means reading cannot be in column 3 because there would be no space to the right for video-games.

So, we have two possible arrangements based on the clues:
1. Baking, Reading, Video-Games
2. Baking, Video-Games, Reading (This arrangement does not fit because video-games must be to the right of reading.)

Therefore, the only arrangement that fits all the given conditions is:

#############
|         |   1    |    2    |      3      |
| Hobby   | Baking | Reading | Video-Games |

Lv1-1x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Japanese is on the far right.
2. The Japanese is on the right of the Nigerian.

From clue 1, we know the Japanese person is in column 3.

From clue 2, we know the Nigerian person must be to the left of the Japanese person, so the Nigerian person can only be in column 1 or 2. However, since the Japanese person is already in column 3, and there are only three columns, the Nigerian person cannot be in column 3. This means the Nigerian person must be in either column 1 or 2.

Given that the Japanese person is in column 3, and the Nigerian person must be to their left (as per clue 2), we can conclude:

- Column 1: Nigerian
- Column 2: French (since it's the only nationality left)
- Column 3: Japanese

Therefore, the solution table is:


#############
|               |   1    |    2     |    3     |
| Nationality   | Nigerian|  French  | Japanese |

Lv1-1x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person drinking water.
Given that the person drinking water is on the far right, we can fill in the last column with ""water"". The table now looks like this:

|            |   1    |      2      |   3   |
| Beverage   |        |             | water |

## Step 2: Determine the position of the person drinking sprite.
Since the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and there are only three positions, the person drinking sprite must be in either position 1 or 2. However, because the person drinking water is already placed in position 3, and sprite must be to the left of almond-milk, the only configuration that allows for this arrangement with water on the far right is having sprite in position 1 and almond-milk in position 2.

The table now looks like this:

|            |   1    |      2      |   3   |
| Beverage   | sprite | almond-milk | water |

## Step 3: Confirm the arrangement meets all conditions.
- The person drinking sprite is indeed on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
- The person drinking water is on the far right.

Therefore, the solution table that meets all the given conditions is:


#############
|            |   1    |      2      |   3   |
| Beverage   | sprite | almond-milk | water |

Lv1-1x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to figure out the order of the three means of transport: boat, car, and snowmobile.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means that the snowmobile must be on the left of the car.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the boat. This means that the car must be on the left of the boat.

Combining these two clues, we get:

snowmobile - car - boat

So, the final solution table is:


#############
|             |     1      |  2  |  3   |
| Transport   | snowmobile | car | boat |

Lv1-1x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine the order of the movie genres based on the given conditions.


## Step 1: Determine the position of thriller movies
The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. This means thriller movies cannot be in column 3 because there would be no space for action movies to its right.


## Step 2: Determine the position of action movies relative to thriller and martial-arts movies
Since the person watching action movies is also on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, and we've established that thriller movies are to the left of action movies, the order must be: thriller, action, martial-arts.


## Step 3: Place the genres into the table based on the determined order
Given the order is thriller, action, martial-arts, we can fill in the table:


|               |    1     |   2    |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Action | Martial-Arts |


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1     |   2    |      3       |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller | Action | Martial-Arts |

Lv1-1x3-8	"Let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is traveling.
The person whose hobby is traveling is in the middle, which means they are in column 2.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is dancing.
The person whose hobby is dancing is on the right of the person whose hobby is traveling. Since the traveler is in column 2, the dancer must be in column 3.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is drawing.
Given that the traveler is in column 2 and the dancer is in column 3, the only remaining spot for the drawer is column 1.


## Step 4: Construct the final table based on the analysis.
Based on the steps above, we can fill in the hobbies as follows:


|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |
| Hobby   | drawing | traveling | dancing |


The final answer is:

Lv1-1x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, we can follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The first clue states that the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means the order must be Comedy, Disaster (at least for these two genres), since Disaster has to be to the right of Comedy.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The second clue tells us that the person watching disaster movies is in the middle. Given there are three positions (1, 2, 3) and considering the information from Step 1, we can determine the order for these two genres with respect to their position: Comedy must be in position 1 (since Disaster has to be to its right), and Disaster must be in position 2 because it's in the middle.


## Step 3: Determining the Last Genre
With Comedy in position 1 and Disaster in position 2, the only remaining genre is Time-Travel. Since there are no more clues to indicate otherwise, Time-Travel must take the last available spot, which is position 3.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |   1    |    2     |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy | Disaster | Time-Travel |

## Step 1: Identify the position of the Turkish nationality.
The Turkish person is in the middle, so they occupy position 2.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the Spanish nationality.
The Spanish person is to the left of the Turkish person. Since the Turkish person is in the middle (position 2), the Spanish person must be in position 1.


## Step 3: Place the remaining nationality, Italian.
With the Spanish and Turkish nationalities placed, the only spot left for the Italian is position 3.


The final solution table with the nationalities filled in according to the clues is:
