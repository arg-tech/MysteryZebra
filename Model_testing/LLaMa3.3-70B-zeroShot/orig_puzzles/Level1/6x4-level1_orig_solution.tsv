Lv1-6x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Identify the Freelancer and Russian Positions
From clue 12, the freelancer is on the far right (position 4). Clue 6 states the Russian is also on the far right, which means the Russian must be the freelancer since there can't be two people in position 4.


## Step 2: Determine the Nationality of Each Person
Clue 6 and step 1 confirm the Russian is in position 4. Clue 9 indicates the Italian is to the right of the fan of trance, but since the Russian is on the far right, the Italian must be in position 3 (because there's no one to the right of the Russian). Clue 8 mentions the Mexican is to the left of the fan of ambient. Given clue 14, which states the person whose sport is basketball is the Mexican, and considering the constraints, we can start placing nationalities.


## Step 3: Place the Accountant
From clue 13, the person driving the van is the accountant. Clue 1 indicates the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the accountant. Since the accountant cannot be in position 4 (freelancer/Russian), and considering the constraints about movie genres and sports, we start building possible positions.


## Step 4: Analyze Movie Genres
Clue 11 states the person watching documentary movies is to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Clue 1 adds that this person (documentary) is also to the right of the accountant. This gives us a sequence but not exact positions yet.


## Step 5: Apply Music Genre Clues
Clue 3 states the fan of jazz is the person whose sport is surfing. Clue 7 indicates the fan of trance is to the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Given these clues and others about music genres, we can start connecting preferences.


## Step 6: Combine Nationality, Job, Movie Genre, Music Genre, Sport, and Transport
From clue 14, the Mexican plays basketball. Clue 8 places the Mexican to the left of the fan of ambient, suggesting the Mexican could be in position 1 (since they have to be to the left of someone). Given all clues, let's place the information:
- The Russian is in position 4 and is a freelancer.
- The Italian must be in position 3 because they are to the right of the fan of trance (clue 9), and there must be someone (the fan of trance) to the left of the Italian but to the right of the surfer (jazz fan).
- The Mexican, being to the left of the ambient fan and playing basketball, likely fits into position 1 or 2, considering the need for the accountant to be placed with the van.


## Step 7: Final Placement
Given all constraints:
1. Clue 10 indicates the Russian (position 4) is to the right of the person driving the car.
2. The accountant drives a van (clue 13), so they cannot drive a car, placing them likely in position 1 or 2 since they need to be on the left for other clues to fit.
3. Clue 5 states the motorbike driver is to the left of the snowboarder, which can help place sports and transport.
4. The social-worker is to the right of the zombie movie watcher (clue 4), but with the freelancer in position 4, this gives us a challenge unless the social-worker is in position 3 or less, considering the Russian's placement.


## Step 8: Connect All Clues for Final Solution
Given all clues and steps:
- Mexican (basketball) likely fits position 1 because they need to be to the left of the ambient fan.
- The accountant (van driver) could fit position 2 since they must be on the left, and this allows for documentary watcher to be to their right (clue 1).
- Italian in position 3 as deduced for space and clue requirements.
- Russian freelancer in position 4.


## Step 9: Fill In Remaining Gaps
With the above steps, let's fill in the remaining gaps:
- Clue 2 places the freelancer to the right of martial-arts, which fits if martial-arts is in position 3 or less, considering our placements.
- The fan of jazz (surfer) and fan of trance must be placed according to clue 7, with trance being to the right of surfing, suggesting a possible order but needing to fit within the already established nationalities and jobs.

Lv1-6x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 - The architect is on the far left.
Given this information, we can start filling in the table:
|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |      4      |

## Step 2: Apply clue 6 - The electrician is the owner of the chinchilla.
And from clue 4, we know the person eating avocado is the owner of the chinchilla. Thus:
|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |      4      |

## Step 3: Apply clue 7 - The electrician is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
This means the person whose sport is ice-hockey must be in column 3 or 4, but since the architect is already on the far left and the electrician is next to them, ice-hockey must be in column 3:
|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |      4      |

And considering clue 13, the person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person watching superhero movies:
Given the constraints and applying other clues about movie genres, sports, and nationalities, we can continue to fill in the table.

## Step 7: Apply clue 5 - The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
And clue 13, which places ice-hockey after superhero movies, but considering all given clues about positions:

Lv1-6x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8
The person watching romance movies is on the far left.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |      4      |

| Hobby         |           |             |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   |             |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |           |             |
| Nationality   |           |             |           |             |
| Sport         |           |             |           |             |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 7
The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.

Since Romance is already on the far left, Soy-milk must be in column 2.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Beverage      |           | Soy-milk   |           |             |
| Hobby         |           |             |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   |             |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |           |             |
| Nationality   |           |             |           |             |
| Sport         |           |             |           |             |

## Step 3: Apply Clue 6
The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person watching horror movies.

Given that Romance is on the far left and Soy-milk (thus the person who drinks it) is in column 2, 7up must be in column 1 or 2 to be on the left of Horror. However, since column 1 is already determined to have Romance, and we can't have a beverage without a corresponding movie genre directly associated with each column yet, this clue suggests that Horror cannot be in column 1 (which is taken by Romance) but must be after Soy-milk.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 9
The malaysian is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.

This clue doesn't directly tell us where Baseball or Malaysian are yet, but it gives us a relationship to consider later.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 2
The fan of trance is on the left of the person watching horror movies.

Given Horror must be after Soy-milk (from Step 3), Trance also cannot be in column 1 and must precede Horror, suggesting Horror could be in column 3 or later if we consider Trance's placement relative to Horror.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 11
The person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person watching comedy movies.

Badminton drinks water (Clue 4), and since Badminton is on the left of Comedy, this doesn't directly tell us their positions but gives another relationship.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 14
The person who's hobby is baking is the person who's sport is cricket.

This links Baking with Cricket but doesn't give specific column placements yet.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 10
The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

Cricket (thus Baking, from Clue 14) precedes Woodworking in terms of Hobby, and by extension, Sport.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 1
The fan of funk is the person who's hobby is reading.

Funk is associated with Reading but doesn't give a direct placement yet.

## Step 10: Apply Clue 3
The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the fan of funk.

Skiing is after Funk (and thus Reading), giving another relationship.

## Step 11: Apply Clue 12
The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the spanish.

This gives a relationship between Video-games and Spanish but no direct placement yet.

## Step 12: Apply Clue 5
The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the fan of folk.

Baking (and thus Cricket, from Clue 14) precedes Folk.

## Step 13: Apply Remaining Clues
Considering all relationships and clues:
- Russian is on the far right (Clue 13).
- Baseball is on the far right (Clue 15), which conflicts with Russian unless they are the same person or there's a misunderstanding in the clue application. Given the constraints, let's reassess: If Russian is on the far right and Baseball also needs to be on the far right according to one interpretation, it might mean they are associated, but this seems to misinterpret Clue 15. It should mean Baseball is not necessarily on the far right but rather that the person whose sport is baseball is in a position that respects all other clues.

Given the complexity and the direct clues:
- Romance is far left.
- Soy-milk follows Romance (thus is in column 2).
- The fan of Trance is before Horror, and 7up is before Horror as well, suggesting a sequence but not exact positions without considering all sports and hobbies.

Let's try to assemble based on the most direct clues:
1. Romance (Column 1), followed by Soy-milk (Column 2).
2. Since Trance is before Horror and considering other placements, let's assume Trance could be in Column 3 for now.
3. Given Baseball cannot be on the far right if Russian is, but must respect all clues, we need to fit these pieces around the fixed points like Romance and the relationships between hobbies, sports, and nationalities.

Final Assembly Attempt:
Given the constraints and trying to fit all clues together without direct contradictions:


|               |     1     |      2      |     3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | 7up       | Soy-milk   | Water    |             |
| Hobby         | Baking    | Reading    | Video-games| Woodworking|
| Movie-Genre   | Romance   | Comedy     | Horror    | Zombie     |
| Music-Genre   | Folk      | Funk       | Trance    | R&B         |
| Nationality   | Spanish   | Colombian  | Malaysian | Russian     |
| Sport         | Cricket   | Badminton  | Skiing    | Baseball    |

This assembly attempts to respect all given clues, but due to the complexity and potential for misinterpretation of some clues (especially regarding the far right placements and how some clues interact), it's crucial to cross-check each clue against this solution.


The final answer is:

Lv1-6x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 12 to determine the position of the Egyptian.
The Egyptian is on the far left, so the Nationality column for person 1 is ""egyptian"".


## Step 2: Use clue 4 to place the person eating peas in relation to the Egyptian.
Since the person eating peas is on the right of the Egyptian and the Egyptian is at position 1, the person eating peas must be at position 2 or further to the right. However, we don't have enough information yet to determine their exact position.


## Step 3: Apply clue 13 to place the owner of the goat.
The owner of the goat is on the right of the Egyptian, so they could potentially be in position 2, 3, or 4.


## Step 4: Use clue 1 to place the scientist relative to the owner of the fish.
The scientist is on the left of the owner of the fish. Without knowing where the fish owner is yet, we can't determine their exact positions but know they are not in position 4 (since there must be someone to the right of the fish owner).


## Step 5: Apply clue 2 to place the musician relative to the Malaysian.
The musician is on the left of the Malaysian. This means the musician cannot be in position 4.


## Step 6: Use clue 3 to determine the order of music genres.
The fan of electronic is on the right of the fan of gospel, but without knowing where these individuals are yet, we can only note their relative positions.


## Step 7: Apply clue 5 to place the person whose hobby is camping in relation to the owner of the bird.
The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the owner of the bird. This means the bird owner cannot be in position 4.


## Step 8: Use clue 6 to identify the Japanese person and their pet.
The owner of the rabbit is Japanese, so we know one nationality and pet combination but not yet their position.


## Step 9: Apply clue 7 to determine the order of jobs for the librarian and paramedic.
The librarian is on the right of the paramedic. This gives us a job order but no specific positions yet.


## Step 10: Use clue 8 to place the person whose hobby is camping relative to the person eating zucchini.
The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person eating zucchini, giving us another relation but not exact positions.


## Step 11: Apply clue 9 to identify the Japanese person's hobby.
The Japanese is the person who's hobby is collecting. Now we know a nationality, pet (rabbit), and hobby combination.


## Step 12: Use clue 10 to place the person eating kiwi.
The person eating kiwi is on the far right, so position 4's food is kiwi.


## Step 13: Apply clue 11 to determine the order of music genres for trance and baking.
The fan of trance is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. This gives us another relation but no exact positions yet.


## Step 14: Use clue 14 to place the fan of trance relative to the musician.
The fan of trance is on the right of the musician, further restricting possible placements.


## Step 15: Apply clue 15 to identify the owner of the fish and their music genre.
The fan of gospel is the owner of the fish. This gives us a direct connection between a music genre and a pet.


Given all these clues and steps, we can start piecing together the information:


1. Egyptian is on the far left (position 1).
2. Owner of the goat is to the right of the Egyptian.
3. Person eating peas is to the right of the Egyptian but not necessarily directly next to them.
4. Japanese person owns a rabbit and has collecting as a hobby.
5. Person eating kiwi is on the far right (position 4).


Given these direct placements and relations, let's try to fill in more information:


- Since the musician is to the left of the Malaysian (clue 2) and the fan of trance is to the right of the musician (clue 14), we have a sequence but not exact positions.
- The scientist must be to the left of the fish owner, who likes gospel music (from clue 15).
- The librarian is to the right of the paramedic.


Now, let's combine all clues to see if we can deduce more:


- Egyptian on the far left means position 1 is ""egyptian"".
- Owner of the goat to the right of the Egyptian could be in position 2.
- Since the person eating peas is to the right of the Egyptian and considering other placements, peas might fit well in position 3 or 4, but kiwi takes position 4.
- Japanese (collecting hobby, rabbit pet) can't be position 1 (Egyptian), so they could fit into positions 2, 3, or 4. But since kiwi is at position 4 and the Japanese has a specific hobby and pet, we need to place them carefully considering other clues.


Let's try to finalize based on key clues:


- Position 1: Egyptian
- The owner of the fish likes gospel music (clue 15), and electronic is to the right of gospel (clue 3).
- Since the scientist is to the left of the fish owner, and we know the Egyptian's position, let's consider how jobs, hobbies, pets, and foods can be distributed.


Given all clues, a direct solution requires careful placement considering all relations. Let's finalize:


Position 1: Egyptian, Paramedic, Fish, Gospel, Peas isn't correct for peas but fits other initial placements.
Position 2: Malaysian, Musician, Bird, Electronic, Lemon could work given some adjustments for other positions.
Position 3: Pakistani, Scientist, Goat, Punk, Zucchini seems plausible considering the need to place the scientist and goat owner.
Position 4: Japanese, Librarian, Rabbit, Trance, Kiwi fits with kiwi on the far right and other placements.


However, we must ensure all clues fit perfectly:


1. Egyptian is far left.
2. Scientist is left of fish owner (who likes gospel), so the scientist can't be position 4, and the fish owner (gospel) isn't in position 1 or 4.
3. Musician is left of Malaysian, fitting our current setup.
4. Peas are right of Egyptian but not necessarily directly next to them; this could fit if peas aren't in position 2.
5. Camping hobby is right of bird owner and left of zucchini eater.


Given these considerations and re-evaluating for a precise fit:


The final solution, ensuring all clues match up correctly and each person has a unique combination of nationality, job, hobby, music genre, pet, and food, requires adjusting our initial guesses to fit every clue perfectly. Let's correct the approach by directly constructing from the clues without assuming positions that don't fit all given conditions.


Considering the complexity and the direct application of clues:


- Egyptian on far left.
- Kiwi on far right.
- Japanese owns rabbit and has collecting hobby.
- Scientist to the left of fish owner (gospel music).
- Musician to the left of Malaysian.


Directly solving with these constraints in mind, we should construct a table that adheres to all given conditions without making incorrect assumptions about positions. Given the step-by-step breakdown, let's ensure each clue directly influences the placement:


Given this, the precise arrangement considering every clue and avoiding misinterpretation is key. However, without directly calculating each possible combination and ensuring adherence to every single clue in a stepwise manner that was initially intended, we recognize the necessity for careful placement.

Lv1-6x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to fill in the table.


1. The Brazilian is on the right of the person eating plum.
2. The French is on the far right.
3. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating garlic.
4. The owner of the rat is on the far right.
5. The person driving the train is the owner of the chinchilla.
6. The person driving the train is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
7. The person who's hobby is sudoku is the person drinking juice.
8. The person driving the jet-ski is the person who's hobby is cooking.
9. The Dutch is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.
10. The person drinking juice is on the right of the Brazilian.
11. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person eating eggplant.
12. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person drinking tea.
13. The person driving the car is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.


From clue 2 and 4, we know the French person owns a rat and is on the far right.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 2 and 4
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      |              |           |            |         |
| Food          |              |           |            |         |

| Transport     |              |           |            |         |


From clue 5, the person driving the train owns a chinchilla.


## Step 2: Consider Clue 5
Since the French person is on the far right and owns a rat, and from clue 5, the train driver owns a chinchilla, the train cannot be driven by the French person.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 6
The train driver is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. This means gardening must be to the left of the train driver but not necessarily directly next to them.


## Step 4: Use Clue 7 and 10
The person whose hobby is sudoku drinks juice, and this person is on the right of the Brazilian (clue 10). So, we have a sequence: Brazilian, Sudoku (juice), but we don't know where this sequence starts yet.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating garlic. This means our sequence from step 4 must be followed by garlic.


## Step 6: Consider Clue 1
The Brazilian is on the right of the person eating plum. So, we have another piece of the sequence: Plum, Brazilian, Sudoku (juice), Garlic.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 9 and 8
The Dutch is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking, and the jet-ski driver has a cooking hobby. This gives us another sequence but doesn't tell us where it fits yet.


## Step 8: Use Clue 11
The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person eating eggplant. We don't know where this sequence fits yet.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 12
The owner of the frog is on the left of the person drinking tea. This gives us another piece but doesn't specify its position.


## Step 10: Consider Clue 13
The car driver is on the left of the person whose hobby is sudoku. Given that sudoku drinks juice, this means the car must be driven by someone to the left of the sudoku person.


Given all these clues and steps, let's try to assemble the table:


1. Nationality: From clue 2, French is on the far right. Clue 9 suggests Dutch is before cooking, which could fit before Brazilian or in another position. The Brazilian must be after plum (clue 1) but also before sudoku (juice) as per clues 7 and 10.


2. Food: Plum must come before Brazilian (and thus before juice and garlic), so a possible sequence for food is Plum, ?, Garlic, ? (since French on the far right doesn't give us direct info on food yet).


3. Beverage: Juice is drunk by the sudoku person, who is after the Brazilian but before garlic.


4. Hobby: Sudoku (juice) comes after Brazilian and before garlic. Gardening must be before the train driver (clue 6), and cooking (jet-ski) follows Dutch.


5. Pet: The chinchilla owner drives the train, and the rat owner is French on the far right.


6. Transport: Train's position relative to gardening and sudoku/juice helps place it. Car must be before sudoku.


Considering all clues and assembling them:


Given that we have a lot of information but need to carefully place each piece, let's finalize based on the most direct clues and logical deductions:


- French is on the far right with a rat.
- Brazilian is after plum and before sudoku (who drinks juice).
- Sudoku (juice) is before garlic.
- Train driver owns a chinchilla and is after gardening.
- Dutch is before cooking, which is associated with jet-ski.


Here's a possible arrangement based on these deductions:


#############
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |    4    |
| Beverage      |  Coffee     |   Fanta   |  Juice     |   Tea   |
| Food          |  Eggplant   |   Plum    |  Garlic    |   Lime  |

Note: The arrangement provided is based on the logical deductions from the clues given. However, without manually trying all combinations or using a more systematic approach like a logic grid, there's always a chance for error in such complex puzzles. This solution seems to fit all the given conditions but verify each clue against the arrangement to ensure accuracy."

## Step 1: Analyze Clue 8
The person eating orange is on the far right.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 15
The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the far right.
Combining with Clue 8, the person eating orange must also be the one whose hobby is filmmaking because both are on the far right.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 14
The person driving the scooter is on the far left.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 13
The person eating blueberry is on the left of the engineer. The electrician is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
Given that the filmmaker is on the far right, the electrician must be to their left.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person watching musical movies.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 12
The person eating raspberry is the person driving the jet-ski.


## Step 7: Analyze Clue 11
The person eating onion is the person who's hobby is baking.


## Step 9: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 4
The person watching satire movies is on the left of the mechanic. The person driving the van is on the left of the mechanic.
This implies that the person watching satire movies is also to the left of the person driving the van, or they could be the same person.


## Step 10: Analyze Clue 9
The malaysian is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.


## Step 11: Analyze Clue 10
The freelancer is on the left of the malaysian.


## Step 12: Combine Information and Fill Table
From the clues:
- The scooter driver is on the far left.
- The electrician is to the left of the filmmaker (who eats orange and is on the far right).
- The person eating onion (baker) is not yet placed but must be to the right of the sports movie watcher.
- The jet-ski driver (raspberry eater) is to the right of the musical movie watcher.
- The van driver is to the left of the mechanic, and the satire movie watcher is also to the left of the mechanic.
- The freelancer is to the left of the Malaysian.

Given these clues, let's place what we can:
1. Scooter (far left)
2. Electrician (left of filmmaker, but exact position not yet clear)
3. Freelancer (to the left of Malaysian, but exact positions not clear)
4. Filmmaker/Organ eater (far right)

Considering Clue 3 (electrician is on the left of the German) and knowing the electrician's relative position to the filmmaker:
- Electrician cannot be in position 1 because then the German would have to be between the electrician and the filmmaker, which contradicts other placements based on hobbies and foods.

So, let's start placing based on known positions and relationships:


Given all clues and trying to fit them together without contradicting any information:

Lv1-6x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
The person watching musical movies is on the far left. This means column 1 watches musical movies.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 9
The Chinese is on the far left. Combining with clue 4, we know the Chinese watches musical movies.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 15
The Chinese is the owner of the rabbit. Now we have the Chinese's pet as well.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 14
The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the fan of gospel. Since the Chinese owns the rabbit and is on the far left, the fan of gospel must be in column 2.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 12
The fan of gospel is the owner of the turtle. Now we know the pet for the person in column 2.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 8
The fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of gospel. This means the fan of jazz must be in column 3 or further to the right.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching documentary movies is the Thai. We don't know the position yet, but we'll come back to this.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 11
The fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. This means the order for music genres so far related to positions is: gospel (column 2), reggae (to the left of documentary, but we don't know where documentary is yet except it's not column 1 because musical is there and not column 2 because gospel is there).

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 3
The Chinese is the person who's sport is rowing. Since the Chinese is in column 1, rowing is their sport.

## Step 10: Analyze Clue 5
The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. This means skydiving must be in column 2 or further to the right.

## Step 11: Analyze Clue 6
The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. We don't know their positions yet, but we'll consider this with other clues.

## Step 12: Analyze Clue 7
The person who's sport is soccer is on the far right. This means column 4 plays soccer.

## Step 13: Analyze Clue 10
The Nigerian is the person who's sport is soccer. Now we know the nationality for column 4.

## Step 14: Analyze Clue 16
The owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is soccer. This gives us the pet for column 4.

## Step 15: Combine Information
- Column 1: Chinese, musical movies, rowing, rabbit.
- Column 2: Gospel music, turtle (but we don't know the nationality or movie genre yet).
- Column 3 and 4 are less clear but we have soccer in column 4 with the Nigerian.

## Step 16: Further Analysis
Given the Thai watches documentary movies and considering clue 2 (the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the Thai), and knowing the Chinese is in column 1, the Thai cannot be in column 1. If the Thai were in column 4, there would be no room for ""reading"" to the right, so the Thai must be in column 2 or 3.

## Step 17: Finalize Positions
- Since the fan of gospel is in column 2 and owns a turtle (from clue 12), and considering other clues about positions relative to each other, we start filling in:
- Column 1: Chinese, musical movies, rowing, rabbit.
- Column 2: Gospel music, turtle. Given the owner of the rabbit (Chinese) is on the left of the fan of gospel, this fits. But we need to determine the hobby and movie genre for column 2.

## Step 18: More Clues
- Clue 13 says the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since soccer (column 4) can't be climbing, climbing must be in column 3.
- This means traveling (clue 6) must be in column 2 because it's to the left of climbing.

## Step 19: Finalizing Hobbies and Movie Genres
- Column 1: Chinese, musical movies, rowing, rabbit. Hobby could be fishing or one not yet ruled out.
- Column 2: Gospel music, turtle, traveling (hobby), needs a movie genre not yet assigned to this column.
- Column 3: Needs to be determined but has climbing as the sport and must have a hobby of skydiving based on clue 5.
- Column 4: Nigerian, soccer, goldfish.

## Step 20: Last Pieces
- The Thai watches documentary movies. Given the constraints, if the Thai is in column 3 (because column 2 is taken by someone with gospel music and traveling as a hobby), this would fit with clue 1 and allow for ""reading"" to be in column 4 or another configuration that fits all clues.
- However, since the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the Thai (clue 2) and the Thai can't be in column 4 because soccer is there, the Thai must indeed be in column 3, making documentary movies in column 3.
- This leaves time-travel movies for column 2 (as all other genres are taken), and since reading must be to the right of the Thai, reading goes in column 4.

## Step 21: Final Table Construction
Given all clues:
- Column 1: Chinese, musical movies, rowing, rabbit, fishing (as it's the only hobby left that fits).
- Column 2: Argentine (by elimination), time-travel movies, traveling, gospel music, turtle.
- Column 3: Thai, documentary movies, climbing, skydiving, mouse (by elimination for pets).
- Column 4: Nigerian, superhero movies (by elimination), soccer, reading, goldfish.

Lv1-6x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the most restrictive clues first.


From clue 4, we know the helicopter is on the far left.
From clue 11 and 1, since the rat owner is also a metal fan and is on the far left, this person must be driving the helicopter because of clue 14 which states the badminton player is on the far left. However, given that clue 14 directly contradicts our initial assumption based on clues 4 and 11, we need to re-evaluate: The far left position, according to clue 14, is actually for badminton, not necessarily for the helicopter or rat owner directly. But considering clue 1 and 11 together, it means the metal fan (who owns a rat) must indeed be on the far left. Since clue 4 places the helicopter on the far left and given the apparent contradiction with clue 14, we deduce that the badminton player is indeed on the far left but does not directly influence the placement of the rat owner or the helicopter driver without further clues.


From clue 9, the engineer is on the far right.
From clue 2, water is to the right of ice-hockey.
From clue 6, the chef is to the right of the journalist.
From clue 3, the doctor likes jazz.
From clue 7, the doctor is to the right of trance.
From clue 8, tea is to the right of goldfish.
From clue 12, iced-tea drinks the train.
From clue 13, ice-hockey is to the left of goldfish.


Given these clues, let's start constructing the table:


1. Badminton (far left) - From clue 14
2. Metal (same as 1 because rat owner is on far left and likes metal) - From clues 1 and 11
3. ? 
4. Engineer (far right) - From clue 9


Since the helicopter driver is on the far left (clue 4), and badminton player also must be on the far left, this suggests a potential conflict unless we consider that these roles could indeed align under specific circumstances or interpretations of the clues provided.


Let's place what we know for sure:


- The doctor likes jazz (clue 3) and is to the right of trance (clue 7), so the order must include ""trance, doctor"" at some point.
- Given that ice-hockey is to the left of goldfish (clue 13), and water is to the right of ice-hockey (clue 2), we can start forming a sequence: ""ice-hockey, ?, water"".
- Since tea is to the right of goldfish (clue 8) and considering the previous point, it seems likely that ""goldfish"" fits into our sequence as well.
- The chef is to the right of the journalist (clue 6).
- Iced-tea drinks the train (clue 12), but we don't know where this person fits yet.


To resolve potential conflicts and missing pieces:


Given that badminton must be on the far left, let's consider how these clues might align with the other information provided:


1. The person who plays badminton could also own a rat and like metal (aligning with being on the far left).
2. Since the doctor is to the right of trance and likes jazz, this gives us a specific music order but not an exact placement yet.
3. Knowing the engineer is on the far right helps to anchor our placements.


Given all clues and attempting to align them without direct contradictions:


The final table attempts to fit all given conditions. Note that there might be slight adjustments needed based on re-evaluation of certain clue interactions, especially considering potential misunderstandings in the initial analysis.

The Japanese is on the far right. This means the last column (column 4) is for the Japanese.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 15
The Dutch is on the right of the coach. This clue doesn't directly tell us which column the Dutch or the coach is in, but it gives us a relationship between two nationalities/jobs.

## Step 3: Use Clues 1 and 14
The Dutch is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (Clue 1), and the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the Dutch (Clue 14). This means the Dutch and the skier are in adjacent columns, with the Dutch to the left.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 2
The analyst is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. This tells us about the relative positions of the analyst and the basketball player but doesn't specify which column they're in yet.

## Step 5: Combine Clues 3 and 9
The person who's sport is basketball is the person driving the motorbike (Clue 3), and the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person eating lettuce (Clue 9). This gives us a relationship between the basketball player/motorbike rider and the lettuce eater.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 12
The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person eating tomato. Now we know the basketball player (also the motorbike rider) is to the right of the tomato eater.
