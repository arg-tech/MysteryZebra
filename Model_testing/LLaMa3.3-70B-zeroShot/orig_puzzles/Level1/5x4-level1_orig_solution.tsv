From clue 5, we know the fan of classical music eats asparagus.
From clue 9, we also know that the person eating asparagus watches family movies.

So far, we have:
|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Food          | asparagus |             |            |            |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   | family    |             |            |            |
| Music-Genre   | classical |             |            |            |
| Pet           |            |             |            |            |

From clue 7, the fan of dubstep is on the right of the person eating asparagus. This means:
|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Food          | asparagus |             |            |            |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |            |
| Movie-Genre   | family    |             |            |            |
| Music-Genre   | classical | dubstep     |            |            |
| Pet           |            |             |            |            |

From clue 6, the fan of d&b is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since we already have a person to the right of asparagus (dubstep fan), this means the d&b fan must be in position 1 or to the left of someone else not yet placed.
However, given our current setup and considering all clues, it seems more likely that new positions will be determined based on further deductions.

From clue 3, the person whose hobby is writing is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since we've tentatively placed dubstep (and thus need to adjust for d&b's correct placement), let's reassess:
Given asparagus is already in position 1 with classical music and family movies, and considering clue 7 places dubstep after asparagus, our initial setup needs adjustment to fit all clues properly.

From clue 2, the person whose hobby is chess is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
From clue 4, the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
This implies an order for pets but doesn't give us their foods or hobbies directly.

From clue 10, the owner of the horse is the person watching epic movies.
From clue 1, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person eating cabbage.
We don't know where cabbage is yet, so let's keep going.

From clue 8, the person eating carrot is on the left of the person whose hobby is card-games.
This gives us a relation but not an exact position without knowing more about card-games in relation to other hobbies or preferences.

Given the complexity and my misunderstanding in directly applying each step sequentially without visual aids or further deductions, let's approach this by summarizing known direct relationships and attempting a final placement based on all clues:


1. Asparagus - Classical - Family
2. Dubstep is after asparagus.
3. D&b fan is to the left of chinchilla owner but must be after considering other placements.
4. Writing hobby is to the left of d&b fan.
5. Chess is to the right of chinchilla; guinea-pig owner is also to the right of chinchilla.
6. Horse owner watches epic movies.
7. Documentary watcher is to the right of cabbage eater.
8. Carrot eater is to the left of card-games hobbyist.

To solve it directly as requested:


Given all clues and attempting a direct solution without misinterpretation:
- Asparagus with classical and family movies (Position 1)
- Followed by dubstep (but we need to place d&b, which is before chinchilla)
- Writing must be before d&b
- Card-games after carrot
- Chess after chinchilla, guinea-pig after chinchilla
- Horse with epic movies
- Documentary after cabbage


A possible arrangement considering all clues (though the step-by-step process here might not directly lead to a singular solution without assuming some positions based on clue interactions):


|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |     4      |
| Food          | asparagus | garlic     | cabbage   | carrot    |
| Hobby         | writing   | skydiving  | chess     | card-games|
| Movie-Genre   | family    | romance    | documentary| epic      |
| Music-Genre   | classical | d&b        | dubstep   | electronic|
| Pet           | mouse     | chinchilla | guinea-pig| horse     |

Lv1-5x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 4
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right (Position 4).


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 5 and 11
From clue 5, the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Clue 11 states the person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the ferret. This gives us a sequence but not exact positions yet.


## Step 3: Analyze Clues 1 and 6
The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person whose sport is cricket (clue 1). The person whose sport is parkour is on the right of the person drinking fanta (clue 6).


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 10
The fan of disco is on the far right, which means the far right must be associated with disco music and hot-chocolate.


## Step 5: Analyze Clues 2 and 7
The fan of disco is on the right of the person whose sport is handball (clue 2). The fan of r&b is on the right of the person watching documentary movies (clue 7).


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 8
The owner of the hamster is the fan of r&b, giving us another association.


## Step 7: Combine All Information
Given the constraints:
- Hot-chocolate and disco are on the far right.
- The person drinking 7up is to the right of coffee.
- Fanta is to the left of the ferret owner.
- Drama movies are to the right of cricket sport.
- Parkour sport is to the right of fanta drinker.
- Skiing sport is to the right of the rat owner.
- R&b fan is to the right of documentary movies and owns a hamster.
- Satire movies are associated with indie music.

Let's try to piece together the information into the table:


|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |       4       |
| Beverage      |             |         |          |               |
| Movie-Genre   |             |         |          |               |
| Music-Genre   |             |         |          |               |
| Pet           |             |         |          |               |
| Sport         |             |         |          |               |

From clue 10 and 4, the far right (position 4) is disco and hot-chocolate.


## Step 8: Finalize Positions
Considering all clues:
- The fan of indie watches satire movies.
- Since the fan of disco is on the far right and also to the right of handball (clue 2), handball must be in position 3, with skiing being in either position 1 or 2 due to its relation with rat ownership and the constraints provided by other clues.


Given these complex relationships and the need for precise step-by-step deduction which was initially aimed but not fully achieved due to the complexity of integrating all clues seamlessly into a single, coherent narrative without visual aids, let's synthesize:


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |      1      |    2    |    3     |       4       |
| Beverage      | coffee     | 7up     | fanta    | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary| satire  | drama    |               |
| Music-Genre   | r&b        | indie   | electronic| disco         |
| Pet           | hamster    | ferret  | pony     | rat           |

Lv1-5x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person whose sport is basketball is on the far left. This means the first column is for basketball.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clues 6 and 3
The person eating grapes drives a trike (Clue 6) and also owns a rabbit (Clue 3). Since the Chinese is to the left of the person driving the trike (Clue 7), and given that basketball is on the far left, we can start forming a sequence: Basketball - ? - Trike (Grapes, Rabbit).

## Step 3: Analyzing Clues 2 and 12
The person whose sport is snowboarding is to the right of the person driving the tram (Clue 2), and the person eating grapes is to the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding (Clue 12). This means we have a sequence for sports: Basketball - Snowboarding - ?.

## Step 4: Combining Information
Since the person driving the trike eats grapes and is on the left of the owner of the mouse (Clue 11), and considering Clue 12, we can infer that snowboarding must be to the left of grapes. Thus, our sequence for sports becomes clearer but needs to fit with transport and food clues.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clues 4 and 8
The person eating cauliflower is to the right of the person driving the trike (Clue 4), and the person driving the bike is to the right of the person driving the tram (Clue 8). Given that snowboarding is to the right of the tram driver, we can start forming transport sequences.

## Step 6: Integrating Nationality Clues
The Chinese is to the left of the trike driver (Clue 7), and since basketball is on the far left, this suggests a potential nationality order but needs careful integration with other clues.

## Step 7: Finalizing Sequences
From Clue 5, tennis is to the right of lettuce. With all clues considered, we must align sports, transport, food, pets, and nationalities in a way that satisfies all conditions.


Given the complexity and the necessity to adhere strictly to the format while providing a clear step-by-step logical deduction for each clue, let's directly construct the solution based on the given clues:


|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |       4       |
| Food          | Cabbage   | Lettuce     | Grapes | Cauliflower  |
| Nationality   | Chinese   | American    | French | British      |
| Pet           | Mouse     | Frog        | Rabbit | Fish         |
| Sport         | Basketball| Tennis      | Snow  | Weightlifting|
| Transport     | Tram      | Bike        | Trike | Subway       |

The final answer is:

|               |     1      |      2       |    3    |       4       |
| Food          | Cabbage   | Lettuce     | Grapes | Cauliflower  |
| Nationality   | Chinese   | American    | French | British      |
| Pet           | Mouse     | Frog        | Rabbit | Fish         |
| Sport         | Basketball| Tennis      | Snowboarding | Weightlifting|

Lv1-5x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the positions based on direct clues
From clue 5, the jet-ski is on the far left. From clue 11, soy-milk is also on the far left, so the person drinking soy-milk drives a jet-ski.

From clue 4, the guinea-pig owner is on the far right. From clue 7, the Thai person is also on the far right, so the Thai person owns a guinea-pig.

From clue 10, the coffee drinker is on the far right. Since the Thai person is already determined to be on the far right and drinking coffee (as per clue 10), this aligns with previous information.


## Step 2: Analyze pet ownership and positions
Clue 1 states the goat owner is to the left of the cat owner.

Clue 3 indicates the roller is to the right of the snake owner. Since the guinea-pig (and thus the Thai person) is on the far right, and considering clue 2 (raspberry eater is to the left of the roller), we start seeing a possible arrangement.


## Step 3: Integrate food preferences into the analysis
Clue 8 places the raspberry eater to the right of the Japanese. Clue 9 indicates the Indonesian is to the left of the garlic eater.

Considering clue 2 and knowing the roller's position relative to the snake (clue 3), we can start building a sequence.


## Step 4: Combine all information for a comprehensive solution
- Soy-milk drinker on the far left drives a jet-ski.
- Coffee drinker on the far right is Thai and owns a guinea-pig.
- The roller driver must be to the left of the coffee drinker but to the right of the snake owner.
- Indonesian is to the left of garlic eater, and since soy-milk (thus jet-ski) is on the far left, Indonesian likely eats garlic or is in a position that allows for this arrangement.

Given these clues, let's attempt to fill out the table logically:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   |          |           | coffee     |
| Food          |            |          |           |            |
| Nationality   |            |          |           | Thai       |
| Pet           |            |          |           | guinea-pig |
| Transport     | jet-ski    |          |           |            |

From clue 6, the taxi is to the left of cola. Since the roller must be to the right of the snake (clue 3) and to the left of raspberry eater (clue 2), and considering the positions of pets and transports:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | cola     |           | coffee     |
| Food          |            | garlic   |           |            |
| Nationality   | Indonesian |          |           | Thai       |
| Pet           |            | goat     | snake     | guinea-pig |
| Transport     | jet-ski    | taxi     | roller    | trike      |

However, we must adjust based on clue 9 (Indonesian to the left of garlic eater) and other clues. Let's correct the table considering all given information:


Clue 12 places the trike to the left of grapefruit eater. Given the constraints, a logical arrangement starts to emerge.


## Step 5: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
Considering the roller is to the right of the snake (clue 3) and to the left of the raspberry eater (clue 2), and integrating all other information:


The Japanese person must eat raspberry (from clue 8, considering positions). The Chinese or Indonesian could potentially eat grapefruit, given the constraints.


Given the need for the taxi to be to the left of cola (clue 6) and aligning with other clues about pets and transport:


Let's finalize a logical arrangement that fits all given clues.


The final answer is:

Lv1-5x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we can.


## Step 1: Apply clue 2 - The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.
Given this, the hobbies row for column 1 must be ""gardening"".


## Step 2: Apply clue 12 - The journalist is on the far left.
This means the job for column 1 is ""journalist"".


## Step 3: Apply clue 10 - The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the owner of the snake.
Since gardening is in column 1, and given clue 8 (the owner of the snake is the dancer), the dancer must be in column 2 because it's the only position to the right of column 1.


## Step 4: Apply clue 8 - The owner of the snake is the dancer.
So, for column 2, under ""Job"", we have ""dancer"" and under ""Pet"", we have ""snake"".


## Step 5: Apply clue 3 - The Canadian is on the far right.
Given clue 6 (the musician is on the far right), this means the musician must be Canadian because they occupy the same position.


## Step 6: Apply clue 1 and clue 8 for confirmation - Both state the dancer owns the snake.
We already placed the dancer in column 2.


## Step 7: Apply clue 13 - The Australian is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
Since the Australian must be to the right of someone whose hobby is skydiving, and given that gardening is already placed in column 1, skydiving cannot be in column 4 (because there would be no one to the right of it for the Australian). This implies skydiving could potentially be in columns 2 or 3.


## Step 8: Apply clue 11 - The Australian is on the right of the owner of the snake.
Given that the dancer (owner of the snake) is in column 2, the Australian must be in column 3 or further to the right. However, since the Canadian is on the far right (column 4), the Australian cannot be to the right of column 3.


## Step 9: Apply clue 14 - The Spanish is on the right of the Turkish.
This means the possible positions for these nationalities are limited by previous placements.


## Step 10: Combine information from steps above and apply remaining clues to fill in the table.
From clue 4, the owner of the ferret eats potato. Clue 5 says this person is to the right of someone eating mango. Given that pumpkin's owner has the lizard (clue 9) and considering all placements so far, we start seeing limited options for each category.


## Step 11: Finalize positions based on elimination and direct clues.
- Column 1: Journalist, Gardening
- Column 2: Dancer, Snake, to be determined for food and nationality (but Australian cannot be here because it must be to the right of the snake's owner)
- Column 3: Possibly Australian (must be to the right of the dancer), and considering clue 13, if skydiving is here, then Australian fits perfectly in column 4 or must be adjacent.
- Column 4: Musician, Canadian


Given all clues, especially with the dancer owning a snake in column 2, and the musician being Canadian in column 4, we fill in based on elimination:


Column 1 (Journalist, Gardening) cannot have snake or musician. Considering clue 9 (pumpkin/lizard), clue 14 (Spanish/Turkish order), and others, we place the remaining items by process of elimination.


The final answer is:

Lv1-5x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 9
The Indonesian is on the far right, so column 4 is filled with ""Indonesian"" for Nationality.

## Step 2: Using Clue 7 and Clue 3
Since the person driving the ship is also into snowboarding (Clue 7) and this person's hobby is skydiving (Clue 3), we can start filling in some categories. However, without direct placement clues yet for these activities, we note them for future steps.

## Step 3: Applying Clue 10
The person whose sport is rugby drives the van. This connects two categories but doesn't give a direct column placement without more information.

## Step 4: Combining Clues 1 and 2
Since the rugby player is to the left of the Pakistani (Clue 1), and the snowboarder is to the right of the rugby player (Clue 2), we have a sequence but not yet a direct placement in columns.

## Step 5: Using Clue 12
The Pakistani drives the bike. This gives us a potential column for the Pakistani but doesn't directly place them without considering other clues.

## Step 6: Applying Clues 5 and 8
The sports movie watcher is to the left of the Brazilian (Clue 5), and the climber is also to the left of the Brazilian (Clue 8). This suggests a sequence but requires integration with other clues for precise placement.

## Step 7: Integrating Clue 6
The Brazilian is to the right of the dancer. This clue helps in sequencing the nationalities and hobbies.

## Step 8: Considering Clue 4
The documentary watcher is to the right of the ship driver (who is also into snowboarding, from Clue 7). Since we know the Indonesian is on the far right, this starts to give us a clearer picture of how some categories might align, especially considering the unique combinations of activities and nationalities.

## Step 9: Finalizing with Remaining Clues
- From Clue 11, the gardener watches animation movies.
- Given all sequences and clues, let's piece together the puzzle:
1. We know the Indonesian is on the far right (Clue 9).
2. The Pakistani drives a bike (Clue 12) and must be to the left of the rugby player (Clue 1), who drives a van (Clue 10).
3. The snowboarder, who also skydives (Clue 3) and drives a ship (Clue 7), must be to the right of the rugby player (Clue 2).
4. Since the Brazilian is to the right of the dancer (Clue 6) and to the left of the sports movie watcher (which doesn't directly fit without considering other placements), we have to align these with the climber being to the left of the Brazilian (Clue 8).

Given all clues, a potential arrangement starts to emerge:
- The sequence for Nationality could be deduced with Indonesian on the far right.
- Sport: Given rugby is next to Pakistani and snowboarding is after rugby, with climbing before Brazilian, we start seeing a pattern.
- Transport: With van, bike, ship, and one left (car or the remaining), placements can be deduced based on sport and nationality clues.

Let's align all information:
1. Climber must be before Brazilian, and sports movie watcher is also before Brazilian but after climber, suggesting an order for Sport and Nationality.
2. Pakistani (bike) is before rugby (van), which is before snowboarding (ship), helping to place Transport.
3. With the Indonesian on the far right and driving not specified, we infer based on remaining transport options.

Given these steps and integrating all clues:
- A potential mistake in direct sequential logic without visual aid means we must reconsider placements based on all clues simultaneously.

Lv1-5x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3 and 11 to find the position of the British person and the fish owner.
The person watching family movies is British (clue 3) and also owns a fish (clue 11). This means the British person watches family movies and owns a fish.


## Step 2: Use clue 5 to identify the Pakistani person's movie preference.
The Pakistani person watches epic movies.


## Step 3: Apply clue 8 and 10 to determine the relative positions of the person eating apple, the person watching family movies, and the person eating eggplant.
The person watching family movies is on the right of the person eating apple (clue 8) and on the left of the person eating eggplant (clue 10). This gives us a sequence: apple, family movies, eggplant.


## Step 4: Use clue 12 to place the watermelon eater.
The person eating watermelon is on the far right.


## Step 5: Combine information from steps 3 and 4 to get a partial food sequence.
We have: apple, family movies (British, fish owner), eggplant, watermelon. Given that family movies are associated with the British person who owns a fish, we can start building our table with this information.


## Step 6: Apply clue 9 to place the Mexican.
The owner of the fish is on the right of the Mexican. Since the fish owner is also the British person watching family movies, the Mexican must be to the left of the British person.


## Step 7: Use clue 1 to place the horror movie watcher relative to the fish owner.
The person watching horror movies is on the right of the owner of the fish. Given that the fish owner watches family movies and is in the middle (based on previous steps), the horror movie watcher must be after the British person.


## Step 8: Apply clue 7 to place the horse owner.
The owner of the horse is on the right of the person watching horror movies.


## Step 9: Use clue 2 to place the gardening hobbyist relative to the epic movie watcher (Pakistani).
The person whose hobby is gardening is on the left of the person watching epic movies. Since the Pakistani watches epic movies, the gardener must be before the Pakistani.


## Step 10: Apply clue 6 and 4 to determine the positions of the turtle owner, magic-tricks hobbyist, and cooking hobbyist.
The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person whose hobby is cooking (clue 6), and the magic-tricks hobbyist is on the right of the turtle owner (clue 4). This sequence must fit within our existing structure.


## Step 11: Combine all clues to fill in the table.
Given the complexity and interrelation of clues, we deduce:
- The British person watches family movies and owns a fish (clues 3, 11).
- The Pakistani watches epic movies (clue 5).
- The sequence for foods is apple, then the British person (family movies, fish), then eggplant, and watermelon on the far right (clues 8, 10, 12).
- The Mexican is before the British person (clue 9).
- Horror movies are watched by someone after the British person (clue 1), which would be the eggplant eater since the British person eats something between apple and eggplant.
- The horror movie watcher is followed by the horse owner (clue 7), placing them third or fourth, but since watermelon is last, the horror movie watcher must eat eggplant, followed by the horse owner who eats watermelon.
- Gardening is before epic movies (Pakistani), suggesting gardening goes with either the apple eater (Mexican) or another hobby for the British person isn't specified directly against gardening, so we consider other placements based on remaining clues.


## Step 12: Finalize positions based on remaining clues and logical deduction.
Considering all previous steps:
- The sequence starts with Mexican (because they are before the British fish owner), likely associated with apple to fit the sequence from clue 8.
- Then comes the British person with family movies and a fish, who must eat something between apple and eggplant; let's place strawberry here as it fits well and doesn't conflict with other clues directly.
- The next is the horror movie watcher (eggplant eater), followed by the watermelon eater.
- Epic movies are watched by the Pakistani, which can fit after gardening if we consider the sequence carefully.


Given these deductions and fitting hobbies, nationalities, pets, and movies together without direct conflicts:
- Mexican with apple, cooking (to fit turtle and magic-tricks clues later), and a pet that isn't specified yet but must be before the fish.
- British with strawberry, family movies, and a fish.
- Then, the horror movie watcher (who could be Italian based on elimination) with eggplant, followed by the Pakistani with watermelon, epic movies, and a horse to fit all remaining clues without conflict.


The final answer is:

Lv1-5x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is dancing.
From clue 3, we know the person whose hobby is dancing is on the far left.


## Step 2: Identify the beverage and sport associated with the person whose hobby is dancing.
From clue 11, we understand that the person whose hobby is dancing drinks water. From clue 5, we also know the person drinking water is a fan of rock music.


## Step 3: Determine the position and details of the person who watches documentary movies and their relation to cycling.
Clue 1 indicates the person whose sport is cycling is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.


## Step 4: Establish the relationship between badminton, gardening, and family movies.
From clue 2, we know badminton is on the left of gardening. Clue 10 places family movies to the right of badminton.


## Step 5: Place the fan of electronic music in relation to juice.
Clue 4 states the fan of electronic music is on the right of the person drinking juice.


## Step 6: Position the person who drinks juice and their sport.
From clue 7, we learn that the person drinking juice plays volleyball.


## Step 7: Determine the position of the metal fan and the 7up drinker.
Clue 6 places the metal fan on the far right. Clue 9 indicates the 7up drinker is also on the far right.


## Step 8: Analyze collecting and scientific movies' relationship.
Clue 8 tells us that collecting is to the left of scientific movies.


## Step 9: Compile all information to fill in the table.
- Far left (1): Dancing, Water, Rock, Badminton
- Second from left (2): Collecting, ?, Scientific, ?
- Middle (3): Gardening, Juice, Family, Volleyball
- Far right (4): ?, 7up, ?, Metal, Cycling


Given the clues:
- The person drinking water is on the far left and is into rock music and dancing (clues 11 and 5).
- Badminton is on the far left (clue 12), which matches with the dancer.
- Volleyball drinks juice (clue 7) and must be in the middle since badminton is to the left of gardening, and family movies are to the right of badminton.
- Cycling is to the right of documentary (clue 1), but we don't have a direct placement yet.
- Electronic music fan is to the right of juice (clue 4), placing electronic likely with cycling or the far right.
- Metal fan and 7up drinker are on the far right (clues 6 and 9).
- Collecting is to the left of scientific movies (clue 8).


Filling in the gaps:
- Since badminton is on the far left, and family movies are to the right of badminton, we can place documentary in the second position as it fits the cycling clue later.
- Gardening must be after badminton, placing it likely with juice (volleyball) or in the third spot if we consider volleyball's placement with juice.
- Cycling being on the right of documentary places it likely in the third or fourth spot, considering electronic music and metal/7up placements.


However, upon detailed analysis and correction based on all clues provided:


The person who drinks water is into rock music and dances (1). Badminton is on the far left (12), matching with dancing. Volleyball drinks juice (7) and must be after badminton due to gardening's placement (2). Metal and 7up are on the far right (6, 9), with metal confirmed as the far-right music genre.


Correcting my approach based on direct clue analysis without intermediate incorrect assumptions:


1 | Dancing, Water, Rock, Badminton
2 | Collecting, ?, Documentary, ?
3 | Gardening, Juice, Family, Volleyball
4 | ?, 7up, ?, Metal, Cycling


Given the electronic fan is to the right of juice (4), and considering placements:


The final answer is:

| Beverage      |   Water   |    Juice   |     Soy-milk|       7up     |

Lv1-5x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Apply clue 6 to determine the pet of person 1
The owner of the frog is on the far left, so person 1 has a frog as their pet.

## Step 2: Use clue 9 and clue 8 to find the position of the dog and its relation to the doctor and r&b fan
Since the doctor is the fan of r&b (clue 9) and the fan of r&b is on the left of the owner of the dog (clue 8), we know the doctor must be to the left of the dog's owner.

## Step 3: Apply clue 11 to identify the music genre of the paramedic
The paramedic is the fan of indie music.

## Step 4: Use clue 10 to identify the pet of the indie music fan
The fan of indie music is the owner of the dog. Since the paramedic is the fan of indie (from step 3), the paramedic owns a dog.

## Step 5: Apply clue 2 to determine the transport and job of person 2 or another position
The doctor drives the subway. Given the doctor's relation to other elements, we need to find where this fits with previous steps.

## Step 6: Combine clues to start building the table
- Person 1 has a frog (Step 1).
- The doctor (r&b fan) is to the left of the dog owner (Steps 2 and 9), and since the paramedic owns a dog and likes indie music, this starts to give us some positions.
- Given clue 12 (the writer is on the left of the doctor), we start seeing a sequence: writer, doctor. But we need to integrate all other clues.

## Step 7: Apply clue 4 to determine the job and transport of another person
The accountant drives the ship. This gives us another specific combination but doesn't directly tell us the position yet without considering other clues.

## Step 8: Use clue 1 to place the western movie fan relative to the writer
The person watching western movies is on the left of the writer. This clue, combined with others, helps in arranging jobs and interests.

## Step 9: Apply clue 3 to determine the music genre sequence
The fan of classical music is on the left of the person who watches epic movies. This gives us a sequence for music genres but needs integration with other clues.

## Step 10: Integrate all information to fill out the table
Given all the above steps and clues:
- The frog owner is on the far left (person 1).
- The paramedic likes indie and owns a dog, which means the doctor (r&b fan) must be to the left of the paramedic based on clue 8 and the fact that the paramedic is the indie fan.
- The writer is to the left of the doctor (clue 12), and since the western fan is to the left of the writer (clue 1), we have a sequence for jobs but need to finalize positions based on transport, pets, and music.

## Step 11: Finalize positions
Considering clue 5 (the van driver is on the left of the hedgehog owner) and knowing the doctor drives the subway, we can start placing means of transport. The accountant drives the ship (clue 4), which doesn't directly relate to pets or music genres without more context.

## Step 12: Place the remaining elements
Given that the paramedic owns a dog and likes indie, and the doctor is an r&b fan who drives the subway and is to the left of the dog owner, we have to fit in the western movie fan, epic movie fan, classical music fan, and ensure all other clues are satisfied.
