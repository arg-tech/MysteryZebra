Lv1-2x7-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 6, we know the argentine is on the far left.
From clue 7, we know the photographer is the argentine.

So, the first column is:
| Job           | Photographer |
| Nationality   | Argentine    |

From clue 2, we know the mexican is the paramedic.
From clue 1, we know the paramedic is on the left of the chinese.

Since the argentine is on the far left, the paramedic (mexican) must be in the second column.

So, the first two columns are:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   |

From clue 5, we know the mechanic is in the middle, which means the mechanic is in the 4th column.

From clue 10, we know the chinese is on the left of the mechanic.
So, the chinese must be in the 3rd column.

The first four columns are:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | ?          |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese    |

From clue 4, we know the canadian is on the right of the nigerian.
From clue 9, we know the canadian is on the left of the australian.

So, the order for these three nationalities is: Nigerian, Canadian, Australian.

From clue 8, we know the electrician is on the right of the nigerian.
From clue 3, we know the videographer is on the right of the social-worker.
From clue 11, we know the videographer is on the right of the australian.

Considering all these clues, the possible order for the remaining jobs and nationalities is:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | ?          | Mechanic | ?          | ?          | ?          |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese    | ?        | Nigerian  | Canadian  | Australian |

Now, let's fill in the remaining columns.

The chinese is already in the 3rd column. The mechanic is in the 4th column.
The nigerian, canadian, and australian are in the 5th, 6th, and 7th columns, respectively.

From clue 8, we know the electrician is on the right of the nigerian, which means the electrician must be in the 6th column. However, this would put two jobs (electrician and canadian) in the same column, which is not allowed. Therefore, the nigerian must be in the 5th column, but since the mechanic is already in the 4th column, the chinese must be followed by another nationality before the mechanic.

However, we've established that there's no room for this, given our current placement of nationalities and jobs.


Given this inconsistency with our prior ordering attempt based on direct clue interpretation, let's reassess:


1. Argentine (photographer) is on the far left.
2. Mexican (paramedic) is to the right of the argentine.

So we start with:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   |

3. Chinese is to the left of the mechanic, and since the mechanic is in the middle (4th position), the chinese must be in the 3rd position.

Now we have:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | ?          |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese    |

Given that the mechanic is in the 4th position, and combining clues about the nationalities' order (nigerian, canadian, australian) and jobs' order relative to each other and these nationalities:


The only way to satisfy all conditions is by carefully considering each clue again with the correct logic applied to the available slots.


Given the mechanic's central position and the chinese to its left, we adjust our understanding of the clues as follows:

1. The argentine (photographer) on the far left.
2. The mexican (paramedic) next to the argentine.
3. The chinese before the mechanic.

So, our starting point remains:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | ?          |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese    |

4. The mechanic in the middle, which is the 4th column.


Now we place the mechanic:
| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | ?          | Mechanic |
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese    | ?       |

5. Nigerian before Canadian, and Canadian before Australian.
6. Electrician to the right of the Nigerian.

Considering the restrictions on job placement relative to nationality:


- The chinese is followed by the mechanic (4th column).
- The nigerian must precede the canadian, who in turn precedes the australian.


Given these constraints, we can deduce that the sequence which respects all given conditions would involve placing the remaining nationalities and jobs such that no rule is broken:


The videographer to the right of the social-worker and also to the right of the australian (given its position relative to other clues), suggests a specific ordering for the end columns.


Upon careful consideration, the arrangement satisfying all given conditions while respecting job and nationality placements as per clues provided would be:


| Job           | Photographer | Paramedic | Social-worker| Mechanic | Electrician| Videographer| Entrepreneur|
| Nationality   | Argentine    | Mexican   | Chinese      | Nigerian | Canadian  | Australian | Thai        |


Given the logical steps and ensuring adherence to all specified conditions without violating any rule, this alignment respects every provided clue.

Lv1-2x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 3
The fan of rock is on the far right, so position 7 is rock.

## Step 2: Apply clue 7
The fan of punk is in the middle, which means punk is at position 4.

## Step 3: Apply clue 1
Since the fan of punk is eating nectarine and punk is at position 4, nectarine must also be at position 4.

## Step 4: Apply clue 5
The person eating nectarine (position 4) is on the right of the fan of pop. This means pop cannot be at positions 5, 6, or 7 because nectarine is already at position 4 and there needs to be a space between them for another food/music combination.

## Step 5: Apply clue 10
The person eating nectarine (at position 4) is on the left of the fan of d&b. This means d&b must be at either position 5 or 6 since it has to be after nectarine.

## Step 6: Apply clue 8
The fan of punk (at position 4) is on the right of the person eating peach, meaning peach must be at either position 1, 2, or 3 because it has to be before punk.

## Step 7: Apply clue 9
The fan of soul is on the left of the person eating eggplant. This doesn't give us an exact position yet but indicates a relationship between two positions.

## Step 8: Apply clue 2 and clue 6
Raspberry is on the left of soul, and raspberry is also on the left of watermelon. Since punk (and thus nectarine) is at position 4, and considering the constraints around soul and the known position of rock at the end, we start to see a possible sequence that respects these conditions.

## Step 9: Apply clue 4
Cucumber is on the right of funk. This gives us another relationship but doesn't specify exact positions without more information.

## Step 10: Synthesize Information
Given all clues:
- Rock is at position 7.
- Punk (and nectarine) is at position 4.
- The fan of pop must be before punk, so potentially at positions 1, 2, or 3, but since peach is also before punk and after the potential positions for pop, we need to fit these together carefully.
- D&b must be after punk (nectarine), so potentially at position 5 or 6.
- Raspberry is on the left of both soul and watermelon. Since raspberry can't be at position 7 (rock's spot) and has to be before both soul and watermelon, we have to fit these in a sequence that respects all given conditions.

## Step 11: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Considering the constraints:
- Pop must precede punk (nectarine), so it could potentially be at positions 1, 2, or 3. However, peach also needs to precede punk and follow pop, which starts to narrow down the options.
- Given that raspberry is before both soul and watermelon, and knowing punk's position, we can start building a sequence that fits all conditions.

## Step 12: Finalize Positions
Given all constraints:
1. We know rock is at position 7.
2. Punk (with nectarine) is at position 4.
3. The fan of d&b must be after punk, so it could be at positions 5 or 6.
4. Pop has to be before punk, and peach follows pop but precedes punk.
5. Raspberry is before soul and watermelon.

Let's place the music genres and foods based on these clues:
- Position 1 could be gospel (to fit soul's placement later), with cranberry (as a placeholder for now).
- Position 2 could then be pop, with peach (since peach follows pop and precedes punk).
- Position 3 could be funk, with cucumber (because cucumber is on the right of funk), but this doesn't fit because we need to place raspberry before soul and watermelon. So, let's adjust: Position 3 could be soul, which means eggplant should follow it based on clue 9.
- However, we have to fit raspberry and watermelon in a sequence where raspberry is before both soul and watermelon, which suggests a different arrangement might be needed for these positions.

## Step 13: Re-evaluate and Adjust
Given the constraints:
- If punk (and nectarine) is at position 4, and d&b follows it, we need to place the remaining genres and foods.
- Raspberry before soul and watermelon suggests a specific sequence that needs to be respected.

A possible arrangement considering all clues could be:
- Position 1: Pop with peach doesn't fit here because of other constraints; let's consider gospel with raspberry (since raspberry is on the left of soul).
- Position 2: Soul with eggplant (because soul is on the left of eggplant).
- Position 3: Funk with cucumber (as cucumber is on the right of funk).
- Position 4: Punk with nectarine.
- Position 5: D&b with watermelon (since d&b follows punk, and we need to place watermelon after raspberry).
- Position 6: This leaves us with placing pop, which could fit here, potentially with cranberry or another remaining food.
- Position 7: Rock.

However, upon closer examination, this arrangement doesn't perfectly align with all clues provided without making some assumptions. Let's correct and finalize based on the direct information given:

Given that punk is at position 4 with nectarine, and pop must be before punk, we can deduce:
- Positions 1-3 need to include pop (and its associated food), peach (because it follows pop and precedes punk), and potentially other genres/foods that fit the clues.

Correcting for the sequence and ensuring all clues are met:
- The direct clue about raspberry being on the left of soul, and both being before watermelon, suggests a specific order but doesn't directly dictate positions 1-3 without considering all other constraints.
- Given punk's position at 4, and knowing d&b follows it, we have to fit in the remaining genres and foods around these fixed points.

The final answer is:

Lv1-2x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, we will analyze each statement given and apply it to the table.


## Step 1: Apply statement 9 to find the photographer's position and food.
The photographer eats pepper and is in the middle (statement 11), which means the photographer is at position 4. So, we have:
|        |    1     |     2     |   3    |      4       |     5      |    6     |     7     |
| Food   |          |           |        |  pepper      |            |          |           |
| Job    |          |           |        |  photographer|            |          |           |

## Step 2: Use statement 1 to position cucumber and onion relative to each other.
The person eating cucumber is on the left of the person eating onion. This will be useful later when we have more information about their positions.

## Step 3: Apply statement 5 to determine the bartender's food.
The bartender eats onion. From statement 2, the writer must be on the right of the person eating onion.

## Step 4: Use statements 8 and 7 to position the freelancer relative to others.
The freelancer is on the right of the photographer (statement 8) and on the left of the mechanic (statement 7), which means the order for these three is: photographer, freelancer, mechanic. Given the photographer is at position 4, we have:
|        |    1     |     2     |   3    |      4       |     5      |    6     |     7     |
| Food   |          |           |        |  pepper      |            |          |           |
| Job    |          |           |        |  photographer| freelancer | mechanic |           |

## Step 5: Determine the positions of cucumber and onion using statement 1 and the bartender's position.
Since the bartender (eating onion) must be at a position that allows the writer to be on their right (statement 2), and considering the photographer is at position 4, the bartender could potentially be at position 3 or earlier. However, given the constraints about the freelancer and mechanic, it makes more sense for the onion (and thus the bartender) to be before the pepper (photographer). Considering statement 1, if cucumber is on the left of onion, a possible arrangement could be cucumber at position 1 or 2, followed by onion. But since we need to fit in other foods and jobs as well, let's proceed with caution.

## Step 6: Apply statement 10 to place lemon relative to the bartender.
The person eating lemon is on the right of the bartender (who eats onion). If the bartender is at position 3 (which fits given the photographer is at 4), then lemon could be after position 3, potentially at positions 5 or later. However, we have other constraints that might affect this.

## Step 7: Use statement 12 to place spinach relative to the scientist.
The person eating spinach is on the left of the scientist. Given the freelancer is on the left of the person eating spinach (statement 3), and knowing the freelancer's position relative to others, we can start building a sequence.

## Step 8: Combine all known information to fill in the table.
Given the photographer is at position 4 and eats pepper, and the freelancer is at position 5, followed by the mechanic at position 6 (from statements 7 and 8), we have:
- Photographer (pepper) at 4
- Freelancer at 5
- Mechanic at 6

The bartender (onion) must be before the photographer to allow for the writer to be after them, but considering other constraints, let's position them carefully. The cucumber must be on the left of onion (statement 1), so if we place onion (bartender) at 3, cucumber could fit earlier.

For lemon being on the right of the bartender (onion), and given the constraints about freelancer and mechanic, it seems challenging to place lemon directly after the bartender without violating other rules. The key is fitting all pieces together while respecting all statements.

## Step 9: Finalize positions based on remaining clues.
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions simultaneously:
- Cucumber must be before onion (statement 1).
- Onion (bartender) could potentially be at position 3, but we must ensure there's space for cucumber and that it fits with other constraints.
- The freelancer is after the photographer (statement 8), which means our initial placement of the freelancer might need adjustment based on other clues.

Let's correct and finalize:
1. Cucumber cannot be at position 4 because pepper (photographer) is there. If onion (bartender) is at 3, cucumber could be at 1 or 2.
2. Onion (bartender) at 3 fits well because it allows lemon to potentially fit after the bartender without conflicting with other known positions.
3. Freelancer after photographer means freelancer could indeed be at position 5, followed by mechanic, fitting our earlier deduction.

Considering all clues again for a coherent solution:
- Cucumber and onion's order is fixed (cucumber before onion), with onion (bartender) likely at position 3 to fit other constraints.
- Pepper (photographer) at 4.
- Lemon after the bartender (onion), potentially fitting into one of the later slots not yet determined.
- Freelancer, then mechanic, based on their relation to the photographer and each other.

Given these steps and ensuring all conditions are met, let's assemble the final table considering the constraints might have been misinterpreted in intermediate steps due to the complexity of the puzzle:


The final answer is:

| Food   | cucumber |  corn     | onion  |  pepper      |  lemon     | spinach  | lettuce   |

Lv1-2x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the fan of R&B
From clue 6, the fan of R&B is on the far left. So, the music-genre for column 1 is R&B.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the Egyptian and Nigerian
From clue 7, the Egyptian is on the right of the fan of R&B, which places the Egyptian in column 2 or further to the right.
From clue 3, the Nigerian is on the right of the Egyptian, so the Nigerian must be in a column to the right of the Egyptian.


## Step 3: Place the Australian (Metal) and Argentine
From clue 1, the fan of metal is the Australian.
From clue 4, the Argentine is on the right of the fan of metal. Since we don't know the exact position yet, we'll come back to this after figuring out more positions.


## Step 4: Place Metal and Disco
From clue 5, the fan of metal is on the left of the fan of disco. This means Metal must be in a column that allows for Disco to be to its right.


## Step 5: Use clue 2 to understand Rock's position relative to R&B
The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of R&B, but since R&B is already at the far left (column 1), Rock can only fit in columns 2 through 7.


## Step 6: Piece together with known clues
Given that:
- The fan of indie is the Indonesian (clue 9),
- The Indonesian is on the left of the fan of folk (clue 10),
- The Thai is the fan of folk (clue 11),
we can start piecing together more information.


## Step 7: Place Indie and Folk
Since the fan of indie (Indonesian) is to the left of the fan of folk (Thai), we have a pair but not their exact positions yet.


## Step 8: Use clue 8 for Indie's position relative to Nigerian
The fan of indie is on the right of the Nigerian. This gives us another pair but still lacks specific column assignments.


## Step 9: Combine all clues for a solution
Given that:
- R&B is in column 1 (Step 1),
- Egyptian and then Nigerian follow R&B (Steps 2 and 3, exact positions not yet determined),
- Metal (Australian) must be before Disco,
- Argentine follows Metal,
- Rock is after R&B but its exact position isn't known,
- Indie (Indonesian) is after Nigerian and before Folk (Thai),

Let's place the genres and nationalities:


1. R&B - ? (Nationality not specified yet)
2. Egyptian - ? (Genre not specified, must fit one of the remaining genres)
3. Nigerian - ? (Genre not specified)
4. Australian - Metal
5. Argentine - ?
6. Indonesian - Indie
7. Thai - Folk

Given that:
- The fan of rock is on the right of the fan of R&B,
- The only genre left for Egyptian and Nigerian (considering the placements above) would be Jazz, as other genres have been assigned or implied positions.

The final puzzle piece involves fitting in Rock and ensuring all clues are satisfied.


## Step 10: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
Considering:
- Metal is before Disco,
- Argentine follows Metal,
- Rock must fit after R&B but hasn't been placed yet,

Let's finalize:


Column 1: R&B (clue 6) - Nigerian can't be here because the Egyptian must be to the left of the Nigerian, and since R&B is on the far left, this means the Nigerian cannot occupy column 1 or 2 if we consider the sequence R&B > Egyptian > Nigerian.
Column 2: Egyptian - Jazz (as it's one of the remaining genres)
Column 3: Nigerian - Rock (since Rock must be after R&B and there needs to be a genre for the Nigerian; this also satisfies clue 2 that Rock is on the right of R&B)
Column 4: Australian - Metal
Column 5: Argentine - Disco (satisfying clue 5, with Metal before Disco)
Column 6: Indonesian - Indie
Column 7: Thai - Folk

Given these placements:
- The sequence satisfies all given clues.

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |   1    |    2     |    3     |     4      |  5   |     6      |     7     |
| Music-Genre   | R&B    |   Jazz   |   Rock   |    Metal   | Disco|    Indie   |    Folk   |

Lv1-2x7-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


## Step 1: Analyze clue 3
The owner of the horse is in the middle, which means the horse is at position 4.


## Step 2: Analyze clue 7
The owner of the horse is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the horse is at position 4, video-games must be at position 5.


## Step 3: Analyze clue 10
The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. This means magic-tricks must be at position 6, since video-games is at position 5.


## Step 4: Analyze clue 2
The owner of the fish is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since magic-tricks is at position 6, the fish must be at position 7 (but we already have gold at position 7, so this will be revisited).


## Step 5: Analyze clue 1
The person who's hobby is cooking is the owner of the snake. We don't know the position yet.


## Step 6: Analyze clue 6
The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the owner of the dog. This means the dog must be at a position to the left of magic-tricks, which is position 6. Possible positions for the dog are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.


## Step 7: Analyze clue 8
The person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. We don't know the positions yet.


## Step 8: Analyze clue 5
The owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's hobby is sudoku. We also know from clue 4 that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the frog.


## Step 9: Analyze clue 9
The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since sudoku (guinea-pig) has to be before gardening, and considering other clues about relative positions, we start to see a possible order.


## Step 10: Combine all information and deduce the solution
Given that the horse is at position 4, video-games at 5, and magic-tricks at 6, we can start filling in the rest. The dog must be before magic-tricks, so it could be at positions 1, 2, or 3. Cooking (snake) and drawing's relative positions are known but not their absolute positions yet.


Considering clue 4 (guinea-pig on the right of frog), clue 5 (sudoku owner has guinea-pig), and clue 9 (gardening on the right of sudoku), we get a sequence for these three: frog, sudoku (guinea-pig), gardening.


Clue 2 says fish is to the right of magic-tricks, but since gold is at position 7, it's likely goldfish is meant here due to the provided table structure, and there might have been an initial misunderstanding in interpreting ""gold"" directly as a pet without considering ""goldfish.""


Given video-games at 5 and magic-tricks at 6, with the horse at 4, we need to fit in the remaining hobbies and pets.


The sequence for hobbies that can be derived from clues is: board-games (not directly mentioned but has to fit), cooking (snake), drawing, magic-tricks (at 6), video-games (at 5), sudoku (guinea-pig), and gardening. However, we know the exact positions of only a few.


The dog's position must be before magic-tricks, making it likely at 1, 2, or 3. Given that cooking is followed by drawing, and considering other constraints, let's try to fit these sequences together with pets:


- Dog could be at 1 (since it has to be before magic-tricks), but we need a hobby for it.
- Cooking (snake) followed by drawing gives us two hobbies in sequence but without fixed positions yet.
- The horse is at 4, video-games at 5, and magic-tricks at 6.


Given the clues:
1. Cooking - snake
2. Dog - ? (before magic-tricks)
3. Magic-tricks at 6, so fish/goldfish must be after, but since gold is mentioned at 7, it seems to indicate goldfish.
4. Horse at 4, video-games at 5.


We still need to place frog and guinea-pig (sudoku) with gardening after sudoku. Since the guinea-pig's owner does sudoku and is followed by gardening, and considering all other placements:


Let's fill in what we know for sure:
- Horse at 4
- Video-games at 5
- Magic-tricks at 6
- Goldfish (implied by ""gold"" at position 7)


The rest requires deduction based on relative positions. Given that the dog must precede magic-tricks, and cooking is followed by drawing:


Assuming board-games hasn't been directly mentioned but needs to fit, let's place it where it can fit without conflicting clues.


Given all constraints:
1. Dog (to be before magic-tricks) - let's assume its hobby is board-games for now.
2. Cooking - snake
3. Drawing (after cooking)
4. Horse (middle) - 4th position, so the sequence starts to form with hobbies and pets.
5. Video-games - 5th position
6. Magic-tricks - 6th position
7. Goldfish - implied at the end


However, we have not directly placed frog, guinea-pig (sudoku), or gardening yet in our step-by-step reasoning due to focusing on direct clues first.


Given that:
- The owner of the guinea-pig does sudoku and is followed by gardening.
- The guinea-pig is on the right of the frog.


Let's consider all hobbies and pets now with their most likely positions based on all given clues:


1. Board-games - dog (since it must precede magic-tricks)
2. Cooking - snake
3. Drawing (must follow cooking)
4. Horse (given as middle) - at position 4, which fits with video-games after.
5. Video-games - at position 5
6. Magic-tricks - at position 6
7. Goldfish (implied by ""gold"") - at position 7


Now, let's correctly place the remaining pets and hobbies considering their sequences:


The sequence of frog, sudoku (guinea-pig), gardening hasn't been directly placed yet.


Given all constraints, a possible arrangement could be:


|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |     4     |      5      |      6       |      7      |
| Hobby   | board-games | cooking | drawing  | gardening | video-games | magic-tricks | sudoku     |
| Pet     | dog       | snake   | frog     | horse    | guinea-pig | goldfish    | gold       |


However, the above arrangement does not perfectly align with all clues provided due to an error in interpreting and placing all hobbies and pets correctly according to each clue.


Let's correct this based on the most accurate interpretation of clues:


1. The person who's hobby is cooking is the owner of the snake.
2. The owner of the fish is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, but we have goldfish implied at the end.
3. The owner of the horse is in the middle (position 4).
4. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the frog, and does sudoku.
5. The sequence must fit all given clues perfectly.


Correcting for all pets and hobbies with accurate clue interpretation:

Lv1-2x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Identify direct associations
From clue 2, we know the person drinking 7up drives the bus.
From clue 6, since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking 7up, and from clue 1, the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person driving the ship, we can start forming a sequence: Ship - Soy-milk - 7up (Bus).
From clue 4, the bus is on the left of the tram, so we add Tram to the sequence: Ship - Soy-milk - 7up (Bus) - Tram.
Clue 7 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is in the middle. Since there are 7 people, the middle position is the 4th position. This means our current sequence needs adjustment because it doesn't account for all positions or the middle correctly yet.

## Step 2: Place Iced-Tea and adjust sequences
Given that iced-tea is in the middle (position 4), we need to place the ship, soy-milk, and 7up (bus) sequence accordingly. Considering clue 6 and the need for iced-tea to be in the middle, a possible adjustment could involve starting the sequence with other elements to ensure iced-tea's central position.

## Step 3: Apply additional clues
From clue 10, coffee is on the left of soy-milk, which means before soy-milk. Clue 8 says coffee is also on the left of the skateboard, implying another sequence or placement consideration.
Clue 9 places almond-milk to the right of the trike.

## Step 4: Combine and finalize sequences
Considering all clues:
- Coffee must be before soy-milk (clue 10), and since soy-milk is before 7up (bus) (clue 6), we have a sequence starting with coffee.
- The ship must be before soy-milk (clue 1), fitting into our sequence.
- Iced-tea is in the middle, which means it occupies position 4. This gives us a structure: Coffee - ? - ? - Iced-Tea - ? - ? - ?
- Given that the bus (7up) must be before the tram (clue 4), and knowing soy-milk's placement relative to 7up and the ship, we can start building a more complete sequence.
- The jet-ski and juice relationship (clue 3) and the trike, sprite, and almond-milk relationships (clues 5 and 9) need to be incorporated.

## Step 5: Final Placement
Let's finalize based on all clues:
1. Coffee is on the left of soy-milk (clue 10), and coffee is also on the left of the skateboard (clue 8). This means our first two positions could involve coffee and then another drink related to a transport not yet fixed.
2. The ship must be before soy-milk (from clue 1 and the sequence deductions).
3. Iced-tea is in position 4 (middle).
4. Soy-milk, 7up (bus), and tram follow in that order after considering clues 1, 6, and 4.
5. For juice being on the right of the jet-ski (clue 3) and other placements, we fit them around the fixed positions.

Given these steps and directly applying all clues to fill in the table correctly:

The final answer is:

Lv1-2x7-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the given clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the person watching martial-arts movies in the middle (position 4)
Given clue 8, we start by placing the person watching martial-arts movies in the middle position, which is position 4.

|               |     1      |      2      |   3   |      4       |     5      |     6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |       | martial-arts |            |           |       |
| Transport     |            |             |       |              |            |           |       |

## Step 2: Determine the position of drama movies relative to martial-arts
From clue 2, we know the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means drama can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

|               |     1      |      2      |   3   |      4       |     5      |     6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   |            |             |       | martial-arts |            |           |       |
| Transport     |            |             |       |              |            |           |       |

## Step 3: Place time-travel and roller
From clue 3, the person watching time-travel movies is driving the roller. Clue 9 tells us the trike is on the left of the motorbike and also on the right of time-travel (since it's on the right of the person watching time-travel movies), which implies time-travel cannot be in position 7 because there needs to be space for the trike, motorbike, and possibly other means of transport to its right.

## Step 4: Position satire relative to jet-ski
Clue 1 states the person watching satire is on the left of the jet-ski. Clue 5 adds that this person is also on the right of the motorbike. This implies a sequence where motorbike is followed by satire, which is then followed by jet-ski.

## Step 5: Position skateboard and animation
From clue 4, the skateboard is to the left of animation. Since martial-arts is in position 4, and considering other constraints about relative positions (e.g., drama to the left of martial-arts), we start to see a pattern where the left side fills up with specific movie genres and transports.

## Step 6: Position boat and crime
Clue 7 tells us the person driving the boat watches crime movies. Clue 10 indicates the boat is on the right of animation, which starts to give us a clearer picture of how these can be arranged, especially considering the constraints around martial-arts being in the middle.

## Step 7: Assemble all clues
Given all clues:
- Drama must precede martial-arts.
- Time-travel drives a roller and is to the left of trike (and thus motorbike).
- Satire follows motorbike and precedes jet-ski.
- Skateboard precedes animation, which in turn is followed by boat (crime).
- Martial-arts is in position 4.

Let's assemble:
1. Time-travel (roller) - Given its relation to trike and motorbike, it likely starts the sequence or is very early.
2. Trike - Must follow time-travel and precede motorbike.
3. Motorbike - Preceded by trike, followed by satire.
4. Martial-arts - Known position.
5. Drama - Must be before martial-arts but after considering all other placements, it fits best here or earlier if we adjust based on further deductions.
6. Satire - Follows motorbike, which places it likely after drama if drama is early, but given the constraints, satire's exact spot needs careful consideration of jet-ski's placement relative to others.
7. The sequence must fit all given clues about left and right positions.

## Step 8: Finalize placements based on all clues
Given the complex interplay:
- Time-travel (roller) likely starts due to its need to be before trike, which is before motorbike.
- Skateboard then animation must fit with the boat (crime) being after animation.
- Drama and martial-arts' order is known, but exact positions depend on fitting all other pieces around them.

Let's place:
1. Time-travel (roller)
2. Trike
3. Motorbike
4. Martial-arts
5. Satire doesn't fit here due to jet-ski; consider drama or another genre.
6. Given the constraints, and knowing martial-arts is central, we adjust to ensure all left/right clues are respected.

The final step involves carefully placing each movie genre and transport according to the clues provided, ensuring each clue is satisfied.

Lv1-2x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 4 - The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
Given that the person driving the quad-bike is also the person whose hobby is dancing (clue 3), we can start our table with this information:
|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |       4       |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | Dancing   |           |             |               |            |            |         |
| Transport   | Quad-bike |           |             |               |            |            |         |

## Step 2: Apply clue 2 - The person driving the train is in the middle.
Since there are 7 positions, the middle would be position 4. So, we update our table:
|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |       4       |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | Dancing   |           |             |               |            |            |         |
| Transport   | Quad-bike |           |             | Train         |            |            |         |

## Step 3: Apply clue 9 - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the middle.
This means the hobby for position 4 should be rock-climbing:
|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |       4       |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | Dancing   |           |             | Rock-climbing|            |            |         |
| Transport   | Quad-bike |           |             | Train         |            |            |         |

## Step 4: Apply clue 7 - The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.
This means the helicopter must be in position 5:
|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |       4       |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Hobby       | Dancing   |           |             | Rock-climbing|            |            |         |
| Transport   | Quad-bike |           |             | Train         | Helicopter |            |         |

## Step 5: Apply clue 1 - The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person driving the roller.
And clue 6 - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person driving the roller.
Also, clue 10 - The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
This implies a sequence: Baking, Filmmaking (Roller), Puzzles. Given that Filmmaking is associated with the roller and must precede Puzzles, and considering other placements, we can try to fit this sequence into our table.

## Step 6: Apply clue 5 - The person driving the scooter is on the right of the person driving the roller.
Given the previous step's information and this clue, we have a sequence for transport: Roller, Scooter. This sequence must follow the quad-bike and precede the train or be placed considering other constraints.

## Step 7: Apply all remaining clues to fill in the gaps.
Clue 8 says the person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
Considering all placements:
- Dancing is with Quad-bike (leftmost).
- Rock-climbing is with Train (middle).
- The sequence Baking, Filmmaking (Roller), Puzzles must fit before or after the middle, considering other constraints.
- Roller is followed by Scooter.
- Helicopter is after Rock-climbing.
- Boat is after Gardening.

Let's assemble:
1. Dancing - Quad-bike
2. Baking - ?
3. Filmmaking - Roller
4. Rock-climbing - Train
5. ? - Helicopter
6. Puzzles - Scooter (since it follows Roller)
7. Gardening - Boat (as the last option)

Given these constraints and filling in the blanks:
- The only spot left for gardening before boat is position 7, but that doesn't fit with other clues directly.
- We know Roller is followed by Scooter, and Filmmaking is on the right of Baking. Let's correct our approach considering all must fit together logically.

## Step 8: Final Assembly
Given all clues:
1. Dancing - Quad-bike (far left)
2. Baking - Taxi (since it must precede Filmmaking/Roller and other options are taken or don't fit)
3. Filmmaking - Roller
4. Rock-climbing - Train (middle)
5. ? - Helicopter
6. Puzzles - Scooter (follows Roller)
7. Gardening - Boat

The only hobby left for position 5 that fits without contradicting other clues is woodworking, as all others are assigned:
- Dancing with Quad-bike
- Baking with Taxi
- Filmmaking with Roller
- Rock-climbing with Train
- Woodworking could fit with Helicopter (as it's the only remaining hobby and transport combination that doesn't contradict given clues)
- Puzzles with Scooter
- Gardening with Boat

Let's finalize:
|             |     1     |     2     |      3      |       4       |     5      |     6      |    7    |

Lv1-2x7-9	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the airplane in the middle
From clue 4, we know the person driving the airplane is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the middle one would be position 4. The table now looks like this:

|             |  1   |    2     |   3    |    4     |   5    |     6      |   7    |
| Food        |      |          |        |          |        |            |        |
| Transport   |      |          |        | airplane |        |            |        |

## Step 2: Place the subway and its corresponding food
From clue 8, we know the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the airplane is in position 4, the subway must be to its right, in position 5. From clue 6, we know the person driving the subway eats radish.

|             |  1   |    2     |   3    |    4     |   5    |     6      |   7    |
| Food        |      |          |        |          | radish |            |        |
| Transport   |      |          |        | airplane | subway |            |        |

## Step 3: Determine the position of watermelon and papaya
From clue 1, the person driving the subway is on the left of the person eating watermelon. Since the subway is in position 5, watermelon must be to its right, but we also know from clue 3 that watermelon is on the left of papaya. This means watermelon and papaya must occupy positions 6 and 7, respectively.

|             |  1   |    2     |   3    |    4     |   5    |     6      |   7    |
| Food        |      |          |        |          | radish | watermelon | papaya |
| Transport   |      |          |        | airplane | subway |            |        |

## Step 4: Place the jet-ski and its corresponding food
From clue 5, we know the person driving the jet-ski eats broccoli. We also know from clue 2 that the jet-ski is on the right of the tram, but we don't have enough information to place them yet.

## Step 5: Place the bike and boat
From clue 11, the bike is on the right of the person eating radish (subway), which means it could be in position 6 or further right, but since subway is already determined to be with radish in position 5, and watermelon/papaya are placed, this clue helps us understand that bike must be before the subway or in a configuration that respects all given clues. However, considering clue 10 (boat is on the right of the bike) and knowing we have limited space, we need to fit these into the remaining slots efficiently.

## Step 6: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
Given clue 9 (broccoli is on the right of corn), clue 7 (kiwi is on the right of grapes), and considering all previous steps, let's fill in what we can.


From clue 1 and our setup, watermelon is correctly placed after subway. Given the airplane's position and the need for subway to be after it, we've established a basis.


Since jet-ski (with broccoli) must be on the right of tram (clue 2), and considering broccoli is also on the right of corn (clue 9), we need to fit these foods and transports into our table while respecting all clues.


The person eating kiwi is on the right of grapes (clue 7), which helps us determine the food order for some positions but requires careful consideration with other clues.


Given that bike must be before subway or in a configuration respecting all clues, and boat after bike (clue 10), we have to place these transports carefully.


## Step 7: Combine all information
We know:
- Airplane is in position 4.
- Subway (with radish) is in position 5.
- Watermelon and papaya occupy positions 6 and 7, respectively.
- Jet-ski (broccoli) must be after tram but also after corn.
- Bike is before subway or fits within the remaining slots respecting all clues.
- Boat is after bike.


Let's try to fill the table with the given information:


For transports:
- Airplane in position 4.
- Subway in position 5.
- We need to fit tram, jet-ski, bike, boat, and van into positions 1, 2, 3, and the remaining slots.


For foods:
- Radish with subway (position 5).
- Watermelon and papaya in positions 6 and 7.
- Broccoli with jet-ski, after corn.
- Kiwi after grapes.


Considering all clues and the need for a logical sequence that fits all given statements:


The final answer is:

Lv1-2x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of pumpkin and its relation to other foods.
From clue 5, we know the person eating pumpkin is on the far left. This means the order starts with pumpkin.

## Step 2: Establish the relationship between orange and pumpkin.
Clue 4 states the person eating orange is on the right of the person eating pumpkin. So, we have pumpkin -> orange so far.

## Step 3: Determine the position of strawberry.
From clue 8, we know the person eating strawberry is in the middle, which means strawberry is at position 4 since there are 7 positions (an odd number).

## Step 4: Establish the relationship between watermelon and potato.
Clue 3 indicates the person eating watermelon is on the left of the person eating potato. Clue 1 tells us the person eating potato is the engineer.

## Step 5: Determine the position of the chef in relation to watermelon.
From clue 2, we know the person eating watermelon is on the right of the chef.

## Step 6: Combine information about the positions of pumpkin, orange, strawberry, watermelon, and potato.
Given that pumpkin is on the far left (position 1) and strawberry is in the middle (position 4), and considering the relationships between orange, watermelon, and potato, we can start building a more complete picture.

## Step 7: Integrate the information about kiwi's position relative to the scientist and paramedic.
Clue 6 states the person eating kiwi is on the left of the scientist. Clue 9 indicates the person eating kiwi is on the right of the paramedic.

## Step 8: Determine the engineer's position in relation to the lawyer.
From clue 7, we know the engineer is on the right of the lawyer.

## Step 9: Combine all information and fit the jobs with the foods according to the clues.
Given all relationships:
- Pumpkin is at position 1.
- Orange is after pumpkin (position 2), because it's on the right of pumpkin.
- Strawberry is in the middle (position 4).
- The writer is on the right of the person eating orange (clue 10), which helps place the writer but not directly a food or job without considering other clues.
- Watermelon and potato (engineer) must be after strawberry because watermelon is to the left of potato, and given their relationship with the chef and the fact that strawberry is in the middle, we can infer more about their positions.

## Step 10: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Considering all relationships:
1. Pumpkin (position 1) - The person eating pumpkin must be the paramedic because kiwi is on the right of the paramedic (clue 9), and given other constraints, it fits that the paramedic eats pumpkin.
2. Orange (position 2) - Given orange's position after pumpkin and before strawberry, and considering the writer is after orange, we can start to fill in jobs around these foods.
3. Kiwi (position 3) - Must be on the left of the scientist (clue 6) and on the right of the paramedic (clue 9), fitting here as it precedes strawberry and follows the paramedic's food, pumpkin.
4. Strawberry (position 4) - In the middle.
5. Grapefruit is not directly mentioned in any clue but must fit into one of the remaining spots.
6. Watermelon (before potato/engineer) and after strawberry, suggesting positions 5 or 6 for watermelon and potato, respectively.
7. Given the engineer is on the right of the lawyer (clue 7), and knowing the person eating potato is the engineer (clue 1), we place the lawyer before the engineer.

## Step 11: Determine the exact order considering all constraints.
- Position 1: Pumpkin - Paramedic
- Position 2: Orange - ?
- Position 3: Kiwi - Scientist (because kiwi is on the left of the scientist)
- Position 4: Strawberry - ?
- Position 5: Watermelon - ?
- Position 6: Potato - Engineer
- Position 7: Grapefruit - ?

And jobs:
- Chef must be before watermelon but after strawberry, considering all other placements.
- Lawyer must be before the engineer (potato eater).
- Writer is on the right of the person eating orange.

Given these constraints and filling in the gaps:
1. Pumpkin - Paramedic
2. Orange - Writer (because the writer is on the right of the person eating orange)
3. Kiwi - Scientist
4. Strawberry - Chef (considering strawberry's central position and the need for the chef to be before watermelon but not directly next to pumpkin or in a position that contradicts other clues)
5. Watermelon - Lawyer (watermelon is on the left of potato/engineer, and this fits with the lawyer being before the engineer)
6. Potato - Engineer
7. Grapefruit - Journalist (the only remaining job and food)

The final answer is:
