Lv1-2x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step based on the information provided.


## Step 1: Identify the given information
- There are two movie genres: epic and musical.
- There are two means of transport: subway and trike.
- The person watching epic movies is to the left of the person driving the subway.

## Step 2: Place the epic movie genre
Given that the person watching epic movies is on the left, we can place ""epic"" in the first column (1) because it must be to the left of the subway user.


|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | epic |         |
| Transport     |       |         |

## Step 3: Determine the transport for each movie genre
Since the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway, and considering there are only two means of transport (subway and trike), the person watching epic movies must be using one of these transports. However, because the statement specifically mentions the position relative to the subway user, it implies that ""epic"" cannot be directly associated with the subway in this context without further clarification on who is using what. But since we know there are only two options for transport and the person watching epic movies must be next to (to the left of) someone using the subway, let's correct our approach based on the given clues.


Given that ""epic"" is on the left, if the epic viewer isn't using the subway, they must be using the trike because there are only two options. The clue suggests a spatial relationship (""on the left of"") which typically would refer to their position rather than directly implying who uses what mode of transport without specifying that both activities (watching movies and using transport) happen simultaneously in the same location or context.


## Step 4: Correctly interpret the clues for final placement
Given the direct clue about positioning (""the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway""), it actually implies the arrangement should consider who does what next to whom. If ""epic"" is on the left and must be next to the subway user (implying the subway user could be watching musicals if we consider them side by side), then:


- Epic movies are watched by someone using a trike because they're not specified as using the subway, but rather being positioned next to it.


## Step 5: Finalize the table
Based on the corrected understanding that ""epic"" is associated with the left position and considering the transport options:


|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | epic | musical |
| Transport     | trike| subway  |

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | epic | musical |
| Transport     | trike| subway  |

Lv1-2x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two different types of food: eggplant and kiwi.
2. There are two different types of sport: skateboarding and snowboarding.
3. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding.

Given that we have a 2x2 table, let's assign positions based on the information:

- Since the person eating kiwi must be to the right of the person who prefers skateboarding, this means the skateboarding preference cannot be in the right column (column 2), because there would be no one to the right of it. Therefore, skateboarding must be associated with the left column (column 1).
- Kiwi, being to the right of skateboarding, must then be in the right column (column 2).

Now, let's fill in the table based on this reasoning:

|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    | eggplant     | kiwi         |
| Sport   | skateboarding| snowboarding |

This configuration satisfies all conditions given:
- The person eating kiwi (column 2) is to the right of the person who prefers skateboarding (column 1).
- Both types of food and both types of sport are represented.

Therefore, the solution table surrounded by '#############' is:


#############
|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    | eggplant     | kiwi         |
| Sport   | skateboarding| snowboarding |

Lv1-2x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two favorite beverages: milk and soy-milk.
2. There are two types of food: orange and spinach.
3. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person eating spinach.

From point 3, we can infer that since the person drinking milk must be to the right of the person eating spinach, and given the table structure:

|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-     |        |
| Food       |          |        |

The person eating spinach cannot be in column 2 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in column 1. Therefore, the person drinking milk must be in column 2.

Given this, we can fill out part of the table:

|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Food       | spinach  |        |

Now, since there are only two types of food (orange and spinach) and spinach is already assigned to column 1, orange must be in column 2.

So, the completed table looks like this:

#############
|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Food       | spinach  | orange |

Lv1-2x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to use the given information.


## Step 1: Determine the position based on the first clue.
The Indonesian is on the right of the person whose sport is cycling. This means if cycling is in column 1, then the Indonesian must be in column 2. If cycling were in column 2, there would be no one to the left for the Indonesian to be next to.


## Step 2: Fill in the sports based on the first clue.
Given that we have two sports (cycling and parkour) and from step 1, if cycling is in column 1, then parkour must be in column 2 because there are only two options for sports.


## Step 3: Assign nationalities based on the clues provided.
Since the Indonesian is to the right of the person who prefers cycling (from step 1), and we've established cycling is likely in column 1, this means the French person must be associated with cycling in column 1, and the Indonesian with parkour in column 2.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   | French  | Indonesian|
| Sport         | Cycling | Parkour   |

Lv1-2x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we can start by analyzing the given information:


## Step 1: Understand the clues
We have two favourite beverages: hot-chocolate and sprite, and two preferred movie-genres: crime and horror. The clue states that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies.


## Step 2: Apply the clue to the table
Given the clue, we can deduce that since the person who drinks hot-chocolate must be to the left of the person who watches crime movies, and considering our table has only two columns (1 and 2), the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot watch crime movies because they need to be in column 1 to satisfy the condition of being to the left. This implies that the person watching crime movies must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Fill in the table based on deductions
Since we have determined that the person watching crime movies is in column 2, and knowing there are only two options for movie genres (crime and horror), the person in column 1 must watch horror movies to satisfy the condition of having two different movie genres.


## Step 4: Determine the beverage for each column
Given the clue that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies, we can conclude that hot-chocolate corresponds with column 1 (horror movies), and by elimination, sprite must correspond with column 2 (crime movies).


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | sprite |
| Movie-Genre   | horror        | crime  |

Lv1-2x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. There are two types of food: apple and asparagus.
2. There are two means of transport: helicopter and taxi.
3. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus.

Given that we have a 2x2 table to fill, with one row for ""Food"" and another for ""Transport,"" and columns labeled ""1"" and ""2"", let's assign the information:

- Since the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus, this implies the following arrangement:
  - Asparagus must be in column 1 (because if it were in column 2, there would be no space to its right for the taxi).
  - Therefore, apple must be in column 2.
- Given that the taxi driver is to the right of the asparagus eater, and knowing asparagus is in column 1, the taxi must be in column 2 (since it has to be to the right of asparagus), which means helicopter must be in column 1.

So, filling out the table based on this logic:

#############
|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Asparagus | Apple |
| Transport   | Helicopter| Taxi  |
#############

This solution satisfies all conditions given: asparagus is to the left of apple (and thus taxi, by association), and helicopter is paired with asparagus, while taxi is paired with apple."	{'food': ['asparagus', 'apple'], 'transport': ['helicopter', 'taxi']}	True	4	True
Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person who drinks almond-milk.
Given that there are two people and two beverages (almond-milk and soy-milk), we know one person drinks almond-milk and the other drinks soy-milk.


## Step 2: Apply the first clue to determine the positions.
The clue states, ""the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk."" This means the person drinking almond-milk cannot be on the right side because then there would be no one to their right. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the left.


## Step 3: Determine the hobbies based on the clue.
Since the person who drinks almond-milk is on the left and the writer is to the right of the almond-milk drinker, the writer must be associated with soy-milk (as it's the only option left for the right side). This leaves dancing as the hobby for the almond-milk drinker.


## Step 4: Construct the final table based on the analysis.
Given the information deduced:


|            |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | soy-milk |
| Hobby      | dancing    | writing  |


The final answer is: 
#############
|            |      1      |    2     |
| Beverage   | almond-milk | soy-milk |
| Hobby      | dancing    | writing  |

Lv1-2x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information:


## Step 1: Identify the jobs and beverages
We have two jobs: firefighter and writer, and two beverages: cola and mirinda.


## Step 2: Apply the given condition
The writer is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. This means if we number the columns as 1 (left) and 2 (right), mirinda must be in column 1 because the writer has to be to its right, which places the writer in column 2.


## Step 3: Determine the beverage for column 2
Since mirinda is in column 1, cola must be in column 2, as these are the only two beverages and each column must have a different one.


## Step 4: Place the jobs according to the condition
Given that the writer is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, we can conclude the job for column 2 (the right side) is the writer. This leaves the firefighter for column 1, as it's the only job left and each column must have a different job.


## Step 5: Construct the solution table
Based on our deductions:


|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |  mirinda   |  cola  |
| Job        | firefighter| writer |

The final answer is: 
#############
|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |  mirinda   |  cola  |

Lv1-2x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, we need to consider the given clues and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Identify Nationalities and Pets
We have two nationalities (Brazilian, Colombian) and two pets (ferret, mouse). The clue mentions that ""the Brazilian is on the right of the owner of the ferret,"" which implies a spatial arrangement.


## Step 2: Apply the Clue to the Table
Given the table structure:


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   |           |           |
| Pet           |           |           |


The clue suggests that if the ferret's owner is in column 1, the Brazilian must be in column 2. This means the Colombian would have to own the ferret because the Brazilian cannot be on the left (in column 1) according to the given condition.


## Step 3: Fill in Possible Combinations
Considering the above:


- If the ferret is in column 1, then:
- Nationality in column 1 must be Colombian (because the Brazilian has to be on the right of the ferret owner).
- Pet in column 2 would be mouse.
- Nationality in column 2 must be Brazilian.


This gives us a possible arrangement:


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Mouse     |


## Step 4: Check for Other Possible Arrangements
Given the clue's specificity about the Brazilian being on the right of the ferret owner, and with only two options for each category, the arrangement in Step 3 fits all given conditions without violating any rules of logic or the information provided.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Mouse     |

Lv1-2x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given information step by step.


## Step 1: Identify the hobbies and beverages
We have two hobbies: card-games and hiking. We also have two beverages: 7up and tea.


## Step 2: Apply the given condition
The person drinking tea is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games. This means the person with the hobby card-games must be in column 1, and the person who drinks tea must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Fill in the table based on the condition
Given the condition from step 2, we can start filling in the table:


|            |     1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |            |        |
| Hobby      | card-games | hiking |

Since the person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, and given that the hobbies are now placed according to this rule, we can determine the beverages:


- The person whose hobby is card-games must drink 7up because if they drank tea, it would contradict the statement since there would be no one to their right drinking tea.
- Therefore, the person whose hobby is hiking drinks tea.


## Step 4: Finalize the table
Based on step 3, we can finalize the table:


|            |     1      |   2    |
| Beverage   | 7up        | tea    |
