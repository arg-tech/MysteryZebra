Lv1-1x5-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues:

1. The electrician is on the left of the engineer.
2. The freelancer is in the middle (position 3).
3. The writer is on the right of the freelancer.
4. The freelancer is on the right of the engineer.

From clue 2, we know the freelancer is in position 3.

Clue 4 tells us the freelancer is to the right of the engineer, and since the freelancer is in position 3, the engineer must be in position 2 (because the freelancer cannot be to the right of the engineer if the engineer were in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5).

Clue 1 tells us the electrician is on the left of the engineer. Since the engineer is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 1.

Now we have:
- Position 1: Electrician
- Position 2: Engineer
- Position 3: Freelancer

Clue 3 says the writer is on the right of the freelancer. With the freelancer in position 3, this means the writer can only be in position 4 or 5.

The only job left unplaced is the videographer and the writer, with positions 4 and 5 available. Since clue 3 specifies the writer is to the right of the freelancer but does not specify which of positions 4 or 5 the writer must occupy, we can deduce that:
- The writer being in position 5 satisfies all conditions (being on the right of the freelancer).
- This leaves position 4 for the videographer.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:

Lv1-1x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step:


1. The Indian is on the far left.
2. The Russian is on the right of the Indian.
3. The Russian is on the left of the Dutch.
4. The Dutch is on the left of the British.

Given these rules, let's start placing the nationalities:


- The Indian must be in position 1 because they are on the far left.
- The Russian must be to the right of the Indian but also to the left of the Dutch. This means the Russian cannot be in position 5 (because there would be no room for the Dutch to their right), and since the Indian is in position 1, the Russian must be in position 2 or further to the right.
- However, considering rule 3 (the Russian is on the left of the Dutch) and rule 4 (the Dutch is on the left of the British), we can deduce that there needs to be at least two positions between the Indian and the British to accommodate both the Russian and the Dutch in the correct order.
- Given this, a possible initial setup could have the Indian in position 1, but since the Russian must be directly to their right (to satisfy rule 1), we place the Russian in position 2.
- Following rule 3, the Dutch must then come after the Russian, placing them in position 3 or later. Given that the Russian is now in position 2 and must precede the Dutch, and considering rule 4 which places the British after the Dutch, a logical sequence starts to form: Indian, Russian, ?, ?, ?.
- With the Russian in position 2 and needing to be followed by the Dutch (rule 3), and knowing the Dutch must precede the British (rule 4), we can place the Dutch in position 3. This leaves positions 4 and 5 for the remaining two nationalities: German and British, with the British needing to be after the Dutch.
- Since the only restrictions directly involving the German are implied by the placements of other nationalities, and given that all other nationalities have fixed positions relative to each other (Indian on the far left, Russian to their right, then Dutch, then British), the German can fit into any remaining slot not violating these rules. However, with the Indian in position 1, Russian in 2, Dutch in 3, and British needing to follow the Dutch, the only place for the German is before the British or after the Dutch but before the British, but since the sequence must be maintained as per the clues (Indian, Russian, Dutch, then British), and there's no direct clue about the German's position relative to these, we fit in the remaining slots with what we know: Indian, Russian, Dutch, ?, British.
- The only slot left that makes sense without disrupting the given order is placing the German before the British but after considering all placements based on clues provided directly, it seems there was an oversight in initial step-by-step logic application regarding direct clue implications for each position. Correcting this with proper sequential analysis:
  - Indian (1), Russian (2) due to direct adjacency requirement.
  - Dutch follows Russian (3).
  - British must follow Dutch, placing them at least in position 4 or later, but since we need to fill all slots and maintain the sequence correctly, and considering there's no direct placement clue for German other than it not being mentioned in the sequential clues:
    The corrected logical deduction directly from given clues without overcomplicating should focus on satisfying each condition sequentially.


Given the rules and correcting the approach for clarity and directness:


1. Indian is far left (Position 1).
2. Russian to the right of Indian (Position 2, as it's directly after Indian).
3. Dutch to the right of Russian but before British (Position 3, following Russian).
4. British must be after Dutch (Position 5, since it follows Dutch and we have a fixed sequence for the first three positions).


This leaves Position 4 for German by process of elimination, as all other positions are determined by direct clues or necessary adjacency.


The final solution table is:

Lv1-1x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle.


Given that there are 5 positions and the person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle, this means the dancer is in position 3 (since the positions are numbered 1 through 5). 


Now, let's place rock-climbing and skydiving/gardening based on the clues:


- Since rock-climbing must be to the left of dancing, and dancing is in position 3, rock-climbing could potentially be in positions 1 or 2.
- Gardening must be to the right of skydiving. Given that dancing is in the middle (position 3), skydiving and gardening can occupy positions 4 and 5 in that order, because there's no space for them on the left side of dancing due to rock-climbing's placement.


The only arrangement that satisfies all conditions with dancing in the middle is:


- Rock-climbing must be directly next to dancing (to its left), placing it in position 2.
- Skydiving and gardening then occupy positions 4 and 5, respectively.


This leaves position 1 for camping, as it's the only hobby not yet assigned a spot.


So, the arrangement from left to right based on the clues is:


Camping - Rock-climbing - Dancing - Skydiving - Gardening


Here is the solution table:

Lv1-1x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person eating potato is to the right of the person eating plum.
2. The person eating strawberry is in the middle (position 3).
3. The person eating strawberry is to the left of the person eating pomegranate.

From point 2, we know strawberry is at position 3.

Given point 3, since strawberry is at position 3 and to the left of pomegranate, pomegranate must be at position 4 (because it has to be after strawberry).

Point 1 tells us that potato is to the right of plum. Since positions 3 and 4 are already occupied by strawberry and pomegranate respectively, plum can't be in position 5 because then there would be no place for potato to its right. This means plum must be either at position 1 or 2.

If plum were at position 2, potato could not fit to its right without displacing strawberry from the middle (position 3), which contradicts point 2. Therefore, plum must be at position 1.

Given that plum is at position 1 and strawberry is at position 3, potato can only fit at position 5 because it needs to be to the right of plum and positions 3 and 4 are taken by strawberry and pomegranate.

This leaves us with grapes for position 2 since all other foods have been placed according to the clues provided.

So, the arrangement from left to right is: plum, grapes, strawberry, pomegranate, potato.

Lv1-1x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


1. The Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish.
2. The Spanish is in the middle (position 3).
3. The Spanish is on the right of the French.

From clue 2, we know the Spanish person is in position 3.


|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Nationality   |         |        | Spanish |            |         |

From clue 3, since the Spanish is on the right of the French and in the middle, the French must be to the left of the Spanish. This means the French can only be in position 1 or 2 because the Spanish is already in position 3.


Considering clue 1 (the Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish) and that we have a fixed position for the Spanish, let's try placing the French:


- If French were in position 1, it would leave positions 2, 4, and 5 for Indonesian, Turkish, and Russian. Given the constraint that the Indonesian is to the left of the Turkish, they could fit into positions 2 and 4 or positions 4 and 5, but we must also consider the fixed Spanish position and the fact that there's a need for the Indonesian to be to the left of the Turkish.


Let's place French in position 1 as it seems most restrictive and try to fit others around it:


|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Nationality   | French |        | Spanish |            |         |

Now, since the Indonesian must be on the left of the Turkish (clue 1), and considering the positions available:


- Position 2 could be Indonesian, which leaves positions 4 and 5 for Turkish and Russian. This arrangement respects all clues so far.


So, let's fill in the rest based on this logic:


|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Nationality   | French | Indonesian | Spanish | Turkish | Russian |

This order satisfies all given conditions:
- The Indonesian is to the left of the Turkish.
- The Spanish is in the middle (position 3).
- The Spanish is on the right of the French.


Given this solution, the final table with '#############' around it looks like this:

Lv1-1x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person watching action movies is to the left of the person watching time-travel movies.
3. The person watching action movies is in the middle.

Given that there are 5 positions and the person watching action movies is in the middle, this places the action movie watcher in position 3.

So, we have:
|               |   1    |   2   |   3    |      4      |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   |        |       | Action |             |        |

From clue 1, since comedy is to the left of crime, and considering action is in the middle (position 3), comedy and crime must occupy positions 1 and 2 or positions 4 and 5, with comedy always being to the left of crime.

From clue 2, since action is to the left of time-travel, and action is in position 3, time-travel cannot be in position 1 or 2. Thus, time-travel must be in either position 4 or 5.

Now, let's try to place comedy and crime around action while keeping in mind that time-travel needs a spot after action:

- If we place comedy in position 1, crime would logically go into position 2 because it must be to the right of comedy. This fits well with our current setup:
  |               |   1    |   2   |   3    |      4      |   5    |
  | Movie-Genre   | Comedy | Crime | Action |             |        |

Given action is in position 3, and time-travel must be after action (clue 2), time-travel could fit into either position 4 or 5. However, since horror hasn't been placed yet and needs a spot, we have to consider where it can go.

The only genre left without restrictions related to the others' positions is horror. Since comedy is in position 1, crime in position 2, action in position 3, time-travel needs to be after action (so it could be in position 4 or 5), and considering all genres must be represented:

- Horror can fit into any remaining spot, but since time-travel needs to be after action and we have a constraint that doesn't directly involve horror, let's place time-travel in position 5 to satisfy the ""action is to the left of time-travel"" condition without conflicting with other rules.

So, placing time-travel in position 5 leaves us with:
|               |   1    |   2   |   3    |      4      |   5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Comedy | Crime | Action |     ?       | Time-travel |

The only spot left for horror, given all other constraints are met, is position 4.

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv1-1x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:


1. The Polish is on the left of the Colombian.
2. The Turkish is on the left of the Indonesian.
3. The Polish is on the far left.
4. The Brazilian is on the right of the Indonesian.


From clue 3, we know the order starts with Polish. So, we have:
- Position 1: Polish

From clue 1, since the Polish is on the left of the Colombian, and given the Polish is at position 1, the Colombian must be at least in position 2 or further to the right.


Considering clue 2, the Turkish is on the left of the Indonesian. This doesn't directly tell us where they are relative to the others yet, but it gives us a pair: Turkish -> Indonesian.


Clue 4 tells us the Brazilian is on the right of the Indonesian. So, we have another pair with an order: Indonesian -> Brazilian.


Since the Polish is at position 1 and must be followed by the Colombian (from clue 1), our starting sequence looks like this:
- Position 1: Polish
- Position 2: Colombian

The Turkish and Indonesian need to fit in such a way that respects all clues. Given the constraints, if we try to place Turkish and Indonesian without considering their positions relative to Colombian yet, but knowing they must come before Brazilian (because Brazilian is on the right of Indonesian), we have two slots left (3 and 4) for these two pairs before reaching position 5.


However, because Turkish must be on the left of Indonesian (clue 2), and knowing that Polish and Colombian are already in positions 1 and 2, the only place where Turkish can fit while respecting all other conditions is in position 3. This forces Indonesian into position 4 because it has to follow Turkish.


Lastly, with Brazilian needing to be on the right of Indonesian (clue 4), Brazilian must then occupy position 5.


Thus, combining all clues and deductions, we get:

Lv1-1x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the quad-bike
From clue 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the far right, so the quad-bike must be in position 5.

## Step 2: Position the train relative to the tram
Clue 1 tells us that the train is to the right of the tram. This doesn't give us exact positions yet, but we know their order.

## Step 3: Position the train and quad-bike
From clue 2, since the quad-bike is to the right of the train and we've established the quad-bike is in position 5, the train must be in a position to the left of 5. Given that the tram must be to the left of the train (from Step 2), and considering the positions available, the train could potentially be in position 4 if we consider that the tram could be in an earlier position.

## Step 4: Position the snowmobile and bus
Clue 3 states that the snowmobile is to the left of the bus. This clue doesn't specify their exact positions relative to the other vehicles yet, but it gives us another piece of the puzzle to consider alongside the tram, train, and quad-bike placements.

## Step 5: Combine all clues for a solution
Given the quad-bike is in position 5 (from Step 1) and must be to the right of the train (Step 3), we can place the train in position 4 as a possible scenario because it allows the tram to be placed before the train, satisfying clue 1. With the snowmobile to the left of the bus (Step 4), and considering the placements so far, we need to fit these two into positions 1, 2, or 3.

Considering all clues together:
- The quad-bike is in position 5.
- The train must be in position 4 because it's to the right of the tram and to the left of the quad-bike.
- This leaves positions 1, 2, and 3 for the tram, snowmobile, and bus. Since the tram must be to the left of the train (now in position 4), it could fit into position 1, 2, or 3. However, with the snowmobile needing to be to the left of the bus, and considering we have to satisfy all conditions including the relative positions of the tram and train, we can deduce further:
- The tram cannot be in position 3 because then the train wouldn't be to its right (as the train is in position 4). So, the tram could potentially be in positions 1 or 2.
- If the tram were in position 1, the snowmobile and bus would have to fit into positions 2 and 3 in a way that respects their order. Given this scenario:
- The snowmobile must be to the left of the bus (clue 3), which means if the tram is in position 1, the snowmobile could be in position 2, and the bus in position 3. This satisfies all conditions because it allows for the train to be to the right of the tram (in position 4) and the quad-bike to be on the far right (position 5).

Thus, a possible arrangement that respects all clues is:
- Position 1: Tram
- Position 2: Snowmobile
- Position 3: Bus
- Position 4: Train
- Position 5: Quad-bike

The final answer is:

## Step 1: Determine the position of the mouse.
Given that the owner of the mouse is in the middle (clue 4), and since there are 5 positions, the middle would be position 3. So, the mouse is in position 3.


## Step 2: Determine the position of the goldfish.
From clue 2, we know the owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the mouse is in position 3, the goldfish must be in a position to the left of 3, which could be either position 1 or 2.


## Step 3: Determine the position of the lizard.
Clue 3 states that the owner of the lizard is on the right of the owner of the mouse. With the mouse in position 3, the lizard must be in a position to the right of 3, which could be either position 4 or 5.


## Step 4: Determine the position of the dog.
From clue 1, we know the owner of the dog is on the far right, which means the dog is in position 5.


## Step 5: Finalize positions for the lizard and goldfish.
Since the lizard must be to the right of the mouse (position 3) and the dog is already in position 5, the lizard must be in position 4. The goldfish then must be in position 2 because it has to be to the left of the mouse, and position 1 is the only spot left for the frog, as all other positions are determined.
