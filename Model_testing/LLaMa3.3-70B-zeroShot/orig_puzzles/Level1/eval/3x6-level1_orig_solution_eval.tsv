Lv1-3x6-1	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the Pakistani and Board-Games
From clue 4, the Pakistani is on the far left. Clue 12 also tells us that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. Therefore, the first column must be the Pakistani with a hobby of board-games.


## Step 2: Determine the Music Genre for the Pakistani
Since we don't have direct information about the music genre for the Pakistani yet, we move to other clues.


## Step 3: Place the American and Baking
Clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the American. We also know from clue 7 that the American is a fan of folk music.


## Step 4: Place the Hiking and Chinese
From clue 6, we learn that the person who's hobby is hiking is the Chinese. Clue 1 states that this person is to the right of the Malaysian, but since we don't know where the Malaysian is yet, we can't place them immediately.


## Step 5: Use Clue 2 for Cooking and Hiking
Clue 2 says the person who's hobby is cooking is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. This helps us understand the relative positions but doesn't give us exact placements without knowing where other hobbies or nationalities are.


## Step 6: Place Metal and Polish
From clue 3, we know the fan of metal is the Polish. However, without more information about their hobby or position relative to others, we can't place them yet.


## Step 7: Analyze Clues for Music Genres
Clue 8 tells us that the fan of trance is on the left of the fan of gospel, and clue 9 states that the fan of gospel is on the far right. Clue 10 mentions the fan of punk being on the right of the person who's hobby is photography.


## Step 8: Integrate Information for Final Placement
Given the clues:
- The Pakistani (board-games) is on the far left.
- The American (folk, baking to their left) must be after the baking enthusiast but doesn't have to be immediately next to them since other nationalities and hobbies can fit between.
- The Chinese (hiking) is to the right of the Malaysian.
- Cooking is to the left of hiking (Chinese).
- Metal fan is Polish.
- Gospel fan is on the far right.
- Punk fan is to the right of photography.

Considering all clues:
1. Pakistani (board-games) must be followed by baking (since American, who likes folk, comes after baking), then cooking (as it's before hiking), and hiking (Chinese).
2. The Malaysian can only fit between the Chinese and the end if we consider clue 1, but since Chinese (hiking) is to the right of Malaysian and also to the left of gospel fan (far right), Malaysian must be placed accordingly.
3. Polish (metal) hasn't been directly linked to a position yet, but given that metal isn't mentioned in relation to specific positions except through nationality, we need to fit them with a hobby not yet assigned.


## Step 9: Finalize Positions
Given the complexity and interlinking clues:
- Pakistani is on the far left (board-games).
- Baking must precede American but after Pakistani.
- Cooking precedes hiking (Chinese), and since Malaysian is between, it means the order for nationalities and hobbies starts to emerge.
- Polish (metal) can fit with a remaining hobby like puzzles or photography, considering punk's position relative to photography.

The table would look something like this based on our deductions:


|               |      1      |   2    |      3      |     4     |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby         | board-games| baking |  cooking   | hiking   | puzzles | photography|
| Music-Genre   | trance     | country| metal       | punk     | folk    | gospel   |
| Nationality   | pakistani  | malaysian| polish      | chinese  | american| german   |

However, this initial placement doesn't fully respect all given conditions (e.g., the position of punk relative to photography and the direct connection between some hobbies and nationalities). Let's correct this by strictly following clues:
- Pakistani on the far left with board-games.
- American is folk and must be after baking but can be preceded by other nationalities and hobbies.
- Chinese is hiking, to the right of Malaysian.
- Gospel fan is on the far right.
- Punk fan is to the right of photography.

Correcting for these conditions and ensuring all clues are respected:


|               |      1      |   2    |      3      |     4     |    5    |    6    |
| Hobby         | board-games| baking | photography | puzzles  | hiking | cooking |
| Music-Genre   | trance     | folk   | punk        | metal    | country| gospel |
| Nationality   | pakistani  | american| german      | polish   | chinese| malaysian|

This setup seems to correctly follow the clues provided, respecting the positions and relationships between hobbies, music genres, and nationalities.

Lv1-3x6-2	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the steps and clues provided:


## Step 1: Determine the teacher's position and beverage
The teacher is on the far left (Clue 1) and drinks coffee (Clue 3). So, the first column is filled with ""teacher"" as the job and ""coffee"" as the beverage.


## Step 2: Place the police-officer in relation to tea
The police-officer is on the right of the person drinking tea (Clue 2). We don't know the exact position yet, but we'll keep this in mind for later steps.


## Step 3: Position the hot-chocolate and sprite drinkers
The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking sprite (Clue 4). Since ""hot-cho"" is already given in column 2, the sprite drinker must be in column 3 or further to the right.


## Step 4: Position the police-officer and Spanish national
The police-officer is on the right of the Spanish (Clue 5), but without knowing the exact positions of tea or the Spanish national, we can't fill this in yet.


## Step 5: Determine the order of Thai and American nationals
The Thai is on the left of the American (Clue 6). Since the teacher drinks coffee and is on the left of the Thai (Clue 9), and considering the teacher's position, the Thai must be in column 2 or further to the right.


## Step 6: Place the architect and fisherman
The architect is on the right of the fisherman (Clue 7). Without specific beverages or nationalities to tie them to, we'll have to come back to this later.


## Step 7: Position the Canadian national
The Canadian is on the far right (Clue 8), which means column 6.


## Step 8: Position the cola drinker and Indian national
The person drinking cola is the Indian (Clue 10). The Spanish is on the left of the person drinking cola (Clue 11), so the order for these two nationals is determined but not their exact positions.


## Step 9: Place the project-manager in relation to the Indian
The Indian is on the right of the project-manager (Clue 12). This clue helps us understand the job sequence a bit better.


Given all these clues, let's start filling in what we know and deducing the rest:


1. The teacher drinks coffee and is at the far left.
2. ""hot-cho"" is already placed in column 2, indicating the hot-chocolate drinker is there.
3. Since the teacher is on the left of the Thai (Clue 9), and given the teacher's fixed position, the Thai cannot be in column 1 but must be after the teacher, possibly starting from column 2. However, considering ""hot-cho"" is in column 2, and we need to fit in the sequence that allows for all conditions to be met (including the police-officer being on the right of both tea and Spanish), we adjust our understanding based on further clues.


Let's fill out what we can with certainty:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |        4        |       5        |     6     |
| Beverage      | coffee | hot-chocolate |           |                 |                |           |
| Job           | teacher|               |           |                 |                |           |
| Nationality   |         |               |           |                 |                | canadian |


From Clue 9, since the teacher (coffee drinker) is on the left of the Thai, and considering the fixed positions:


- The Thai must be in column 2 or after, but given ""hot-cho"" is in column 2, we need to adjust our approach based on all clues.


Given the constraints and working through them logically:


1. Teacher (coffee) is in column 1.
2. Hot-chocolate is in column 2.
3. The sequence must allow for the police-officer to be on the right of both tea and Spanish, with the Spanish also being on the left of cola (which is drunk by the Indian).


Let's finalize based on logical deductions from all clues:


Given ""hot-cho"" in column 2, and knowing the teacher drinks coffee, we start building the sequence. However, without direct clues for every step, we must deduce:


- Column 1: Teacher, coffee
- Column 2: Hot-chocolate (Nationality and Job to be determined)
- The police-officer is after tea, Spanish before cola (Indian), Thai before American.


Considering all clues and filling in the blanks logically, we might have missed directly calculating each step due to the complexity and interdependence of the clues. However, let's outline a potential solution based on deductions:


Given the direct information and clues:
- Teacher is in column 1 with coffee.
- Hot-chocolate in column 2 suggests a specific order for beverages and potentially nationalities and jobs.


The final answer is:

Lv1-3x6-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 5
The person whose sport is water-polo is on the far right (position 6).


## Step 2: Combining Clues 8 and 1
Since the Japanese is on the left of the person whose sport is water-polo (Clue 8) and also on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon (Clue 1), we can deduce that biathlon must be to the left of Japanese, and water-polo is to the right of Japanese.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 4
The Canadian is on the left of the person watching animation movies. This clue doesn't specify a position yet but gives us a relationship.


## Step 4: Using Clue 6
The Mexican is on the right of the Canadian, which starts to build a sequence: Canadian -> Mexican -> ?


## Step 5: Applying Clue 7
The French is on the left of the person whose sport is surfing. This clue also doesn't specify positions but gives us another relationship.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 10
The French is on the left of the person watching thriller movies, which helps to build a sequence involving movie genres and nationalities.


## Step 7: Integrating Clues for Nationality Sequence
From clues 4, 6, and knowing the Canadian and Mexican positions relative to each other and possibly to others through additional clues, we start building a possible nationality sequence.


## Step 8: Using Clue 3
The person watching crime movies is also the person whose sport is baseball. This clue helps in identifying specific movie-genre and sport combinations but doesn't directly give us a position yet.


## Step 9: Applying Clues 9 and 11
Animation movies are on the left of sports movies, and animation movies are also on the left of snowboarding. These clues help in establishing a sequence for both movie genres and sports.


## Step 10: Finalizing Sequences with Remaining Clues
With Clue 2 (mystery movies to the right of British), Clue 12 (mystery movies to the right of thriller movies), and knowing that water-polo is at position 6, we can start placing the remaining options.


Given the complexity and interdependence of clues, let's attempt to synthesize them into a coherent table without violating any rules:


|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5       |     6      |
| Movie-Genre   |          |          |          |           |              |            |
| Nationality   |          |          |          |           |              |            |
| Sport         |          |          |          |           |              |            |

Based on the clues:
- The Canadian is left of Animation (Clue 4).
- Mexican is right of Canadian (Clue 6).
- French is left of Surfing and Thriller (Clues 7, 10), suggesting a sequence where French precedes these.
- Japanese is left of Water-Polo (Clue 8) and right of Biathlon (Clue 1).
- Water-Polo is at position 6 (Clue 5).
- Animation is left of Sports and Snowboarding (Clues 9, 11).
- Mystery is right of British and Thriller (Clues 2, 12).

A possible arrangement considering all clues:


|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5       |     6      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation| Thriller| Mystery |  Crime   |  Sports/Zombie|            |
| Nationality   | Canadian | French  | British | Mexican  |  Japanese    | Russian    |
| Sport         | Cycling  | Surfing | Biathlon| Baseball | Snowboarding | Water-Polo |

However, to fit all clues perfectly without contradiction and ensure each person has a unique combination of movie genre, nationality, and sport, we adjust while keeping the clues intact:


|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5       |     6      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation| Thriller| Mystery |  Zombie  |  Crime/Sports|            |

| Sport         | Cycling  | Surfing | Biathlon| Snowboarding| Baseball     | Water-Polo |

Given the constraints and to precisely match all clues, a correction is needed for accurate placement of genres and sports with nationalities:


|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |     4     |      5       |     6      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation| Thriller| Mystery | Zombie   | Crime        | Sports     |
| Nationality   | Canadian | French  | British | Mexican  | Japanese     | Russian    |
| Sport         | Cycling  | Surfing | Biathlon| Snowboarding| Baseball     | Water-Polo |

This adjustment ensures that each clue is respected, but the precise arrangement of genres and sports might still require final tweaking based on re-evaluation of all clues for a perfect fit.

Lv1-3x6-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 5 and Clue 6
From Clue 5, we know the Indian is on the far right. From Clue 6, we also know that the person watching family movies is on the far right. This means the Indian watches family movies.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person watching thriller movies is American. We don't know their position yet, except from Clue 7, which states the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the Chinese.


## Step 3: Use Clue 10 and Clue 1
The Chinese person's hobby is gardening (Clue 10), and this person is to the right of the filmmaker (Clue 1).


## Step 4: Apply Clue 9 and Clue 4
The person who draws is also the one watching martial-arts movies (Clue 4) and is on the left of the American (Clue 9). This gives us a sequence but not exact positions.


## Step 5: Analyze Clues 3, 8, and 13
From Clue 3, the time-travel fan is to the right of the musical fan. Clue 8 tells us the Spanish person is to the right of the musical fan. Clue 13 places the traveler to the right of the musical fan but to the left of the martial-arts fan.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 11
The Turkish person's hobby is chess, but we don't have enough information yet to place them.


## Step 7: Combine Information
From Clues 3 and 8, since the Spanish is on the right of the musical fan and so is the time-travel fan, but we know from Clue 13 that the traveler is between the musical and martial-arts fans, we can start forming sequences.


## Step 8: Finalize Sequences
Given all clues, let's try to place everyone:
- The American watches thrillers (Clue 2) and is on the left of the Chinese (Clue 7).
- The Chinese gardens (Clue 10) and is on the right of the filmmaker (Clue 1).
- The Indian watches family movies (from Step 1) and is at the far right.
- The martial-arts fan draws (Clue 4) and is on the left of the American (Clue 9), but also to the right of the traveler (Clue 12).
- The musical fan has several people to their right in a specific order: traveler, Spanish (who could be the time-travel fan given the constraints), and then the martial-arts fan.


## Step 9: Place Nationalities and Hobbies
Let's start with what we know:
1. American watches thrillers.
2. Chinese gardens.
3. Indian watches family movies.
4. Martial-arts fan draws and is to the right of the traveler.

Considering all clues, a possible arrangement could be:

| Hobby         | Movie-Genre   | Nationality   |
|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Drawing       | Martial-Arts  | ?             |
| Traveling     | Musical       | ?             |
| Filmmaking    | Time-Travel   | Spanish       |
| Gardening     | Documentary   | Chinese       |
| Chess         | Thriller      | American      |
| Photography   | Family        | Indian        |

But this doesn't fit all clues perfectly, especially considering the positions and relationships. Let's correct this based on the clues:


## Step 10: Correct Placement
Given:
- The martial-arts fan (who draws) is to the left of the American.
- The traveler is between the musical fan and the martial-arts fan.
- The Spanish is to the right of the musical fan.

And considering all other clues for correct placement:

Lv1-3x6-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Statement 10
The person who's sport is climbing is on the far left. This means position 1 is climbing.

## Step 2: Analyzing Statements 6 and 9
The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person eating asparagus, and the fan of classical is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing. Since climbing is at position 1, asparagus cannot be at position 1 (because then sailing would have to be at position 2 or further, but there's no room for classical before sailing if asparagus were at position 1), so we can deduce asparagus must be at position 2 (to fit classical and sailing in a way that respects all constraints given later).

## Step 3: Analyzing Statement 7
The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating kiwi. Given the positions already determined, pumpkin could potentially be at position 1 or 3 to satisfy this condition, but since climbing is at position 1 and asparagus (with classical and sailing following) seems to start from position 2 based on previous steps, pumpkin would logically fit into position 3 if we were just considering food. However, we need to integrate all preferences.

## Step 4: Integrating Statements 2, 11, and 13
The person eating cranberry is the fan of skateboarding, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person eating pomegranate, and the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This sequence must fit within our constraints. Given that skiing is a fan of folk (Statement 1) and considering other positions, we start to see a possible ordering for sports.

## Step 5: Analyzing Statements 3, 4, and 5
The fan of ambient is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing, the fan of funk is on the right of the fan of folk, and the fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon. This helps us place music genres relative to sports.

## Step 6: Combining All Information
Given all statements:
- Climbing is at position 1.
- Asparagus (and thus classical, then sailing) starts from position 2.
- Pumpkin must precede kiwi, and since pumpkin can't be before asparagus (due to climbing's placement), it likely goes after the asparagus/classical/sailing sequence or integrates within a way that respects all other conditions.
- Skateboarding (with cranberry) is before pomegranate and after sailing (to fit skiing and folk music in later positions).
- Skiing (folk music fan) follows skateboarding.
- Ambient's position is after sailing, which also needs to fit with the placement of funk and biathlon.

Given these constraints:
1. Climbing (position 1)
2. Asparagus (classical music) - fits here based on previous deductions
3. Sailing (ambient music doesn't fit here due to being on the right of sailing; thus, a sport or food item must separate them)
4. Pumpkin (to precede kiwi and fit within remaining slots)
5. Skateboarding (cranberry, and before pomegranate and skiing)
6. Skiing (folk music)

Now integrating music genres:
- Classical is with asparagus.
- Ambient is after sailing but needs a spot; since it's on the right of sailing, and considering our placements, ambient could fit with pumpkin if we adjust our understanding to integrate all preferences correctly.
- Folk is with skiing.
- Funk is on the right of folk and left of biathlon.

And sports:
- Climbing at 1
- Sailing after asparagus (classical)
- Skateboarding before pomegranate and skiing
- Skiing after skateboarding
- Biathlon after funk

Food:
- Asparagus with classical
- Pumpkin before kiwi
- Cranberry with skateboarding
- Pomegranate after skateboarding
- Kiwi with dubstep (Statement 14)

Finalizing positions based on all constraints:

1. Climbing - Pumpkin - Classical doesn't fit here; it fits better if we consider the direct statements about music and sport together.
2. Asparagus must be at position 2 to allow classical and then sailing to fit, considering the need for ambient after sailing.

Correcting our approach with a focus on integrating all preferences accurately:

Given the complexity and the mistake in sequential logic without directly applying each rule step-by-step to the table, let's correctly place items based on rules:

1. Climbing is at position 1.
2. Asparagus (and thus classical) must be at position 2 because sailing follows asparagus, and ambient follows sailing.
3. The sequence for sports and music considering all statements would accurately reflect:
- Climbing
- Asparagus (Classical)
- Sailing
- Pumpkin or the item that allows for ambient to follow sailing correctly while respecting other conditions.
- Skateboarding (Cranberry) before pomegranate and skiing.
- Skiing (Folk) after skateboarding.

Given the rules about music genres and their positions relative to sports, and considering we need to place each food item, sport, and music genre according to the given statements:

###########


Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 7, the person watching drama movies is on the far right (position 6).
From clue 5, the person drinking 7up is the person watching drama movies.
From clue 10, the person driving the skateboard is the person watching drama movies.


So, position 6 is: 
| Beverage      |    7up     |
| Movie-Genre   |   drama    |
| Transport     | skateboard|


From clue 13, the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching horror movies.
Since drama is at position 6, horror must be at position 5.


From clue 3, the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
So, documentary must be at position 4 or less.


From clue 1, the person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
Since documentary is at position 4 or less, and ship cannot be at position 6 (taken by skateboard), 
ship must be at position 5 or more, but horror is already at position 5. 
So, documentary must be at position 4 or less, and ship must be at position 5 or more.


From clue 11, the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.
Since documentary is at position 4 or less, taxi must be at position 3 or less.


From clue 8, the person drinking mirinda is the person driving the taxi.
So, mirinda is at position 3 or less.


From clue 12, the person driving the roller is the person watching documentary movies.
Since roller is on the left of milk (clue 2), and documentary is at position 4 or less,
documentary must be at position 3 or more (to satisfy both conditions).
So, documentary is at position 3.


From clue 2, the person driving the roller is on the left of the person drinking milk.
Since roller is at position 3 (with documentary), milk must be at position 4 or more.


We now have:

From clue 9, the person drinking water is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
Since water can't be at position 6 (taken by 7up), 
helicopter must be at position 1 or 2.

From clue 4, the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
Since mystery can't be at position 6 (taken by drama), 
hot-chocolate must be at position 4 or less.

From clue 1, the person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
Since ship can't be at position 6 (taken by skateboard), 
ship must be at position 5.

From clue 6, the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
Since mystery can't be at position 6 (taken by drama), 
mystery must be at position 4.


We now have:
|               |       1       |    2    |    3    |      4      |   5    |     6      |

| Transport     | taxi          | helicopter | roller   |             | ship    | skateboard|


But the problem is that there are only 6 beverages (mirinda, water, milk, hot-chocolate, 7up and juice) 
and we've already used mirinda, water, hot-chocolate and 7up.


So, milk must be at position 5 and juice must be at position 4.


We now have:
|               |       1       |    2    |    3    |      4      |   5    |     6      |

| Transport     | taxi          | helicopter | roller   |             | ship    | skateboard|


But the problem is that we've used mirinda twice.


So, mirinda must be at position 1 and another beverage must be at position 3.


The only remaining beverages are milk and juice but they're already used.


So, one of them must be replaced with the other remaining beverage which is not used yet.


Let's try to replace milk with the other beverage (which will be used at position 3).


We now have:
|               |       1       |    2    |    3    |      4      |   5    |     6      |

| Transport     | taxi          | helicopter | roller   |             | ship    | skateboard|


The only remaining beverage is hot-chocolate.


So, hot-chocolate must be at position 3.


We now have:
|               |       1       |    2    |    3    |      4      |   5    |     6      |

| Transport     | taxi          | helicopter | roller   |             | ship    | skateboard|


Now we have to fill the remaining movie-genre.


From clue 6, the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
But this doesn't give us any new information.


From clue 5, the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person drinking milk.
So, horror must be at position 5 or less.


We already have horror at position 5.


Now we have to fill the remaining movie-genre.


The only remaining movie-genre is mystery and it's already used.


But there are two more movie-genres which are not used yet: action and comedy.


One of them must be at position 2 and the other must be at position 1.


Let's try to put action at position 2.


We now have:
|               |       1       |    2    |    3    |      4      |   5    |     6      |

| Transport     | taxi          | helicopter | roller   |             | ship    | skateboard|


The only remaining movie-genre is comedy.


So, comedy must be at position 1.

Lv1-3x6-8	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each rule to deduce the arrangement of food, movie genres, and music genres for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 1
The fan of trance is the person eating tomato. This gives us a direct association but does not tell us the position yet.


## Step 2: Apply Rule 2
The fan of trance (who eats tomato) is on the right of the person watching musical movies. This starts to give us a relative positioning.


## Step 3: Apply Rule 3
The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. This rule helps with movie genre positioning but does not directly relate to food or music yet.


## Step 4: Apply Rule 4
The fan of gospel is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Combining this with Rule 3, we have a sequence for some movie genres and a music genre.


## Step 5: Apply Rule 6
The person watching adventure movies is the fan of reggae. This gives us another direct association between a movie genre and a music genre.


## Step 6: Apply Rule 11
The fan of r&b is on the far right. This gives us an endpoint for our arrangement.


## Step 7: Combine Rules for Overall Positioning
From Rule 3 and Rule 4, we know the sequence for some movie genres and a music genre is: gospel, romance, adventure. Since the person watching adventure movies is also the fan of reggae (Rule 6), this helps place reggae.


## Step 8: Further Refine with Food
Rule 1 and Rule 2 tell us about trance and tomato's position relative to musical movies. Rule 7 tells us eggplant is on the right of pineapple, and Rule 9 places satire to the left of pineapple.


## Step 9: Detailed Placement
- From Rule 12 and Rule 13, we know eggplant is to the left of cherry, and cherry is to the right of reggae. Since reggae is with adventure (Rule 6), this sequence helps.
- Rule 5 places blueberry to the left of electronic, and Rule 8 places electronic to the left of satire.


## Step 10: Finalize Positions
Combining all rules for a coherent order:
1. We have gospel to the left of romance, which is to the left of adventure (reggae).
2. Electronic is to the left of satire, which is to the left of pineapple.
3. Blueberry is to the left of electronic.
4. Eggplant is to the right of pineapple, and cherry is to the right of reggae (adventure), with horror to the right of eggplant.
5. Tomato (trance) is to the right of musical.
6. The fan of r&b is on the far right.


Given these steps, let's attempt to fill in the table based on deductions:


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |     4     |     5     |   6    |
| Food          | blueberry | pineapple | eggplant| cherry   | tomato   | pear   |
| Movie-Genre   | romance   | satire    | horror  | adventure| musical  | sports |
| Music-Genre   | gospel    | electronic| r&b     | reggae   | trance   | disco  |

However, upon careful review of the steps and ensuring each rule is applied correctly, we notice some discrepancies in the direct application of rules to the table without visual aids or further clarification on some positions. Let's correct this with a focus on directly applying each rule correctly:


1. Gospel is to the left of romance, which is to the left of adventure (reggae).
2. Electronic is to the left of satire, which is to the left of pineapple.
3. Blueberry is to the left of electronic.
4. Eggplant is to the right of pineapple, and cherry is to the right of reggae (adventure).
5. Horror is to the right of eggplant.
6. Tomato (trance) is to the right of musical.
7. R&b is on the far right.


Correcting for these rules and ensuring each is properly applied:


Given the complexity and upon reevaluation for clarity and accuracy in application:

Lv1-3x6-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and start filling in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right (column 6).


## Step 2: Combining Clues 9 and 4
Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who's sport is baseball, and this person is in column 6, we can start filling in the table with ""rock-climbing"" as the hobby and ""baseball"" as the sport for column 6.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 2
The person whose sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is video-games. We don't know the exact position yet, but we can note this combination.


## Step 4: Using Clue 1
The person whose hobby is collecting is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. This doesn't give us an exact position but tells us about a relationship between ""collecting"" and the helicopter.


## Step 5: Applying Clue 12
The person whose sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is cooking, and from clue 5, this person is on the left of the person driving the train. We also know from clue 10 that the person whose hobby is cooking is on the left of the person whose hobby is collecting.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 7
The person whose hobby is rock-climbing (which we've determined is in column 6) is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Since rock-climbing is in column 6, surfing must be to its left.


## Step 7: Applying Clue 13
The person whose sport is surfing is on the right of the person whose sport is handball. This means handball must be further to the left than surfing.


## Step 8: Using Clue 3
The person driving the scooter is on the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in column 6, the scooter must be in one of the columns to its left.


## Step 9: Applying Clue 6
The person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the scooter. This gives us a relationship between the scooter and the roller but doesn't specify their exact positions yet.


## Step 10: Combining Clues for Final Placement
From clue 8, the person driving the trike is on the left of the person whose sport is handball. Given all relationships, we start placing from the most restrictive clues:


- Baseball (and thus rock-climbing) is in column 6.
- Rugby (and thus cooking) must be to the left of the train, and since rugby's position isn't specified but it's related to cooking and then collecting, we can start building a sequence.
- Surfing is to the left of rock-climbing, so it could be in column 5, given that handball (from clue 13) is to the left of surfing.
- The scooter is to the left of rock-climbing, and the roller is to the right of the scooter. Given the constraints, we have to fit these around the other clues.


## Step 11: Finalizing Positions
Given all clues, let's place them in a possible order that satisfies all conditions:


1. Cooking (Rugby) - because it must be on the left of collecting and related to the train.
2. Collecting - must be after cooking and before the helicopter (from clue 1), but we also have to fit in drawing, roller, scooter, and trike around the clues about sports and hobbies.
3. Drawing - on the left of the roller (clue 11).
4. Roller - after drawing.
5. Scooter - since it must be before rock-climbing (clue 3) but also after the helicopter isn't directly stated; however, we need to fit in surfing and handball with their respective sports.


Considering all clues:


- Handball is on the left of surfing (clue 13), and surfing is to the left of rock-climbing (clue 7).
- The train is after rugby (cooking) but before baseball isn't directly stated; however, given that rugby is cooking and must be on the left of the train, and considering other placements, we have flexibility in how we arrange transport around hobbies and sports.


## Step 12: Final Placement Considering All Clues
Let's try to fit all clues into a coherent table:


Given:
- Baseball/Rock-climbing in column 6.
- Cricket/Video-games not directly placed yet.
- Rugby/Cooking on the left of the train.
- Surfing to the left of rock-climbing, and handball to the left of surfing.


A possible arrangement considering all relationships:


|             |     1      |       2       |      3      |    4     |    5    |       6       |
| Hobby       | Cooking   | Drawing      | Collecting | Sudoku  | Video  | Rock-climbing|
| Sport       | Rugby     | Cricket      | Surfing    | Handball| Weightlifting | Baseball    |
| Transport   | Trike     | Roller       | Scooter    | Jet-ski | Helicopter| Train        |


This arrangement attempts to satisfy all given clues, but the puzzle's complexity and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction for each clue make it challenging to ensure accuracy without iterating through each possible combination systematically.

Lv1-3x6-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the arrangement of foods, hobbies, and movie genres for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 7
The person watching disaster movies is on the far left.

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |      6      |

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games.

Since we don't know where the video-games person is yet, we can't fill in the table directly from this clue alone.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 8
The person who's hobby is sudoku is the person eating nectarine.
The person eating garlic is the person who's hobby is collecting.

These clues give us information about specific hobbies and foods but don't directly tell us their positions without other clues.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 10 and Clue 12
The person eating lemon is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
The person who's hobby is board-games is the person eating onion.

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |      6      |

## Step 5: Apply Clue 11
The person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.

This clue doesn't give us a direct placement yet without knowing where gardening is.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 13
The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person eating lemon.
The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person watching musical movies.

Given that the person eating lemon is to the right of the board-games person, and sudoku (nectarine) is to the right of lemon:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |      6      |
| Food          | Onion      | Lemon     | Nectarine |            |           |             |
| Hobby         | Board-Games|           | Sudoku    |            |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster    |           |           | Musical   |           |             |

## Step 7: Apply Clue 3
The person eating garlic is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

Since sudoku is associated with nectarine and is in position 3, garlic must be to its right:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |      6      |
| Food          | Onion      | Lemon     | Nectarine | Garlic    |           |             |
| Hobby         | Board-Games|           | Sudoku    | Collecting|           |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Disaster    |           |           | Musical   |           |             |

## Step 8: Apply Clue 5
The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.

We still need to place gardening, but we know it must be before comedy.


## Step 9: Apply Clue 6 and Clue 1
The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
The person watching animation movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games.

These clues help us understand the order but require knowing where dancing and video-games are in relation to other hobbies.


## Step 10: Piece together remaining clues
From Clue 9, lime is before fantasy. We know lemon is in position 2, so lime can't be there. Garlic (collecting) is in position 4, leaving positions 5 and 6 for lime and the remaining foods.


Considering all clues:
- Disaster is in position 1.
- Board-games (onion) is in position 1, followed by lemon, then nectarine (sudoku), then garlic (collecting).
- The order for hobbies from Clue 11 is board-games, gardening, and we have sudoku (nectarine) after lemon.
- Video-games must be after dancing, with animation before video-games.


Given the constraints:
- Position 1: Disaster, Board-Games, Onion
- Position 2: Lemon, Gardening (from Clue 11)
- Position 3: Nectarine, Sudoku, Musical (from Clue 13)
- Position 4: Garlic, Collecting
- Positions 5 and 6 must include lime before fantasy, animation before video-games, and dancing before video-games.


The final arrangement considering all clues is complex and requires precise placement based on the given constraints. Let's deduce the most likely order:


1. Disaster (Movie), Board-Games (Hobby), Onion (Food)
2. Comedy (Movie), Gardening (Hobby), Lemon (Food)
3. Musical (Movie), Sudoku (Hobby), Nectarine (Food)
4. Fantasy (Movie), Collecting (Hobby), Garlic (Food)
5. Animation (Movie), Dancing (Hobby), Lime (Food)
6. Spy (Movie), Video-Games (Hobby), Spinach (Food)
