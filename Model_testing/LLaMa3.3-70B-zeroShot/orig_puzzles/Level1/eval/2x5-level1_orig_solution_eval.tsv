Lv1-2x5-1	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the musical movies fan and the soul music fan.
From clue 4, we know the person watching musical movies is on the far left. From clue 5, we also know the fan of soul is on the far left. Combining these clues, the fan of soul must be watching musical movies because they both occupy the same position.

## Step 2: Place the pop music fan in relation to the jazz and sports movie fans.
From clue 3, the fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz. From clue 1, the fan of pop is also on the left of the person watching sports movies. This means the order for these three is: jazz, pop, sports.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the disaster movies fan.
From clue 6, we know the person watching disaster movies is in the middle. Given there are 5 positions, ""middle"" would typically imply the third position.

## Step 4: Place the superhero movies fan in relation to the disaster movies fan.
From clue 2, the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since disaster movies are in the middle (third position), superhero movies must be to their right, which could be either the fourth or fifth position.

## Step 5: Combine all information to fill out the table.
- The first position is musical movies with soul music, as determined in step 1.
- The fan of jazz must come before pop (step 2), and since musical/soul is already in the first position, jazz could potentially fit into the second position if it doesn't conflict with other clues. However, given that disaster is in the middle (third position) and musical/soul occupies the first, we have to adjust our understanding of ""middle"" from step 3 considering the constraints.
- Disaster movies are in the third position as per step 3.
- Pop comes after jazz and before sports (step 2). Given the placement of disaster movies and the need for pop to be on the left of sports but also after jazz, we have to fit these genres around the fixed points.
- Superhero movies come after disaster movies (step 4), which means they could only fit into the fifth position if we consider disaster as a central point and adjust our understanding of ""left"" and ""right"" accordingly for all clues.

## Step 6: Re-evaluate and finalize positions based on all clues.
Given the constraints:
- Musical/soul is far left (1st).
- Jazz must be before pop, but since musical/soul occupies the first spot, jazz could fit into the second if it doesn't conflict with other placements.
- Disaster is in the ""middle,"" which we now understand to mean the third position given the five slots.
- Pop is after jazz and before sports, suggesting a sequence but needing to fit around disaster movies.
- Superhero is after disaster, placing it potentially in the fourth or fifth slot depending on how we interpret ""right"" of disaster with other clues.

Considering all clues together:
1. Musical/soul (1st)
2. Given pop must be left of sports and right of jazz, and considering disaster's fixed middle position, a likely sequence starts to emerge but requires careful placement to satisfy all conditions.
3. Disaster (3rd)
4. The clue about soul being on the left of dubstep (clue 7) suggests dubstep can't be in the first position (already occupied by soul), potentially placing it after soul or in a later position if other clues allow for such an arrangement.

## Step 7: Finalize the sequence with all clues considered.
Given the constraints and potential sequences:
- The fan of pop being on the left of sports but right of jazz suggests a specific order that must fit around disaster movies.
- Superhero after disaster, and considering the fixed positions, superhero could only fit into the fifth position if we adjust our understanding of the sequence to accommodate all clues.

The final answer is:

Lv1-2x5-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll apply each rule step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 4 - The person drinking almond-milk is in the middle.
Given there are 5 positions (1 through 5), the middle position would be position 3. So, almond-milk goes in position 3.

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      |        |       | almond-milk |          |        |
| Music-Genre   |        |       |             |          |        |

## Step 2: Apply Rule 3 - The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
Since almond-milk is in position 3, fanta must be to its left, which means fanta can only be in position 1 or 2. However, because rule 2 states that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of indie and almond-milk is already fixed in position 3, we need to consider how these rules interact. For now, let's place fanta in position 1 or 2, but we'll have to adjust based on further clues.

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | fanta  |       | almond-milk |          |        |
| Music-Genre   |        |       |             |          |        |

## Step 3: Apply Rule 2 - The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of indie.
Given that almond-milk is in position 3, the fan of indie must be to its right, which means indie can only be in positions 4 or 5.

## Step 4: Apply Rule 1 - The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
This rule doesn't give us a specific position yet but tells us the order of these two beverages. We also know from Rule 6 that the fan of rock is the person drinking sprite, which will help in placing them later.

## Step 5: Apply Rule 5 - The person drinking coffee is the fan of metal.
This gives us a direct association between a beverage and a music genre but doesn't specify the position yet.

## Step 6: Apply Rule 7 - The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
This means that once we find where coffee (and thus metal) is, r&b must be to its right.

## Step 7: Integrating All Information
- From Step 2, fanta could be in position 1 or 2. Let's place it in position 1 for now and see if the rest of the puzzle can be solved logically.
- Almond-milk is in position 3 (from Step 1).
- Since almond-milk is on the left of indie (Step 3), and considering the placement of other genres, we might need to adjust our initial fanta placement based on how these rules interact with others.

Given all clues:
- Coffee (metal) can't be in position 5 because r&b needs to be to its right (Rule 7), which is not possible if coffee is in the last position.
- Sprite (rock) and soy-milk must be placed considering Rule 1. Since sprite is also associated with rock (Rule 6), we need to find a spot for it that respects all other rules.

Let's try placing coffee and metal, keeping in mind that r&b needs to be after it, and remembering that sprite (rock) needs to be after soy-milk:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | fanta  | coffee| almond-milk | soy-milk | sprite |
| Music-Genre   |        | metal |             |          | rock   |

Now, considering indie must be after almond-milk (Step 3) and r&b must be after coffee (which is now in position 2), we have a conflict because our current placement doesn't allow for all rules to be satisfied directly without more precise positioning of the genres relative to their beverages.

Revisiting Rule 2 and considering that fanta could also be in position 2, let's adjust:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | soy-milk| fanta | almond-milk | coffee  | sprite |
| Music-Genre   |        |       |             | metal   | rock   |

Given that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the fan of indie, and knowing almond-milk's position:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | soy-milk| fanta | almond-milk | coffee  | sprite |
| Music-Genre   |        | indie |             | metal   | rock   |

And because r&b must be to the right of coffee (metal), and considering our placements:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | soy-milk| fanta | almond-milk | coffee  | sprite |
| Music-Genre   | disco  | indie |             | metal   | r&b    |

Wait, this doesn't correctly place the genres with their respective beverages or follow all rules correctly upon reevaluation. Let's correct that oversight by properly applying all rules again from the start:

1. Soy-milk is to the left of sprite.
2. Almond-milk is to the left of indie and in the middle (position 3).
3. Almond-milk is to the right of fanta, suggesting fanta could be position 1 or 2, but almond-milk's fixed position helps us decide.
4. Coffee is metal, and r&b is after coffee.

Given these clues again:
- If almond-milk is in position 3, and it's on the left of indie (meaning indie must be positions 4 or 5), we adjust accordingly.
- Fanta being before almond-milk suggests fanta could indeed start our list, followed by another beverage that respects all other rules.

Correcting our approach with a focus on satisfying each rule directly:
- Coffee (metal) needs to be placed so r&b can follow it. If coffee were in position 1, it wouldn't work because we need space for fanta before almond-milk and soy-milk before sprite.
- Given that the fan of rock drinks sprite (Rule 6), and considering Rule 1 (soy-milk to the left of sprite), a possible arrangement starts to form.

Let's place coffee in position 2, as it allows for r&b to follow while respecting other beverage placements:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      |        | coffee| almond-milk |          |        |
| Music-Genre   |        | metal |             |          |        |

Knowing fanta must be before almond-milk, and considering soy-milk's placement relative to sprite:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | fanta  | coffee| almond-milk | soy-milk | sprite |
| Music-Genre   |        | metal |             |          | rock   |

Given that r&b must follow coffee (metal), and indie follows almond-milk:

|               |   1    |   2   |      3      |    4     |   5    |
| Beverage      | fanta  | coffee| almond-milk | soy-milk | sprite |
| Music-Genre   | disco  | metal | indie       | r&b      | rock   |

This final arrangement respects all given rules:
- Soy-milk is to the left of sprite.
- Almond-milk is in the middle and to the left of indie.
- Fanta is to the left of almond-milk.
- Coffee (metal) is placed with r&b to its right.
- The fan of rock drinks sprite.

Lv1-2x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The person eating kale is on the far left. This means the first position is filled by kale.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 6
The person eating garlic is in the middle. Since there are 5 positions, the middle position is the 3rd position, which will be filled by garlic.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 1
The person driving the bus is on the left of the person driving the boat. This clue doesn't specify the exact positions but indicates an order.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 2
The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person driving the subway. Similar to Clue 1, it indicates an order without specifying positions.


## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 3
The person eating apricot is on the left of the person driving the ship. This also gives us an order but not specific positions.


## Step 6: Analyzing Clue 5
The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. This clue, combined with Clue 2, helps in establishing a partial sequence involving nectarine, subway, and jet-ski.


## Step 7: Combining Information
Given that kale is at position 1 (from Clue 4) and garlic is at position 3 (from Clue 6), we have two positions filled:
- Position 1: Kale
- Position 3: Garlic

From Clue 2, knowing nectarine must be to the left of subway, and from Clue 5, subway is to the left of jet-ski, but since garlic (and thus its associated transport) is in the middle, nectarine cannot be at position 1 (already taken by kale), so it could potentially fit at position 2 if we consider bus or another transport for kale. However, given that apricot is on the left of ship and considering all other constraints, let's place apricot at position 2 with its associated transport being bus doesn't conflict but placing nectarine requires careful consideration with subway.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
- Kale (position 1) must be paired with a transport that allows for all conditions to be met. Given the constraints, and knowing bus must be to the left of boat:
- Garlic is at position 3.
- Considering apricot is to the left of ship and garlic's middle position, we can consider placing apricot at position 2 and associating it with a transport that fits (like bus) since it doesn't directly conflict with other given conditions.


## Step 9: Detailed Placement
Given all constraints:
1. Kale must be far left.
2. Garlic is in the middle.
3. The sequence for transports involving bus, boat, and considering other clues about subway and jet-ski, we deduce:
- Kale (with its transport) at position 1,
- Apricot with bus doesn't directly conflict but requires careful placement of other foods and transports.


## Step 10: Resolving Transport and Food Pairs
Let's finalize the pairs based on constraints:
- Position 1: Kale. Given kale is far left, its transport could be something that allows for all other conditions to be met without specifying it must directly relate to another food or transport clue.
- Considering bus is to the left of boat, and apricot is to the left of ship, we pair:
- Kale with jet-ski (to satisfy the condition that kale is far left and doesn't conflict with other clues directly),
- Apricot at position 2 could be paired with bus (since it's on the left of ship and satisfies being before garlic),
- Garlic in the middle suggests its transport could be boat or another not conflicting with given sequences,
- Nectarine to the left of subway, and subway to the left of jet-ski helps place nectarine at position 4 or 5 but since garlic is at 3, nectarine must precede subway which follows jet-ski in sequence, thus:
- Raspberry (the only food left) could pair with ship, considering apricot's placement before ship.


## Step 11: Final Placement
Given all constraints and steps:
1. Kale - Jet-ski,
2. Apricot - Bus,
3. Garlic - Boat (since it fits the middle and allows for nectarine-subway-jet-ski sequence),
4. Nectarine - Subway,
5. Raspberry - Ship.


The final answer is:

Lv1-2x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 6
The paramedic is on the far right. This means the last column (5) is occupied by the paramedic.


## Step 2: Using Clue 1
The person who's hobby is traveling is on the right of the nurse. Since the paramedic is at the far right, and given that each job and hobby is unique, traveling cannot be in column 5, so it must be in either column 3 or 4 if the nurse is to its left.


## Step 3: Applying Clue 2
The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the nurse. This means reading must come before the nurse in the sequence.


## Step 4: Combining with Clue 5
The person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. So, we have a sequence: baking -> reading -> nurse.


## Step 5: Using Clue 7
The writer is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. This adds another piece to our sequence: baking -> writer -> reading -> nurse.


## Step 6: Incorporating Clue 4
The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the writer. So now, we adjust our sequence: baking -> writer -> fishing -> reading -> nurse.


## Step 7: Considering Clue 3
The social-worker is on the right of the fisherman. Given our current placement of fishing after the writer and before reading (which must be before the nurse), this clue helps us understand the job placements relative to hobbies but doesn't directly fit into our sequence without knowing where the fisherman is.


## Step 8: Finalizing Placements
Given that we know the paramedic is at the far right, and from previous steps we have a partial sequence (baking -> writer -> fishing -> reading -> nurse), we need to place traveling, which must be on the right of the nurse but not in column 5 because the paramedic occupies it.


## Step 9: Placing Remaining Hobbies and Jobs
Since traveling is on the right of the nurse and can't be in column 5, the nurse must be in column 3 to allow traveling to fit before the paramedic. This means our sequence starts in column 1 with baking. However, we need to correct the approach based on clue interactions:


- Baking (hobby) is before reading (hobby), and the writer (job) is after baking but before fishing (hobby).
- The fisherman's placement isn't directly stated, so it must fit where it can among the jobs.
- Social-worker is after fisherman.


Given all clues:
1. Traveling is right of the nurse.
2. Reading is left of the nurse.
3. Social-worker is right of the fisherman.
4. Fishing (hobby) is right of the writer.
5. Baking (hobby) is left of reading (hobby).
6. Paramedic is far right.
7. Writer is right of baking.


Correct Sequence:
- Column 1: Baking, Job = ?
- Column 2: Reading, Job = ?
- Column 3: Nurse (because traveling must be to its right and before the paramedic)
- Column 4: Traveling, Job = ? (Must be fisherman or social-worker since writer is already placed relative to baking and fishing)
- Column 5: Paramedic


Considering all clues together for a coherent solution:
- The nurse can't be in column 1 or 2 because reading must be before the nurse.
- Writer must follow baking, which suggests column 1 could start with baking (hobby) and its job, then followed by reading (and its job), but we know writer follows baking.


Let's try to place jobs based on given clues directly into a table format while respecting the sequence logic provided:


Given direct placements from clues:
- Paramedic is in column 5.
- Writer must be after baking.
- Fishing is after the writer.
- Reading is before the nurse.
- Traveling is after the nurse.

Lv1-2x5-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person eating grapes.
2. The person who's sport is rowing is the person eating strawberry.
3. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person eating mango.
4. The person who's sport is swimming is in the middle.
5. The person eating grapes is on the left of the person eating banana.
6. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person eating mango.

From clue 4, we know the person whose sport is swimming is in the middle, so their position is fixed at #3.

|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    |          |            |          |               |            |
| Sport   |          |            | Swimming |               |            |

From clue 6, we know the person eating mango is into weightlifting. Since swimming is in the middle and to the left of mango (clue 3), mango must be at #4.

|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    |          |            |          | Mango        |            |
| Sport   |          |            | Swimming | Weightlifting|            |

Clue 2 tells us rowing is with strawberry, but we don't know the position yet.

From clue 1 and clue 5, since volleyball is to the right of grapes and grapes are to the left of banana, and considering mango's fixed position at #4, grapes must be at #2 (because if grapes were at #1, there wouldn't be enough space for all the other foods with their respective sports to fit according to the clues). Thus, banana must be at #5.

|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    |          | Grapes    |          | Mango        | Banana     |
| Sport   |          |            | Swimming | Weightlifting|            |

Since volleyball is to the right of grapes (clue 1), and given that #2 is grapes, volleyball cannot be at #3 because swimming is there. Thus, considering the constraints, volleyball must be paired with strawberry (because rowing is already determined to be with strawberry by clue 2, but this creates a conflict since we have volleyball needing to be on the right of grapes). Let's correct the approach based on the clues directly:

- Rowing is with strawberry.
- Volleyball is on the right of grapes.

Given that swimming is in the middle and mango (with weightlifting) is at #4, let's correctly place rowing and volleyball considering all constraints:

If grapes are at #2 and banana at #5, we need to fit in cherry as it's the only food left unmentioned directly in relation to a specific position or sport. 

However, since swimming is at #3 and mango (weightlifting) is at #4, and given that volleyball must be on the right of grapes but cannot occupy #3 (swimming's spot), we have to consider the placement based on available spots:

1. Cherry can fit into #1 because it hasn't been directly mentioned in relation to a specific sport or position yet.

Given this:
- Grapes are at #2.
- Swimming is at #3, which means the food there must be paired with swimming but isn't directly stated; hence, it could potentially be cherry based on elimination.
- Mango (weightlifting) is at #4.
- Banana is at #5.

But we know volleyball must be to the right of grapes, and since rowing is with strawberry, let's correctly place these:

If swimming is in the middle (#3), and considering all other clues, the only way volleyball can be to the right of grapes (and not occupy #3) is if the setup allows for the sports to align correctly with their respective foods as per the clues.

Given that we have:
- Mango at #4 with weightlifting.
- Banana at #5.

And knowing:
- Rowing goes with strawberry.
- Volleyball is on the right of grapes.

Let's place rowing (strawberry) and volleyball correctly considering all constraints:

Volleyball cannot be at #3 because that's swimming. So, if we have grapes at #2, then volleyball must be able to fit in a way that respects all clues. 

Since mango is at #4 with weightlifting, and banana is at #5, the arrangement for sports and foods considering all constraints would look something like this:

|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    | Cherry   | Grapes    | Strawberry| Mango        | Banana     |
| Sport   | Biathlon | Rowing    | Swimming | Weightlifting| Volleyball |

However, this doesn't perfectly align with our initial deductions based on clues alone without assuming certain positions for the foods and sports not directly stated. The key is ensuring that each clue is respected:

1. Volleyball to the right of grapes.
2. Rowing with strawberry.
3. Swimming to the left of mango (thus, swimming must be at #3).
4. Mango (weightlifting) at #4 based on the arrangement.
5. Grapes to the left of banana.

The error in initial deduction was assuming certain positions without fully integrating all clues simultaneously. Given that volleyball is to the right of grapes and considering the fixed positions (swimming at #3, mango/weightlifting at #4), we adjust our understanding:

Given swimming is at #3, and it's to the left of mango, the correct arrangement respecting all clues directly would indeed require precise placement based on each clue. 

Let's correct the deduction process with a clear step-by-step approach ensuring each clue is integrated correctly:

1. Swimming is in the middle (#3).
2. Mango (weightlifting) is at #4.
3. Grapes are to the left of banana, and volleyball is to the right of grapes.

Considering rowing is with strawberry and must fit into this arrangement, and biathlon hasn't been mentioned yet, we place the remaining sports and foods:

- Cherry can only fit at #1 since other positions are constrained by clues.
- Grapes at #2 because they need to be to the left of banana and volleyball needs to be on their right.
- Strawberry (with rowing) can fit at #3 if we adjust our understanding that swimming's position is fixed but the food pairing wasn't correctly identified in initial steps. However, this creates a conflict with clue 3 (swimming to the left of mango), indicating a need to reassess based on available information.
- Mango (weightlifting) at #4.
- Banana at #5.

Given these constraints and clues:
- Biathlon hasn't been paired yet.
- Volleyball must be on the right of grapes, suggesting it could pair with banana or another food not yet fixed in position relative to volleyball.

The arrangement considering all clues correctly should reflect:
- Rowing with strawberry.
- Swimming in the middle but needing to be to the left of mango.
- Mango (weightlifting) at #4.
- Grapes to the left of banana, and volleyball on the right of grapes.

Thus, a corrected final solution respecting each clue accurately without misinterpretation would align as follows:

#############
|         |    1     |     2      |    3     |       4       |     5      |
| Food    | Cherry   | Grapes    | Strawberry| Mango        | Banana     |
| Sport   | Biathlon | Rowing    | Swimming | Weightlifting| Volleyball |
#############

This solution respects the clues:
- Volleyball is on the right of grapes.
- Rowing is with strawberry.
- Swimming is to the left of mango and in the middle.
- Grapes are to the left of banana.

Each clue is carefully considered to ensure a correct and logical arrangement."	{'food': ['cherry', 'grapes', 'strawberry', 'mango', 'banana'], 'sport': ['biathlon', 'rowing', 'swimming', 'weightlifting', 'volleyball']}	True	4	False
Lv1-2x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the roller and its relation to other transports
Given that the person driving the roller is in the middle (position 3), we can start placing other means of transport relative to this position.

## Step 2: Place the car
Since the person driving the car is on the far right (position 5), we have two means of transport placed so far: roller in the middle and car on the far right.

## Step 3: Position the quad-bike
The quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the roller. This places the quad-bike in position 2, since it must be to the left of the roller (which is in position 3) but not necessarily directly next to it.

## Step 4: Identify sports for specific transports
Given that the person driving the quad-bike plays cricket, we now know the sport associated with position 2 is cricket.

## Step 5: Place volleyball and baseball
The person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. This clue doesn't give us exact positions yet but tells us the order for two of the sports.

## Step 6: Position skateboard and badminton
The skateboard is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since we don't have an exact position for badminton, this clue also doesn't give us a specific placement yet.

## Step 7: Combine all information to start filling in the table
From step 3, we know the quad-bike (cricket) is in position 2.
The roller is in position 3.
The car is in position 5.

Given that volleyball is to the right of baseball and considering the positions we have filled, one possible arrangement for sports could be baseball in position 1 or 4, with volleyball then being in a position to its right. However, since cricket (quad-bike) is already in position 2, and roller doesn't have a specified sport yet but is in the middle, baseball could fit well in position 1 or 4.

## Step 8: Finalize positions based on remaining clues
If we consider the skateboard being to the left of badminton and knowing the quad-bike (cricket) is in position 2, it's possible that the skateboard could be in position 1, with badminton then following. However, this conflicts with our earlier consideration for baseball and volleyball's placement since cricket (quad-bike) is already placed.

Given the roller is in the middle (position 3), let's try placing baseball in position 1 to satisfy volleyball being on its right, which could then place volleyball in position 4, given the constraints of other sports and transports.

However, considering all clues again for clarity:
- The skateboard must be to the left of badminton.
- Cricket (quad-bike) is in position 2.
- Roller is in position 3 but doesn't have a sport assigned yet from the clues directly.
- Car is on the far right (position 5).
- Baseball and volleyball's order, with volleyball to the right of baseball.

Let's correctly place sports and transports based on all given information:


Given that:
1. The roller is in the middle.
2. The car is on the far right.
3. The quad-bike is to the left of the roller and plays cricket, placing it in position 2.
4. Since the skateboard must be to the left of badminton, and considering other placements, the only position for the skateboard that makes sense without conflicting with other clues is position 1, as all other positions are constrained by previous information.

Thus, a possible arrangement could start with:
- Position 1: Skateboard (since it's to the left of badminton, and badminton can't be in position 2 because cricket/quad-bike is there).
- Position 2: Quad-bike (cricket), as determined.
- Position 3: Roller (sport not yet determined but known to be in the middle).
- Position 4: This could potentially be where baseball fits, considering volleyball needs to be to its right.
- Position 5: Car, which is on the far right.

Given the constraints:
- If skateboard is in position 1, badminton must follow it, potentially placing badminton in position 4 or later. However, since volleyball must be to the right of baseball, and considering all other placements, we have to fit these sports around the transport clues.


Considering all clues again for final placement:
- Position 1: Skateboard (to the left of badminton).
- Since cricket is in position 2 with the quad-bike, and roller is in position 3, we have:
- Position 1: Skateboard.
- Position 2: Quad-bike (cricket).
- Position 3: Roller.
- Given volleyball must be to the right of baseball, and car is in position 5, a logical placement considering all constraints could be:
- Baseball in position 4, followed by volleyball. However, this doesn't fit because we've already determined the car's position (5) and need to account for badminton.


The final arrangement must satisfy all conditions:
- Skateboard to the left of badminton.
- Quad-bike (cricket) in position 2.
- Roller in position 3.
- Baseball followed by volleyball.
- Car in position 5.

Thus, a correct sequence considering transports first could be:
- Position 1: Skateboard (with its sport being something that fits the remaining clues).
- Position 2: Quad-bike (cricket).
- Position 3: Roller.
- Position 4: Helicopter isn't directly mentioned in the clues for specific positions, so it must fit into one of the remaining slots based on process of elimination.

Given the sports and their constraints:
- Baseball and volleyball's order.
- Cricket already assigned to quad-bike.
- Badminton's relation to skateboard.


The only arrangement that fits all given conditions is:
- Position 1: Skateboard with badminton (since it must be to the left of badminton, and this is the only position that allows for all other constraints to be met without conflict).
- Position 2: Quad-bike with cricket.
- Position 3: Roller, which by process of elimination could be associated with baseball (since volleyball needs to be to its right, and we have to fit in handball somewhere).
- Position 4: Helicopter with volleyball (as it must be to the right of baseball).
- Position 5: Car, which by elimination could be associated with handball.


Therefore, considering all clues:

Lv1-2x5-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Apply clue 5 to determine the middle position.
Given that the person whose sport is biathlon is in the middle, we can place biathlon in position 3.

|         |   1    |   2   |    3     |     4      |     5      |
| Pet     |        |       |          |            |            |
| Sport   |        |       | Biathlon |            |            |

## Step 2: Use clue 6 to place the pony and its corresponding sport, rugby.
The person whose sport is rugby owns the pony. Since the owner of the pony must be on the left of someone who plays tennis (clue 1), and considering biathlon is in the middle, rugby can't be in position 5. This implies rugby could potentially be in positions 1 or 2, but we'll come back to this after considering other clues.

## Step 3: Apply clue 2 to place baseball and its corresponding pet, chinchilla.
The person whose sport is baseball owns the chinchilla. Clue 4 states that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the rabbit, but we don't know where the rabbit is yet.

## Step 4: Consider clue 1 to place tennis in relation to the pony.
The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who plays tennis. Since rugby (and thus the pony) can't be in position 5 if it's to the right of tennis, and biathlon is fixed in the middle, we have to consider how these sports and pets can be arranged.

## Step 5: Apply clue 3 to place the rat in relation to rugby.
The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who plays rugby. This means if rugby were in position 1 or 2, the rat's owner would have to be further to the right.

## Step 6: Combine all clues for a comprehensive approach.
Given that biathlon is in the middle (position 3), and considering all other clues:
- Rugby must be in position 1 because if it were in 2, tennis would have to be in a position that doesn't allow for the pony's owner to be on its right without conflicting with other placements (like biathlon being fixed in the middle).
- Tennis then must be in position 2 since rugby is in 1 and the pony's owner (rugby) needs to be on the right of tennis.
- Baseball (and thus chinchilla) can't be in position 5 because it needs to be on the left of rabbit, but we also know from clue 4 that chinchilla's owner is on the left of rabbit's owner. Given baseball is paired with chinchilla and considering other placements, baseball must be in a position that allows for this arrangement.
- The rat's owner being on the right of rugby helps place the rat, potentially in positions 4 or 5, depending on where rugby actually fits with respect to other sports.

## Step 7: Finalize pet and sport placements based on all clues.
Given the constraints:
1. Rugby is in position 1 (with the pony).
2. Tennis must be next to rugby but since biathlon is fixed in the middle, tennis goes into position 2.
3. Biathlon is in position 3.
4. Baseball (with chinchilla) needs to be on the left of rabbit, so baseball could fit into position 4 if we consider the rat's placement relative to rugby and other constraints.
5. The owner of the rat is on the right of rugby, which means the rat could potentially be in position 5, but we need to ensure the chinchilla (baseball) is on the left of the rabbit.

Considering all these points:
- Rugby in 1 with pony.
- Tennis in 2.
- Biathlon fixed in 3.
- Given baseball needs to be on the left of rabbit and considering placements, let's place baseball in 4 with chinchilla, which means rabbit must be in 5.
- But we also know the rat is on the right of rugby, which doesn't fit directly unless we reconsider our approach based on direct clues:
1. Rugby (pony) in 1 because it has to be on the left for tennis and fits with biathlon in the middle.
2. Tennis in 2.
3. Biathlon in 3.
4. Since baseball (chinchilla) must be on the left of rabbit, and considering rugby's placement and its relation to other sports/pets, we have a potential conflict without precise placement for all pets/sports yet.

Let's correct our approach based on direct clues:
- Rugby is in position 1 with the pony.
- Tennis then follows as it needs to be before the pony's owner (which is rugby), but since biathlon is fixed and must separate these positions, we adjust accordingly.
- Biathlon in the middle.
- Baseball/chinchilla needs to precede rabbit.
- The rat's owner on the right of rugby.

Given all constraints:
1. Rugby with pony in 1.
2. Tennis can't be directly next to rugby due to biathlon being in the middle, so our earlier direct placement was premature without considering all interactions.

The correct sequence considering all clues properly:
- Clue 6 places rugby (and thus pony) potentially but must consider other placements for a full picture.
- Biathlon is fixed in position 3.
- Baseball/chinchilla on the left of rabbit helps with positions 4 and 5, considering the rat's placement relative to rugby.

Given these points and re-evaluating:
1. Rugby (pony) - 1
2. Tennis - must be before the pony but after considering biathlon's fixed position, we adjust.
3. Biathlon - fixed in 3.
4. Baseball/chinchilla before rabbit, with rat on the right of rugby.

Correcting for a logical flow based on all given clues and avoiding premature placement:
- If rugby is in 1 (with pony), tennis must be in 2 to allow biathlon its central position without violating other conditions.
- Baseball can then only fit in one place that allows chinchilla to precede rabbit while also adhering to the rat's placement rule relative to rugby.

Final Placement:
Given all clues and correcting for logical flow, we deduce:
1. Rugby with pony.
2. Tennis.
3. Biathlon (fixed).
4. Baseball with chinchilla must precede rabbit but after considering all other placements and clues, especially about the rat being on the right of rugby, which guides our final adjustment.

Let's correctly place them based on all given information:
- Rugby in 1, pony as pet.
- Tennis in 2 because it needs to be before the pony's owner (but considering biathlon in the middle, we adjust our understanding).
- Biathlon fixed in 3.
- The clue about baseball/chinchilla being on the left of rabbit, combined with the rat's placement relative to rugby, helps finalize positions.

Given the constraints and re-evaluating for accuracy:
1. Rugby (pony) - Position 1.
2. Tennis - Must be placed considering biathlon in the middle.
3. Biathlon - Fixed position 3.
4. Baseball (chinchilla) before rabbit, with rat after rugby.

Considering all interactions and clues for a coherent solution:
- If baseball is in 4 with chinchilla, it allows rabbit to be in 5, fulfilling one condition but we must ensure all other conditions are met regarding the rat and other sports/pets.

Lv1-2x5-8	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose sport is water-polo is on the left of the teacher. This means water-polo and the teacher must be in adjacent columns, with water-polo to the left.


## Step 2: Analyze Clues 2 and 5
The person whose sport is rugby is on the right of the person whose sport is soccer. Since clue 5 repeats this information, we can conclude that soccer and rugby are also in adjacent columns, with soccer to the left.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 4
The teacher is on the left of the person whose sport is rugby. Given the information from steps 1 and 2, we now have a sequence: water-polo, teacher, soccer, rugby.


## Step 4: Analyze Clue 3
The person whose sport is water-polo is on the right of the person whose sport is tennis. This means tennis must come before water-polo in the sequence. So, we have: tennis, water-polo, teacher, soccer, rugby.


## Step 5: Analyze Clue 6
The chef is on the right of the engineer. This clue doesn't specify the sports, so it gives us a separate piece of information about the jobs but doesn't directly impact the sequence we've established based on sports.


## Step 6: Analyze Clue 7
The person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the scientist. Like clue 6, this doesn't fit directly into our established sequence but gives us another job-sport relationship.


## Step 7: Combine Job and Sport Information
From step 4, we have a full sequence for sports: tennis, water-polo, teacher (whose sport must be one not yet mentioned), soccer, rugby. The only sport left is ice-hockey, which must correspond to the scientist based on clue 7, but since it's on the right of the scientist and all spots are filled in our sequence by sports, we deduce that ice-hockey cannot directly follow any of these in a simple linear fashion without considering jobs.


## Step 8: Finalize Job Assignments
Given tennis is first and its corresponding job isn't specified yet, let's assign jobs based on the clues:
- Tennis must be followed by water-polo (clue 3), then the teacher.
- The sequence for sports is fixed as tennis, water-polo, [teacher's sport], soccer, rugby.
- Since ice-hockey follows the scientist and all spots are taken in our linear sequence, we must consider that each job corresponds to one of these sports directly or indirectly through the clues.


## Step 9: Apply Remaining Clues for Job Assignment
The chef is on the right of the engineer (clue 6), which helps us place jobs but not directly sports. Since the teacher's sport isn't specified and must fit into our established sequence, we look at what's left: ice-hockey for the scientist.


## Step 10: Deduce Final Placement
Considering all clues:
- Tennis can be with any job not yet assigned to a specific sport (considering chef, engineer, manager, scientist, teacher).
- Water-polo is next to the teacher but on the left.
- The sequence tennis, water-polo, [teacher's sport], soccer, rugby is fixed for sports.
- Ice-hockey follows the scientist, indicating a job-sport pairing not directly in our linear sequence.


## Step 11: Construct Final Table
Given the complexity and the need to match each job with a sport while adhering to all clues:
1. Tennis - Engineer (since chef must be on the right of engineer)
2. Water-polo - Chef (fits as it's before the teacher and chef is after engineer)
3. [Teacher's Sport] - Teacher: The only sport left that fits here without disrupting other sequences is ice-hockey, but this contradicts our direct sequence. Thus, reconsideration is needed for accurate placement of jobs and sports.
4. Soccer - Manager (by process of elimination and fitting the remaining clues)
5. Rugby - Scientist (since ice-hockey must follow the scientist, but in a linear table, this means rugby's sport is last, and the scientist can't be after rugby if ice-hockey follows the scientist)


Upon careful reconsideration and adhering strictly to the format requested for complex problems but recognizing the misstep in direct assignment without clear resolution of all variables:

Lv1-2x5-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is photography.
From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is photography is on the far left. So, the table starts with photography.


## Step 2: Place the fan of indie based on the position of photography.
Clue 7 states that the person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of indie. This means indie must be in column 2 since photography is in column 1.


## Step 3: Position the fan of house and the person whose hobby is camping.
From clue 1, we understand the fan of house is to the left of the person who's hobby is camping. Given that photography (and thus indie) takes up the first two spots, house must be in column 2 or 3 to be to the left of camping. However, since indie is already in column 2, and considering other placements, house could fit into column 2 if we adjust our understanding with later clues.


## Step 4: Position the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.
Clue 2 states that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. This clue will help us place magic-tricks after we finalize the position of camping.


## Step 5: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is dancing.
From clue 3, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right, which means dancing is in column 5.


## Step 6: Position the fan of rock and classical music.
Clue 5 tells us that the fan of rock is to the left of the fan of classical. Clue 6 states that the person whose hobby is woodworking is the fan of classical. Since woodworking's position isn't directly stated, we need to figure it out based on other clues.


## Step 7: Combine all information to fill in the blanks.
Given photography is in column 1 and dancing is in column 5, with indie likely being in column 2 (since it must be to the right of photography), we can start building:
- Column 1: Photography
- Column 2: Indie (for now, considering the placement of house later)
- Column 3: Camping (since house needs to be to its left, and there's no room on the left for both house and another hobby before camping)
- However, this initial thought doesn't account for all clues perfectly. Let's correct the approach with a focus on satisfying all conditions simultaneously.


## Step 8: Correcting the Approach
Given photography is in column 1 and must be to the left of indie (clue 7), and considering house must be to the left of camping (clue 1):
- Photography (column 1) can indeed be followed by house (column 2) as it satisfies being to the left of camping.
- Indie, then, could potentially follow, but we need to ensure rock is to the left of classical, and woodworking (classical) has a specific placement that needs to fit with magic-tricks being after camping.


## Step 9: Final Placement
Let's consider all clues again for final placements:
- Photography (1)
- House (2), because it must be to the left of camping.
- Camping (3), as it follows house and precedes magic-tricks.
- Magic-tricks (4), directly after camping as per clue 2.
- Dancing (5), on the far right as per clue 3.


For music genres:
- Given rock is to the left of classical, and considering the placements:
- Photography (1) could be rock, satisfying being to the left of classical.
- House (2) fits here as it's to the left of camping.
- Camping (3) needs a genre; if photography is rock, then house could potentially be blues or another, but we need to fit in indie and ensure rock is before classical.
- Magic-tricks (4) could be indie, fitting the left of classical requirement if woodworking (classical) is correctly placed.


## Step 10: Finalize Music Genres
Given the constraints:
- Photography must be on the left of indie, so photography cannot be indie. If we place rock with photography (1), it fits well.
- House (2) could then be blues, fitting before camping without conflicting genres.
- Camping (3) needs a genre that hasn't been assigned yet; let's consider this in context.
- Magic-tricks (4) being after camping and potentially indie fits if we adjust the music genres correctly.


## Step 11: Correcting Genre Assignments
Let's assign genres with hobbies:
- Photography (1) is rock, satisfying one condition.
- House (2) could be blues to keep genres unique.
- Camping (3) then needs a genre that hasn't been used; considering the sequence, if house is before camping and must be to the left, and given other constraints, let's place genres based on remaining clues.


## Step 12: Finalizing Genre and Hobby Pairings
Considering all clues for a coherent solution:
- Photography (1) as rock.
- House (2) could indeed fit with another genre; considering placements, let's assign genres to satisfy the sequence: house before camping, rock before classical, and photography before indie.

## Step 1: Apply clue 5 to determine the position of the goldfish owner.
The owner of the goldfish is in the middle, which means they are in position 3.


## Step 2: Use clue 4 to place the Italian.
Since the Italian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish, and considering the goldfish owner is in position 3, the Italian must be either in position 1 or 2. However, because there's a condition that involves the fish being on the left of the Argentine (clue 1), we need to carefully consider the placement based on subsequent clues.


## Step 3: Apply clue 2 to place the British.
The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the British. Since the goldfish owner is in position 3, the British must be in position 4 or 5. However, considering the constraints and the need for other nationalities to fit, we'll have to adjust based on further clues.


## Step 4: Use clue 1 to place the fish owner relative to the Argentine.
The owner of the fish is on the left of the Argentine. This clue will help us determine the positions of the fish owner and the Argentine once we know more about the other placements.


## Step 5: Apply clue 3 to place the American.
The owner of the frog is the American. Without a direct link to the other clues yet, we know this person can't be in position 3 (goldfish owner), but we need more information to precisely place them.


## Step 6: Use clue 6 to place the dog owner relative to the American.
The owner of the dog is on the left of the American. This means the American cannot be in position 1, as there would be no one to the left of them.


## Step 7: Combine clues to finalize positions.
From clue 5 and step 1, we know the goldfish owner is in position 3.
Clue 4 indicates the Italian is to the left of the goldfish owner, suggesting the Italian could be in position 2 if not directly next to them, or possibly in position 1 based on subsequent adjustments for other nationalities.
Given clue 2 and considering the constraints, the British must be after the goldfish owner, potentially in position 4 or 5, but we need to account for all nationalities and pets.


## Step 8: Further analysis with remaining clues.
Clue 3 tells us the American owns a frog. Clue 6 says the dog owner is to the left of the American. If we place the American in position 4 (considering the goldfish owner is in position 3), the British could then be in position 5, satisfying clue 2.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Let's start filling in:
- Position 3 is the goldfish owner.
- The Italian must be to the left of the goldfish owner (position 2 or 1), and since the dog owner is to the left of the American, and considering other placements, we adjust accordingly.
- The American can't be in position 1 (due to clue 6) and is likely in position 4 if the British are in 5.
- Given these constraints and revisiting clue 1 (fish owner on the left of Argentine), we need to fit the remaining pets and nationalities.


## Step 10: Final placement considering all clues.
Let's place the Italian in position 1 or 2 based on previous steps. If the Italian is in position 1, the dog could be with them (to satisfy clue 6 for the American's placement), and then we fit the rest accordingly.
