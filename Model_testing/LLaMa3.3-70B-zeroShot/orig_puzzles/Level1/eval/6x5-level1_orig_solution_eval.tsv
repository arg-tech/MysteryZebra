Lv1-6x5-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the thriller movie watcher's position and the chinchilla owner's position.
From clue 4, the chinchilla owner is on the far left. Clue 7 states the person watching thriller movies is also on the far left, so this person must own the chinchilla.


## Step 2: Identify the r&b fan's position relative to the chinchilla owner.
Clue 5 indicates the r&b fan is on the right of the chinchilla owner. Since the chinchilla owner is on the far left (position 1), the r&b fan must be in position 2.


## Step 3: Determine the positions based on the roller and zombie movies.
Clue 2 states the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person driving the roller, but we don't know their exact positions yet.


## Step 4: Identify the designer's drink and its implications.
From clue 3, the designer drinks juice. Clue 12 states the fan of rock drinks juice, so the designer must also be a fan of rock.


## Step 5: Determine the engineer's position relative to the bus driver.
Clue 8 says the engineer is on the left of the person driving the bus. Clue 11 indicates the bus driver is a fan of classical music.


## Step 6: Place the rat owner and the implications for the fisherman and others.
Clue 10 states the rat owner is on the right of the fisherman, and clue 9 says the rat owner is in the middle (position 3). This means the fisherman must be to the left of the rat owner.


## Step 7: Determine the water drinker's position and its implications.
Clue 13 states the person drinking water is in the middle. Clue 16 indicates this person also watches time-travel movies.


## Step 8: Identify the dancer's position.
Clue 17 says the dancer is in the middle, which aligns with the water drinker/time-travel movie watcher.


## Step 9: Place the bike rider relative to the soy-milk drinker.
Clue 1 states the bike rider is on the left of the soy-milk drinker.


## Step 10: Piece together the remaining clues to finalize positions.
- Clue 6: Fantasy movies are on the right of tea.
- Clue 14: Soy-milk is on the right of zombie movies.
- Clue 15: Hedgehog owner is on the right of mouse owner.
- Clue 18: Bird owner drives skateboard.
- Clue 19: House fan is on the right of rat owner.


Given these clues, let's try to assemble a coherent table:

Lv1-6x5-4	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply the clues step by step to deduce the arrangement.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8 and Clue 17
The Mexican is on the far left (Clue 8), and the person eating artichoke is also on the far left (Clue 17). This means the Mexican eats artichoke.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 7
The person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Since the lizard's owner drives the snowmobile (Clue 14), the lizard's owner is on the far right.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 16
The fan of metal is in the middle (Clue 2), and the dog's owner is the fan of metal (Clue 16). This places the dog's owner in the middle.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 11 and Clue 18
The person watching crime movies is in the middle (Clue 11), which means this person must also be the metal fan since both are in the middle. The crime movie watcher is on the left of the Japanese (Clue 18).

## Step 5: Apply Clue 13
The Turkish is in the middle, but since the metal fan and crime movie watcher are already determined to be in the middle, and given the constraints, it seems there was an oversight in the direct application. The Turkish must be adjacent to the middle, considering the unique placements of others.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 3
The thriller movie watcher is on the left of the person eating pear. Given the fan of folk eats pear (Clue 19), we can start piecing together the relationships but need more direct placements.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 1 and Clue 5
The ship driver is on the right of the Turkish, and the disaster movie watcher is on the right of the ship driver. This gives us a sequence but still lacks specific starting points without directly knowing who the Turkish person is adjacent to or what they watch.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 6
The house fan watches musical movies, which starts to give us genre alignments but not direct positions yet.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 10
The classical fan is on the left of the crime movie watcher. Given the crime watcher's central position, this helps in aligning some preferences.

## Step 10: Compile Known Information
- Mexican eats artichoke and is on the far left.
- The person driving the snowmobile (and owning a lizard) is on the far right.
- Metal fan owns a dog and watches crime movies, in the middle.
- Turkish is near the middle but exact placement needs clarification with other clues.
- Crime movie watcher is also in the middle, on the left of the Japanese.

## Step 11: Finalize Positions
Given the complexity and interlinking clues, we'll directly infer some positions based on the most restrictive clues:
1. Mexican (artichoke) - Far Left
2. Clues suggest a specific arrangement but require iterative application to ensure all conditions are met, which involves trial and error with the given constraints.

Lv1-6x5-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to see if we can deduce any positions.

1. **The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike**: This clue doesn't give us immediate positions but tells us about a relative relationship.
2. **The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the Brazilian**: Again, no immediate positions, but it gives another relative relationship.
3. **The person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking lemonade**: Relative relationship.
4. **The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies**: More relative relationships.
5. **The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade**: This connects with clue 3.
6. **The person watching sports movies is the Brazilian**: Now we know a nationality and its preference, but still need to place it.
7. **The person eating lettuce is on the left of the person drinking cola**: Another relative relationship.
8. **The person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the person watching animation movies**: This forms a sequence with clue 5.
9. **The person whose hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person watching mystery movies**: Relative relationship.
10. **The person whose hobby is video-games is in the middle**: This gives us our first fixed position (though we don't know what's associated with it yet).
11. **The person eating cabbage is on the far right**: Another fixed position, though we need to fill in details.
12. **The person whose hobby is video-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing**: Since video-games is in the middle (3rd position), this means singing must be in the 2nd position.
13. **The person eating cabbage is the person whose hobby is sudoku**: Now we know the hobby associated with cabbage, which is on the far right.
14. **The person watching drama movies is on the far left**: This gives us another fixed position.
15. **The Turkish is on the right of the Spanish**: Relative relationship.
16. **The person whose hobby is video-games is the person driving the bus**: Now we know the transport associated with video-games, which is in the middle.
17. **The Spanish is the person drinking juice**: This gives us a nationality and its beverage preference.
18. **The person eating cherry is on the left of the Dutch**: Relative relationship.
19. **The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking cola**: Another relative relationship.
20. **The person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving the bike**: More relative relationships.

Let's start filling in what we know:

- The drama movies fan is on the far left (Position 1).
- Video-games hobbyist is in the middle (Position 3), drives a bus, and is to the right of the singing hobbyist.
- Cabbage eater (sudoku hobbyist) is on the far right (Position 5).

Given these clues and their relationships, we can start piecing together more information:

1. **Drama** (Movie-Genre) | ? | ? | ? | **Cabbage** (Food)
2. ? | Singing (Hobby) | Video-games (Hobby), Bus (Transport) | ? | Sudoku (Hobby)
3. ? | ? | ? | ? | ?
4. ? | ? | ? | ? | ?
5. ? | ? | ? | ? | ?

From clue 6 and 1, we know the Brazilian watches sports movies and is to the right of the quad-bike rider.

Given that video-games (and thus bus) is in the middle and from other clues:

- **Cola** is to the left of **Lemonade**, which is to the left of **Animation**.
- **Sports** (Brazilian) is to the right of the **Quad-bike** rider.

And since the person watching time-travel movies is to the left of animation, and the taxi driver is to the right of time-travel:

- Time-travel, Animation, Taxi

Considering all relationships and filling in what we can deduce directly from clues without assuming (since direct deductions are complex with so many variables), let's organize based on fixed positions and known sequences:

1. **Drama** | ? | Video-games, Bus | ? | **Cabbage**, Sudoku
2. Lettuce, Cola | Singing, ? | Video-games, Bus | Lemonade, Animation | Cabbage, Sudoku
3. ? | ? | ? | Time-travel, Taxi | ?
4. Cherry, Dutch | Spanish, Juice | Brazilian, Motorbike | Sports, ? | Thai, ?
5. Bike, Tea | Quad-bike | ? | Motorbike | ?

However, filling in every single detail requires careful application of each clue to avoid contradiction and ensure all conditions are met. Given the complexity and without making assumptions beyond what's directly stated:

Let's attempt a more structured approach based on direct clues and known positions:

1. Drama (far left) - Lettuce - Cola - Singing - Bike - Tea
2. Time-travel - Lemon - Animation - Taxi - Cherry - Dutch
3. Video-games - Bus - Spanish - Juice - Skydiving - Mystery
4. Brazilian - Motorbike - Sports - Quad-bike - Reading - ?
5. Thai - Sudoku - Cabbage - ?

And nationalities:
- Brazilian (Sports, Motorbike)
- Dutch (Cherry, ?)
- Spanish (Juice, ?)
- Turkish (?)
- Thai (Cabbage, Sudoku)

Transport:
- Bike
- Bus (Video-games)
- Quad-bike
- Motorbike (Brazilian)
- Taxi

Beverages:
- Almond-milk
- Cola
- Juice (Spanish)
- Lemonade
- Tea

Given the complexity of directly solving this without iterative guessing and checking, let's simplify to what we know for sure and can deduce logically:

Directly placing everything correctly requires matching each clue perfectly without contradiction. Let's correct and finalize based on given clues and logical deductions:

The puzzle solution is quite complex and requires careful consideration of all clues. Without direct iteration through possible combinations while ensuring adherence to all rules, the exact placement of every category for each person involves considering the implications of each clue on the others.

Given this complexity, let's directly address what can be deduced with certainty based on provided information:

- The **Drama** fan is at position 1.
- The **Video-games** enthusiast (also the bus driver) is in position 3.
- The **Cabbage** eater (who enjoys **Sudoku**) is at position 5.

Considering beverage clues:
- **Cola** is before **Lemonade**, which precedes **Animation**.

And from transport and hobby clues, we piece together more information:

The direct solution requires meticulous attention to detail across all provided clues. The following represents an attempt to organize known elements based on the given puzzle constraints:


However, without manually going through each step and clue application in a systematic way that avoids assumptions beyond what's directly inferable from given statements, providing a precise and complete table that fills in every blank correctly according to the rules is challenging.

#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 2, the owner of the goat is in the middle, so the goat is in column 3.

From clue 6, the pakistani is in the middle, so the pakistani is in column 3.

From clue 1, the brazilian is on the far right, so the brazilian is in column 5.

From clue 4, the pakistani is driving the bike, but from clue 6, the pakistani is in the middle. Since the pakistani can't be driving the bike and be in the middle at the same time, the pakistani must be driving a different vehicle. From the transport options, the only one left for the pakistani is the bike.

From clue 3, the egyptian is on the left of the russian.

From clue 20, the egyptian is on the left of the person driving the tram. Combining this with clue 19, we get: egyptian - drama - epic - tram.

From clue 18, the person driving the tram is on the right of the person watching drama movies.

From clue 5, the person driving the taxi is the fan of ambient. From clue 15, the russian is on the right of the fan of ambient. Combining these two clues, we get: ambient - russian.

From clue 11, the person eating apple is on the right of the fan of electronic. From clue 12, the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person eating apple. Combining these two clues, we get: motorbike - electronic - apple.

## Step 2: Place the person who's hobby is collecting in the middle

|               |     1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |    5     |

## Step 3: Place the American and their preferences
From clues 9 and 10, we know the American eats zucchini and watches horror movies.

|               |     1     |    2     |     3      |      4      |    5     |

## Step 4: Place the person watching adventure movies
From clue 19, we know this person is in the middle, but since the collector is already in the middle, and from clue 15, the person watching adventure movies is also the person whose sport is parkour, we need to adjust our understanding based on further clues.

## Step 5: Adjust based on additional clues
From clue 11, the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Clue 19 seems to contradict our initial placement for adventure movies unless the middle position is flexible based on other criteria. We need to consider the interplay of all clues.

## Step 6: Place the Mexican and their preferences
From clue 13, the Mexican is on the left of the person watching sports movies.

## Step 7: Integrate the clues about beverages
From clue 5, the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Clue 6 places fanta to the left of iced-tea. Clue 2 indicates iced-tea is to the right of sports movies.

## Step 8: Consider the hobbies and sports clues
Clue 16 links cricket with writing, and clue 1 places writing to the right of badminton. Clue 3 places surfing to the right of board-games. Clue 18 places thriller (cooking) to the right of board-games.

## Step 9: Finalize placements based on all clues
Given the complexity and the need to satisfy all conditions, let's deduce:
- The Brazilian is on the far left.
- The American watches horror movies and eats zucchini, placing them likely on the far right due to other constraints.
- The person drinking iced-tea (Egyptian) is to the right of sports movies.
- Adventure movies are in the middle but must align with parkour and being to the right of mirinda.
- Collecting is in the middle, which might need adjustment based on the adventure movies placement.

Given these steps and considering all clues, the exact table requires precise integration of each clue, focusing on the constraints provided:

The final answer is:
