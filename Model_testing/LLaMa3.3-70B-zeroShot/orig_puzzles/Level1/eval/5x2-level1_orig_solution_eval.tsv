From clue 4, we know the freelancer drinks cola, so:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |           |

| Transport   |            |           |

From clue 3, we know the paramedic owns a mouse:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |           |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |            |  mouse    |
| Sport       |            |           |
| Transport   |            |           |

From clue 2, we know the person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the train:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |  lemonade |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |            |  mouse    |
| Sport       |            |           |
| Transport   |            |  train    |

From clue 1, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person whose sport is skiing. Since the person drinking lemonade is already on the right, the person whose sport is skiing must be on the left:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |  lemonade |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |            |  mouse    |
| Sport       |  skiing   |           |
| Transport   |            |  train    |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks. The person on the left has a pet that is not a mouse (since the paramedic has a mouse), so they must have a rat:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |  lemonade |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |  rat      |  mouse    |
| Sport       |  skiing   |           |
| Transport   |            |  train    |

The person on the right has a sport that is not skiing (since the person on the left prefers skiing), so they must prefer baseball:


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |  lemonade |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |  rat      |  mouse    |
| Sport       |  skiing   |  baseball |
| Transport   |            |  train    |

Finally, the person on the left must use a jet-ski (since the person on the right uses a train):


|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  cola     |  lemonade |
| Job         |  freelancer|  paramedic|
| Pet         |  rat      |  mouse    |

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is on the far right, so the transport for column 2 is ""roller"".


From clue 4, we know the owner of the ferret is drinking sprite. Combining this with clue 3, we know the person who owns the ferret and drinks sprite also likes skateboarding.


Now, let's use clue 1: the paramedic is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This means the paramedic must be in column 1, and the person drinking sprite (who owns a ferret and likes skateboarding) must be in column 2.


Since the paramedic is in column 1, the librarian must be in column 2, but we already know that the person in column 2 drinks sprite and likes skateboarding. However, there's no direct information linking these two, so let's continue with other clues.


The transport for column 1 can be deduced from clue 2: since the roller is used by the person in column 2, the tram must be used by the person in column 1.


For pets, we know the ferret owner drinks sprite and is in column 2. Therefore, the goldfish must be in column 1.


Lastly, for sports, since skateboarding is liked by the person in column 2 (who owns a ferret and drinks sprite), lacrosse must be liked by the person in column 1.


Now, let's assemble all this information into the table:


|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | soy-milk |      sprite   |
| Job         | paramedic|    librarian  |
| Pet         | goldfish |      ferret   |
| Sport       | lacrosse | skateboarding|
| Transport   |    tram  |      roller   |


Therefore, the final solution table is:

| Sport         |                    |          |


From clue 1, we know the person eating grapes is on the far left. This means:
 
|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             |          |

| Sport         |                    |          |

From clue 4, the person whose hobby is collecting is on the far left. So:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             |          |

| Sport         |                    |          |

Since there are only two foods and the person on the left eats grapes, the person on the right must eat avocado:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             | Avocado  |

| Sport         |                    |          |

From clue 3, the fan of electronic is on the left of the person whose sport is baseball. This means the person on the left (whose food is grapes and hobby is collecting) must be the fan of electronic because there's no one to their left, and thus the person on the right must have baseball as their sport:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             | Avocado  |

| Music-Genre   | Electronic         |          |
| Sport         |                    | Baseball |

Given clue 2, the fan of pop is on the right of the software-developer. Since the person on the right has baseball as their sport and avocado as their food, they must also be the fan of pop (because electronic is already assigned to the left), which means the software-developer cannot be on the right. Therefore, the software-developer must be on the left:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             | Avocado  |

| Sport         |                    | Baseball |

The only hobby left is camping, which must be assigned to the right:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             | Avocado  |

| Sport         |                    | Baseball |

The only job left is teacher, which must be on the right since software-developer is already assigned to the left:

|               |         1          |    2     |
| Food          | Grapes             | Avocado  |

| Music-Genre   | Electronic         | Pop      |
| Sport         |                    | Baseball |

The only sport left is weightlifting, which must be assigned to the left:

|               |         1          |    2     |

Lv1-5x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person eating radish.
From clue 1, we know the person eating radish is on the far right. This means the other food, lemon, must be on the left.


## Step 2: Place the nationalities based on the taxi and the Chinese person's position.
Clue 2 tells us the Chinese person is to the left of the person driving the taxi. Since there are only two positions, this means the Chinese person must be on the left (eating lemon), and the taxi cannot be on the left, so it must also be on the right or associated with the right person in some way.


## Step 3: Arrange the movie genres.
Clue 3 states that the person watching family movies is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means comedy movies are watched by the person on the left (Chinese, eating lemon), and family movies are watched by the person on the right (eating radish).


## Step 4: Position the jobs based on their order.
Clue 4 indicates that the journalist is to the right of the dancer. Since we have determined the movie genres' positions and know the foods, this clue helps us finalize the jobs' arrangement.


## Step 5: Assemble all information into a table.
Given the clues:
- The person eating radish is on the far right (Step 1).
- The Chinese person is on the left of the taxi driver, implying the Chinese person eats lemon and is on the left (Step 2).
- Comedy movies are watched by the person on the left, and family movies by the person on the right (Step 3).
- The journalist is to the right of the dancer (Step 4).


The table should look like this based on our deductions:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Food          | lemon     | radish    |
| Job           | dancer    | journalist|
| Movie-Genre   | comedy    | family    |
| Nationality   | chinese   | turkish   |
| Transport     | airplane  | taxi      |

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Food          | lemon     | radish    |

Lv1-5x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and apply it step by step to the table.


1. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking Sprite.
2. The owner of the ferret is the person drinking Sprite.
3. The person watching action movies is on the right of the British.

From clue 1, since the person with magic-tricks is to the left of the person drinking Sprite, and given that there are only two columns (1 and 2), the person with magic-tricks must be in column 1, and the person drinking Sprite must be in column 2.


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |              | Sprite   |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks|          |
| Movie-Genre   |              |          |
| Nationality   |              |          |
| Pet           |              | ferret   |

From clue 2, we've already placed the ferret in column 2 with Sprite.


Now, using clue 3, which states the person watching action movies is on the right of the British, this means the British person cannot be in column 2 because there's no one to their right. Thus, the British person must be in column 1, and since we've determined the magic-tricks hobbyist is also in column 1, this aligns with our current setup.


The remaining pieces of information are:
- The other beverage is iced-tea.
- The other hobby is chess.
- The other movie genre is documentary.
- The other nationality is Canadian.
- The other pet is a snake.

Given that the British person is in column 1 and watches either action or documentary movies, but must be to the left of the action movie watcher (according to clue 3), it means the British person cannot watch action movies because there would be no one to their right. Thus, the British person watches documentary movies.


Since the magic-tricks hobbyist is in column 1 and we've established this person is also British (because they must be to the left of the Sprite drinker/action movie watcher), and given that the owner of the ferret drinks Sprite and is in column 2, this leaves us with:


|               |      1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |              | Sprite   |
| Hobby         | magic-tricks|          |
| Movie-Genre   | documentary |          |
| Nationality   | British     |          |
| Pet           |              | ferret   |

The person in column 2 must be Canadian (since the other nationality is Canadian), drink Sprite, own a ferret, and watch action movies (because they are to the right of the British person).


This leaves us with iced-tea as the beverage for column 1, chess as the hobby for column 2 (since magic-tricks is already assigned to column 1), and the snake as the pet for column 1.


So, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea     | Sprite   |

Lv1-5x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The coach is a fan of country music.
2. The Italian is to the left of the person whose sport is swimming.
3. The person drinking Mirinda is Italian.
4. The Italian is to the left of the scientist.

From clue 3, we know the Italian drinks Mirinda. From clue 4, we know the Italian is to the left of the scientist, so the Italian cannot be a scientist (because they would be to the left of themselves). Therefore, the Italian must be a coach.

Now, using clue 1, we know the coach is a fan of country music. Since the Italian is a coach, the Italian must be a fan of country music.

Clue 2 tells us that the Italian is to the left of the person whose sport is swimming. This means the Italian's sport cannot be swimming, so it must be cycling.

We have determined the following:

- The Italian drinks Mirinda.
- The Italian is a coach.
- The Italian likes country music.
- The Italian's sport is cycling.

Now we fill in the table for the Italian (left side) and deduce the rest:

|               |    1    |     2     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda | Iced-tea  |
| Job           | Coach   | Scientist|
| Music-Genre   | Country | Folk     |
| Nationality   | Italian | Turkish  |
| Sport         | Cycling | Swimming |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-5x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person whose hobby is dancing is on the right of the Canadian. This means the Canadian cannot be in column 2 because there would be no one to the right of them for the dancer to be placed.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The paramedic is on the left of the person whose sport is baseball. This implies that the paramedic must be in column 1, and the baseball player must be in column 2.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person eating pear is on the left of the Thai. Since there are only two nationalities (Canadian and Thai), and given the previous clue that suggests the Canadian is likely in column 1 (to allow someone to be to their right), this implies the Thai must be in column 2.


## Step 4: Combine Information
From Steps 1-3, we can deduce:
- The Canadian is likely in column 1.
- The paramedic is in column 1.
- The dancer is on the right of the Canadian, so the dancer must be in column 2, but since the Thai is also in column 2 (and considering the limited options), this means the dancer and the Thai are associated with column 2.
- The person eating pear is to the left of the Thai, which means the pear eater cannot be the Thai. Thus, the Canadian eats pears.


## Step 5: Finalize Jobs
Given that the paramedic is on the left (column 1) of the baseball player and must be in column 1, this aligns with our previous deductions about nationalities and hobbies.


## Step 6: Assign Remaining Categories
- The electrician, by process of elimination, would have to be associated with column 2 since the paramedic is in column 1.
- Since the dancer is on the right of the Canadian, and we've established the Thai must be in column 2 (with the dancer), this means the dancing hobby aligns with the Thai.
- The sport of swimming, by elimination, goes to column 1.


## Step 7: Construct Final Table
Given all deductions:
- Column 1 is Canadian, paramedic, eats corn (since pear is eaten by someone to the left of the Thai, implying a mistake in deduction regarding pear's placement; correction needed based on clue 3), and prefers swimming.
- Column 2 is Thai, electrician, eats pear (correcting previous deductions based on clue 3), and prefers baseball.


Corrected Final Table Based on Deductions:


|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |   corn    |     pear    |

| Job           | paramedic| electrician |

Lv1-5x2-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
2. The person eating pepper is on the far right.
3. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby.

From clue 2, we know the person eating pepper is on the far right, so the table looks like this:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Food          |              |  pepper    |

| Sport         |              |            |

From clue 1, we know the fan of metal is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person eating pepper is on the far right, the person with the hobby magic-tricks must be on the left. The table looks like this:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Food          |              |  pepper    |
| Hobby         |  magic-tricks|            |

| Sport         |              |            |

Now, the fan of metal must be on the right, so the music-genre for person 2 is metal. The table looks like this:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Food          |              |  pepper    |
| Hobby         |  magic-tricks|            |

| Sport         |              |            |

From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. This means person 1 has a lizard and person 2 plays rugby. The table looks like this:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Food          |              |  pepper    |

| Sport         |              |  rugby     |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks. Person 1 has a lizard, so person 2 must have a goldfish. Person 1's sport is not rugby, so it must be basketball. The music-genre for person 1 is not metal, so it must be house. Finally, the food for person 1 is not pepper, so it must be nectarine. The table looks like this:

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Food          |  nectarine   |  pepper    |

Lv1-5x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Apply the first clue
The person watching satire movies is on the left of the owner of the cat. This means the satire movie watcher cannot be on the far right, but we don't know which side they are on relative to the other categories yet.


## Step 2: Apply the second clue
The fisherman is on the far left. This gives us a fixed position for one job.


## Step 3: Apply the third clue
The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. This means the comedy movie watcher cannot be on the far left, and the snowmobile driver also cannot be on the far right.


## Step 4: Apply the fourth clue
The person whose hobby is traveling is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing. This gives us a relative position for the hobbies but doesn't directly relate to the other clues yet.


## Step 5: Combine all clues
Given that the fisherman is on the far left (clue 2), and considering clue 4, if we assume the fisherman's hobby is rock-climbing (since it has to be either rock-climbing or traveling, and we need to start with a possible combination), then the traveler must be on the right. However, we don't know their jobs, movie preferences, pets, or transport yet.


## Step 6: Further deduction
Since the satire movie watcher is on the left of the cat owner (clue 1) and the fisherman (rock-climber, for this assumption) is on the far left, if the fisherman watches satire, then the cat cannot be with them because there needs to be someone between the satire watcher and the cat owner. This suggests the fisherman might watch comedy, but we need to align all categories.


## Step 7: Aligning jobs and hobbies
If the fisherman is on the far left and watches comedy (to satisfy clue 3 indirectly by not conflicting with it), then the journalist must be on the right. Given that traveling is on the right of rock-climbing, the journalist could be the traveler.


## Step 8: Finalizing movie genres and pets
The satire watcher must be on the left of the cat owner. If the fisherman (comedy) is on the far left, then the satire watcher cannot be the fisherman but must be next to them or have someone in between who isn't a cat owner if we were considering other placements. However, given our setup, the fisherman being a comedy fan allows the journalist (on the right) to potentially own the cat and watch satire.


## Step 9: Transport
The comedy watcher is on the right of the snowmobile driver. If the fisherman watches comedy, then the fisherman cannot drive the snowmobile because they are already on the far left. This means the journalist (satire, traveling) could be associated with the train, and the fisherman (comedy, rock-climbing) could be associated with the snowmobile or vice versa for transport but considering positions, it fits that the fisherman uses the snowmobile.


## Step 10: Final arrangement
Given all considerations:
- Fisherman is on the far left.
- Watches comedy movies.
- Has rock-climbing as a hobby.
- Uses the snowmobile.
- The other person (journalist) watches satire, has traveling as a hobby, and uses the train.
- Since the satire watcher is on the left of the cat owner and considering our arrangement, it means the bird must be with the fisherman to satisfy all conditions.
