Note: This solution was obtained by carefully applying the given constraints one by one, using a process of elimination and deduction to arrive at the final arrangement. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

* From clue 2, we know that sprite is on the far left.
* From clue 21, we know that the police-officer is on the far left, so they must drink sprite.
* From clue 13, we know that the police-officer is on the left of the person drinking cola, so cola must be in position 2.
* From clue 15, we know that the bartender is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the police-officer and the person drinking cola are already in positions 1 and 2, the bartender must be in position 2, and the owner of the hamster must be in a later position.
* From clue 5, we know that the social-worker is on the right of the scientist. This means that the scientist cannot be in position 6 (since there would be no room for the social-worker to their right), so the scientist must be in an earlier position.
* From clue 1, we know that the social-worker is on the left of the fan of ambient. Since the social-worker is already on the right of the scientist, this means that the fan of ambient must be in a later position than the social-worker.
* From clue 10, we know that the fan of disco is the dancer, and from clue 14, we know that the dancer is on the far right. This means that disco must be in position 6.
* From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is the fan of disco. Since disco is in position 6, this means that biathlon must also be in position 6.
* From clue 18, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is on the left of the fan of disco. This means that tennis must be in an earlier position than disco (which is in position 6).
* From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since tennis is in an earlier position than disco, this means that almond-milk must also be in an earlier position.
* From clue 12, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since almond-milk is in an earlier position than tennis, this means that the owner of the bird must be in an even earlier position.
* From clue 6, we know that the owner of the bird is the person who's sport is swimming. This means that swimming must be in a position that is earlier than tennis but later than almond-milk.
* The remaining positions and preferences can be filled in using the remaining clues.

Note that this explanation is not exhaustive, and there are many other clues and deductions that were used to arrive at the final solution."	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'cola', 'almond-milk', 'soy-milk', 'coffee', 'fanta'], 'job': ['police-officer', 'bartender', 'scientist', 'social-worker', 'designer', 'dancer'], 'music-genre': ['dubstep', 'ambient', 'soul', 'electronic', 'rock', 'disco'], 'pet': ['snake', 'bird', 'fish', 'hamster', 'lizard', 'cat'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'swimming', 'volleyball', 'tennis', 'biathlon', 'ice-hockey']}	True	7	False

The solution is obtained by carefully applying the given conditions one by one, using a process of elimination and deduction to determine the unique arrangement that satisfies all conditions. 

Here's a brief overview of how some of the conditions help determine the arrangement:

- From condition 2, the chef is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.
- Condition 8 states the person whose hobby is chess is the chef, and from condition 20, this person eats pear. 
- Given condition 1 (the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person whose hobby is chess) and condition 5 (the fan of blues is the person eating pomegranate), we can start building a sequence.
- Condition 4 gives us papaya to the right of pineapple, and condition 7 places the fan of trance to the left of papaya.
- Since the electrician is on the far right (condition 6) and the person eating avocado is also on the far right (condition 14), these two must be related to the same person or adjacent positions.
- The freelancer is the person whose hobby is sudoku (condition 13), and this person likes dubstep (condition 3).
- Condition 21 states the person whose sport is soccer is on the left of the person whose sport is water-polo, which helps in arranging sports.
- By combining these conditions with the others, we can deduce the arrangement that fits all given clues.

This puzzle requires a systematic approach to ensure all conditions are met simultaneously.

Lv1-5x6-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through each clue and update the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person eating grapefruit
From clue 19, the person eating grapefruit is on the far left.

## Step 2: Place the person whose hobby is dancing
From clue 13 and 12, we know the person who's hobby is gardening eats blueberry. Clue 22 indicates that the fan of blues (who also eats blueberry from clue 17) is to the right of the grapefruit eater. Since the dancer is on the far left according to clue 12 and the grapefruit eater is also on the far left, they must be in positions 1 and 2 but we cannot determine their exact order yet.

## Step 3: Position the fan of blues (blueberry eater) relative to grapefruit
From clue 22, since the blueberry eater (fan of blues) is to the right of the grapefruit eater, and considering clue 12 where gardening (and thus blueberry eating) is also associated with the fan of blues, we deduce that grapefruit must be in position 1, followed by blueberry.

## Step 4: Position the cricket player
From clue 6, the person whose sport is cricket is on the far left. This means cricket and grapefruit are associated with the first position because the dancer (from clue 12) cannot occupy this spot due to the grapefruit eater's placement as per clue 19.

## Step 5: Position the handball player relative to tomato
From clue 5, the person eating tomato is on the right of the person whose sport is handball. This doesn't give us an exact position yet but tells us their order.

## Step 6: Position the fisherman relative to tomato
From clue 1, the fisherman is on the right of the person eating tomato.

## Step 7: Determine the positions based on job and music preferences
Clue 4 states the fan of soul is the teacher. Clue 21 indicates this teacher (soul fan) is to the left of the rowing sport player.

## Step 8: Position the coach and rower
From clue 9, the person whose sport is rowing is on the left of the coach. Combining with clue 16 (handball player on the right of the coach), we get a sequence but not exact positions yet.

## Step 9: Position the paramedic and onion eater
Clue 7 states the paramedic is on the left of the person eating onion, and from clue 15, the paramedic's sport is cycling.

## Step 10: Place the fan of folk (cooking hobby)
From clue 2, the cooking hobbyist is a fan of folk. Clue 8 indicates this folk fan is to the right of the pumpkin eater.

## Step 11: Position the pumpkin eater and disco fan
Clue 14 states the fan of disco eats pumpkin. Since from clue 13, the gardening hobbyist (who eats blueberry) is to the left of the disco fan, we have a partial order but need more information for exact placement.

## Step 12: Finalize positions with remaining clues
Given the complex interconnections, let's summarize key points:
- Grapefruit and cricket are in position 1.
- Blueberry (and thus blues fan and gardener) is in position 2.
- From clue 3, gardening (blueberry eater) is to the left of golf player.
- Sudoku hobbyist plays golf (clue 20), helping to place golf.
- With pumpkin eaten by disco fan (clue 14), and considering other placements, we fill in the gaps.

The final answer is:
