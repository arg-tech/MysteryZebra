```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

From clue 1, the person drinking iced-tea is the person watching action movies:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

```

From clue 8, the fan of techno is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing:
This means that techno must be in column 3, and dancing in column 4, so:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

From clue 6, the person driving the airplane is the person drinking mirinda:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

| Transport     |                | airplane   |              |            |
```

From clue 11, the person who's sport is biathlon is the person drinking mirinda:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea       | mirinda    |              |            |

```

From clue 14, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person drinking water:
And from clue 13, the person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person drinking water.
Since the person drinking mirinda (biathlon) is in column 2 and the dancer (column 4) can't be to the left of anyone, 
the person drinking water must be in column 1 or 3. Given that iced-tea is already in column 1:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

| Transport     |                | airplane   |              |            |
```

From clue 15, the person who's sport is soccer is the entrepreneur:
And since soccer must be to the right of water (from clue 13), and given that ice-hockey is already in column 3:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |
| Beverage      | iced-tea       | mirinda    | water       |            |

| Transport     |                | airplane   |              |            |
```

From clue 16, the person drinking sprite is not mentioned in any other clues, so they must be in column 4:
But since we already know that dancing and soccer are in columns 4 and 3 respectively (due to previous deductions), 
the only option left for sprite's drinker is column 1 or 2. Given that iced-tea is already in column 1:
However, from clue 17, there's no mention of the person drinking sprite or coffee.
But given the information about electronic music and that it must be in column 3 (since column 4 has techno), 
and since we have already determined most of the other columns, let's look at what is left for column 4:
Since dancing is already in column 4, and from clue 12, the person who likes electronic music is not the same as the dancer,
but must be in the same column (column 3 has techno), this means that column 4 can have either soccer or electronic.
However, we know that soccer must be to the right of ice-hockey, which is already in column 3. 
Given this information and the remaining clues:
From clue 16, it seems there was an error in transcription as ""sprite"" does not appear elsewhere; I assume you meant another drink.
Assuming one of the drinks (let's say coffee or tea) must be in column 4 with dancing:
But given that we don't have a direct match for column 4's beverage yet and considering all other clues about jobs, sports, music genres, 
and transport, let's finalize based on what we can infer directly from provided information.
Given the arrangement so far and looking at clue 12 again which was not directly utilized due to missing specifics:
And finally, combining clues 9 and 10 (not explicitly mentioned but implied through elimination), 
the only beverage left for column 4 that hasn't been assigned or ruled out based on given conditions is tea or coffee.
However, it seems I proceeded under an assumption of provided details without direct reference to specific clue numbers beyond a certain point.

Given the constraints and deductions made:
- Column 1 has iced-tea, action movies, board-games, and an unspecified job.
- Column 2 has mirinda, superhero movies, biathlon, and an airplane.
- Column 3 has water, western movies, ice-hockey, and an unspecified transport (not airplane).
- Column 4 has an unspecified beverage (let's fill in the gaps based on standard logic puzzle resolution strategies).

For column 4's beverage, since tea isn't mentioned elsewhere and assuming each drink is unique to a column:
Let's assign tea to column 4 for completion. However, without explicit clues for some positions, 
this assignment relies on typical logic puzzle conventions rather than direct clue implications.

Thus, considering standard logic puzzle structures and the information directly provided or inferred:
```
|               |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4      |

| Transport     |                | airplane   |              |            |
```
Given the direct and indirect implications of clues, along with standard logic puzzle conventions:
This arrangement seems to follow the general structure of a logic puzzle, but without explicit details for every category in each column,
some assumptions are based on typical puzzle patterns rather than strictly adhering to provided clue numbers.

The final answer is: $\boxed{tea}$"	{'beverage': ['iced-tea', 'mirinda', 'water', 'tea'], 'hobby': ['board-games', '', '', 'dancing'], 'job': ['', '', '', 'dancer'], 'movie-genre': ['action', 'superhero', 'western', ''], 'music-genre': ['', 'trance', 'techno', ''], 'sport': ['', 'biathlon', 'ice-hockey', 'soccer'], 'transport': ['', 'airplane', '', '']}	True	9	False
Lv1-7x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to fill in the table.


Given the clues:
1. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person driving the trike.
2. The Indonesian is on the right of the fan of folk.
3. The person eating garlic is on the left of the person eating cherry.
4. The fan of folk is on the left of the person whose hobby is photography.
5. The fan of soul is the person watching epic movies.
6. The person watching epic movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is Sudoku.
7. The fan of blues is on the left of the owner of the fish.
8. The person watching family movies is the person whose hobby is gardening.
9. The Australian is on the left of the Pakistani.
10. The person whose hobby is photography is on the right of the person eating cherry.
11. The owner of the horse is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
12. The Pakistani is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
13. The person whose hobby is photography is on the far right.
14. The person driving the boat is on the left of the owner of the fish.
15. The owner of the rabbit is on the far left.
16. The person driving the boat is on the left of the person watching family movies.
17. The Pakistani is on the right of the person watching family movies.

From clue 13, we know the person whose hobby is photography is on the far right (column 4).
From clue 15, the owner of the rabbit is on the far left (column 1).

Using these as anchors, let's start filling in:


|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |      4      |
| Food          |          |            |             |             |
| Hobby         |          |            |             | Photography|
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |             |             |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |             |             |
| Nationality   |          |            |             |             |
| Pet           | Rabbit   |            |             |             |
| Transport     |          |            |             |             |

From clue 3, since the person eating garlic is on the left of the person eating cherry, and from clue 10, the person whose hobby is photography is on the right of the person eating cherry, we have a sequence for food but not exact positions yet.

Clue 8 tells us the person watching family movies has gardening as their hobby. Clue 16 says the person driving the boat is on the left of the person watching family movies, and clue 17 places the Pakistani on the right of the person watching family movies.

Given clue 9 (Australian on the left of the Pakistani) and knowing the owner of the rabbit is on the far left, we can start placing nationalities.


|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |      4      |
| Food          |          |            |             |             |

| Nationality   | Australian|            | Pakistani  |             |
| Pet           | Rabbit   |            |             |             |
| Transport     | Boat     |            | Jet-ski     |             |

Clue 14 (the person driving the boat is on the left of the owner of the fish) and clue 7 (the fan of blues is on the left of the owner of the fish) help us place the music genre and pet for column 2.


|               |    1     |     2      |      3      |      4      |

Note: The solution is based on the given clues and may require careful analysis of each statement to arrive at the final arrangement. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was derived:

* Clue 9 places the fan of disco on the far left, and clue 15 places the dancer on the far left as well. Since there can only be one person on the far left, the dancer must also be the fan of disco.
* Clue 10 identifies the owner of the rat as the person watching epic movies. Clue 12 places the person eating potato on the left of the owner of the rat, so the person eating potato cannot be the one watching epic movies.
* Clue 13 places the person watching time-travel movies on the left of the person watching epic movies. Clue 7 places the person watching horror movies on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. This creates a sequence: horror, time-travel, epic.
* Clue 8 places the owner of the cat on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Clue 5 places the librarian on the left of the person who's sport is rowing, and clue 16 places the librarian on the left of the owner of the lizard. This creates a sequence: librarian, lizard, rowing.
* Clue 1 places the person who's sport is rowing on the right of the person eating kale. Clue 2 places the person eating kale on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. This creates a sequence: fishing, kale, rowing.
* Clue 3 identifies the fan of d&b as the person eating kale. Clue 11 identifies the chef as the person eating grapes. Clue 4 places the person eating grapes on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
* Clue 17 places the person who's sport is surfing on the left of the fan of gospel. Clue 15 identifies the person who's hobby is board-games as the fan of gospel.
* By combining these sequences and clues, we can arrive at the final solution table."	{'food': ['potato', 'kale', 'grapes', 'kiwi'], 'hobby': ['fishing', 'baking', 'board-games', 'singing'], 'job': ['dancer', 'librarian', 'chef', 'architect'], 'movie-genre': ['time-travel', 'horror', 'epic', 'comedy'], 'music-genre': ['disco', 'd&b', 'gospel', 'folk'], 'pet': ['chinchilla', 'rat', 'lizard', 'cat'], 'sport': ['surfing', 'skateboarding', 'rowing', 'weightlifting']}	True	5	False

- The spy movie watcher (woodworking hobby, iced-tea drinker) is on the far left.
- The Brazilian (mystery movies, bike not applicable but ship or tram possible, folk music not correct based on later clues) is placed with mystery movies and must fit into one of the remaining spots that aligns with other clues.
- The Italian watches family movies and is not on the far left or right.
- The Mexican is on the far right, listens to techno, and the sport and transport can be deduced from elimination.

Lv1-7x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the correct arrangement of characteristics for each person.


Given Clues:


1. The Russian is a fan of salsa.
2. The Colombian is on the left of the dancer.
3. The software-developer is on the right of the person whose hobby is photography.
4. The person watching musical movies is on the left of the person whose hobby is reading.
5. The fan of hip-hop is the person driving the subway.
6. The dancer is on the right of the fan of electronic.
7. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching zombie movies.
8. The fan of folk is on the right of the person whose hobby is singing.
9. The owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the skateboard.
10. The owner of the snake is on the left of the project-manager.
11. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person driving the subway.
12. The Colombian is on the left of the owner of the turtle.
13. The person driving the ship is on the right of the Colombian.
14. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the dancer.
15. The Colombian is on the right of the Dutch.
16. The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.


From clue 15, we know the order for two nationalities: Dutch, Colombian.


Clue 2 gives us a job-nationality pair: Colombian - Dancer (but not necessarily directly next to each other).


Clue 14 tells us the hedgehog owner is on the left of the dancer. Clue 9 says this person also drives a skateboard.


Given clue 6 and knowing the dancer's position relative to others, we can start forming groups.


However, solving this puzzle step-by-step without guessing requires methodically applying each clue to eliminate possibilities until we find a fit for all characteristics. This involves creating a grid or table and systematically filling in known information while using process of elimination for unknowns.


Let's deduce some key points:


- From clue 5, the hip-hop fan drives the subway.
- Clue 11 places the hamster owner to the left of the subway rider (hip-hop fan).
- Clue 1 tells us the Russian likes salsa.
- The Dutch and Colombian order is known from clue 15.


Directly solving this puzzle in a single response without iterative steps or guessing is challenging due to its complexity. However, we can infer some direct placements:


1. **Nationality Order**: From clue 15, we have Dutch, Colombian. Clue 2 suggests the dancer is after the Colombian but doesn't specify if directly after.


2. **Hedgehog and Skateboard**: The hedgehog owner drives a skateboard (clues 9 and 14) and is on the left of the dancer.


3. **Hip-Hop and Subway**: The hip-hop fan rides the subway (clue 5).


Given these clues, let's attempt to construct a table based on the most direct information:


|               |      1      |         2          |        3        |     4      |

| Transport     |             | Skateboard         | Subway/Ship     | Car        |


However, constructing the complete table requires a detailed step-by-step elimination process that considers all clues simultaneously. Given the format and complexity of this puzzle, directly filling out the entire table in a single response without iterative deduction steps or potentially guessing some combinations is impractical.


For an accurate solution, each clue must be carefully integrated into the table, ensuring consistency across all characteristics. The provided table above reflects initial deductions but lacks the comprehensive application of all clues necessary to accurately fill every field.

Lv1-7x4-7	"To solve this puzzle, we will go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we deduce it.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 7 and Clue 8
From Clue 7, the Colombian is on the far right, and from Clue 8, the person drinking hot-chocolate is also on the far right. This means the Colombian drinks hot-chocolate.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 4
The person whose sport is golf is the Colombian. So, we have the Colombian playing golf and drinking hot-chocolate.


## Step 3: Use Clue 17
The dancer is the person whose sport is parkour. From Clue 1, the person whose sport is parkour has a hobby of reading.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 6
The owner of the hedgehog is the dancer. But from Clue 11, the Chinese is the owner of the hedgehog, which means the dancer must be Chinese.


## Step 5: Resolve Conflict with Clue 3 and Clue 11
Given the Chinese owns a hedgehog (Clue 11) and is on the left of someone (from various clues), we can start building the sequence. The mechanic is on the right of the Chinese (Clue 3).


## Step 6: Use Clue 13
The Colombian is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games. Since the Colombian is at the far right, this helps us place someone with a hobby of card-games to the left of the Colombian.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 5 and Clue 10
The dancer (who is Chinese) is on the right of the person driving the train (Clue 5), and the entrepreneur is on the right of the Thai (Clue 10). This gives us a sequence but needs to be integrated with other information.


## Step 8: Integrate Clues for Beverage, Hobby, Job, Nationality, Pet, Sport, and Transport
From Clue 2, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the owner of the bird. Since the Colombian drinks hot-chocolate and is at the far right, someone to their left owns a bird.


## Step 9: Apply Remaining Clues for Final Placement
- Clue 14 places the Chinese (who plays cricket) to the left of someone whose sport is cricket.
- Clue 15 indicates the person drinking Mirinda is on the left of the Chinese.
- Clue 16 places the person drinking 7up to the left of the person drinking milk.


## Step 10: Compile Information
Given all clues, let's compile what we know:
- Colombian is at the far right, drinks hot-chocolate, and plays golf.
- The dancer (Chinese) owns a hedgehog and does parkour.
- Mechanic is on the right of the Chinese.
- Entrepreneur is on the right of the Thai.


## Step 11: Finalize Positions
1. The person drinking Mirinda is on the left (Clue 15), so they must be Australian or Thai since Colombian is taken by hot-chocolate and we know the dancer's (Chinese) beverage indirectly through elimination.
2. Given Clue 16, if the person drinking 7up is to the left of milk, this sequence must fit within the first three positions.
3. Since the Chinese owns a hedgehog (Clue 11), and considering other placements, we deduce:
- The Australian drinks Mirinda (to be on the left of the Chinese).
- The Thai drinks 7up (since they need to be to the left of someone drinking milk, and after the Australian).
- The person drinking milk must then be the Colombian or in a position that allows for all other clues to fit.


## Step 12: Final Placement Considering All Clues
Given the complexity and the process of elimination:
- The Australian drinks Mirinda.
- The Thai drinks 7up.
- The Chinese (dancer, hedgehog owner) does parkour, which means they can't be in the first position due to beverage clues but fits well with being the second or third based on other clues.

From clue 17, the nurse is on the right of the person drinking tea. And since the fisherman is in column 2, we place the nurse and the person drinking tea in columns 2 and 3 or further to the right.


However, from clue 1, the nurse is on the left of the owner of the frog, so the nurse cannot be in column 4.


From clue 3, the person eating radish is on the left of the nurse. Given the current setup, this means:


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |

From clue 5, the social-worker is the person driving the scooter. From clue 11, the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of funk.


Since we don't know where the fan of funk or the social-worker are yet, let's proceed with other clues.


From clue 2, the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person driving the helicopter. From clue 13, the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person eating zucchini.


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |

From clue 14, the fan of funk is the person who's hobby is drawing. From clue 8, the fan of funk is on the left of the person driving the trike.


We can now use clue 4 to place some more information: The owner of the horse is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing (fan of funk).


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |

From clue 15, the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the fan of funk.


Since we have a person eating zucchini in column 4 and the fan of funk (drawing) likely in column 3 due to the placement of the horse and other constraints:


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |

| Transport     |               | scooter   | trike     | helicopter |


Given the fan of country is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (clue 7), and considering we have to fit in a fan of gospel as well (on the left of the person whose hobby is filmmaking, clue 10):


The only place for the fan of country to be on the right of card-games is if card-games is in column 1 or 2. Since column 1 has fisherman and we've established a pattern:


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |      4      |
| Beverage      | cola/other   | iced-tea   | mirinda   |             |
| Food          | broccoli    | radish    |            | zucchini   |
| Hobby         | card-games   |            | drawing   | filmmaking |
| Job           | fisherman  | nurse     | social-worker| electrician|

| Pet           | horse        |            | chinchilla| frog       |
| Transport     |              | scooter   | trike     | helicopter |


Using clue 10 (fan of gospel on the left of filmmaking) and knowing we have to fit in an electrician or another job for the last column, along with fitting beverages:


The final arrangement considering all clues might look something like this, although exact beverage placements were not directly inferable from given clues without assuming common associations (e.g., cola with country music):


Given all the constraints and clues provided:


############## Final Answer ##############
The arrangement that fits all given clues would be a detailed table where each column represents a person and each row a characteristic. However, due to the complexity of directly solving every aspect with the information given in this format and without visual aids or tables, we deduce based on logical steps taken.


To align with the instructions for providing a final answer in the required format while acknowledging that a detailed table would be more appropriate but not feasible here:


The final answer is: $\boxed{1}$"	{'beverage': ['cola/other', 'iced-tea', 'mirinda', ''], 'food': ['broccoli', 'radish', '', 'zucchini'], 'hobby': ['card-games', '', 'drawing', 'filmmaking'], 'job': ['fisherman', 'nurse', 'social-worker', 'electrician'], 'music-genre': ['country', 'gospel', 'funk', ''], 'pet': ['horse', '', 'chinchilla', 'frog'], 'transport': ['', 'scooter', 'trike', 'helicopter']}	True	9	False
Lv1-7x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement and fill in the information step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing statements about specific positions
From statement 2, we know the person watching crime movies is on the far right.
From statement 5, the person driving the jet-ski is also on the far right. This seems to conflict with statement 2 unless they are related or the same person in some way, but given statement 6 (the owner of the pony is the person driving the jet-ski), it indicates a specific set of activities for one person.
From statement 11, the person driving the train is on the far left.


## Step 2: Combining information about hobbies and jobs
Statement 12 says the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far right. Statement 7 indicates this person is to the right of the hiker, suggesting a sequence but not exact positions yet.
Statement 9 places the american to the right of the security-guard, and statement 10 places the person eating blueberry to the right of the security-guard, implying the american eats blueberries.


## Step 3: Analyzing food preferences
From statement 4, the person eating cranberry is to the left of the bartender. Statement 13 indicates the fantasy movie watcher is to the left of the cranberry eater, giving a sequence but not exact positions.
Statement 14 says the scientist owns the dog, and statement 15 places this person (scientist) to the right of the blueberry eater.


## Step 4: Nationality and transport
Statement 3 identifies the helicopter driver as Spanish. Statement 8 indicates the Japanese person watches animation movies.


## Step 5: Combining all information
Given the complexity, let's start filling in based on fixed positions:
- Far left is the train driver (11).
- Far right has conflicting information but seems to be related to gardening (12), jet-ski driving (5), and crime movie watching (2). However, statement 16 places the onion eater on the far right, which could imply this person also does these activities or there was an oversight in initial analysis.


## Step 6: Detailed placement
Given statement 1 (reading hobby to the right of guinea-pig owner) and other placements, we need to deduce a logical sequence that fits all criteria. However, without direct statements linking many categories directly to each other, we infer based on given clues:
- The american is to the right of the security-guard (9), and since the blueberry eater is also to the right of the security-guard (10), this suggests the american could be the blueberry eater.
- The scientist, who owns a dog (14), is to the right of the blueberry eater (15), suggesting a sequence but not exact jobs or nationalities yet.


## Step 7: Finalizing positions
To finalize, let's correct and clarify:
- Given statement 16 (onion eater on the far right) and considering other ""far right"" statements, it seems there might have been an initial misunderstanding. The person eating onion is indeed on the far right.
- Statement 12 indicates the gardener is on the far right, which aligns with the onion eater if we consider gardening as their hobby.


## Step 8: Correcting for specific activities and positions
Given all statements, let's try to fill in the table logically:
1. The train driver (far left) could be associated with a nationality, job, food, movie preference, pet, and hobby that doesn't conflict with other statements.
2. The security-guard's position relative to others (with the american/blueberry eater to their right) helps place some individuals.
3. The scientist (dog owner) being to the right of the blueberry eater gives another clue.


## Step 9: Final analysis
Considering all clues:
- The japanese watches animation movies (8), which could be on the left side given no direct conflict with the far left or right positions.
- The helicopter driver is Spanish (3), but without a direct link to other categories, we place based on remaining options.


Given the complexity and potential for error in step-by-step logical deduction without visual aids or further clarification of conflicting statements, let's simplify to key points that can be directly inferred:
- Train driver on the far left.
- Crime movie watcher/jet-ski driver/pony owner/gardener/onion eater on the far right.
- Specific sequences like the fantasy movie watcher to the left of the cranberry eater, who is to the left of the bartender.

Lv1-7x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person. Let's break it down step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 10
The software-developer is on the far right. This means the 4th column is reserved for the software-developer.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 11
The italian is on the left of the bartender, and the software-developer is on the right of the indonesian. Since the software-developer is in the 4th position, the indonesian must be in the 3rd position.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 7
The police-officer is on the left of the person driving the subway. Given that the british person drives the subway (Clue 5), and considering the arrangement so far, the police-officer could potentially be in the 1st or 2nd position.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 6
The canadian is on the right of the librarian. This clue doesn't specify exact positions yet but indicates a relationship between two nationalities and jobs.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 12
The person driving the bus is on the far left. This places the bus driver in the 1st position, which could potentially be the police-officer from Clue 7, considering they need to be on the left of the subway driver.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 1 and Clue 16
The owner of the lizard is the software-developer, and the owner of the dog is the person watching animation movies. Since the software-developer is in the 4th position, they own the lizard. The dog's owner could be in any other position but must watch animation movies.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 9
The person who's sport is cycling is the person watching disaster movies. Given that the italian watches disaster movies (Clue 14), they must also enjoy cycling.

## Step 8: Combine Information
From Clue 2 and knowing the indonesian is in the 3rd position, and the software-developer is in the 4th, we can start building a table. The italian, being on the left of the bartender and watching disaster movies (which aligns with cycling), helps to place the italian in relation to others.

## Step 9: Finalize Positions
Given all clues:
- The bus driver is on the far left (Clue 12).
- The police-officer is on the left of the subway driver (Clue 7), and since the british drives the subway (Clue 5), this places the police-officer in the 1st or 2nd position. But since the bus driver is on the far left, and considering other clues about nationalities and jobs, we can start making educated guesses.
- The italian watches disaster movies and is on the left of the bartender (Clue 2), and given the software-developer's position (Clue 10) and relation to the indonesian (Clue 11), we can infer more positions.

## Step 10: Detailed Placement
1. Clue 12 places the bus driver in the 1st position.
2. Clue 5 indicates the british person drives the subway, potentially placing them in the 2nd or 3rd position based on other clues.
3. Clue 7 suggests the police-officer is before the subway driver.
4. The italian (disaster movies, cycling) must be before the bartender and after considering all placements, likely in the 2nd position if we account for the police-officer's placement and the need for the british to drive the subway.

Given these steps and clues, let's assemble a possible table:

|               |       1        |     2     |       3       |         4          |
