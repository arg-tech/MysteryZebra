Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 5, we know the person eating lime is on the far left.


|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |  Lime   |         |            |
| Hobby   |         |         |            |
| Pet     |         |         |            |


From clue 1, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime. Since the person eating lime is on the far left, the owner of the pony must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 3, we know the person eating banana is the owner of the pony. Combining this with the previous conclusion, the person eating banana must be in column 2 or 3.


Since there are only three columns, and the person eating lime is already in column 1, the person eating banana (and owning the pony) must be in column 2 or 3. The person eating kale must be in the remaining column.


Let's consider clue 2: the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. This means the person with the guinea-pig cannot be in column 1 (since there is no one to their left), so they must be in column 2 or 3.


From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig. Combining this with the previous conclusion, the person with puzzles as their hobby must be in column 2 or 3.


Now, let's try to piece together the information:


We have three possible combinations for the food:


Lime (1), Banana (2), Kale (3)
Lime (1), Kale (2), Banana (3)


From clue 1, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime. Since the person eating lime is in column 1, the owner of the pony must be in column 2.


Combining this with clue 3, we get:


Lime (1), Banana (2), Kale (3)


Now, let's look at the hobbies and pets:


From clue 2, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. This means the person with camping as their hobby must be in column 1 or 2.


If the person with camping as their hobby is in column 1, then the owner of the guinea-pig would be in column 2, but we already know the person eating banana (and owning the pony) is in column 2. This would mean the person with camping as their hobby is also the person eating lime, and the owner of the guinea-pig is the person eating banana, which contradicts clue 4.


Therefore, the person with camping as their hobby must be in column 2, but we already know the person eating banana (and owning the pony) is in column 2. This means the person with camping as their hobby cannot be the person eating banana, so they must be the person eating kale, which would put them in column 3.


However, this would mean the owner of the guinea-pig is in column 3, and the person with puzzles as their hobby (who owns the guinea-pig) would also be in column 3. The only remaining hobby, reading, would be in column 1 or 2.


Since the person eating lime is in column 1, and we already know the person eating banana (and owning the pony) is in column 2, the person with reading as their hobby must be in column 1.


Now, let's summarize what we have so far:


|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |  Lime   | Banana |  Kale     |
| Hobby   | Reading | Camping|  Puzzles  |
| Pet     |         |        |           |


From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig. This means the person in column 3 (with puzzles as their hobby) owns the guinea-pig.


The only remaining pet is the cat, which must be owned by the person in column 1 (with reading as their hobby).


Now we can fill in the final table:

Lv1-3x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right. This means column 3 is reserved for the hedgehog's owner.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since we don't know the exact positions yet, we'll keep this in mind for later steps.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 3
The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. This clue, combined with clue 2, starts to give us a sequence: Gardening -> Video-Games -> Sports Movies.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 4
The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching family movies. This gives us another piece of the puzzle but doesn't directly fit into our current sequence without knowing more about movie genres and hobbies alignment.

## Step 5: Combine Information
From clue 3, we have Gardening -> Video-Games. Clue 2 then adds Sports Movies after Video-Games. Since the hedgehog owner is on the far right (clue 1), and considering the sequence from clues 2 and 3, it seems likely that the video-games hobbyist could be in column 2, as this allows for a person watching sports movies to be to their right, which would have to be in column 3. However, we must also consider clue 4, which involves family movies and the dog's owner.

## Step 6: Further Deduction
Given that the hedgehog is on the far right (column 3), and considering our sequence (Gardening -> Video-Games -> Sports Movies), if video-games are in column 2, then sports movies must be associated with the hedgehog owner in column 3. The only hobby left for column 1 is gardening.

## Step 7: Finalize Hobbies
So, we have Gardening in column 1, Video-Games in column 2, and by default, Card-Games in column 3 (as it's the only remaining hobby).

## Step 8: Place Movie Genres
With video-games in column 2 and sports movies needing to be to the right of video-games, sports movies must indeed be in column 3. Given that family movies' viewer is to the left of the dog owner (clue 4), and since the hedgehog (column 3) can't be the dog, family movies likely fit into either column 1 or 2. However, since action hasn't been mentioned yet and sports is in column 3, we need to figure out where action fits.

## Step 9: Place Pets
The hedgehog owner is in column 3. The dog's owner is on the right of the person watching family movies (clue 4), which means if family movies are in column 1, the dog would have to be in column 2 or 3. Given that sports movies are likely with the hedgehog (column 3) based on previous deductions, and considering all other placements, we must carefully align pets with hobbies and movie genres.

## Step 10: Finalize All Categories
Given all clues:
- Gardening is in column 1.
- Video-Games are in column 2.
- Card-Games must be in column 3 (by elimination).
- Sports Movies are in column 3, as they follow video-games.
- Family Movies then likely fit into column 1, given the dog's owner must be to their right.
- Action Movies, by elimination, would go with Video-Games in column 2, since sports is taken by column 3 and family likely fits column 1 based on clue 4 about the dog.
- The Hedgehog is in column 3.
- The Dog, being on the right of Family Movies (which we've placed in column 1), would go into column 2, but since column 2's hobby is video-games and action movies, this aligns with having a pet there as well.
- The Hamster, by elimination, goes to column 1, as it's the only pet left without a home.

The final answer is: 
#############

Lv1-3x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the dubstep fan and the airplane user.
From clue 2, we know the fan of dubstep is on the far left. From clue 3, we also know that the person driving the airplane is on the far left. This means the person who likes dubstep must also be the one using the airplane.


## Step 2: Identify the music genre and transport for each position.
Given the above, the far left (position 1) is dubstep and airplane. Now we need to figure out the other positions based on the remaining clues.


## Step 3: Apply clue 1 to determine relative positions of funk and ice-hockey.
Clue 1 states that the fan of funk is to the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. This doesn't give us exact positions yet, but it tells us the order for two of the music genres and sports.


## Step 4: Apply clue 5 to identify the transport used by the ice-hockey player.
Clue 5 says the person who plays ice-hockey uses a trike. Combining this with clue 1, we know funk is to the left of ice-hockey (and thus trike), but we still need to place them in the table.


## Step 5: Apply clue 4 to determine the position of cycling and its relation to trike.
Clue 4 states that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who cycles. Since ice-hockey corresponds with trike (from clue 5), this means cycling cannot be in the far left or far right positions because it needs to be to the left of trike, and we've established that dubstep/airplane is on the far left.


## Step 6: Piece together all information.
- Dubstep/Airplane is on the far left (position 1).
- Cycling must be in position 2 because it has to be to the left of ice-hockey/trike, and funk must be between dubstep and ice-hockey based on clue 1. Thus, funk cannot be in position 1 or 3 if we are to satisfy all conditions.
- Ice-hockey/Trike is on the far right (position 3) because it's to the right of cycling.


## Step 7: Finalize positions for music genres and transport.
Given the constraints:
- Position 1: Dubstep/Airplane
- Position 2 must have funk (to satisfy being to the left of ice-hockey), but we also know from elimination that cycling goes here since it's between dubstep/airplane and ice-hockey/trike, making funk/cycling for position 2. However, considering transport, skateboard is the only one left and must go with funk or cycling. Since airplane and trike are taken by dubstep and ice-hockey respectively, and we've determined the order of sports and music genres relative to each other, we deduce that:
- Funk goes with cycling (because it has to be to the left of ice-hockey), leaving gospel for ice-hockey (but since we know ice-hockey is with trike, this doesn't directly tell us the transport for funk/cycling or gospel/ice-hockey beyond what's already determined).
- Thus, by elimination and fitting clues together:
- Position 1: Dubstep/Airplane
- Position 2: Funk/Cycling/Skateboard (since skateboard is the only transport left and cycling fits here based on clue 4)
- Position 3: Gospel/Ice-hockey/Trike


The final answer is:

Lv1-3x3-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person drinking milk is to the left of the person whose hobby is puzzles. This means the puzzle enthusiast cannot be in position 1 because there would be no one to the left of them for the milk drinker to be.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person whose hobby is fishing is in the middle, which places them in position 2. This clue directly tells us where one of the hobbies is located.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person drinking 7up is to the left of the dancer. Since we don't know where the dancer is yet, this clue will have to be combined with others for more information.


## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 4
The person drinking milk is to the right of the paramedic. This means the paramedic cannot be in position 3 because there would be no one to the right of them for the milk drinker to be.


## Step 5: Combining Clues
From Clue 2, we know the fishing hobbyist is in the middle (position 2). From Clue 1, since the milk drinker must be to the left of the puzzle enthusiast, and considering Clue 4 where the paramedic must be to the left of the milk drinker, it suggests a possible order for some elements but doesn't directly place them without considering the other clues.


## Step 6: Placing the Paramedic and Milk Drinker
Given that the paramedic must be to the left of the milk drinker (Clue 4) and knowing the fishing enthusiast is in the middle, if we try to place the paramedic in position 1, it would allow for the milk drinker to potentially be in a position that satisfies other clues as well.


## Step 7: Considering Clue 3 with Previous Information
The 7up drinker being to the left of the dancer means if the dancer were in position 3, the 7up drinker could only be in position 1 or 2. However, since we've established the fishing enthusiast is in position 2, and considering other placements, this clue helps us determine possible beverage and job combinations.


## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Let's start placing based on clues:
- Paramedic (Job) could be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of the milk drinker.
- Fishing enthusiast is in position 2 (from Clue 2).
- Given that the person drinking milk must be to the left of the puzzle enthusiast and to the right of the paramedic, if we place the paramedic in position 1, the milk drinker could potentially be in position 2 or 3. However, since fishing is in position 2, and considering other clues, this forces specific arrangements.
- The dancer, being to the right of the 7up drinker (Clue 3), helps us place jobs relative to beverages.


## Step 9: Detailed Placement
1. If the paramedic is in position 1, drinking one of the beverages, it must be either 7up or juice because milk's placement is dependent on being to the right of the paramedic and left of puzzles.
2. Given that fishing is in the middle (position 2), this person could drink either 7up or milk, but since the milk drinker has to be to the left of puzzles and to the right of the paramedic, it creates a challenge for direct placement without considering all combinations.
3. The puzzle enthusiast cannot be in position 1 because the milk drinker must be to their left (Clue 1), suggesting they are likely in position 3.


## Step 10: Final Placement Attempt
Considering all clues:
- Paramedic in position 1, drinking 7up (to satisfy being to the left of the milk drinker and allowing for the dancer to be after the 7up drinker).
- Fishing enthusiast in position 2, which means they could potentially drink juice or milk. However, since the milk drinker is to the right of the paramedic and must also be to the left of puzzles, this creates a conflict unless the fishing enthusiast drinks juice.
- This leaves position 3 for the puzzle enthusiast, who must drink milk (as it's the only beverage left that fits all conditions), and thus, the dancer can be in position 2 or 3 based on job requirements. However, since the paramedic is already placed with 7up, and fishing (thus potentially a different beverage) is in the middle, we adjust to fit the clues perfectly.


## Step 11: Adjusting for Clue Accuracy
Given that the milk drinker must be to the right of the paramedic and the left of the puzzle enthusiast, and considering all other placements:
- Paramedic drinks 7up (position 1).
- The middle person (fishing) could drink juice (as it's a remaining option that hasn't been directly ruled out by beverage clues yet).
- This would leave milk for position 3, which aligns with being to the right of the paramedic but requires adjustment to fit all hobby and job placements correctly.


## Step 12: Correcting Misalignments
Revisiting Clue 3 (7up drinker to the left of the dancer) and considering previous steps:
- If the paramedic (drinking 7up) is in position 1, the dancer must be in a position after them, which could only be position 2 or 3. However, since fishing is in position 2, the dancer cannot be there based on hobby placement.
- Thus, the dancer must be in position 3, but this conflicts with our need to place the puzzle enthusiast and milk drinker according to Clue 1.


## Step 13: Finalizing Correct Placements
Given all clues:
- Paramedic (drinking 7up) is in position 1.
- Fishing enthusiast is in position 2. Given the constraints, this person must drink juice to satisfy beverage distribution without conflicting with other clues.
- The dancer cannot be in position 2 due to fishing being there, so if the paramedic is in position 1 drinking 7up, and considering all other clues, we need to adjust our understanding of job and hobby placements while maintaining adherence to the clues.


## Step 14: Final Adjustment for Accuracy
Considering the direct information:
- The person who likes puzzles must be in position 3 because the milk drinker is to their left (Clue 1), and given other constraints, this places the puzzle enthusiast.
- With the paramedic in position 1 drinking 7up (to satisfy Clue 3 and being to the left of the dancer), and knowing the fishing enthusiast is in position 2:
- The dancer must then be after the 7up drinker but cannot be in position 2 due to the fishing hobbyist. This suggests a potential misstep in previous logic regarding direct placements based on clues.


## Step 15: Correct Final Placement
Given all considerations and correcting for logical flow and clue adherence:
1. Paramedic (Job) in position 1, drinking 7up.
2. Fishing enthusiast (Hobby) in position 2, which means they could drink either of the remaining beverages not taken by the paramedic. Given the constraints, they must drink juice to fit all conditions without conflict.
3. Puzzles enthusiast (Hobby) in position 3, with the milk beverage, as it fits being to the right of the paramedic and having the dancer after the 7up drinker.


The final answer is:

Lv1-3x3-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The fan of jazz is on the far left.
2. The fan of d&b is the owner of the dog.
3. The fan of d&b is on the far right.
4. The person eating papaya is in the middle.
5. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person eating cabbage.

From point 1, we know the first column's music genre is jazz.

From points 2 and 3, we understand that d&b is associated with the dog and is on the far right, so the third column's music genre is d&b.

Given that the fan of jazz (point 1) is on the far left and the fan of d&b (point 3) is on the far right, the middle column must be metal, as it's the only genre left.

So, we have:
- Column 1: Jazz
- Column 2: Metal
- Column 3: D&B

From point 4, we know papaya is in the middle. 

From point 5, since the lizard's owner is to the right of the cabbage eater, and considering the d&b fan (who owns a dog) is on the far right, the lizard cannot be on the far right. Thus, the cabbage must be on the left or in the middle, but because papaya is in the middle, cabbage must be on the left.

Given this, peas must be on the right since papaya is in the middle and cabbage is on the left.

So, we have:
- Column 1 (Jazz): Cabbage
- Column 2 (Metal): Papaya
- Column 3 (D&B): Peas

Now, let's place the pets. We know from point 2 that d&b is associated with the dog, so the dog is on the far right.

From point 5, since the lizard's owner is to the right of the cabbage eater and we've established the cabbage eater is on the left (jazz), the lizard must be in the middle because it has to be to the right of the cabbage eater but not on the far right where the dog is.

This leaves the hedgehog for the jazz fan on the far left, as the other pets have been accounted for.

So, we have:
- Column 1 (Jazz): Cabbage, Hedgehog
- Column 2 (Metal): Papaya, Lizard
- Column 3 (D&B): Peas, Dog

Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv1-3x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The person driving the taxi is the entrepreneur.
2. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing.
3. The person who's sport is water-polo is in the middle.
4. The photographer is on the right of the person driving the car.

From clue 3, we know the middle column (column 2) is for water-polo. 

Using clue 1, since the taxi driver is an entrepreneur and considering the constraints, the taxi can't be in the middle because then the entrepreneur would be associated with water-polo, which doesn't give us enough information to solve the puzzle without more specific connections. Thus, the taxi (and hence the entrepreneur) must be either on the left or the right.

Clue 2 tells us that sailing is to the left of the skateboard. Since the skateboard cannot be in the middle (because water-polo is there), and it has to be to the right of sailing, this means sailing must be in column 1, and the skateboard must be in column 3.

Given clue 4, the photographer is to the right of the car driver. This implies the car cannot be in column 3 because then the photographer would have no one to their right to fulfill the ""on the right"" condition unless the photographer is also in column 3, which contradicts other placements based on previous clues.

So, we can deduce:
- Column 1 (sailing) must have a job that isn't the entrepreneur (since the entrepreneur drives a taxi and could be on either end but not necessarily tied directly to sailing without further information).
- Column 2 is water-polo.
- Column 3 has the skateboard.

Considering all clues together:
- If the photographer is in column 3, then the car must be in column 1 or 2. But since column 2 is taken by water-polo and its associated transport can't be the car (because the photographer needs to be on the right of the car), this implies that sailing (column 1) could be associated with the car.
- Given that the taxi driver is an entrepreneur, and if we consider column 3 for the skateboard and thus possibly the photographer, the taxi must then be in column 1 or associated indirectly through job/sport transport connections.

However, let's correctly place based on direct clues:
- Water-polo is in the middle (column 2).
- The skateboard is on the right of sailing (thus, sailing in column 1 and skateboard in column 3).
- The taxi driver is an entrepreneur, and given the arrangement, if the taxi were in column 1, it would conflict with other conditions unless carefully placed. But since we know sailing is in column 1 and the skateboard (and thus not the taxi) is in column 3, this means the car must be associated with sailing to allow the photographer to be on the right of the car driver.

Direct placements:
- Column 1: Sailing (sport), Doctor (job, by process of elimination since entrepreneur can't be here due to taxi placement and photographer needs to be on the right of someone), Car (transport, because it allows the photographer to be on their right).
- Column 2: Water-polo (sport), Entrepreneur (job, associated with taxi but placed here due to logical deductions about job distribution), Taxi (transport, fits with entrepreneur clue).
- Column 3: Weightlifting (sport, by elimination), Photographer (job, on the right of car driver as per clue), Skateboard (transport).

The final solution table is:

Lv1-3x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
2. The person driving the bus is on the right of the Mexican.
3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the Spanish.
4. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person driving the van.
5. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the Mexican.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the right of the Mexican. This means the Mexican must be in column 1, and the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the Spanish. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is already determined to be in column 2 or 3, the Spanish must be in column 3.

Now, let's combine this information with clue 1: The American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. If the American were in column 3, there would be no room for the person who's sport is surfing to their left. Therefore, the American cannot be in column 3, and must be in either column 1 or 2.

However, we've already established that the Mexican is in column 1, so the American must be in column 2 or 3. But if the American were in column 2, they would not be to the right of the person who's sport is surfing (since the person who's sport is weightlifting is already in column 2). Therefore, the person who's sport is surfing must be in column 1, and the American must be in column 3.

We now have:

| Transport     |         |               |          |

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person driving the van. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is in column 2, the person driving the van must be in column 3.

However, from clue 2, we know the person driving the bus is on the right of the Mexican. This means the person driving the bus must be in either column 2 or 3. But if they were in column 3, they would not be to the right of the Mexican (since the American is already in column 3). Therefore, the person driving the bus must be in column 2.

We now have:

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |
| Nationality   | Mexican |               | American |

| Transport     |         | Bus           |          |

The only sport left for the American is baseball, and the only transport left for the Mexican is scooter. The Spanish must be in column 2 (since the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the Spanish), and the only transport left for the American is van.

We now have:

Lv1-3x3-8	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:


From clue 3, we know the person eating cauliflower is watching satire movies.


From clue 2, we know the person eating potato is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the person eating cauliflower is watching satire movies, the person eating potato must be on the left of the person eating cauliflower.


From clue 1, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.


From clue 4, we know the person watching satire movies (who is eating cauliflower) is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing.


From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person eating watermelon.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |    1     |      2       |     3      |
| Food          | potato  | cauliflower | watermelon|
| Movie-Genre   | disaster| satire      | thriller  |
| Sport         | snowboarding | skiing | tennis    |


The final solution is:

Lv1-3x3-9	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The Australian is the person driving the helicopter.
2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
3. The person who's sport is sailing is in the middle.
4. The British is on the left of the Australian.
5. The Australian is on the left of the person driving the train.

From clue 4, we know the order of the nationalities is: British, Australian, ? (since the British is on the left of the Australian).

From clue 1, we know the Australian drives a helicopter. From clue 5, we know the Australian is on the left of the person driving the train. So, the order of transport is: ?, Helicopter, Train.

Since the Australian drives a helicopter and is in the middle (clue 3 implies the sailing person is in the middle, but we don't know the nationality yet), we can combine this information with clue 4 to get:

British, Australian (Helicopter), Russian

Now, let's fill in the sports. From clue 2, we know the sailing person is on the right of the lacrosse person. Since the sailing person is in the middle (clue 3), the order of sports must be: Lacrosse, Sailing, ?.

The only sport left is Basketball, which must be on the right. So, the final table is:

#############
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Nationality   | British  | Australian | Russian    |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Sailing    | Basketball |
| Transport     | Trike    | Helicopter | Train      |

Lv1-3x3-10	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.


From statement 2, we know the owner of the rat is in the middle.


From statement 4, we know the person drinking coffee is in the middle.


So, the person drinking coffee must also be the owner of the rat.


From statement 1, we know the owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the owner of the rat is in the middle, the person who's sport is soccer must be on the left.


From statement 5, we know the owner of the goat is the person drinking 7up.


Now, let's try to fill in the table:


|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    | coffee  |         |
| Pet        | goat   | rat     |         |
| Sport      | soccer |         |         |


From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the owner of the snake.


So, the owner of the snake must be in the middle or on the left. But the middle position is already taken by the rat, and the left position is taken by the goat. Therefore, the snake must be on the right, and lacrosse must be on the right as well.


Now we have:


|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    | coffee  |         |
| Pet        | goat   | rat     | snake   |
| Sport      | soccer |         | lacrosse|


The only sport left is cricket, which must be in the middle.


The only beverage left is sprite, which must be on the right.


Now we have:


|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    | coffee  | sprite  |
| Pet        | goat   | rat     | snake   |
| Sport      | soccer | cricket | lacrosse|


#############
|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   | 7up    | coffee  | sprite  |
