Lv1-7x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1 and Clue 2
From Clue 1, the person drinking cola is on the far right.
From Clue 2, the mechanic is also on the far right.
This means the person on the far right drinks cola and is a mechanic.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The person watching western movies is on the far left.
So, we can fill in the movie genre for the leftmost person as western.

## Step 3: Use Clue 4
The owner of the frog is the Pakistani.
This clue doesn't give us a direct position yet but tells us about the nationality and pet connection.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
Since we know from Clue 5 that the western movie fan is on the far left, and given the arrangement must allow for the subway driver to be to the left of the sudoku enthusiast, it implies the sudoku enthusiast cannot be on the far left. Thus, the subway driver must be on the far left because there's no one to the left of the far left position.

## Step 5: Combine Information
From Clue 6, the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the subway.
Given the subway driver is on the far left (from Step 4), the turtle owner must be in the second position (since it's to the right of the subway driver).

## Step 6: Fill in Nationality and Pet
From Clue 4, the frog owner is Pakistani. Since the turtle owner is in the second position (from Step 5), and we have two nationalities, the person on the far left (subway driver) must be Indonesian to satisfy the condition that there are only two nationalities.

## Step 7: Determine Hobby
Given the subway driver (Indonesian) is on the far left and watches western movies (from Clue 5), and knowing the mechanic (who drinks cola, from Clues 1 and 2) is on the far right, we can deduce hobbies. The person who likes puzzles must be paired with either the subway driver or the mechanic since there are only two hobbies. Since sudoku's position relative to the subway is defined (with sudoku being after subway), and considering the mechanic's fixed position, it makes sense that the puzzle enthusiast could be on the far right (mechanic), which would mean the sudoku enthusiast must then be in the middle.

## Step 8: Finalize Movie-Genre for Far Right
The mechanic on the far right cannot watch westerns because that's the far left person's preference. Thus, the mechanic watches superhero movies.

## Step 9: Fill in Remaining Gaps
Given the turtle owner is in the second position (to the right of the subway driver) and must be Pakistani (since the Indonesian is on the far left), this means the Pakistani owns a turtle and does sudoku, as that's the only hobby left for this position.

## Step 10: Finalize Beverage for Far Left
Since cola is on the far right with the mechanic, fanta must be the beverage of choice for the person on the far left.

The final answer is:

Lv1-7x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down each clue step by step:


1. The teacher is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
2. The owner of the mouse is the person driving the van.
3. The person driving the tram is on the left of the fan of indie.
4. The German is on the far right.
5. The person drinking almond-milk is the owner of the lizard.

From clue 4, we know the German is on the far right, which means the Australian must be on the left.


Clue 1 tells us the teacher is to the right of the person whose hobby is drawing. This doesn't tell us their positions directly but gives a relative position.


Clue 2 says the mouse owner drives the van. Since there are only two means of transport, this implies the other pet owner (lizard) uses the tram (from clue 5, we know this person drinks almond-milk).


Clue 3 places the tram driver to the left of the indie fan. Given that the tram is one of the transports and from clue 2, we can start piecing together positions.


From clue 5, the almond-milk drinker owns a lizard and thus drives the tram (since the mouse owner drives the van). This person must be on the left because they are to the left of the indie fan (clue 3).


Now, combining all clues:


- The Australian is on the left (opposite of the German's position from clue 4).
- The almond-milk drinker owns a lizard and drives the tram, placing them on the left.
- This person is also to the left of the indie fan (clue 3), which means the indie fan cannot be on the far left but must be on the right since the tram driver (almond-milk drinker) is to their left.


Given these points:


|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk   | iced-tea |
| Hobby         | drawing       | dancing  |
| Job           | police-officer| teacher  |
| Music-Genre   | r&b           | indie    |
| Nationality   | australian    | german   |
| Pet           | lizard        | mouse    |
| Transport     | tram          | van      |

Explanation:
- The leftmost person drinks almond-milk, has a lizard as a pet, drives a tram (from clue 5 and the process of elimination), and must have a hobby that fits. Since drawing is the only hobby left that can fit without contradicting other clues, they likely enjoy drawing.
- The teacher is to the right of the drawer (clue 1), placing them on the right side.
- The mouse owner drives the van (clue 2), which must be the person on the right because the tram is already assigned to the left.
- The indie fan is on the right (because the tram driver, who drinks almond-milk and owns a lizard, is to their left), and since the German is also on the far right (clue 4), this aligns with having the indie fan as the German.
- The person drinking iced-tea must be the teacher (as it's the only job left for them) and enjoys dancing (the remaining hobby) and prefers r&b music (since indie is taken by the German).

The final solution table, given all considerations and clues provided, looks like this:

Lv1-7x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given in the clues and apply them step by step to the table.


1. The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.
2. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. The person eating eggplant is on the right of the person driving the bus.
4. The dancer is on the right of the person driving the bus.

Given these clues, let's start by placing information that can be directly inferred:


- From clue 1, we know the pony owner and the rowing sport preference cannot be in the same column, with the pony owner being to the right.
- Clue 2 tells us milk and martial-arts also cannot be in the same column, with milk to the right.
- Clue 3 indicates eggplant and bus are not in the same column, with eggplant to the right.
- Clue 4 places dancer to the right of bus.

Let's start filling in based on these clues:


Since the dancer is to the right of the bus (clue 4), and we know from clue 3 that eggplant is also to the right of the bus, it suggests the bus must be associated with column 1 because both dancer and eggplant have to be in column 2 according to their respective clues.


Given:
- Bus in column 1.
- Dancer in column 2 (because it's to the right of bus).
- Eggplant also in column 2 (because it's to the right of bus).

Now, let's consider rowing and pony. Since the pony owner is to the right of the person whose sport is rowing, rowing must be associated with column 1, and pony with column 2.


Given:
- Rowing in column 1.
- Pony in column 2.

The only sport left for column 2 is water-polo, which fits because we've already placed rowing in column 1.


For transport, since bus is in column 1, skateboard must be in column 2.


Now, let's consider jobs:
- Dancer is already in column 2.
- This leaves journalist for column 1.

For food:
- Eggplant is in column 2.
- Strawberry must then be in column 1.

For beverages:
- Milk is to the right of martial-arts (clue 2), so martial-arts must be with strawberry and bus in column 1, which places milk in column 2.
- This leaves 7up for column 1.

Lastly, movie-genre:
- Martial-arts is in column 1 (with rowing, bus, journalist, 7up, and strawberry).
- Spy movies then must be in column 2 (with pony, dancer, skateboard, milk, eggplant, and water-polo).


Let's summarize the findings:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | 7up          | milk       |

Lv1-7x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step and fill in the information accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 3
The Argentine is the person watching documentary movies. This gives us a direct correlation between nationality and movie genre for one of the individuals.

## Step 2: Apply Statement 1
The Argentine is on the left of the owner of the fish. Since we know from Statement 3 that the Argentine watches documentaries, this means the person who owns the fish must watch satire (the only other movie genre), and they are positioned to the right of the Argentine.

## Step 3: Apply Statement 2
The person whose hobby is hiking is on the right of the person watching documentary movies. Given the Argentine watches documentaries (from Statement 3), this means the hiker must be to the right of the Argentine, which aligns with the arrangement we have so far (Argentine on the left, followed by someone whose details are yet to be fully determined but includes a fish owner who likes satire).

## Step 4: Apply Statement 5
The person whose sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the train. This statement doesn't directly relate to our current arrangement but tells us about the sport and transport correlations.

## Step 5: Analyze Remaining Statements for Job and Hobby Correlations
From Statement 4, the doctor is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games. Given that we have hiking as a hobby correlated with someone who watches satire (from our deductions following Statement 2), this implies the doctor cannot be the hiker (since their hobby is not card-games) and thus must correlate with either rowing or sailing in terms of sport, depending on further deductions.

## Step 6: Finalize Correlations
Given all statements:
- The Argentine watches documentaries and is on the left.
- The person who owns fish watches satire and is to the right of the Argentine.
- The hiker is to the right of the documentary watcher (thus, must watch satire).
- The doctor is to the right of the card-game player.

Since we know the Argentine's movie preference but not their job or hobby directly from these statements, let's assign based on what we can deduce:
- If the Argentine watches documentaries and is on the left, and considering Statement 2 (hiker to the right of documentary watcher), this implies the hiker cannot be the Argentine.
- The doctor being on the right of the card-game player means if the Argentine were a doctor, they'd have to be a card-game player to fit all criteria given the placement rules.

## Step 7: Piece Together Remaining Information
Considering all placements and correlations:
- Nationality: Argentine (left), Colombian (right).
- Movie Genre: Documentary (Argentine), Satire (Colombian).
- Given Statement 2 and our deductions, the hiker must watch satire.
- Since the doctor is on the right of the card-game player, and considering the need to balance jobs, hobbies, sports, and transport:
- The Argentine can be a nurse who likes card-games and watches documentaries. This fits with being on the left and allows for the Colombian (on the right) to have contrasting preferences.
- Sport and Transport: Since sailing is to the left of train driving (Statement 5), and knowing the Argentine's placement, we deduce the Argentine prefers sailing (to fit the sport correlation without conflicting other statements).

Given these deductions and ensuring all criteria are met:
- The Argentine nurse likes card-games, watches documentaries, prefers sailing, and uses the tram (since the train is mentioned to be used by someone else).
- The Colombian doctor likes hiking, watches satire, prefers rowing, and uses the train.

The final answer is:

Lv1-7x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 2 and Clue 4
From clue 2, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the far left. From clue 4, we understand that the fan of metal music is also on the far left. This means the person on the far left watches time-travel movies and listens to metal music.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
Clue 5 tells us the person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right. This gives us a fixed position for one of the hobbies.


## Step 3: Use Clue 1
The Spanish person is on the right of the firefighter (clue 1). Since we don't know the exact positions yet, we note that the firefighter cannot be on the far right because there needs to be space for the Spanish person to their right.


## Step 4: Apply Clue 3
The person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the fish. This clue gives us a relationship but doesn't specify sides yet, except that it implies the fish owner and trike driver are not on the far left or far right based on other clues.


## Step 5: Combine Information
Given the fan of metal and the time-travel movie watcher is on the far left (from step 1), and knowing the hiking enthusiast is on the far right (from step 2), we start building the table. The firefighter and engineer jobs, along with the Spanish and Polish nationalities, need to be placed according to clue 1 and other constraints.


## Step 6: Place Nationality and Job
Since the Spanish person is to the right of the firefighter (clue 1) and the hiking enthusiast (thus likely not the firefighter) is on the far right, we can infer that the firefighter might be in the first column if considering the placement of nationalities and jobs. However, given the constraints about music, movies, and hobbies, we need to ensure all clues fit.


## Step 7: Finalize Positions
- The metal fan and time-travel movie enthusiast is on the far left (column 1).
- Given clue 3 and other constraints, the fish owner must be in column 1 because the trike driver needs to be to their right, and there's no room for this arrangement if they were in column 2.
- The firefighter cannot be on the far right; thus, the engineer is likely on the far left or right based on job placement clues.
- Since the Spanish person is on the right of the firefighter, and considering other placements, we deduce positions.


## Step 8: Complete Table
Given all clues:
- Column 1 (far left): Metal fan, time-travel movies, engineer (because the firefighter needs to be next to the Spanish person), fish owner.
- Column 2 (far right): Hiking enthusiast. This must include the firefighter and Spanish nationality based on clue 1.

Lv1-7x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the arrangement of characteristics for each person.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 3 and Clue 4
From Clue 3, the person eating pomegranate is on the far left. From Clue 4, the person whose hobby is puzzles is also on the far left. This means the person on the far left enjoys puzzles as a hobby and eats pomegranate.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 5
The person driving the scooter is the mechanic. This clue directly associates a job with a mode of transport but does not specify the position yet.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The mechanic is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since we know from Clue 5 that the mechanic drives a scooter, this means the guinea-pig's owner must be to the left of the mechanic.


## Step 4: Combine Information
From Steps 1 and 3, we have the person on the far left eating pomegranate and enjoying puzzles. This person cannot be the mechanic (since the mechanic is to the right of the guinea-pig owner), so this person must own the guinea-pig because the guinea-pig owner has to be on the left of the mechanic.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1
The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. This clue does not directly tell us positions but gives a relative arrangement that will help in finalizing the table.


## Step 6: Piece Together Remaining Information
Given that the mechanic drives a scooter (Clue 5) and is to the right of the guinea-pig owner (Clue 2), and knowing the person on the far left enjoys puzzles, eats pomegranate, and owns a guinea-pig, we can start filling in the table.


## Step 7: Finalize Table
Let's assign:
- Far Left: Pomegranate, Puzzles, Guinea-Pig (and by deduction from other clues, this person watches satire because the thriller watcher is to the left of the skateboarding sport preferer).
- Since the mechanic is on the right of the guinea-pig owner and drives a scooter, the right side must have: Garlic, Video-Games, Hedgehog, Skateboarding (as a sport), Thriller (movie genre), Entrepreneur (job), Motorbike (transport) doesn't fit here because the mechanic drives a scooter. Thus, we adjust to fit all clues.


Given the constraints and applying each clue carefully:


The far left person has pomegranate, puzzles, and a guinea-pig. The right person must have garlic, video-games, and a hedgehog (since there are only two options for each category). The mechanic is on the right of the guinea-pig owner and drives a scooter, which means the entrepreneur must be associated with the other transport method (motorbike) and cannot be the mechanic. Skateboarding is to the right of thriller movies, so the person who watches thrillers cannot be on the far right.


Therefore, considering all clues:

Lv1-7x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 4
The fan of hip-hop is on the far left. This means the music genre for person 1 is hip-hop.

## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 1 and Clue 2
The Indian is on the left of the person drinking cola and on the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing. Since the hip-hop fan is already placed on the far left, this implies the Indian must also be on the left side because they are to the left of both cola drinker and rock-climber.

## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 6
The French is the person watching comedy movies. This clue alone doesn't give us a specific position but tells us about the nationality and movie preference connection.

## Step 4: Analyzing Clue 5
The scientist is on the right of the pilot. This gives us a job order but not the exact positions yet.

## Step 5: Analyzing Clue 3
The person eating broccoli is on the far right. This clue tells us about food preference and position.

## Step 6: Combining All Information
From Clue 4, we know the hip-hop fan is on the left.
From Clues 1 and 2, since the Indian is to the left of both cola drinker and rock-climber, and considering the hip-hop fan's placement, it suggests the Indian could be the hip-hop fan or at least on the left side.
Clue 6 tells us the French person likes comedy movies but doesn't specify their position directly.
Clue 5 indicates the scientist is to the right of the pilot, suggesting a possible job arrangement.
Clue 3 places the broccoli eater on the far right.

Given these clues:
- The hip-hop fan is on the left (Clue 4).
- Assuming the Indian is also the hip-hop fan based on Clues 1 and 2 for simplicity, as there's no direct conflict given the information.
- The French person watches comedy movies (Clue 6), which could place them on the right since the Indian is likely on the left.
- The scientist is to the right of the pilot (Clue 5).
- Broccoli eater is on the far right (Clue 3).

## Step 7: Placing Nationality and Beverages
Since the Indian is on the left of the cola drinker, if we assume the Indian drinks coffee (to satisfy the two different beverages condition), this fits with Clue 1.

## Step 8: Finalizing Positions
Let's try to fit all pieces together:
- The hip-hop fan is on the far left, which could be the Indian.
- If the Indian likes coffee and is on the left, the cola drinker must be on the right.
- Given the French person watches comedy movies and considering positions, they might not be on the far left (since that's hip-hop), possibly aligning with being on the right or associated with the remaining preferences.
- The scientist to the right of the pilot helps in job placement.
- Broccoli eater on the far right gives us a clear food placement.

## Step 9: Final Placement Attempt
Given all clues, let's place:
- Indian (hip-hop, coffee) on the left.
- French (comedy, possibly cola since it contrasts with the Indian's coffee) on the right.
- Pilot and scientist jobs can be aligned with these nationalities or preferences, considering the scientist is to the right of the pilot.
- Rock-climbing as a hobby for one, board-games for the other, fitting around the placements.

The final answer is:

Lv1-7x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Statement 1
The person whose sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the trike. This means sailing cannot be on the right side (column 2) if the trike is also on the right, but since there are only two options for transport and one must be on each side, it implies that sailing is on the left (column 1), and thus, the trike must be in column 2.


## Step 2: Analyze Statement 2
The fan of country music is on the far right. This directly places country music in column 2.


## Step 3: Analyze Statement 3
The owner of the goat is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means sudoku cannot be in column 2, placing it in column 1, and thus, the goat must be in column 2.


## Step 4: Analyze Statement 4
The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching romance movies. Since we don't know the exact positions of these yet except that romance cannot be in column 1 (because adventure is there according to statement 5), this implies lemonade must be in column 1, and romance must be in column 2.


## Step 5: Analyze Statement 5
The person watching adventure movies is on the far left. This directly places adventure movies in column 1.


Given these analyses:


- Column 1 (left): Adventure movies, sailing, lemonade, sudoku.
- Column 2 (right): Romance movies, trike, country music, goat.

We can start filling in the table with this information and deduce the remaining options by process of elimination.


|               |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Mirinda   |

| Movie-Genre   | Adventure| Romance  |

| Pet           | Rabbit   | Goat     |
| Sport         | Sailing  | Biathlon |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Trike    |

The final answer is:

|               |     1     |     2     |

Lv1-7x2-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The owner of the horse is on the right of the person who's sport is golf.
2. The owner of the horse is the person eating strawberry.
3. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the bike.
4. The fan of disco is on the right of the person watching family movies.


From clue 2, we know the horse owner eats strawberry. Combining this with clue 1, we can start forming a relationship between the columns:


- Column 1 (left): Golf
- Column 2 (right): Horse, Strawberry


Clue 3 tells us that lemonade is on the left of bike. Since the person drinking lemonade must be on the left and we've already established golf is on the left, lemonade cannot be associated with golf directly without more information.


Clue 4 indicates disco is to the right of family movies, but without knowing which column family movies are in, we can't place it yet.


Let's start filling in what we know for sure:


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      |          |            |
| Food          |          | Strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     |            |
| Transport     |          |            |


Given the pet and food for column 2, we can infer from clue 1 that golf must be in column 1. Since strawberry is in column 2 and is associated with the horse, kale must be in column 1.


For transport: since lemonade is to the left of bike (clue 3), and assuming each category has a unique match for each person, we can place bike in column 2 because lemonade would then be in column 1.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade|            |
| Food          | Kale    | Strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     |            |
| Transport     |          | Bike      |


Now, to fill in the blanks for movie-genre and music-genre:


- Since disco is to the right of family movies (clue 4), and considering we have one spot left on the right that matches with bike and strawberry (which are already placed), family movies must be on the left, making animation go on the right.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade|            |
| Food          | Kale    | Strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | Family  | Animation |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Pet           |          | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     |            |
| Transport     |          | Bike      |


For music-genre, given that disco is on the right of family movies (and thus must be in column 2), soul would go in column 1.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade|            |
| Food          | Kale    | Strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | Family  | Animation |
| Music-Genre   | Soul    | Disco     |
| Pet           |          | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     |            |
| Transport     |          | Bike      |


Lastly, the only pet left for column 1 is ferret, and since skiing is the only sport left, it goes in column 2. For beverages, 7up must go in column 2 as lemonade is already placed.


|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade| 7up        |
| Food          | Kale    | Strawberry|
| Movie-Genre   | Family  | Animation |
| Music-Genre   | Soul    | Disco     |
| Pet           | Ferret  | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     | Skiing    |
| Transport     | Ship    | Bike      |


The ship is placed in column 1 because it's the only transport option left, and we've determined bike must be in column 2 based on earlier clues.


Therefore, the final solution table, surrounded by '#############', is:


#############
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade| 7up        |

| Movie-Genre   | Family  | Animation |
| Music-Genre   | Soul    | Disco     |
| Pet           | Ferret  | Horse     |
| Sport         | Golf     | Skiing    |
| Transport     | Ship    | Bike      |

Lv1-7x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


## Step 1: Place the videographer on the far left
Given clue 1, we start with the videographer on the left. The table now looks like this:

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |               |            |
| Food          |               |            |
| Hobby         |               |            |
| Job           | Videographer |            |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |
| Music-Genre   |               |            |
| Sport         |               |            |

## Step 2: Place the fan of classical music on the far right
From clue 2, we know the person who likes classical music is on the far right. The table now looks like this:

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |               |            |
| Food          |               |            |
| Hobby         |               |            |
| Job           | Videographer |            |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |
| Music-Genre   |               | Classical |
| Sport         |               |            |

## Step 3: Determine the beverage on the far right
Clue 5 tells us the person drinking lemonade is on the far right. So, we update the table:

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |               | Lemonade  |
| Food          |               |            |
| Hobby         |               |            |
| Job           | Videographer |            |
| Movie-Genre   |               |            |
| Music-Genre   |               | Classical |
| Sport         |               |            |

## Step 4: Place the person whose sport is tennis
From clue 3, we know the person who likes tennis is to the right of the person whose hobby is baking. Since the far right is taken by the classical music fan (who also drinks lemonade), and considering other constraints, baking must be on the left, and tennis on the right, but we need to figure out the exact arrangement with other clues.

## Step 5: Arrange the food preferences
Clue 4 tells us the person who watches epic movies is to the right of the person eating corn. This means corn cannot be on the far right (since there's no space for ""epic"" to its right), so corn must be on the left, and epic movies also need to be placed accordingly.

## Step 6: Combine all clues
Given that the videographer is on the far left, and assuming the videographer could also be the one eating corn (since there's no direct contradiction), we can start filling in more details.


- The person on the left (1) is a videographer, eats corn, and for their hobby, let's place baking here as it fits with clue 3 that tennis is to the right of baking.
- Since the fan of classical music and lemonade drinker is on the far right, and considering clue 4 (epic movies to the right of corn), epic movies must be associated with the person on the right.
- Clue 3 indicates tennis is to the right of baking, so tennis goes on the right.
- The job on the right must be a dancer since videographer is on the left.
- For music genres, classical is already placed on the right. Soul, therefore, must be on the left.
- For movie genres, epic is on the right (from clue 4), so western must be on the left but considering other placements, it seems more likely that western would be associated with the videographer and corn, and epic with the dancer and possibly pumpkin or another food not directly mentioned in clues but inferred by process of elimination.
- Given the information about sports and hobbies, and knowing the beverage on the right is lemonade, cola must be on the left.

Let's fill in the table based on these deductions:


|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola         | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Corn         | Pumpkin   |
| Hobby         | Baking       | Card-games|
| Job           | Videographer| Dancer    |
| Movie-Genre   | Western      | Epic      |
| Music-Genre   | Soul         | Classical |
| Sport         | Skateboarding| Tennis    |

The final answer is: 
#############
|               |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | Cola         | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Corn         | Pumpkin   |
| Hobby         | Baking       | Card-games|

| Movie-Genre   | Western      | Epic      |
