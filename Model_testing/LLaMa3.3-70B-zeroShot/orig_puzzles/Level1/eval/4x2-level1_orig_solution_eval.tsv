Lv1-4x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each piece of information step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is traveling is on the far right.
2. The person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The designer is on the far right.

From (1) and (3), we know that the person on the far right has traveling as a hobby and is a designer.


Now, let's fill in what we know so far:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   |               |           |

From (2), since the person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski, and given that the far right column is already occupied by the designer/traveler, the jet-ski user must be in the left column.


Given this information:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-ski       |           |

Now, let's figure out the remaining spots. Since soccer is already placed on the right and the jet-ski is on the left for transport, we know the person on the left must enjoy a different sport (volleyball), have a different job (social-worker), and a different hobby (writing).


So, we fill in the rest:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Writing      | Traveling |
| Job         | Social-worker| Designer  |
| Sport       | Volleyball   | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-ski       | Bike      |

This arrangement satisfies all conditions given in the puzzle.

Lv1-4x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
2. The entrepreneur is on the far left.
3. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

Given:
- Beverages: almond-milk, lemonade
- Jobs: entrepreneur, lawyer
- Movie Genres: action, time-travel
- Sports: snowboarding, surfing

From clue 2, we know the entrepreneur is on the far left. So, the table starts with:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |              |             |
| Job           | entrepreneur|             |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |
| Sport         |              |             |

From clue 3, since the person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade, and considering the entrepreneur's position, lemonade must be associated with the entrepreneur (because there's no one to the left of the entrepreneur), which means almond-milk is associated with the lawyer.

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade    | almond-milk|
| Job           | entrepreneur| lawyer     |
| Movie-Genre   |              |             |
| Sport         |              |             |

Now, considering clue 1 and clue 3 together, since the person watching action movies is on the right of both the person whose sport is snowboarding and the person drinking lemonade, and knowing the positions of the beverages, we can deduce:

- The lawyer (on the right) must watch action movies because they are to the right of the entrepreneur who drinks lemonade.
- Snowboarding cannot be associated with the lawyer (since action movies are on the right of snowboarding), so it must be associated with the entrepreneur.

Given this information, and knowing that surfing is the only sport left for the lawyer:

|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | lemonade    | almond-milk|
| Job           | entrepreneur| lawyer     |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel | action     |
| Sport         | snowboarding| surfing    |

So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-4x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


1. The fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi.
3. The person eating apple is on the far left.


From clue 3, we know the person eating apple is on the far left. 

Given clue 1, if the country fan is to the left of the soy-milk drinker and considering the apple eater is on the far left (from clue 3), it suggests the country fan could be the one eating apple because they have to be to the left of the soy-milk drinker.


Clue 2 tells us the iced-tea drinker uses a taxi. Since there are only two columns, and if we assume the apple eater is also the country music fan (from our deduction), this would place the soy-milk drinker on the right.


Given these deductions, let's fill in what we know:


- The person on the left eats an apple, listens to country music.
- The iced-tea drinker uses a taxi.


So, if the person on the far left (eating apple and presumably listening to country) is not drinking iced-tea (because the iced-tea drinker uses a taxi), then they must be drinking soy-milk according to clue 1, which would actually contradict our setup since we deduced the country fan has to be to the left of the soy-milk drinker. Let's correct this understanding based on the clues:


- The apple eater is on the far left.
- This person listens to country music (as they are to the left of the soy-milk drinker).
- The iced-tea drinker uses a taxi.


So, we actually have two scenarios for the first column based on our initial misinterpretation. Let's correct this with the proper logic:


1. Apple eater is on the far left.
2. This person cannot be drinking soy-milk if they are to the left of the soy-milk drinker and a country fan.


Thus, considering all clues correctly:
- The apple eater (country music fan) drinks iced-tea because they must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker, fitting clue 1.
- The person drinking iced-tea uses a taxi (clue 2), placing them on the right would contradict since the country fan (apple eater) is already determined to be on the left.


Correcting for logical flow and adhering strictly to clues:
- Apple eater (far left) listens to country music.
- Since they are on the far left, and considering clue 1 (country fan to the left of soy-milk drinker), it actually suggests our initial interpretation needed adjustment. The correct sequence should directly reflect all given conditions without assuming the apple eater's drink.


Let's re-evaluate with strict adherence to clues without incorrect assumptions:


Given:
- Apple eater is far left.
- Country music fan is to the left of the soy-milk drinker.
- Iced-tea drinker uses a taxi.


This means the country fan (who eats an apple) cannot drink soy-milk as per clue 1; they must drink iced-tea if we were to incorrectly assume drink assignment based on position alone. However, our clues directly state relationships, not direct assignments of all categories to individuals without considering all interactions.


The correct interpretation should align all clues properly:
- The country fan is to the left of the soy-milk drinker (clue 1).
- The apple eater is far left (clue 3), implying they could be the country fan based on positional clue alone.
- The iced-tea drinker uses a taxi (clue 2).


Given these, let's properly assign without over-assuming:


The person eating an apple (far left) listens to country music and thus must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker. This means they could drink iced-tea since there's no direct contradiction given our clues about drink and music preference directly correlating with transport for both individuals.


However, the actual puzzle solution requires careful placement based on all given conditions:


Since the apple eater is on the far left and must be a country fan (to fit being to the left of the soy-milk drinker), and knowing the iced-tea drinker uses a taxi, we have to place these preferences correctly.


Given our clues again for clarity:
1. Country music fan to the left of soy-milk.
2. Iced-tea drinker uses a taxi.
3. Apple eater is far left.


The corrected solution table considering all interactions and without misinterpretation should directly reflect the clues given:


|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | Soy-milk | Iced-tea  |
| Food          | Avocado  | Apple     |
| Music-Genre   | Country  | Ambient   |
| Transport     | Quad-bike| Taxi      |


However, this doesn't align with our deductions based on clues. The correct alignment should consider the apple eater being on the far left and the country fan being to the left of the soy-milk drinker:


The proper arrangement reflecting all given conditions accurately is:


Given that the person eating an apple is on the far left (clue 3) and this person listens to country music because they are to the left of the soy-milk drinker (clue 1), and knowing the iced-tea drinker uses a taxi (clue 2), we deduce:


The apple eater, who listens to country music, must be on the left. The iced-tea drinker uses a taxi, which means the other person (soy-milk drinker) cannot use a taxi but must use a quad-bike, and they listen to ambient music as it's the only option left.


The correct table should thus accurately reflect these deductions based on given clues:


|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea | Soy-milk  |
| Food          | Apple    | Avocado   |
| Music-Genre   | Country  | Ambient   |
| Transport     | Taxi     | Quad-bike |


This solution fits all given conditions correctly without contradiction.

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of punk is on the far left.
2. The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking soy-milk eats lemon. Let's fill in the table with this information:

|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      |                |          |
| Food          |                |          |
| Job           |                |          |
| Music-Genre   |                |          |

Since the fan of punk is on the far left (clue 1), we can fill in the music genre for person 1:

|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      |                |          |
| Food          |                |          |
| Job           |                |          |
| Music-Genre   | punk           |          |

Now, let's use clue 3 to fill in the beverage and food for person 1 or 2. Since the person drinking soy-milk eats lemon, and we don't know which person drinks soy-milk yet, let's look at clue 2. The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that person 1 must drink iced-tea, because if they drank soy-milk, the nurse would be on the right of person 1, but there is no one to the right of person 1.

So, person 1 drinks iced-tea and likes punk music. Person 2 must drink soy-milk and eat lemon (from clue 3). The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea, which means person 2 is the nurse.

The only food left for person 1 is papaya, and the only job left for person 1 is security-guard (since person 2 is the nurse).

Lv1-4x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement carefully.


From statement 1, we know the fan of classical music is on the far left. This means:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby         |           |               |

| Transport     |           |               |


Statement 2 tells us that the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person driving the roller. Statement 3 says the person whose hobby is video-games is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since both skateboarding and video-games are to the right of the roller, and there are only two columns, the roller must be in column 1, and both skateboarding and video-games must be associated with column 2.


Given that the fan of classical music is on the far left (column 1), and considering statement 2 and 3 together, we can start filling in more information:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby         |           | Video-games   |

| Sport         |           | Skateboarding|
| Transport     | Roller    | Quad-bike    |


The only hobby left for column 1 is skydiving. The sport left for column 1 is sailing, as skateboarding has been assigned to column 2.


So, the completed table looks like this:

Lv1-4x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, we can start by using the given clues to fill in the table.


From clue 1: The fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
This means that if mirinda is in column 2, then techno must be in column 1.

From clue 2: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching animation movies.
This implies that if animation is in column 1, then skateboarding must be in column 2.


Let's start filling the table based on these clues:

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks.


For column 1, Beverage can't be mirinda (already assigned to column 2), so it must be milk.
For column 2, Movie-Genre can't be animation (already assigned to column 1), so it must be scientific.

Lv1-4x2-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3
The person watching thriller movies is on the far left. This means the movie genre for the first column is thriller.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur. Since the thriller fan is on the far left, the zombie fan (and thus the entrepreneur) must be in the second column.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 1
The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. This implies that the jet-ski user cannot be in the second column because there would be no one to their right for the board-game enthusiast. Therefore, the jet-ski must be associated with the first column.


## Step 4: Determine Hobbies
Given the clue about the jet-ski and board-games, and knowing the jet-ski is on the left (first column), we can infer that the person in the second column enjoys board-games because they are to the right of the jet-ski user.


## Step 5: Fill in Remaining Information
- The first column has a thriller movie fan who uses a jet-ski.
- The second column has a zombie movie fan who is an entrepreneur and enjoys board-games.
- Since reading is the only hobby left, it must belong to the person in the first column.
- The software developer job is left, which must be filled by the person in the first column because the entrepreneur is already identified as being in the second column.
- Finally, trike transport is left and must be associated with the board-game enthusiast (second column) since jet-ski is taken by the first column.


## Step 6: Construct Final Table
Given all deductions:


|               |         1          |      2       |
| Hobby         | Reading          | Board-games |

From clue 1: The teacher is on the left of the person eating cucumber.
- This means the teacher cannot be in column 2 if cucumber is in column 2.

From clue 2: The person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
- This implies that if spinach is in column 1, coffee must be in column 2.

From clue 3: The teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.

Since the teacher is on the left of the person eating cucumber (clue 1) and also on the left of the person whose hobby is chess (clue 3), we can start by placing the teacher in column 1 because if the teacher were in column 2, it would violate one of these conditions given that there's only one position to the left.


2. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee (clue 2). This means spinach must be paired with either the teacher or another hobby/job combination that allows coffee to be in column 2 without violating any rules.


Given these constraints, let's propose a solution:


|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |             |           |
| Food       |             |           |
| Hobby      |             |           |
| Job        |             |           |

From clue 3 and considering the teacher must be in column 1, chess cannot be the hobby of the person in column 1. Thus, we place board-games in column 1.


Considering clue 2, if spinach is on the left (in column 1), then coffee must be in column 2.


The teacher is in column 1 and is to the left of cucumber (clue 1) and chess (clue 3). Since we've established that the hobby in column 1 is board-games, chess must be in column 2. This also means cucumber must be in column 2 because the teacher (in column 1) is to the left of the person eating cucumber.


Now, the only job left for column 2 is scientist since teacher is already placed in column 1.


The beverage left for column 1 (since coffee is determined to be in column 2 based on spinach's placement) must be 7up because we've established coffee's position based on clue 2 and the constraint that each category has only two options.


Therefore, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |  7up       |  coffee  |
| Food       | spinach    | cucumber |
| Hobby      | board-games|  chess   |
| Job        | teacher    | scientist|

Lv1-4x2-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The Polish person owns the rabbit.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of folk music is to the right of the person eating artichoke.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The Polish person is to the right of the owner of the lizard.


## Step 4: Determine Positions Based on Clues
From Clue 3, since the Polish person is to the right of the lizard owner and from Clue 1, we know the Polish person has a rabbit. This implies the lizard cannot be with the Polish person, placing the lizard with the non-Polish (Malaysian) person.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 2
Given that the folk fan is to the right of the artichoke eater and knowing from Clue 1 that the Polish person has a rabbit, we can start building our table. If the Polish person (with the rabbit) is on the right, then they must be the folk music fan because they have to be to the right of someone eating artichoke.


## Step 6: Construct Table Based on Clues
Given all clues:
- The Polish person owns a rabbit and listens to folk music (because they are on the right).
- The Malaysian person owns a lizard.
- Since the Polish person is to the right of the lizard owner, the lizard owner must eat artichoke (to satisfy Clue 2 that the folk fan is to the right of the artichoke eater).


## Step 7: Finalize Table
The only combination left is for the Malaysian to listen to blues and eat artichoke, while owning a lizard. The Polish person listens to folk, eats blueberry (since the other food option is taken), and owns a rabbit.


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Food          | artichoke | blueberry |
| Music-Genre   | blues     | folk      |
| Nationality   | malaysian | polish    |
| Pet           | lizard    | rabbit    |
