Lv1-7x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the table accordingly.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The person watching sports movies is the paramedic.

## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The paramedic is on the right of the Spanish.

## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The person drinking almond-milk is the entrepreneur.

## Step 4: Analyze Clue 4
The German is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball.

## Step 5: Analyze Clue 5
The person who's sport is badminton is the person watching scientific movies.

## Step 6: Analyze Clue 6
The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies.

## Step 7: Analyze Clue 7
The paramedic is on the right of the fan of ambient.

## Step 8: Analyze Clue 8
The fan of blues is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

## Step 9: Analyze Clue 9
The person eating peas is the person drinking tea.

## Step 10: Analyze Clue 10
The person eating orange is on the right of the Spanish.

From Clue 1 and Clue 6, we know the order for Movie-Genre is sports, ?, fantasy (since fantasy is to the right of sports). Given that there are only three genres left (fantasy, scientific, sports) and sports is already placed, the middle genre must be scientific because badminton (which watches scientific movies) cannot be on the far right due to other constraints.

From Clue 2, we know the paramedic (who watches sports movies) is to the right of Spanish. Thus, the order for Nationality starts with Spanish, followed by ?, and then the paramedic's nationality.

Clue 3 tells us the entrepreneur drinks almond-milk.

Clue 4 gives us the German being on the right of basketball. Since there are only three sports, this means the order is badminton (scientific movies), basketball, climbing (because badminton can't be last due to Clue 5).

From Clue 7 and knowing the paramedic watches sports movies, we understand that ambient must come before the paramedic.

Clue 8 indicates blues comes after almond-milk, which is drunk by the entrepreneur.

Given these clues, let's try to piece together a possible arrangement:

1. The person who likes badminton (scientific movies) cannot be Spanish because they have to fit into one of the other nationalities and their sport does not conflict with any given nationality directly.
2. Since the paramedic watches sports movies and is on the right of Spanish, and considering the movie genres order (sports, scientific, fantasy), we can infer that badminton (scientific) cannot be first if it's tied to a specific job or drink directly without conflicting clues.

Considering all clues together:

- The person watching sports movies (paramedic) must be on the far right because they are also to the right of Spanish and ambient music fan.
- Since fantasy is on the right of sports, and given that there are only three people, fantasy must be in the third column.
- Given that badminton watches scientific movies, and considering the constraints around the paramedic (sports) being after Spanish and ambient, badminton likely aligns with a different nationality that doesn't conflict with other clues.

Now, let's fill in what we can directly:

|               |      1       |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |              |            |          |
| Food          |              |            |          |
| Job           |              |            |          |
| Movie-Genre   |              |            |          |
| Music-Genre   |              |            |          |
| Nationality   |              |            |          |
| Sport         |              |            |          |

From Clue 9, peas = tea. From Clue 10, orange is on the right of Spanish.

Given these pieces, we can start constructing possible combinations while adhering to all given constraints.


Given the complexity and the step-by-step elimination required for each clue against the table format provided without direct iterative filling based on clues in this response format, let's deduce a logical path considering all given information:


1. **Nationality**: Since Spanish must be followed by another nationality (due to Clue 2), and German is after basketball (Clue 4), Spanish likely starts, then Russian or German, but because the paramedic must be on the right of Spanish and also to the right of ambient, it suggests a particular order for nationalities that accommodates all other conditions.


2. **Job**: Paramedic watches sports movies (Clue 1) and is after Spanish (Clue 2), with the entrepreneur drinking almond-milk (Clue 3).


3. **Movie-Genre**: Given sports, then fantasy (because fantasy is to the right of sports from Clue 6), scientific must fit before sports or in a way that doesn't conflict with badminton's fan watching scientific movies.


Considering all constraints and attempting a logical deduction without iterative table filling due to format limitations:


Given:
- Paramedic is after Spanish.
- Fantasy is after sports movies.
- German is after basketball.
- Entrepreneur drinks almond-milk.
- Peas = tea, orange after Spanish.

We must align these with the music genres, jobs, and sports while maintaining consistency across all clues.


Since direct filling based on iterative clue analysis isn't straightforward in this format without visual table manipulation, let's synthesize a potential arrangement considering key constraints:


For **Nationality**, if we start with Spanish (to satisfy Clue 2), followed by another nationality that allows for the paramedic to be after ambient and before fantasy movies, we consider how jobs, sports, and music genres align.


Given the clues:
- The person watching sports movies is a paramedic.
- Paramedic is on the right of Spanish.
- Almond-milk drinker is an entrepreneur.
- German is on the right of basketball.
- Badminton watches scientific movies.
- Fantasy movies are after sports.
- Paramedic is after ambient music fan.


The table filling requires aligning these preferences without direct conflict, ensuring each clue supports the overall arrangement.


Given the puzzle's complexity and the clues provided, a precise step-by-step filling of the table in this response format is challenging without iterative visual adjustments. However, by analyzing each clue against possible arrangements, we aim to find a configuration that satisfies all conditions simultaneously.


For **Beverage**, **Food**, **Job**, **Movie-Genre**, **Music-Genre**, **Nationality**, and **Sport**, aligning with clues provided:

Lv1-7x3-2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 5 and clue 9 to determine the job and transport of the first column.
The chef is on the far left (clue 5), and the person driving the van is on the far left (clue 9). This means the first column's job is a chef, and their transport is a van.


## Step 2: Use clue 1 to identify the nationality of the middle column.
The Italian is in the middle (clue 1).


## Step 3: Apply clue 3 to determine the transport of the middle column.
The person driving the tram is in the middle (clue 3). So, the middle column's transport is a tram.


## Step 4: Use clue 7 to identify the sport of the far right column.
The person whose sport is tennis is on the far right (clue 7).


## Step 5: Apply clue 2 to relate hobby and sport.
The person whose hobby is traveling is the person whose sport is badminton (clue 2). This means the hobby of traveling corresponds with the sport of badminton.


## Step 6: Use clue 6 to position the Nigerian relative to badminton.
The Nigerian is on the left of the person whose sport is badminton (clue 6).


## Step 7: Apply clue 4 to relate hobby and pet.
The person whose hobby is photography is the owner of the pony (clue 4).


## Step 8: Use clue 10 to identify the teacher's pet.
The teacher is the owner of the cat (clue 10).


## Step 9: Apply clue 11 to position the journalist relative to mystery movies.
The journalist is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (clue 11).


## Step 10: Combine all information to fill in the table.
Given the clues:
- The first column has a chef, uses a van, and must be the Nigerian because the Nigerian is to the left of badminton (which can't be in the first column due to clue 6), and badminton is associated with traveling.
- The middle column is Italian, drives a tram, and since the person watching western movies must be after photography (clue 8) and the chef is already on the far left, this setup suggests that photography and thus the pony's owner cannot be in the first column but also not necessarily directly next to western movies without more specific placement clues.
- The last column has tennis as its sport.


Given these steps, we have:
1. Chef (Job) - Van (Transport) - Nigerian (Nationality) for the leftmost person because the van and chef are specified for this position, and the Nigerian must precede badminton.
2. For the middle: Italian (Nationality) - Tram (Transport). Since photography's owner has a pony and is to the left of western movies (clue 8), and considering the other clues about jobs, hobbies, and sports, we can deduce more specific placements.


Considering all clues:
- The chef is on the far left with a van.
- The Italian is in the middle with a tram.
- Tennis is on the far right.


We have to place the remaining elements (hobbies: hiking, photography, traveling; jobs: journalist, teacher; movie-genres: mystery, scientific, western; pets: cat, hamster, pony; sports: badminton, surfing) according to the clues.


Given clue 2 and clue 6, the Nigerian on the left is associated with badminton indirectly (because they are to the left of badminton), which means traveling must be in the second column because it's associated with badminton, but we know the Italian is there. So, we deduce based on associations:
- The first column has a chef and thus likely watches mystery movies since the journalist is to the left of mystery (clue 11), making the first column likely have mystery movies as well.
- Photography is to the left of western (clue 8), which places photography in the first or second column. Given the Italian is in the middle, and assuming badminton's placement affects this, we consider how these fit with jobs and pets.


The teacher has a cat (clue 10). The pony belongs to the photographer (clue 4).


Given the clues about sports:
- Badminton is with traveling.
- Tennis is on the far right.
- Surfing must then be in one of the first two columns but can't be directly stated without considering all other placements.


We know from clue 8 that photography is to the left of western, which helps place hobbies relative to movie genres.


Since we have to relate all elements (job, transport, nationality, pet, sport, hobby, movie-genre) and given the clues about positions:
- The first column is a chef with a van, Nigerian, and by process of elimination and clue associations, likely has mystery movies because the journalist precedes mystery.
- The second column, being Italian and using a tram, must then be associated with badminton (because traveling is linked to badminton), which places traveling in this column indirectly through its association with badminton.


Considering all:
- The leftmost person (Nigerian chef with a van) likely watches mystery movies because the journalist is on the left of mystery, suggesting a setup where the first column aligns with the chef and thus potentially with mystery or another genre that fits the clues about the journalist's position relative to movie genres.

Lv1-7x3-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement and apply it step by step to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply Statement 2
The person watching superhero movies is on the far left.
This means the movie-genre for the first column is superhero.

## Step 2: Apply Statement 6
The person watching superhero movies is the person drinking mirinda.
So, the beverage for the first column is mirinda.

## Step 3: Apply Statement 1
The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
Given that the first column already has a beverage assigned (mirinda), and considering the constraint, the snowmobile must be in the first column because there's no one to the left of the first column.

## Step 4: Apply Statement 5
The person eating broccoli is on the far right.
This means the food for the third column is broccoli.

## Step 5: Apply Statement 10
The freelancer is the owner of the horse.
We know from statement 9 that the owner of the horse is on the right of the dressmaker, but we don't yet know where the dressmaker or the freelancer are in relation to each other or the columns.

## Step 6: Apply Statement 7
The dressmaker is on the right of the pakistani.
This means the dressmaker cannot be in the first column because there must be a Pakistani person to their left. Given that the freelancer owns a horse and considering statement 9, we start to see a possible arrangement where the dressmaker could be in the second column if the Pakistani is in the first, but this conflicts with our superhero/mirinda/snowmobile setup from steps 1-3.

## Step 7: Re-evaluate Statements for Column Placement
Considering all constraints:
- The superhero fan is on the far left (Step 1), drinking mirinda (Step 2), and uses the snowmobile (deduced).
- The broccoli eater is on the far right (Step 4).

Let's place the dressmaker relative to the Pakistani, considering the freelancer must own a horse and be related to the dressmaker through the horse's placement.

## Step 8: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Given the complexity and interrelation of clues:
- Statement 3 indicates the spy movie fan is right of the 7up drinker.
- Statement 4 places the trike user right of the Dutch person.
- Statement 8 says the cat owner is left of the lime eater.

Let's place known items in columns based on direct statements and deductions, then fill in the gaps.


Given all constraints:
1. Superhero/mirinda/snowmobile (left)
2. Spy movie fan to the right of 7up drinker
3. Dressmaker to the right of Pakistani, with horse owner (freelancer) after dressmaker

Since the person watching superhero movies is also drinking mirinda and using a snowmobile, and given other constraints:
- Dutch cannot be leftmost due to trike placement.
- Pakistani could potentially fit in the middle based on dressmaker's relative position.

Considering all statements for a coherent solution:


The final answer is:

From clue 8, the person who's hobby is card-games is on the far left.
From clue 5, the person who's hobby is card-games is the person drinking coffee.
So, the leftmost column has a hobby of card-games and a beverage of coffee.

From clue 3, the person who's sport is skateboarding is in the middle.
From clue 6, the person eating avocado is in the middle.
So, the middle column has a sport of skateboarding and food of avocado.

From clue 9, the person who's hobby is chess is the person driving the boat.
From clue 2, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat.
So, the middle column has a transport of boat (because if it were in the rightmost column, there would be no room for the person drinking cola to its right), and thus the leftmost or middle column must have chess as a hobby, but since card-games is already on the left, chess must be in the middle.

From clue 10, the person eating avocado is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
So, the rightmost column has a movie-genre of drama.

From clue 4, the owner of the goat is the person watching drama movies.
So, the rightmost column also has a pet of goat.

From clue 7, the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the jet-ski.
So, either the leftmost or rightmost column has a transport of jet-ski and a sport of weightlifting.

From clue 1, the person whose sport is snowboarding is the person watching satire movies.
Since drama is already in the rightmost column, satire must be in either the leftmost or middle column. But since the middle column already has skateboarding as its sport, satire (and thus snowboarding) must be in the leftmost column.

From clue 11, the owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating corn.
Given that avocado is in the middle and we have a goat on the right, corn must be on the left (because if it were in the middle, there would be no room for the dog to its left). This means the leftmost column has food of corn.

The only hobby left for the rightmost column is video-games, and since weightlifting must be paired with jet-ski (clue 7), it has to be in the rightmost column because jet-ski can't be in the middle (that's where boat is).

And the last beverage, iced-tea, must go in the middle.

However, we see that some fields were not correctly filled according to the instructions provided in the problem. Let's correct those based on the clues given and the process of elimination:

The only movie genre left for the middle column is romance, but since we've established all other categories, let's correct and finalize without adding unnecessary information:

Lv1-7x3-5	"Based on the given clues, we can solve the puzzle as follows:


|               |       1       |     2      |      3       |
| Food          |  avocado     |   broccoli |    onion     |

| Sport         | weightlifting|   biathlon  |   baseball   |

The steps to solve the puzzle involve using each clue to narrow down the possibilities for each category. Here's a brief overview of how the clues help:


1. The reggae fan is on the right of the spy movie watcher.
2. Fishing hobby is on the far right.
3. Nigerian is into magic-tricks.
4. Pop music fan eats avocado.
5. Disco fan is on the left of onion eater and right of weightlifter.
6. Weightlifting sport is not on the far right (because disco fan is to its right).
7. Horse owner is in the middle.
8. Card-games hobbyist is on the left of lizard owner.
9. Onion eater is French and into baseball.
10. Martial-arts movie watcher is on the far right, conflicting with fishing unless they're the same person.
11. Pop music fan is on the far left.


Given these clues, we piece together the information:


- The pop fan is on the far left (12) and eats avocado (4), so column 1 has avocado and pop music.
- The martial-arts watcher and fishing hobbyist are both on the far right (11 and 2), suggesting they could be related or the same person, but since fishing is a hobby and martial-arts is a movie genre, they can indeed coexist in the same column without conflict. However, given that the spy movie fan has reggae to their right (1) and considering all other constraints, we find that martial-arts must align with fishing on the far right.
- The Nigerian does magic-tricks (3), placing them in the middle since they can't be on the far left (pop fan) or far right (fishing/martial-arts).
- The onion eater is French and into baseball (9 and 10), which places them on the far right if considering only these clues, but given that fishing/martial-arts must be on the far right and the reggae fan (who watches spy movies) is to their left, we find a conflict unless we correctly align all remaining clues.
- The disco fan is to the left of the onion eater (5) and to the right of the weightlifter (6), which suggests a middle position for weightlifting or another arrangement that fits all criteria.


Considering all clues together:


- Since pop is on the far left, eating avocado, and given the constraints around the Nigerian (magic-tricks), the horse owner (middle), and the lizard owner's relation to card-games, we can start filling in the gaps.
- The French person eats onion and watches baseball, which must align with being on the right side due to other constraints but considering all clues, especially with martial-arts/fishing and reggae/spy alignments, we find that the French can indeed be on the far right as initially suggested by some clues before realizing the necessity of reconciling all statements.
- The weightlifter must then be on the left or in a position that allows disco to be to their right while also being to the left of onion (and thus baseball), which places weightlifting on the far left, given pop's position and the need for disco to be central or right-central.


Given these deductions, we place each category accordingly, ensuring all clues are satisfied:

Lv1-7x3-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we can deduce it.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 11
From clue 11, we know the person drinking juice is on the far right. This gives us a starting point for placing other preferences based on their relationship to the juice drinker.

## Step 2: Applying Clue 1
The owner of the goat is also on the far right (clue 1), which means this person must be drinking juice since clue 11 specifies the juice drinker is on the far right.

## Step 3: Using Clue 5
The fan of hip-hop is to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the juice drinker is on the far right, hip-hop's fan must be in the middle.

## Step 4: Applying Clue 9
The teacher is to the left of the person drinking mirinda (clue 9). Given that the teacher eats spinach (clue 8) and owns a goldfish (clue 7), we can start building a profile for the teacher.

## Step 5: Integrating Clue 6
The chef drives a motorbike. This is crucial for placing the jobs in relation to the modes of transport.

## Step 6: Applying Clue 4
The electronic fan is to the right of the motorbike driver (clue 4). Since the motorbike driver (the chef) cannot be on the far right (because the juice drinker is), and considering the placements so far, we need to fit these pieces together carefully.

## Step 7: Using Clue 3
The watermelon eater is to the right of the mirinda drinker. This clue helps us understand the food arrangement relative to the drinks.

## Step 8: Applying Clue 10
The trike driver is to the left of the baseball player. This gives us a relationship between transport and sport but doesn't specify exact positions yet.

## Step 9: Integrating Remaining Clues
- From clue 2, we know the weightlifter uses a roller. 
- The teacher (who eats spinach) must be on the left since they are to the left of the mirinda drinker (clue 9), and given that the hip-hop fan is in the middle (from clue 5 and knowing the juice drinker's position), we can start piecing together the jobs, sports, and transports.

## Step 10: Final Placement
Given all clues:
- The teacher must be on the left, eating spinach, owning a goldfish.
- The hip-hop fan is in the middle, to the left of the juice drinker.
- The goat owner drinks juice and is on the far right.
- The chef drives a motorbike and cannot be on the far right (since that's the juice drinker), placing them likely on the left or in the middle. However, given the electronic fan's position relative to the motorbike driver and other clues, we have to carefully place these preferences.

Considering all relationships:
1. The teacher is on the left, eating spinach, and owns a goldfish. They must drive a trike (since the motorbike driver is the chef, and the roller is for the weightlifter).
2. The middle person is the hip-hop fan. Given the electronic fan is to the right of the motorbike driver and the motorbike driver (chef) cannot be on the far right, the chef must be in the middle, with the electronic fan to their right. However, since the hip-hop fan is in the middle and the electronic fan must be to the right of the motorbike driver, this means our initial assumption about direct placements needs adjustment based on all clues.
3. The person drinking mirinda must be to the left of the watermelon eater (clue 3) and to the right of the teacher (clue 9), which places mirinda in the middle if we consider the fixed positions (teacher on the left, juice drinker on the right).
4. Given that the weightlifter uses a roller (clue 2) and considering other placements, we have to ensure all clues fit together logically.

Let's correct and finalize based on the most restrictive clues:
- Teacher (spinach, goldfish) is on the left.
- Chef (motorbike) cannot be on the far right; thus, likely in the middle or on the left. But since the teacher is on the left, and considering other restrictions, we place the chef in the middle.
- Hip-hop fan is to the left of the juice drinker, placing them in the middle, but this conflicts with our need to place the chef (motorbike) and electronic fan correctly. Thus, reevaluation is necessary:
1. Teacher on the left (spinach, goldfish, trike).
2. Middle: Given the restrictions, the chef (motorbike) fits here, but we must align sports, transports, and other preferences accordingly.
3. Right: Juice drinker, goat owner.

Reconciling all clues with the direct information:
- The teacher (eating spinach, owning a goldfish, driving a trike) is on the left.
- The chef (driving a motorbike) is in the middle.
- The juice drinker (owning a goat) is on the right.

Considering sports and music genres:
- Weightlifting is associated with the roller (clue 2), which must fit into our arrangement.
- Electronic fan to the right of the motorbike driver helps place the electronic genre.
- Hip-hop to the left of the juice drinker places hip-hop in the middle or left, but since the teacher is on the left, and considering other placements, adjustments are necessary.

Finalizing based on direct clues and deductions:
1. Teacher (left): spinach, goldfish, trike, gospel (since hip-hop and electronic are placed relative to others).
2. Middle: chef, motorbike, watermelon, hip-hop.
3. Right: juice, goat, mirinda doesn't fit here; it must be to the left of the watermelon eater, suggesting a rearrangement based on clues.

Given the complexities and to directly solve it:
- The direct placements from clues give us the teacher on the left and the juice drinker on the right.
- Other preferences are filled in based on the clues provided, ensuring each clue is respected.

Lv1-7x3-7	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 7
The person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left. This gives us a starting point for one of the hobbies.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
The person drinking 7up is on the left of the Egyptian. Since the magic-tricks enthusiast is on the far left, this suggests the Egyptian cannot be on the far left, thus possibly placing them in the middle or right, but we know the 7up drinker must be to their left.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 4
The person drinking lemonade is on the far right. This gives us another fixed point for beverages.


## Step 4: Consider Clue 2
The person watching scientific movies is in the middle. This clue, combined with others, starts to give us a clearer picture of the arrangement.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 1
The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the Egyptian. Since we know from Clue 4 that lemonade is on the far right and assuming the drinker's movie preference isn't specified, this clue helps in arranging nationalities and movie genres.


## Step 6: Use Clue 5
The owner of the turtle is the person whose sport is golf. This links a pet with a sport but doesn't give us an immediate position without other clues.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 9
The British is on the right of the person driving the roller. This clue helps in placing nationalities relative to transport.


## Step 8: Consider Clue 10
The owner of the guinea-pig is in the middle. This gives us a fixed point for pets and can help in arranging other categories.


## Step 9: Piece Together Remaining Clues
Clues 6, 8, and 11 provide relationships between hobbies, sports, and transport but require an understanding of the placements from previous steps to accurately position them.


Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach that considers all clues simultaneously, let's directly construct the solution based on deducing from these clues:


- Magic-tricks (hobby) is on the far left.
- Lemonade (beverage) is on the far right.
- Scientific movies (movie-genre) are in the middle.
- The turtle's owner likes golf (sport).
- Guinea-pig's owner is in the middle.
- British is to the right of the roller (transport) user.

Lv1-7x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues and apply them step by step.


## Step 1: Apply clue 2 to determine the nationality of the first column.
The American is on the far left.


## Step 2: Use clue 1 to establish a relationship between woodworking and broccoli.
The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person eating broccoli. This doesn't give us specific columns yet but tells us about a relationship.


## Step 3: Apply clue 8 to identify the drink associated with horror movies.
The person drinking iced-tea is the person watching horror movies.


## Step 4: Use clue 5 to establish the order of movie genres.
The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching horror movies.


## Step 5: Apply clue 9 to relate asparagus eating to iced-tea (horror movies).
The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.


## Step 6: Use clue 4 to identify the sport and transport associated with skateboarding.
The person whose sport is skateboarding is the person driving the bike.


## Step 7: Apply clue 3 to relate Indonesian nationality to airplane transport.
The Indonesian is on the left of the person driving the airplane.


## Step 8: Use clue 6 to place zombie movies in relation to skydiving.
The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.


## Step 9: Apply clue 7 to relate basketball to sprite.
The person whose sport is basketball is on the right of the person drinking Sprite.


## Step 10: Combine all clues to fill in the table.
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach, let's deduce:


- From clue 2, the American is on the far left (Column 1).
- Clue 8 tells us the horror movie fan drinks iced-tea. Clue 5 places sports movies before horror, so sports must be in column 1 or 2 if horror is in column 2 or 3, respectively.
- Since the American is on the far left and clue 5 suggests sports movies are before horror, we can consider the American watches sports movies (as it fits with being on the far left).
- Clue 9 places asparagus after iced-tea (horror), suggesting a possible order for food based on movie genres.
- Skateboarding is associated with biking (clue 4), and given basketball's relation to sprite (clue 7), we can start piecing together sports and drinks.


## Step 11: Final Deductions
Given the American watches sports movies (based on clue 5 and being on the far left), and considering all other clues:


- Column 1: American, Sports movies, ? drink, ? food, ? hobby, ? sport, ? transport
- Since horror is after sports (clue 5) and iced-tea is associated with horror (clue 8), we place horror in column 2.
- Asparagus is after iced-tea (horror), placing it in column 3 (clue 9).
- Skateboarding is with biking (clue 4), suggesting the transport for column 2 could be bike, given skateboarding's sport association.
- The person drinking Sprite must be before basketball (clue 7), and since basketball can't be in column 1 (American watches sports), it suggests column 2 or 3 for basketball. But since skateboarding is with biking, and assuming unique combinations, basketball might fit better in column 3 if we consider the restrictions.


## Step 12: Final Table Assembly
Let's assemble based on deductions:


- American in column 1, watching sports movies. The only drink left that fits well before horror (iced-tea) is Fanta for sports, considering the sequence and associations.
- Column 1: American, Sports, Fanta, ?, ?, Basketball doesn't fit here due to sprite association, so possibly ice-hockey or another sport not yet ruled out, Airplane doesn't fit due to Indonesian clue, leaving bike or roller. Given skateboarding is with biking (and likely in column 2 for the bike), this leaves roller as a possibility but considering transport and other clues, we need to ensure each category has a unique item per column.


- Column 2: Since horror movies are after sports, and associated with iced-tea, let's place it here. The hobby could be skydiving (as woodworking is related to broccoli, which isn't in this column based on asparagus's placement after horror), the sport could indeed be skateboarding given the bike association, and nationality could be Indonesian based on clue 3 about the airplane.


- Column 3: Zombie movies are after skydiving (clue 6), suggesting the sequence. Asparagus is here (after horror, clue 9), garlic or broccoli for food in columns 1 or 2 (since asparagus is in column 3). The drink must be Sprite (as Fanta and iced-tea are taken), and considering basketball's placement after sprite (clue 7), this fits. Transport could be airplane given the Indonesian clue about being before the airplane.


Given these deductions, let's fill in the table:


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |     Fanta    |  Iced-tea  |   Sprite   |
| Food          |   Broccoli   |  Garlic    |  Asparagus |

Lv1-7x3-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply clue 2
The Australian is on the far right. This means the nationality column for column 3 is ""australian"".


## Step 2: Apply clue 4 and clue 5
The photographer is in the middle, and the person watching time-travel movies is also in the middle. This implies that the person watching time-travel movies is the photographer.


## Step 3: Apply clue 7
The person watching time-travel movies eats lime. Since this person is also the photographer and in the middle, we can fill in ""lime"" for food in column 2.


## Step 4: Apply clue 8
The person whose hobby is skydiving is the photographer. So, the hobby for column 2 (the middle) is ""skydiving"".


## Step 5: Apply clue 3 and clue 10
The person watching family movies eats kale and drinks iced-tea. This gives us specific food and beverage for one of the columns.


## Step 6: Apply clue 9
The chef watches western movies. Since we don't know the position yet, we'll have to come back to this later.


## Step 7: Apply clue 1
The Indian is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. This implies that the guinea-pig cannot be owned by the person in column 3 (since there's no one to their right), so it must be either column 1 or 2.


## Step 8: Apply clue 6
The person whose hobby is baking is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This means the person drinking sprite cannot be in column 3.


## Step 9: Apply clue 11
The owner of the bird is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Given that iced-tea is associated with family movies and kale, this helps to further narrow down the options.


## Step 10: Piece together all clues for a final solution.
From clue 2, we know the Australian is in column 3.
Clue 4 and clue 5 place the photographer/time-travel fan in column 2.
Clue 7 tells us this person eats lime.
Clue 8 says their hobby is skydiving.
Given the constraints:
- The person drinking sprite must be in either column 1 or 2 (clue 6), but since clue 10 associates iced-tea with family movies and kale, and clue 11 places the bird owner to the right of the iced-tea drinker, we can start building a picture.
- If the Indian is on the right of the guinea-pig owner (clue 1) and the Australian is on the far right (clue 2), this means the Indian must be in column 2. But clue 4 places the photographer in the middle, so there seems to be a conflict unless we consider other positions for the nationalities based on further clues.


## Step 11: Finalize positions
Given that:
- The Australian is in column 3 (clue 2).
- The photographer/time-travel fan who eats lime and has skydiving as a hobby is in column 2 (clues 4, 5, 7, 8).
- This person cannot be the Indian because clue 1 states the Indian is to the right of the guinea-pig owner, suggesting flexibility in how we interpret initial placements based on subsequent clues.
- The family movie watcher who eats kale and drinks iced-tea (clues 3, 10) must then fit with another set of clues.


## Step 12: Resolve Conflicts
Revisiting clue 1 and considering the constraints:
- If the Indian is to the right of the guinea-pig owner, but we also know the Australian is on the far right (column 3), this means the Indian cannot be in column 2 if the guinea-pig owner were in column 1 because there would be no space for the Indian to the right. Thus, our initial assumption about fixed positions needs adjustment based on all clues.


## Step 13: Reconsider Nationalities and Pets
Given:
- The Australian is in column 3.
- The photographer (who watches time-travel movies) is in column 2.
The only configuration that fits all given clues correctly must account for every piece of information. Since we have specific associations but need to ensure they fit the grid without direct placement from some clues, let's directly apply what we know:
- Column 1: Must contain a person who drinks sprite (since baking is on the right of sprite, clue 6), watches family movies (thus eats kale and drinks iced-tea, clues 3 and 10).
- Column 2: Photographer, time-travel movies, lime, skydiving.
- Column 3: Australian, western movies (because the chef watches western, clue 9).


## Step 14: Final Placement
Considering all clues:
- The bird owner is to the right of the iced-tea drinker (clue 11), which means if the iced-tea drinker (and kale eater) is in column 1, the bird must be in either column 2 or 3. But since the Australian is in column 3 and there's no indication they own a bird directly from the clues, we need to fit pets, nationalities, and other preferences around these constraints.


## Step 15: Finalize
Based on all clues:
- Column 1 seems to be associated with family movies, kale, iced-tea (clues 3, 10), which could imply the British nationality here since it's the only one left.
- Column 2 is time-travel movies, lime, photographer, skydiving, which from clue 1 must include the Indian to fit all given conditions without conflict, suggesting an error in initial logic flow that needed adjustment for proper placement.
- Column 3 has western movies and is Australian.


Given these steps and recognizing the complexity of directly applying each clue without a visual grid initially, let's finalize based on logical deduction and correction:

Lv1-7x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to fill in the table.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 8
The person eating pear is the police-officer.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The person eating pear is the person who's sport is sailing. Since this person is also the police-officer (from Clue 8), we have a connection between food, job, and sport for one person.


## Step 3: Apply Clue 6
The designer is the person drinking lemonade.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the designer. This implies the designer cannot be in the first column since there needs to be a person to the left of them.


## Step 5: Apply Clue 2 and Clue 3
The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking water, and the person drinking water is on the right of the French. This gives us a sequence for beverage and nationality but doesn't specify positions yet.


## Step 6: Apply Clue 4
The owner of the lizard is the French.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 10
The French is on the left of the Malaysian. Since we know from Clue 3 that the person drinking water is on the right of the French, and combining with Clue 2, we start to get a clearer picture of the beverage order in relation to nationality.


## Step 8: Apply Clue 7
The person watching disaster movies is in the middle. This clue starts to give us a structure for the movie-genre column.


## Step 9: Combine Information
- From Clues 1 and 8, we have a police-officer who eats pear and prefers sailing.
- The designer drinks lemonade (Clue 6).
- The French owns a lizard (Clue 4) and is on the left of the Malaysian (Clue 10), with water being drunk by someone to the right of the French (Clue 3).
- Juice is drunk by someone to the left of the person drinking water (Clue 2).
- Disaster movies are watched by the person in the middle (Clue 7).


## Step 10: Constructing the Table
Given all clues, let's start constructing:


- The French must be on the left because they own a lizard and are to the left of the Malaysian. If the French were in the third column, there would be no room for the Malaysian to their right.
- Since the person drinking water is to the right of the French (Clue 3) and juice is to the left of water (Clue 2), we have a beverage order but need to match it with other preferences.


## Step 11: Finalizing Positions
Let's assign positions based on clues:


1. The French cannot be in column 3 because they must be to the left of the Malaysian (Clue 10).
2. Given Clue 5 and Clue 6, the designer (who drinks lemonade) must be in either column 2 or 3 but since they have to have someone with a rabbit to their left, this gives us some flexibility.
3. The person eating pear (police-officer, sailing) can now be placed.
