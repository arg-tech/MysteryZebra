Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's analyze the given information:


1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish.
2. The Turkish is the person who's sport is golf.


From statement 2, we know the Turkish person prefers golf. 

Using statement 1, since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish, and given that there are only two positions (1 and 2), the Turkish person must be in position 1, and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 2.


So, we have:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Nationality   | Turkish |               |
| Sport         | Golf    |               |


Now, let's fill in the rest of the information:


- The Turkish person is in position 1 and prefers golf.
- Since there are only two nationalities (Egyptian and Turkish) and two sports (Biathlon and Golf), and given that the Turkish person prefers golf, the Egyptian person must prefer biathlon.


Given statement 1 again, the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish, meaning they cannot be Turkish. Therefore, the person in position 2 (who drinks hot-chocolate) must be Egyptian, and their sport is biathlon.


The last piece of information to fill in is the beverage for the Turkish person. Since there are only two beverages (hot-chocolate and tea), and the person in position 2 drinks hot-chocolate, the Turkish person in position 1 must drink tea.


Therefore, the completed table is:


#############
|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |   Tea   | Hot-Chocolate |

Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
This means that the person who likes adventure movies must be on the right, and the person who sings must be on the left.

2. The owner of the fish is on the far right.
This means that the person on the right has a fish as their pet.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |      1       |      2       |

| Pet           | Goat        | Fish        |

This solution satisfies both clues: the person who sings is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, and the owner of the fish is on the far right.

Lv1-3x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Place the dressmaker according to clue 2.
The dressmaker is on the far left. So, the job for person 1 is dressmaker.

|             |     1      |      2      |
| Job         | Dressmaker|             |
| Pet         |            |             |
| Transport   |            |             |

## Step 2: Use clue 1 to determine the transport for person 1.
Since the person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse, and we don't know who owns the mouse yet, we can't directly place the tram or bus. However, given that the dressmaker is already placed on the far left, if the tram were associated with the dressmaker, it would imply the mouse's owner must be to the right of the dressmaker (but still in column 1), which is impossible since there's no one to the right within the same column. Thus, we can infer that the tram cannot be directly placed yet without considering other clues.


## Step 3: Determine the pet for each person based on clue 1.
Given the tram is to the left of the mouse owner and knowing the dressmaker is on the far left, if the dressmaker were the mouse owner, it would contradict clue 1 because there's no one to the left of the dressmaker. So, we have two possibilities for the mouse owner: either person 2 owns the mouse, or we need more information.


## Step 4: Analyze transport options.
Since the tram must be to the left of the mouse owner and we've established the dressmaker is on the far left, if the dressmaker uses the tram, then person 2 must own the mouse. If not, and assuming the dressmaker doesn't own the mouse (because there's no one to the left of them), we have to consider who could own the mouse and use the other transport options.


## Step 5: Combining clues for final placement.
Given that the dressmaker is on the far left and must use a form of transport, and considering clue 1, if the tram user is to the left of the mouse owner, it suggests the dressmaker could be the tram user because there's no one to their left. This means person 2 would own the mouse. Since we have two jobs (dressmaker and electrician), two pets (mouse and pony), and two transports (tram and bus), and knowing the dressmaker is on the far left, we can start filling in the blanks.


## Step 6: Finalize placements based on remaining options.
- Job for person 1: Dressmaker
- Job for person 2: Electrician (since it's the only job left)
- Transport for person 1: Tram (considering clue 1 and previous steps)
- Transport for person 2: Bus (the only transport left)
- Pet for person 1: Pony (because if the tram user is to the left of the mouse owner, and the dressmaker/tram user can't own the mouse due to positional constraints)
- Pet for person 2: Mouse


The final answer is: 
#############
|             |     1      |      2      |
| Job         | Dressmaker| Electrician|

Lv1-3x2-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given statements:

1. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person whose hobby is gardening.
2. The person whose hobby is gardening is the person drinking Fanta.

From statement 2, we know the person who likes gardening drinks Fanta. 

Using statement 1, since the helicopter driver is to the left of the gardener, and given that there are only two people (thus two columns), this means the gardener must be in column 2 because if they were in column 1, there would be no one to their left.

So, we have:
- Gardening in column 2.
- Fanta in column 2 (because the gardener drinks Fanta).

Now, let's fill in what we can deduce:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |            |  Fanta    |
| Hobby       |            | Gardening|
| Transport   |            |           |

Since there are only two means of transport and the helicopter driver must be to the left of the gardener, the helicopter goes in column 1. This leaves roller for column 2.

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |            |  Fanta    |
| Hobby       |            | Gardening|
| Transport   | Helicopter |  Roller   |

Given that there are only two beverages (Fanta and Mirinda) and the gardener drinks Fanta, the person in column 1 must drink Mirinda.

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  Mirinda   |  Fanta    |
| Hobby       |            | Gardening|
| Transport   | Helicopter |  Roller   |

Lastly, since there are only two hobbies (camping and gardening) and gardening is in column 2, camping must be in column 1.

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  Mirinda   |  Fanta    |
| Hobby       | Camping    | Gardening|
| Transport   | Helicopter |  Roller   |

Therefore, the solution table is:

Lv1-3x2-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The hobbies are board-games and traveling.
2. The pets are a frog and a guinea-pig.
3. The means of transport are a motorbike and a quad-bike.

From clue 1, we know:
- The owner of the guinea-pig uses the quad-bike.

From clue 2, we understand:
- The owner of the frog is to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.

Given that there are only two people (columns 1 and 2), let's start by placing the guinea-pig owner, who must use the quad-bike, in one of the columns. Since we don't know which column yet, let's consider the second clue for placement.

If the frog owner is to the left of the board-games enthusiast, and assuming the board-games enthusiast can't be in the first column (since there needs to be someone to their left), this initially suggests the board-games enthusiast could only be in the second column. However, this interpretation was too hasty; the correct understanding should be that if the frog owner is to the left of the board-games person, and given we have two people, the frog must be in column 1, and the board-games hobbyist in column 2, because there's no one to the left of column 1.

Now, let's combine this with the first clue:
- The guinea-pig owner uses the quad-bike. Given that we've established the board-games enthusiast is likely in column 2 (because the frog, and thus its owner, must be to their left), and if we place the guinea-pig owner (who uses the quad-bike) in column 2, it fits because the clue about the frog being to the left of the board-games person would then accurately describe the arrangement with the frog in column 1.

So, we have:
- Column 1: Frog (because it's to the left of the board-games enthusiast)
- Column 2: Guinea-pig, and thus the quad-bike, with the hobby being board-games.

This leaves us with:
- The motorbike for column 1.
- Traveling as the hobby for column 1, since board-games is taken by column 2.

Thus, the final solution table is:

#############
|             |     1     |      2      |

Lv1-3x2-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. Hobbies: hiking, singing
2. Jobs: analyst, bartender
3. Sports: basketball, skiing
4. The person whose hobby is singing is to the left of the person whose sport is basketball.
5. The analyst is on the far right.

Given that we have two people and each has a unique hobby, job, and sport, let's start by placing the analyst as per clue 2:

|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   |           |            |
| Job     |           | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           |            |

From clue 4, since the person who likes singing must be to the left of the basketball player, and considering the analyst's position, we can start building the possibilities. However, without directly assigning jobs to hobbies or sports yet, let's consider the implications:

- The analyst (on the far right) could either like basketball or skiing, as there's no direct information linking the analyst to a specific sport.
- The person on the left has a hobby and must be involved in one of the two remaining activities not associated with the analyst.

Given clue 4, if the singing hobbyist is to the left of the basketball enthusiast, and considering the positions:

1. If the analyst likes basketball (since they have to be on the far right), then:
   - The person on the left must like singing.
   - The remaining sport for the analyst would indeed be basketball (as it fits with clue 4).
   - This leaves hiking for the hobby of the person on the right (analyst) or skiing as their sport, but since we've established basketball for them based on this scenario, let's correct the thought process to align with given clues directly.

2. Correcting our approach:
   - The analyst is on the far right.
   - Since the singing hobbyist must be to the left of the basketball player (clue 4), and without assigning jobs yet, let's think about hobbies and sports first:
     - If the person who likes singing is on the left, their sport could be either skiing or basketball. However, since they need to be to the left of the basketball player, it means their sport cannot be basketball if we're considering direct placements based on clues given.
   
Given these considerations and directly applying clue 4:

Let's assign the hobbies first, considering the singing person must be on the left:
|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   | Singing   | Hiking     |
| Job     |           |            |
| Sport   |           |            |

Now, applying clue 4 more directly with jobs and sports in mind:
- The person who likes singing (on the left) must be to the left of the basketball player. This implies the basketball player is on the right.
- Given the analyst is on the far right (clue 2), this means the analyst could indeed be the basketball player, as it satisfies both conditions.

Assigning jobs:
|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   | Singing   | Hiking     |
| Job     | Bartender | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           |            |

Finally, assigning sports based on previous deductions and clue 4:
- The singing person is to the left of the basketball player. Given our current setup, this means the skiing enthusiast must be on the left (singing), and the basketball enthusiast on the right.

So, the final solution table should look like this:

#############
|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   | Singing   | Hiking     |

Lv1-3x2-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:


1. Hobbies: cooking, skydiving
2. Sports: sailing, skateboarding
3. Transport: quad-bike, roller


Given clues:
- The person whose sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person whose hobby is cooking.
- The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.


From clue 2, we know the transport for person 1 is a quad-bike.


|             |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby       |           |               |
| Sport       |           |               |
| Transport   | quad-bike | roller        |


Clue 1 tells us that skateboarding must be on the right, and since cooking's position is not directly stated but implied to be related to the left due to its relation with skateboarding (skateboarding is on the right of cooking), we can infer the following:


- Person 1 (on the far left) has the quad-bike as their transport.
- Since the person who does skateboarding is to the right of the person whose hobby is cooking, and given that there are only two people (thus, two positions), cooking cannot be on the right. Hence, cooking must be the hobby for person 1.


|             |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby       | cooking  |               |
| Sport       |           |               |
| Transport   | quad-bike | roller        |


Given that skateboarding is to the right of cooking and there are only two positions, skateboarding must be associated with person 2.


|             |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby       | cooking  |               |
| Sport       |           | skateboarding|
| Transport   | quad-bike | roller        |


Now, since the hobbies are cooking and skydiving, and sports are sailing and skateboarding:


- Person 1 has cooking as a hobby.
- Person 2 has skateboarding as a sport.


The only combinations left for person 1's sport (since it can't be skateboarding) is sailing. For person 2's hobby (since it can't be cooking), it must be skydiving.


Therefore, the completed table looks like this:

Lv1-3x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking tea is the person who's sport is rowing.
2. The American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.

From clue 1, we can deduce that the person who likes rowing also likes tea. 

|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      |           |          |
| Nationality   |           |          |
| Sport         |           |          |

Let's fill in the sport and beverage for person 1:

|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      |  tea     |          |
| Nationality   |           |          |
| Sport         |  rowing  |          |

Now, from clue 2, we know that the American is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. This means person 1 must be a surfer and Malaysian (since if they were American, the clue wouldn't make sense as there would be no one to their left), and person 2 is American and does not surf.

|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      |  tea     |          |
| Nationality   | malaysian| american |
| Sport         |  rowing  | surfing |

However, this contradicts our initial placement of rowing with tea. Let's correct the sport for person 1 to surfing and leave the beverage as mirinda (since we already used tea), then adjust accordingly:

|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      | mirinda  |  tea    |
| Nationality   | malaysian| american|
| Sport         | surfing  | rowing  |

This setup satisfies both clues: the person drinking tea (person 2) is the one whose sport is rowing, and the American (person 2) is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing (person 1).

* The people prefer 2 different music-genres: indie, punk
* The people use 2 different means of transport: taxi, train
* The fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train
* The person watching thriller movies is the person driving the taxi

From statement 2, we know that the person watching thriller movies drives a taxi. This means the other person (who watches time-travel movies) must drive the train.

Statement 1 tells us that the fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train. Since there are only two people, this means the fan of punk cannot be driving the train. Therefore, the fan of indie music must be driving the train (and watching time-travel movies).

The other person drives a taxi, watches thriller movies, and must listen to punk music.

Lv1-3x2-10	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Identify the given information
We have two favourite beverages (juice and lemonade), two movie genres (adventure and scientific), and two means of transport (airplane and bike). There are two people involved.


## Step 2: Apply the first clue
The person watching scientific movies drinks lemonade. This gives us a direct association between a movie genre and a beverage.


## Step 3: Apply the second clue
The person drinking lemonade is to the left of the person driving the bike. Since there are only two people, this means the person drinking lemonade cannot be driving the bike.


## Step 4: Deduce from the clues
Given that the person watching scientific movies drinks lemonade (Step 2) and this person is to the left of the bike rider (Step 3), we can start filling in the table. The person on the left must watch scientific movies and drink lemonade.


## Step 5: Fill in the table based on deductions
Since the person drinking lemonade watches scientific movies and is on the left, the other person (on the right) must watch adventure movies and drink juice (because there are only two options for each category). The person on the left cannot drive the bike (as per clue 2), so they must travel by airplane, leaving the bike for the person on the right.


The final answer is:
