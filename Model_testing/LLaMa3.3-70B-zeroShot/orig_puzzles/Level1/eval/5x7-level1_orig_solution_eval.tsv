Lv1-5x7-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I will attempt to solve the logic puzzle.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the australian and the person eating kiwi
From clue 16, the person eating kiwi is on the far left. However, clue 22 states that the australian is on the far left. Clue 23 also places the person who's sport is cricket on the far left. Since there can only be one person on the far left, we must reconcile these clues. Given the information, it seems there might have been an oversight in the initial interpretation. The correct approach should consider all clues systematically.


## Step 2: Reconcile clues for the far left position
Clue 22 explicitly states the australian is on the far left, and clue 23 says the person who's sport is cricket is also on the far left. This implies the australian's sport could be cricket, as both conditions need to be true.


## Step 3: Position the person eating corn and the person whose sport is ice-hockey
From clue 2, the person eating corn is in the middle, and from clue 6, the person whose sport is ice-hockey is also in the middle. This suggests that the same person might be eating corn and enjoying ice-hockey, as there can only be one ""middle"" position if we consider a linear arrangement without specifying which is more central if there are an even number of positions.


## Step 4: Place the nigerian
Clue 19 states the nigerian is in the middle. Given that clue 2 and clue 6 already suggest a confluence of characteristics (eating corn and enjoying ice-hockey) for someone in the middle, it seems plausible that this person could also be the nigerian, especially since no other clues directly contradict this or specify another nationality for the middle position.


## Step 5: Determine the positions based on given conditions
From clue 13, the fan of reggae is on the left of the indonesian. Clue 24 states the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the brazilian. We must integrate these with other clues to establish a coherent order.


## Step 6: Apply additional constraints
Clue 1 indicates the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the person whose sport is surfing. Clue 3 places the nurse on the right of the fan of ambient, and clue 18 specifies the nurse as the fan of classical. Clue 5 states the fan of ambient is on the right of the chinese.


## Step 7: Synthesize information to fill in the table
Given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach, let's synthesize key points:
- The australian is on the far left (clue 22) and could be associated with cricket (clue 23).
- The person eating kiwi must then be immediately next or related to the australian in some manner not directly stated but implied through elimination.
- The nigerian, who eats corn and possibly enjoys ice-hockey, is central.
- Other positions are determined by relative clues (e.g., clue 4 for disco and pilot, clue 11 for soul and dancer).


## Step 8: Finalize positions
Given the vast number of clues and the complexity of directly solving each step without visual aid or a more detailed breakdown due to format constraints, we deduce key placements:
- Australian on the far left, associated with cricket.
- The person eating corn (nigerian) is central, possibly enjoying ice-hockey.
- Other positions are filled based on relative clues.


The final answer is: $\boxed{#############

So, the person who's hobby is traveling must be at position 1.

From clue 3, we know the person driving the train is on the right of the person watching family movies. From clue 1, we know the person driving the train is on the left of the librarian. So, the person watching family movies must be at position 1 or 2, and the train must be at position 3 or more.

From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is writing is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. From clue 8, we know the entrepreneur is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. So, the entrepreneur must be at position 5 or less.

From clue 18, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. So, the jet-ski must be at position 4 or less, and sudoku must be at position 5 or more.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. From clue 21, we know the person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is video-games. So, the person who's sport is soccer must be at position 1 or 2.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the entrepreneur. From clue 4, we know the security-guard is the person who's sport is climbing. From clue 17, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person watching disaster movies. So, the person who's sport is climbing must be at position 3 or less.

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the scientist. From clue 15, we know the scientist is the person who's sport is golf. So, the person who's sport is cricket must be at position 5 or more.

Lv1-5x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we get it.


Given:
- The scooter is on the far left.
- The superhero movies are on the far left.
- Tomato is on the far right.
- Almond-milk is on the far right.

Let's start with what we know from the beginning:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |     5     |    6     |      7      |

| Food          |           |            |          |           |           |          |             |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero |            |          |           |           |          |             |
| Nationality   |           |            |          |           |           |          |             |
| Transport     | Scooter   |            |          |           |           |          |             |

From clue 25, the person watching superhero movies is on the far left.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 22
The van is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means 7up cannot be in position 6 or 7 because there needs to be space for the van after it.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 3
Coffee is on the right of 7up. Since we don't know where 7up is yet, let's keep this in mind for later.


## Step 3: Use Clue 17
The van is on the left of the person eating radish. Radish is eaten by the French (Clue 5).


## Step 4: Apply Clue 1
Blueberry is on the left of the Indonesian.


## Step 5: Consider Clue 8 and Clue 9
Turkish is on the left of crime movies and also on the left of cherry. This means Turkish cannot be in position 7 because it needs to be before both crime movies and cherry.


## Step 6: Use Clue 20
Crime movies are on the right of lemon.


## Step 7: Apply Clue 13
Zucchini is on the right of crime movies.


## Step 8: Consider Clue 6
Zucchini is on the left of documentary movies. This helps us place zucchini and documentary in relation to crime movies.


## Step 9: Piece Together with Remaining Clues
With all these clues, let's start placing people:


- Since the scooter is far left (Clue 21) and superhero movies are also far left (Clue 25), we can combine these.
- The van is after 7up (Clue 22), and before radish/French (Clue 17).
- Coffee is after 7up (Clue 3), and musical movies are after coffee (Clue 10).
- Iced-tea is after action movies (Clue 11).
- The taxi is before tomato (Clue 12), which is far right.
- Sprite is before tomato (Clue 16) and the Dutch/bike is after sprite (Clue 18).


Let's make some educated placements based on these clues:


Given the complexity and the step-by-step nature required for a precise solution, we'll summarize key points to deduce the arrangement:


1. **Scooter & Superhero**: Far left.
2. **Van after 7up**: Van in position 3 or later if 7up is in position 2 or earlier.
3. **Coffee after 7up**, and **Musical after Coffee**.
4. **Radish/French** after van (in Clue 17).
5. **Turkish before Crime** and before Cherry.
6. **Zucchini after Crime** and before Documentary.
7. **Lemon before Crime**.
8. **Dutch/Bike after Sprite**, which is before Tomato.


Considering all clues, let's fill in what we can directly:


- The far left is the scooter and superhero movies (Clues 21 & 25).
- The far right is almond-milk and tomato (Clue 26).


Direct placements from specific clues are challenging without a visual aid for each step. However, by following the clues methodically, we can infer many positions:


## Step 10: Final Placement
Let's attempt to place everything based on our deductions:


Given:
- Superhero movies and scooter are at position 1.
- Almond-milk and tomato are at position 7.


Using all clues to fill in the gaps, here is a possible arrangement (keeping in mind that without visual step-by-step, some deductions might require iterative refinements):

| Beverage      | Sprite   | 7up        | Coffee  | Iced-tea  | Juice    | Tea     | Almond-milk |

17. The person eating lime is on the left of the person eating asparagus.
18. The person driving the snowmobile is in the middle (this also conflicts with clues 5, 10, and 12).
19. The person eating mango is on the left of the japanese.
20. The pakistani is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
21. The german is the person driving the taxi.
22. The person driving the quad-bike is the person drinking almond-milk.
23. The person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
24. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left.

From clue 4, we know the tram is at position 7.


Given the conflicts in clues regarding the middle position (clues 5, 10, 12, and 18), we need to carefully consider how these can coexist. Clue 10 places coffee in the middle, which seems like a strong starting point since it doesn't conflict with any other ""middle"" placement directly.


Clue 24 tells us magic-tricks is on the far left (position 1).


Using clue 8 and knowing the tram's position from clue 4, we can start building from the right. Since 7up must be to the left of the tram and pear is to the right of 7up but can't be in position 7 (because tram is there), there seems to be a misunderstanding in how these clues fit together based on initial interpretations.


Clue 2 places pear to the right of 7up, and clue 1 places the tram to the right of 7up. Given the tram is at position 7, this means 7up cannot be at position 6 because there needs to be a person eating pear between them or the statements are inconsistent with each other.


Let's correct our approach considering all clues systematically:


1. Magic-tricks (hobby) is on the far left (position 1).
2. The chinese (nationality) is on the left of the helicopter (transport), but we don't know where this fits yet.
3. Given the constraints, let's place coffee in the middle as per clue 10, and see if other clues can fit around it without violating any conditions.


Since there are multiple conflicting interpretations possible based on these clues and my explanations might have caused confusion by not directly leading to a singular solution table due to the complexities and potential for misinterpretation of the given clues, let's clarify:


The direct solution requires meticulously applying each clue in a way that respects all given conditions without assuming information not provided. Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step deduction based on each clue, creating the final table here would require resolving the apparent conflicts and accurately placing each item according to the clues.


Given this, let's simplify our approach to directly state the solution based on careful analysis of all clues:
