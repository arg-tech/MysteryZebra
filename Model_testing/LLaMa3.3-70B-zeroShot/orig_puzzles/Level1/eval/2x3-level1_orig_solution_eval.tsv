Lv1-2x3-1	"To solve this puzzle, we can start by applying the given conditions one by one.


## Step 1: Apply condition 3 to determine the beverage for position 1.
The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left, so position 1's beverage is almond-milk.


## Step 2: Use condition 1 to identify the sport in the middle position.
The person whose sport is rugby is in the middle, which means position 2's sport is rugby.


## Step 3: Apply condition 2 to find out the beverage and sport for the remaining positions.
Since the person drinking juice is the person whose sport is surfing, we can place surfing and its corresponding beverage (juice) in either position 1 or 3. However, because almond-milk is already assigned to position 1, surfing and juice must go to position 3.


## Step 4: Fill in the remaining blanks based on the process of elimination.
- Position 1 has almond-milk as its beverage (from step 1) and cannot be rugby (since rugby is in position 2), and it also cannot be surfing (because surfing is paired with juice, which is now in position 3). Thus, the sport for position 1 must be biathlon.
- Position 2 has rugby as its sport (from step 2) but does not have almond-milk or juice as its beverage. Therefore, coffee must be the beverage for position 2.
- Position 3 has surfing as its sport and juice as its beverage (from step 3).

From clue 2, we know the Canadian is on the far left, so the table becomes:

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the Canadian is already on the far left, the Argentine must be in the middle, and the person drinking tea must be on the right. The table becomes:

Now, we know the beverages are fanta, iced-tea, and tea, and we already have iced-tea on the left. We also know the person drinking tea is on the right. The only beverage left for the middle is fanta. The table becomes:

Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish.
2. The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish.

From clue 3, we know that soy-milk is on the left of radish. 

From clue 1, we know that tea is on the right of radish.

So, the order for radish is: soy-milk - radish - tea

Now, let's look at clue 2: water is on the left of raspberry.

Since there are only three positions, and radish is already in the middle, raspberry must be on the right (position 3), and water must be on the left (position 1).

The only food left is plum, which must go with soy-milk (position 2 is taken by radish).

So, the completed table is:

From clue 3, we know that the person with the hobby of woodworking is on the far left. So, the table looks like this:


|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |

| Hobby   | Woodworking |            |             |


From clue 1, we know that the person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means the person eating radish must be in either column 2 or 3.


From clue 2, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person with woodworking is already on the far left (column 1), the person with card-games must be in column 2, and the person eating pomegranate must be in column 3.


So, the table now looks like this:


|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Food    |             |            |             |

The only hobby left is puzzles, which must be in column 3. Now we have:

| Hobby   | Woodworking | Card-games | Puzzles     |


From clue 1, the person eating radish is on the right of the person with woodworking. Since woodworking is in column 1, radish must be in either column 2 or 3. But from our current setup, if radish were in column 3, it would violate clue 2 (pomegranate being on the right of card-games). Therefore, radish must be in column 2.


From clue 2, pomegranate is on the right of card-games. So, pomegranate must be in column 3.


The only food left is zucchini, which must be in column 1.


So, the final solution table is:

Lv1-2x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person driving the trike owns the hedgehog.
2. The person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the bird.
3. The owner of the hedgehog (who drives the trike) is on the right of the person driving the airplane.
4. The owner of the bird is in the middle.

From clue 4, we know the order is: _ - Bird - _

From clue 2, since the trike driver is on the right of the bird owner and the bird owner is in the middle, the trike (and thus the hedgehog) must be on the rightmost position.

From clue 3, since the hedgehog owner (trike driver) is on the right of the airplane driver, and knowing the hedgehog owner is on the far right, the airplane must be in the leftmost position.

So, we have: Airplane - Bird - Trike

Now, let's match pets with their owners based on transport:

- The person driving the airplane cannot own the bird (because the bird's owner is in the middle) and cannot own the hedgehog (because the hedgehog's owner drives the trike). So, the airplane driver must own the guinea-pig.
- The bird's owner is in the middle.
- The hedgehog's owner drives the trike.

Thus, the solution table looks like this:

Lv1-2x3-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person driving the boat.
2. The person eating plum is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
3. The person eating strawberry is the person driving the boat.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the boat eats strawberry. Combining this with clue 1, we get:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        | Strawberry |           |       |
| Transport   | Boat       |           |       |

Now, let's consider clue 1 again: the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person driving the boat. This means that the person eating kiwi must be in column 2 or 3. Since the person driving the boat is in column 1 and eats strawberry, we can place the person eating kiwi in column 2 or 3.

Clue 2 states that the person eating plum is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. This means that the person eating plum must be in column 2 or 3, and the person driving the motorbike must be in column 1 or 2.

Let's try to place the motorbike driver in column 2:

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        | Strawberry |           |       |
| Transport   | Boat       | Motorbike |       |

Now, we can place the person eating plum in column 3 (since they are to the right of the motorbike driver):

|             |     1      |     2     |   3   |
| Food        | Strawberry |           | Plum  |
| Transport   | Boat       | Motorbike |       |

The only food left is kiwi, which must be in column 2 (since it's to the right of the boat driver and not already occupied by plum):

Lv1-2x3-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The person whose hobby is card-games is on the right of the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
3. The person eating peach is the person whose hobby is card-games.

From clue 3, we know that peach and card-games go together.

Using clue 1, since card-games (which goes with peach) must be to the right of asparagus, the order for these two items is: asparagus, peach (card-games).

Clue 2 tells us pomegranate is to the left of skydiving. Given that we already have asparagus and peach/card-games in a sequence, and knowing there are only three positions, pomegranate must be on the left end because it has to be to the left of skydiving.

So, we can deduce the following sequences:
- Food: pomegranate, asparagus, peach
- For hobbies, since card-games is with peach (from clue 3), and knowing from clue 1 that card-games must be to the right of asparagus, and from clue 2 that pomegranate is to the left of skydiving, we can conclude:
  - Pomegranate (which has to be on the left) must go with camping (since peach/card-games is already determined, and skydiving has to be after pomegranate).
  - Asparagus then must go with skydiving because it's the only combination left that fits all clues.
  - Peach goes with card-games.

Therefore, the final solution table looks like this:

2. The owner of the rabbit is on the far right (column 3).
3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.


From clue 3, we know the order of hobbies is: puzzles, filmmaking. Since filmmaking is on the right of puzzles and there are only three columns, puzzles must be in column 1, and filmmaking must be in column 2.


Now, using clue 1, we know the person with the hobby filmmaking (column 2) owns a horse.


Clue 2 tells us the rabbit's owner is in column 3. This means the remaining pet, the rat, must belong to the person in column 1, whose hobby is puzzles.


The only hobby left for column 3 is chess, as filmmaking and puzzles are already assigned.

Lv1-2x3-10	"To solve this puzzle, we'll analyze each clue step by step.


## Step 1: Analyzing Clue 1
The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This means the zombie movie watcher cannot be in column 1 if the sprite drinker is in column 2 or 3, but since there's no restriction about the zombie movie watcher being in column 3 directly from this clue, we need to consider other clues for more information.


## Step 2: Analyzing Clue 2
The person watching zombie movies is on the far right. This directly places the zombie movie genre in column 3, meaning whoever drinks a beverage in column 3 must watch zombie movies.


## Step 3: Analyzing Clue 3
The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking tea. This implies that if tea is not in column 1, then adventure cannot be in column 3 (since it has to be to the left of tea), but given the restrictions from other clues, we can deduce more specific placements.


## Step 4: Combining Clues
Given clue 2, zombie movies are in column 3. From clue 1, since zombie movies are on the far right, sprite cannot be in column 3 (because zombie is to the right of sprite), so sprite must be in either column 1 or 2.


## Step 5: Further Deductions
If sprite were in column 3, it would contradict clue 2 because zombie needs to be on the far right. Thus, considering all clues:
- Zombie movies are in column 3.
- Sprite cannot be in column 3 (must be in column 1 or 2).
- The adventure movie watcher must be to the left of the tea drinker.


## Step 6: Finalizing Positions
Given that zombie is in column 3 and considering clue 1, sprite must be in column 1 or 2. But since the person watching zombie movies is on the far right (column 3), and they need to be to the right of the sprite drinker, sprite cannot be in column 3 but also cannot be in column 3 if it's to be to the left of zombie. Therefore:
- Column 1: Must have sprite because it has to be to the left of zombie movies (in column 3), and for adventure to be on the left of tea, tea must then be in column 2.
- Column 2: Tea
- Column 3: Zombie


## Step 7: Final Beverage Placement
Given the movie genres' placement:
- Column 1 has sprite and since it's also to the left of tea (based on clue 3), adventure movies are here.
- Column 2 has tea, so comedy must be here because zombie is in column 3 and adventure is in column 1.
- Column 3: Zombie movies, which leaves cola as the only beverage left for this spot.


The final answer is:
