Lv1-1x2-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step based on the information given:


## Step 1: Understanding the Foods and Their Positions
We have two types of food: asparagus and spinach. The clue tells us that the person eating asparagus is to the left of the person eating spinach.


## Step 2: Applying the Clue to the Table
Given the table structure:

|        |     1     |    2    |
| Food   |           |         |

And knowing that the person eating asparagus must be to the left of the person eating spinach, we can deduce the following:


- Asparagus must be in position 1 because it needs to be to the left of spinach.
- Spinach must then be in position 2.


## Step 3: Filling Out the Table
Based on our deductions:

|        |     1     |    2    |
| Food   | Asparagus | Spinach |


The final answer is: 
#############
|        |     1     |    2    |
| Food   | Asparagus | Spinach |

Lv1-1x2-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which movie genre corresponds to each position in the table based on the given clues.


Given:
- There are two different movie genres: documentary and family.
- The person watching family movies is on the far right.

Since there are only two positions (1 and 2) and the person watching family movies is on the far right, this means that position 2 corresponds to ""family"" movies. Therefore, by deduction, position 1 must correspond to ""documentary"" since these are the only two genres mentioned.


So, the table should look like this:


#############
|               |      1      |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Family |

Lv1-1x2-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which person prefers which music genre based on the given clues.


## Step 1: Identify the clue about the house music fan.
The clue states that ""the fan of house is on the far right."" This means in a two-person setup where one person is on the left (position 1) and the other on the right (position 2), the person who likes house music must be in position 2.


## Step 2: Determine the genre for each position based on the clue.
Given that the fan of house music is on the far right, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Music-Genre   |  1  |   2   |
|               | R&B | House |

The reasoning here is simple: since there are only two genres mentioned (house and r&b) and we've established that house is on the far right (position 2), the remaining genre, r&b, must be on the left (position 1).


The final answer is: 
#############
| Music-Genre   |  1  |   2   |
|               | R&B | House |

## Step 1: Understand the clue
The clue states that the fan of pop is on the left of the fan of country. This means in a lineup or table setting where positions are considered from left to right, the pop fan will always be positioned before (to the left of) the country music fan.

Given the table structure:


|               |  1  |    2    |
