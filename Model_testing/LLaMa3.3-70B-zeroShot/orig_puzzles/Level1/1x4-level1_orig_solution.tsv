Lv1-1x4-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 1
The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of soul. This means the order for these two genres is Ambient -> Soul, but we don't know their positions relative to the other genres yet.


## Step 2: Analyze Clue 2
The fan of country is on the right of the fan of r&b. This gives us the order R&B -> Country.


## Step 3: Analyze Clue 3
The fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of country. Combining this with the information from step 2, we get R&B -> Country -> Ambient. Since Ambient must be to the left of Soul (from step 1), the final order for all genres is R&B -> Country -> Ambient -> Soul.


## Step 4: Fill in the Table
Based on the analysis, the table should look like this:


|               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | Country | Ambient | Soul |


The final answer is: 
#############
|               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | Country | Ambient | Soul |

Lv1-1x4-2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to follow the given clues:


1. The owner of the turtle is on the far right.
2. The owner of the bird is on the far left.
3. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the bird.


From clue 2, we know the bird is in position 1.


|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird |       |            |        |


From clue 3, since the mouse must be to the right of the bird, and considering the bird is already placed on the far left (position 1), the mouse can either be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, from clue 1, we know the turtle is on the far right, which means it occupies position 4.


|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird |       |            | Turtle |


Given that the turtle is in position 4 and the bird is in position 1, and knowing the mouse must be to the right of the bird (clue 3), if we place the mouse in position 2, it satisfies all conditions so far.


|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Mouse |            | Turtle |


The only pet left to place is the guinea-pig, which must go into the remaining empty slot, position 3.


|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Turtle |


Therefore, the final solution table with '#############' around it is:


#############
|       |  1   |   2   |     3      |   4    |
| Pet   | Bird | Mouse | Guinea-pig | Turtle |

Lv1-1x4-3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each statement carefully.


## Step 1: Determine the order based on the first clue
From clue 1, we know the person whose hobby is puzzles is to the left of the person whose hobby is baking. This gives us an initial order: Puzzles - Baking.


## Step 2: Incorporate the second clue into our analysis
Clue 2 tells us that Board-games is to the left of Rock-climbing, giving us another sequence: Board-games - Rock-climbing.


## Step 3: Use the third clue to finalize the order
Clue 3 indicates that Board-games is to the right of Baking. Combining this with our sequences from Steps 1 and 2, we can start building a comprehensive order. Since Board-games must be after Baking but before Rock-climbing, and Puzzles must be before Baking, we get: Puzzles - Baking - Board-games - Rock-climbing.


## Step 4: Construct the final table
Based on our analysis, the hobbies in order from left to right are: Puzzles, Baking, Board-games, Rock-climbing. Let's fill in the table:


|         |    1    |   2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby   | Puzzles | Baking | Board-games | Rock-climbing |


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |    1    |   2    |      3      |       4       |
| Hobby   | Puzzles | Baking | Board-games | Rock-climbing |

Lv1-1x4-4	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the information given:

1. The person driving the roller is on the far left.
2. The person driving the van is on the far right.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the van.

Given these clues, we can start filling in the table. Since the roller is on the far left and the van is on the far right, our initial setup looks like this:

|             |   1    |  2   |    3    |  4  |
| Transport   | Roller |      |         | Van |

Now, we know from clue 3 that the jet-ski must be to the left of the van. This means it can either be in position 2 or 3 since the roller is already occupying position 1 and the van is in position 4.

However, if the jet-ski were in position 3, there would be no room for the bike (the remaining transport) because the van has to be on the far right. Therefore, the jet-ski must be in position 2, leaving position 3 for the bike:

|             |   1    |  2   |    3    |  4  |
| Transport   | Roller | Jet-ski | Bike | Van |

So, the final solution table is:


#############
|             |   1    |  2   |    3    |  4  |
| Transport   | Roller | Jet-ski | Bike | Van |

Lv1-1x4-5	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down based on the clues given:


1. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.


Given these clues, we can start filling in the table:


- Lacrosse must be in position 1 (far left).
- Baseball must be in position 4 (far right).
- Parkour must be to the left of Baseball, but since Lacrosse is already on the far left, Parkour cannot be next to Lacrosse. Therefore, Parkour must be in either position 2 or 3.


Considering the placement rules:
- If Parkour were in position 3, there would be no space for Cycling before Baseball (since Parkour has to be directly to the left of Baseball according to a strict interpretation of the clues). However, this is not entirely accurate as the clue only specifies Parkour is to the left of Baseball, allowing for other sports between them.
- Thus, Parkour can indeed be in position 3, with Cycling taking position 2.


The final arrangement based on these deductions is:


#############
|         |    1     |    2    |    3    |    4     |
| Sport   | Lacrosse | Cycling | Parkour | Baseball |

Lv1-1x4-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze the clues given:

1. The person watching animation movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.

From clue 1, we know animation is at position 4.

From clue 2, since animation is at position 4 and it's to the right of martial-arts, martial-arts must be at position 3.

From clue 3, since martial-arts is at position 3 and it's to the right of musical, musical must be at position 2. 

The only genre left is satire, which must then be at position 1 because all other positions are filled.

So, the order from left to right is: satire, musical, martial-arts, animation.

Lv1-1x4-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating orange.
2. The person eating peas is on the left of the person eating orange.
3. The person eating raspberry is on the left of the person eating peas.

From clue 3, we know the order is: raspberry, peas, ...

From clue 2, we know the order is: ..., peas, orange, ...

Combining these, we get: raspberry, peas, orange, ...

From clue 1, we know nectarine is on the right of orange, so the final order is: raspberry, peas, orange, nectarine

Here is the solution table:


#############

Lv1-1x4-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step based on the clues given:

1. The person driving the skateboard is on the far left.
2. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
3. The person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the trike.

From clue 1, we know the order starts with the skateboard.

From clue 3, we understand the sequence must include trike -> jet-ski (since the jet-ski is to the right of the trike).

Combining this with clue 2, which states the tram is to the right of the jet-ski, we get a full sequence: trike -> jet-ski -> tram.

However, we need to incorporate the skateboard being on the far left. So, the complete sequence from left to right must be: skateboard -> trike -> jet-ski -> tram.

Thus, the solution table is:

#############
|             |     1      |   2   |    3    |  4   |
| Transport   | skateboard | trike | jet-ski | tram |

Lv1-1x4-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given:

1. The fan of reggae is to the right of the fan of soul.
2. The fan of electronic is to the left of the fan of soul.
3. The fan of reggae is to the left of the fan of d&b.

From point 2, we know the order starts with electronic and then soul.

So, we have: Electronic, Soul, ...

From point 1, since reggae is to the right of soul, it comes after soul.

Now we have: Electronic, Soul, Reggae, ...

And from point 3, since reggae is to the left of d&b, d&b must come last.

So, the complete order is: Electronic, Soul, Reggae, D&B.

Here is the solution table:

Lv1-1x4-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person driving the car is on the far right.
3. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left.

Given these clues, we can start filling in the table:

- Since the motorbike is on the far left (clue 3), it must be in position 1.
- The car is on the far right (clue 2), so it must be in position 4.
- The bus is to the right of the bike (clue 1). Given that positions 1 and 4 are already determined, the only way this can fit is if the bike is in position 2 and the bus is in position 3.

So, the final arrangement should look like this:

#############
|             |     1     |  2   |  3  |  4  |
| Transport   | motorbike | bike | bus | car |
