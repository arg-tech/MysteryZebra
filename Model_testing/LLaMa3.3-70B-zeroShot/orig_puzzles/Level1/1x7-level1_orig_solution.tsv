Lv1-1x7-1	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


1. The Egyptian is in the middle: This means the Egyptian must be in position 4 since there are 7 positions and the middle one would be the 4th.
   
2. The Egyptian is on the left of the French: Given the Egyptian is in position 4, the French must then be in position 5.

3. The Mexican is on the right of the Italian: We don't know their exact positions yet, but we know the Italian cannot be in position 7 because there needs to be room for the Mexican on the right.

4. The Dutch is on the right of the French: Since the French is in position 5, the Dutch must be in position 6.

5. The Thai is on the far left: This places the Thai in position 1.

6. The Nigerian is on the right of the Dutch: With the Dutch in position 6, the Nigerian must then be in position 7.


Now, let's fill in what we have so far:


|               |  1   |    2    |    3    |    4     |   5    |   6   |    7     |
| Nationality   | Thai |         |         | Egyptian | French | Dutch | Nigerian |

The only ones left to place are the Italian and the Mexican. From clue 3, we know the Mexican is on the right of the Italian. Given that positions 2 and 3 are the only ones available for both to fit (since the Italian needs to be to the left of the Mexican), they must occupy these spots in the order: Italian, Mexican.


So, the completed table looks like this:

Lv1-1x7-2	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by filling in the information we know for sure:

1. The teacher is on the far right: 
   - Column 7: Teacher

2. The analyst is on the far left:
   - Column 1: Analyst

3. The analyst is on the left of the manager:
   - Since the analyst is in column 1, the manager must be in column 2.
   - Column 1: Analyst
   - Column 2: Manager

4. The manager is on the left of the entrepreneur:
   - Given the manager is in column 2, the entrepreneur must be to the right of the manager but not necessarily directly next to them due to other constraints.
   - Column 1: Analyst
   - Column 2: Manager
   - (Entrepreneur's position is after the manager but needs further clarification)

5. The librarian is on the right of the nurse:
   - This means the nurse must come before the librarian, but we don't have their exact positions yet.

6. The teacher is on the right of the doctor:
   - Since the teacher is in column 7, the doctor must be to the left of the teacher.
   - Column 7: Teacher
   - Column 6: Doctor (because it's the only position that allows the teacher to be directly after the doctor)

Given these clues, let's assemble what we can:

- Column 1: Analyst
- Column 2: Manager
- Column 6: Doctor
- Column 7: Teacher

The entrepreneur must come after the manager but before or after other professions not yet placed. Since the nurse and librarian also need to be placed with the nurse before the librarian, and considering the constraints:

- The entrepreneur can fit into column 3 because it needs to be after the manager (column 2) and there's flexibility for where exactly it goes as long as it's after the manager.
- Column 3: Entrepreneur

Now we have:
- Column 1: Analyst
- Column 2: Manager
- Column 3: Entrepreneur
- Column 6: Doctor
- Column 7: Teacher

We need to place the nurse and librarian, remembering that the librarian is on the right of the nurse. Given the doctor's placement in column 6, we have columns 4 and 5 for the nurse and librarian.

- If the nurse were in column 5, there wouldn't be room for the librarian to the right of the nurse (since column 6 is taken by the doctor), so the nurse must be in column 4.
- Column 4: Nurse
- Column 5: Librarian

This satisfies all conditions given:
- The analyst is on the far left.
- The teacher is on the far right.
- The manager is after the analyst.
- The entrepreneur is after the manager.
- The nurse is before the librarian.
- The doctor is before the teacher.

The final solution table looks like this:

Lv1-1x7-3	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the clues step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose hobby is drawing.
Given that the person who's hobby is drawing is in the middle, and since there are 7 people (an odd number), the middle position would be the 4th position. So, the 4th column will be filled with ""drawing"".


## Step 2: Place the person whose hobby is fishing.
The clue states that the person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right, which means they are in the 7th position.


## Step 3: Determine the relative positions of card-games and fishing.
Since the person who's hobby is fishing is to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, and given that fishing is in the 7th position, card-games must be to the left of fishing but not necessarily directly next to it.


## Step 4: Place woodworking relative to card-games.
The person whose hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. This clue helps to establish a sequence but doesn't give an exact position yet.


## Step 5: Establish the sequence involving board-games, rock-climbing, and sudoku.
Given that the person whose hobby is board-games is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing, and sudoku is on the right of board-games, we have a sequence: rock-climbing -> board-games -> sudoku.


## Step 6: Combine all clues to find a possible arrangement.
- Drawing is in the middle (4th position).
- Fishing is on the far right (7th position).
- Card-games must be before fishing but after woodworking.
- The sequence of rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku needs to fit around drawing and before card-games or after, considering the constraints.


## Step 7: Attempt a placement for woodworking and card-games.
Since woodworking is to the left of card-games, and considering fishing's position, we need to find space for these hobbies. Given that drawing occupies the middle (4th position), and if we consider the sequence involving rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku, it seems reasonable to place this sequence before or after drawing.


## Step 8: Final placement attempt.
Let's try placing woodworking, card-games, and fishing with the constraints:
- Woodworking must be before card-games.
- Fishing is at the end (7th position).
Considering all sequences and constraints:
1. Woodworking
2. Card-games doesn't fit here because we need to account for rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku's sequence.
Let's place rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku before drawing or after, considering the drawing is in the 4th position.


## Step 9: Finalize positions based on all clues.
Given that fishing is at the end (7th), and drawing is in the middle (4th), we can start building around these fixed points:
- Drawing is in the 4th position.
- Fishing is in the 7th position.
Let's consider placing rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku before drawing because after drawing, we have card-games and then fishing, with woodworking before card-games.


## Step 10: Place remaining hobbies.
Considering all clues:
1. Woodworking can't be directly next to drawing due to the need for card-games to be between woodworking and fishing.
2. Rock-climbing, board-games, and sudoku must fit in a way that respects the order and other clues.


The final answer is: 
#############
|         |       1       |      2      |   3    |    4    |      5      |     6      |    7    |

Lv1-1x7-4	"To solve this puzzle, we need to follow each clue carefully and place the nationalities accordingly.


## Step 1: Place the Spanish nationality
The Spanish is on the far left, so we start with that.
| Nationality   | Spanish |         |            |         |          |         |         |

## Step 2: Place the Egyptian and Australian nationalities
The Egyptian is on the left of the Australian. Since the Spanish is already on the far left, the Egyptian and Australian must be in the next two spots.
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Australian |         |          |         |         |

## Step 3: Place the Mexican nationality
The Mexican is on the far right.
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Australian |         |          |         | Mexican |

## Step 4: Place the Italian nationality
The Italian is on the left of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is on the far right, the Italian must be in the spot immediately to the left of the Mexican.
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Australian |         |          | Italian | Mexican |

## Step 5: Place the British nationality
The British is in the middle. With the current arrangement, the middle spot would be between the Australian and the empty spot before the Italian.
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Australian | British |          | Italian | Mexican |

## Step 6: Place the Canadian nationality
The only spot left for the Canadian is the one that hasn't been filled yet, which is between the British and the Italian.
| Nationality   | Spanish | Egyptian | Australian | British | Canadian | Italian | Mexican |

## Step 7: Finalize the table
Now we have all nationalities placed according to the clues.

Lv1-1x7-5	"To solve this puzzle, we will apply each rule step by step.


## Step 1: Apply Rule 2
The owner of the turtle is on the far left.
|       |   1    |    2     |   3    |   4   |    5     |     6      |   7   |
| Pet   | Turtle |          |        |       |          |            |       |

## Step 2: Apply Rule 5
The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
|       |   1    |    2     |   3    |   4   |    5     |     6      |   7   |
| Pet   | Turtle | Hedgehog |        |       |          |            |       |

## Step 3: Apply Rule 4
The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the lizard.
Since the hedgehog is already in position 2, the lizard must be to its right.

## Step 4: Apply Rule 1
The owner of the snake is in the middle.
Given there are 7 positions, the middle would be position 4.
|       |   1    |    2     |   3    |   4   |    5     |     6      |   7   |
| Pet   | Turtle | Hedgehog | Lizard | Snake|          |            |       |

## Step 5: Apply Rule 6
The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
This means the goldfish must be to the right of the snake.
|       |   1    |    2     |   3    |   4   |    5     |     6      |   7   |

## Step 6: Apply Rule 3
The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.
So, the guinea-pig must be in position 6 or 7. Since there's only one spot left that fits all conditions without contradicting previous placements, and considering we have to place the mouse as well, the guinea-pig should be placed after the goldfish, leaving the last spot for the mouse.

Lv1-1x7-6	"To solve this puzzle, let's follow the clues step by step.


1. The person whose hobby is photography is on the left of the person whose hobby is writing.
2. The person whose hobby is photography is on the far left.
3. The person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person whose hobby is skydiving.
4. The person whose hobby is hiking is on the far right.
5. The person whose hobby is chess is on the right of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
6. The person whose hobby is skydiving is in the middle.


Given that there are 7 hobbies and 7 positions, we can start filling in the information based on the clues:


- Photography is at position 1 (far left).
- Hiking is at position 7 (far right).
- Skydiving is in the middle, which means it's at position 4.

So, we have:
|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |     4     |       5       |   6   |   7    |
| Hobby   | Photography|         |         | Skydiving |               |       | Hiking |

From clue 3, rock-climbing is to the right of skydiving, so it can be at position 5 or further to the right. But from clue 5, chess must be to the right of rock-climbing, meaning rock-climbing cannot be at position 6 or 7 because there would be no space left for chess. Thus, rock-climbing is likely at position 5.


|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |     4     |       5       |   6   |   7    |
| Hobby   | Photography|         |         | Skydiving | Rock-climbing |       | Hiking |

Now, chess must be at position 6 since it's to the right of rock-climbing.


|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |     4     |       5       |   6   |   7    |
| Hobby   | Photography|         |         | Skydiving | Rock-climbing | Chess | Hiking |

The only hobbies left are writing and singing. Since photography is to the left of writing (clue 1), writing cannot be at position 2 because there would be no space for another hobby between photography and writing if it were any further to the right.


Given that skydiving is at position 4, and considering all other placements, the most logical placement for writing, to satisfy clue 1 and not contradict any other clues, is at a position that allows photography to be to its left without conflicting with the established middle position of skydiving. However, since singing is the only hobby left and it hasn't been placed yet, we must consider where writing can fit without violating the ""photography to the left of writing"" rule and also ensuring skydiving remains in the middle.


If photography is at 1, and considering skydiving's fixed position at 4, the best fit for writing that allows another hobby (singing) to potentially fit between photography and writing or after writing but before skydiving would be to place singing between them. This means singing could go at position 2 or 3, with writing then following at the next available spot that keeps it to the right of photography but also respects the other established positions.


Given this, a possible arrangement is:
- Photography at 1
- Singing at 2 (as it's the only one left that can fit without disrupting the other rules)
- Writing at 3 (since photography must be to its left, and singing now occupies position 2)


Thus, the completed table looks like this:


#############
|         |      1      |    2    |    3    |     4     |       5       |   6   |   7    |

Lv1-1x7-7	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step:


## Step 1: Determine the position of grapes
From statement 3, we know that grapes are on the far left, so the table starts with grapes.


| Food   | grapes |         |       |        |       |        |            |
|        |        |         |       |        |       |        |            |


## Step 2: Position pepper in the middle
Statement 6 tells us that pepper is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the middle would be position 4.


| Food   | grapes |         |       | pepper |       |        |            |
|        |        |         |       |        |       |        |            |


## Step 3: Place lemon relative to pepper and lettuce
From statement 2, we know lemon is on the left of pepper. Statement 5 indicates that lemon is also on the right of lettuce.


## Step 4: Determine positions for lemon and lettuce
Given that lemon must be to the left of pepper (from step 2) and to the right of lettuce (statement 5), and knowing pepper's position, we can start building the sequence. Since grapes are at position 1, and considering the need for lemon to be between lettuce and pepper, a possible arrangement starts to form.


## Step 5: Place apple and banana
Statement 4 says that apple is on the left of banana, and statement 1 indicates grapefruit is on the right of banana. We also know from previous steps that grapes are at position 1, and we need to fit in lettuce, lemon, and pepper with their constraints.


## Step 6: Finalizing positions
Considering all constraints:
- Grapes are far left (position 1).
- Pepper is in the middle (position 4), so lemon must be to its left (since it's also to the right of lettuce), suggesting lettuce could be at position 2 or 3, but because lemon must be between lettuce and pepper, and grapefruit is to the right of banana, we have a specific order starting to form.
- Apple is to the left of banana (statement 4), and since grapefruit is to the right of banana (statement 1), this gives us a sequence for these three as well.


Given all constraints:
1. Grapes are at position 1.
2. Lettuce can't be directly next to grapes because lemon needs to be between lettuce and pepper, suggesting lettuce could fit at position 2 if we consider the placement of apple and banana relative to grapefruit and the other constraints.
3. Apple must precede banana (statement 4), and considering grapefruit's relation to banana (statement 1) and the need for lemon to be before pepper but after lettuce, we can deduce that lettuce should indeed start the sequence with grapes or shortly after, given the direct placements.


Let's assemble:
- Grapes at position 1.
- Lettuce at position 2 because it allows lemon to fit between lettuce and pepper while respecting other constraints.
- Lemon then follows at position 3, as it must be to the right of lettuce and left of pepper.
- Pepper in the middle (position 4).
- The sequence apple-banana-grapefruit fits after pepper, given grapefruit is to the right of banana and apple is to the left of banana.


So, the table looks like this:


| Food   | grapes | lettuce | lemon | pepper | apple | banana | grapefruit |
|        |        |         |       |        |       |        |            |


The final answer is:

| Food   | grapes | lettuce | lemon | pepper | apple | banana | grapefruit |

Lv1-1x7-8	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each statement step by step.


## Step 1: Place the person watching sports movies in the middle.
Since there are 7 different movie-genres and thus 7 people, the middle position would be the 4th position. Therefore, the person watching sports movies is in position 4.

|               |   1    |    2     |   3   |   4    |   5    |    6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   |        |          |       | Sports |        |          |       |

## Step 2: Determine the position of the person watching horror movies.
Given that the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies, and since sports is in position 4, horror must be in position 5 or further to the right. However, because there are other conditions that might affect the exact placement (like the disaster and crime movie preferences), we'll place horror in a temporary position for now but keep in mind it has to be after sports.

|               |   1    |    2     |   3   |   4    |   5    |    6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   |        |          |       | Sports | Horror |          |       |

## Step 3: Place the person watching thriller and drama movies.
Since the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies, they cannot be in positions 6 or 7 if we consider the horror placement from step 2. This means thriller and drama must occupy two positions before sports (since sports is in position 4), given that other conditions might push them but for now, let's temporarily place them in positions 2 and 3, keeping in mind that drama is after thriller.

|               |   1    |    2     |   3   |   4    |   5    |    6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   |        | Thriller | Drama | Sports | Horror |          |       |

## Step 4: Place the person watching satire and disaster movies.
The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Considering the placements so far, and knowing that crime has to be after disaster, we need to fit these in such a way that respects all conditions. Given drama and thriller are before sports, and horror is after sports, satire and disaster must then come before thriller or occupy position 1, with one of them possibly being in position 1 if it fits the rest of the criteria.

|               |   1    |    2     |   3   |   4    |   5    |    6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Thriller | Drama | Sports | Horror | Disaster | Crime |

## Step 5: Finalize the placement based on all conditions.
Considering all conditions:
- The person watching drama is indeed to the right of thriller.
- Sports is in the middle (position 4).
- Disaster is to the right of satire, and since crime must be after disaster, this order works if we adjust slightly for better fit considering all rules.
- Horror is after sports.

Given these conditions and trying different placements while respecting the order (satire before disaster, disaster before crime, thriller before drama, and horror after sports), let's finalize:

|               |   1    |    2     |   3   |   4    |   5    |    6     |   7   |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire | Thriller | Drama | Sports | Horror | Disaster | Crime |

This order respects all conditions given.


The final answer is:

Lv1-1x7-9	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:

1. The fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock.
2. The fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of ambient.
3. The fan of disco is on the right of the fan of ambient.
4. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of d&b.
5. The fan of d&b is in the middle.

Given that there are 7 positions and considering clue 5, ""the fan of d&b is in the middle,"" we place d&b in position 4 since it's the exact middle in an odd-numbered sequence.

From clue 4, ""the fan of folk is on the left of the fan of d&b,"" we can place folk in position 3 because it has to be directly to the left of d&b.

With d&b in position 4 and knowing from clue 2 that ""the fan of d&b is on the left of the fan of ambient,"" ambient must be in position 5, as it needs to be to the right of d&b.

Clue 3 states ""the fan of disco is on the right of the fan of ambient."" So, disco goes into position 6 because it has to be to the right of ambient.

Lastly, clue 1 says ""the fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock."" Since positions 3, 4, 5, and 6 are filled with folk, d&b, ambient, and disco respectively, we have to fit rock and house into positions 1, 2, and 7. Given that house must be to the right of rock and there's only one position left that allows for this arrangement (since rock cannot be in position 7 if house is to its right), rock must be in position 1 or 2, and house in position 7 because it's the only way to satisfy all conditions with the remaining genres.

However, considering the constraints:
- Folk is before d&b (position 3).
- D&b is before ambient (position 4 then 5).
- Ambient is before disco (positions 5 then 6).

The only positions left for rock and house that fit clue 1 are positions 1 and 2 for rock, but since house must be to the right of rock, and all other positions are filled according to the clues, we have a misunderstanding in our initial placement logic considering the strict sequence given by the clues.

Correcting this based on the clues:
- Folk is to the left of d&b (so folk in 3, d&b in 4).
- D&b is to the left of ambient (so ambient in 5).
- Ambient is to the left of disco (so disco in 6).
- House is to the right of rock.

Given these constraints and realizing we need to fit rock and house around the fixed positions, let's correctly place them:
- Since d&b, ambient, and disco occupy positions 4, 5, and 6 respectively, and folk is in position 3, rock and house must be in positions 1, 2, or 7. But since house must be to the right of rock and we have a sequence that doesn't allow for much flexibility due to the other constraints, let's reconsider their placement with the correct logic:
- Rock cannot be after house (from clue 1), so if we place rock in position 2, house can only go in position 7 because it must be to the right of rock and all other positions are filled.

Thus, the corrected sequence based on re-evaluating the clues correctly is:
- Folk in 3.
- D&b in 4.
- Ambient in 5.
- Disco in 6.
- The only genres left are rock, house, and soul. Since rock must come before house, and considering the fixed positions of other genres, we place rock in position 2 (as it can't be after house), which means house goes into position 7 because it's to the right of rock.

The final puzzle piece is placing soul, which hasn't been directly mentioned in relation to a specific position except by elimination. Soul must then fit into position 1 since all other positions are determined by the clues provided.

So, the sequence considering all clues correctly should be:
1. Soul
2. Rock
3. Folk
4. D&b
5. Ambient
6. Disco
7. House

Lv1-1x7-10	"To solve this puzzle, let's analyze each clue step by step:


## Step 1: Analyze Clue 3 and Clue 4
The owner of the pony is on the far left (Clue 3), and the owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (Clue 4). This means the order for these two is: pony, chinchilla.


## Step 2: Apply Clue 2
The owner of the cat is in the middle. Since there are 7 pets, the middle position would be the 4th position. So, we have:
- Pony (1)
- Chinchilla (2)
- ? (3)
- Cat (4)
- ? (5)
- ? (6)
- ? (7)


## Step 3: Apply Clue 5
The owner of the goldfish is to the left of the owner of the goat. This clue, combined with Clue 1 (the owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat), suggests that the order for these three is: goldfish, goat, frog.


## Step 4: Combine Information
We know from Clue 1 and Clue 5 that the order must include goldfish before goat and then frog after goat. Given the cat's position in the middle (4th), we can start to piece together the remaining positions:
- Pony (1)
- Chinchilla (2)
- Goldfish (3) - This fits as it needs to be to the left of the goat.
- Cat (4)
- Goat (5) - Placing the goat here satisfies Clue 5 and allows for the frog to be on its right.
- Frog (6)
- Hamster (7) - The only pet left, which can fit any remaining slot, in this case, the last one.


The final answer is:
