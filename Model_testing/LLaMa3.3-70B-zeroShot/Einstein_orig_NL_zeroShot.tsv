Einstein_orig_NL_1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 9
The Norwegian is on the far left.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The British is the person who likes red.
Since we don't know the position of the British yet, we'll come back to this clue later.

| Cigar		|          	|         	|           	|          	|       master	|

## Step 4: Apply Clue 5
The person who likes green is the person drinking coffee.
We can't place this information yet, but we'll keep it in mind for later.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 2
The Swedish is the owner of the dog.
|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		|          	|         	|         	|          	|          	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	|          	|           	|          	|    swedish	|
| Pet		|        	|         	|         	|         	|  dog      |

## Step 6: Apply Clue 3
The Danish is the person drinking tea.
We can't place this information yet, but we'll come back to it.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 12
The Bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer.
We can't place this information yet.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 13
The German is the Prince-smoker.
We can't place this information yet.

## Step 9: Apply Clue 4
The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white.
This clue, combined with others, will help us figure out the color arrangement later.

## Step 10: Apply Remaining Clues and Deductions
Given the complexity and the need for iterative deductions based on all clues, let's summarize key points:
- Norwegian is on the far left.
- Swedish is on the far right and owns a dog.
- The person drinking milk is in the middle (position 3).
- British likes red.
- Danish drinks tea.
- Green is to the left of white.
- Green drinks coffee.
- Pall-mall smokes bird.
- Yellow smokes Dunhill.
- Blend is near cat or water.
- German smokes Prince.
- Bluemaster drinks beer.

Let's try to place some of these:
- Norwegian (1) can't be British (since British likes red, and we don't know if Norwegian likes red), but could like blue given clue 14.
- If Norwegian likes blue (and considering clue 14 that Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue doesn't add new info since it's already placed on the far left), then:
- British can't be next to Norwegian if Norwegian likes blue because then the British would have to like a color not mentioned yet, and we know all colors.
- Considering clue 4 (green is to the left of white) and clue 5 (green drinks coffee), green must be before the person who drinks milk (since milk is in the middle, position 3), meaning green could be position 1 or 2. But since Norwegian is on the far left and might like blue, green has to be in position 2.
- This means the color arrangement so far is Blue (1), Green (2), ?, ?, ?.
- Given that white must be after green (clue 4) and milk is in the middle, we place white in position 4 because it can't be in position 3 (milk) or 5 (Swedish).
- The only color left for position 5 (considering Swedish likes a color not yet mentioned) is red for British doesn't fit here since Swedish is on the right, so red must be before the milk drinker, placing it in position 3, which doesn't work because milk is in position 3. Thus, we realize there's been an oversight in step-by-step logic without directly applying each clue to possible positions simultaneously.

## Step 11: Re-evaluate and Correct Approach
Given the complexity of clues and the need for a systematic approach:
1. Norwegian on the far left.
2. Milk drinker in the middle.
3. Swedish on the far right with a dog.
4. Green to the left of white, and green drinks coffee.
5. Red is British.

Let's correctly place nationalities, colors, pets, beverages, and cigars by applying all clues systematically.


The final answer is: 
#############
|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green	| red   | white | yellow |
| Nationality	| norwegian | danish  | british| german | swedish |
| Pet		| cat    | bird   | horse | fish  | dog    |

Einstein_orig_NL_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each clue to deduce the characteristics of each person. Let's start by applying the clues directly where possible and then use the process of elimination and logical deduction for the rest.


## Step 1: Apply Direct Clues
From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left (Position 1).
Clue 2 tells us the Swedish person owns a dog.
Clue 3 indicates the Danish person drinks tea.
Clue 8 places the person drinking milk in the middle (Position 3).


## Step 2: Determine Nationality and Beverage for Each Position
From clue 1, the British person likes red. We don't know their position yet.
Clue 13 tells us the German is the Prince-smoker, but we don't have their position or any other direct information about them.


## Step 3: Apply Color Clues
Clue 4 states the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes white. We also know from clue 5 that this person drinks coffee.
Given the Norwegian's position (far left) and clue 14, which says the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, we start forming a possible arrangement.


## Step 4: Apply Pet Clues
Clue 2 gives us the Swedish person owns a dog. Since the Swedish person is at position 5 (from the table), and clue 6 tells us the Pall-Mall smoker owns a bird, we can start piecing together other positions based on pet ownership.


## Step 5: Apply Cigar Clues
Clue 7 indicates the Dunhill smoker likes yellow. Clue 12 says the Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.
We need to carefully place these smokers with their respective preferences and pets.


## Step 6: Finalize Positions Based on All Clues
Given all clues, we now piece together:
- Norwegian (Position 1) must be next to someone who likes blue (clue 14). Let's assume the person who likes blue is in position 2 since the green liker (who drinks coffee) has to be to the left of the white liker.
- The milk drinker is in the middle, so position 3. This also helps place other beverages.
- We know the Swedish person is at position 5 with a dog and smokes Master (though ""Master"" isn't directly linked to any color or beverage without further deduction).
- Clue 10 places the Blend smoker next to the cat owner, and clue 11 places the horse owner next to the Dunhill smoker.
- Since the Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (clue 12) and considering other placements, we can start filling in the blanks.


## Step 7: Deduce Remaining Positions
By elimination and matching clues:
- Position 1 is Norwegian. Given clue 14, let's place blue at position 2 to satisfy being next to Norwegian.
- The green liker (coffee drinker) must be before the white liker, placing them likely in positions 2 or 3 if we consider the need for the milk drinker to be central and other constraints.
- However, with the direct information given and applying all clues systematically:
1. Norwegian (Blue, Water, Cat) - Clues 9, 14, and deduction for water since it's not directly assigned yet but must fit logically.
2. Danish (Green, Coffee, Bird) - Since green is to the left of white, and coffee is mentioned with green in clue 5.
3. British (Red, Milk, Horse) - Given milk is central and red is associated with British in clue 1.
4. German (White, Tea, Fish) - Since tea is Danish's drink, we place German here by elimination for nationality and the white color to satisfy clue 4.
5. Swedish (Yellow, Beer, Dog) - Clue 2 places the dog with Swedish, and yellow is associated with Dunhill in clue 7.


## Step 8: Finalize Cigar Brands
- Norwegian (Blue, Water, Cat) could be a Blend smoker based on clue 10.
- Danish (Green, Coffee, Bird) smokes Pall-Mall (clue 6).
- British (Red, Milk, Horse) might smoke Dunhill since the horse is next to the Dunhill smoker (clue 11), and yellow is associated with Dunhill.
- German (White, Tea, Fish) could be the Prince smoker as per clue 13.
- Swedish (Yellow, Beer, Dog) smokes Master.

Einstein_orig_NL_3	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by applying the clues one by one to deduce the arrangement of colors, nationalities, pets, beverages, and cigars.


## Step 1: Apply Clue 9
The Norwegian is on the far left.

## Step 2: Apply Clue 1
The British is the person who likes red. This does not directly tell us the position but gives a nationality-color pair.

## Step 3: Apply Clue 2
The Swedish is the owner of the dog. This tells us the Swedish person's pet but not their position, except that they cannot be in position 1 because the Norwegian is on the far left.

## Step 4: Apply Clue 8
The person drinking milk is in the middle. This means the middle position (3) is occupied by someone who drinks milk.

## Step 5: Apply Clue 4 and Clue 5
The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, and this person drinks coffee. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and we don't know their color preference yet, let's leave this open for now but note that green must be to the left of white.

## Step 6: Apply Clue 12
The Bluemaster-smoker is the person drinking beer. This gives us a cigar-beverage pair but no direct position yet.

## Step 7: Apply Clue 13
The German is the Prince-smoker. Another nationality-cigar pair without a direct position.

## Step 8: Apply Clue 3
The Danish is the person drinking tea. Yet another nationality-beverage pair.

## Step 9: Start Building the Table
Given the clues, let's start with what we know:
- Norwegian is on the far left (position 1).
- Swedish is in position 5 because they have a dog, and clue 2 only specifies their pet.
- Milk drinker is in the middle (position 3).

## Step 10: Apply Remaining Clues
- The British likes red (Clue 1), but without a direct position, we must consider other clues for placement.
- Green is to the left of white (Clue 4), and green drinks coffee (Clue 5).
- Pall-mall smokes with a bird (Clue 6), but no direct position.
- Yellow likes Dunhill (Clue 7), which also doesn't give us a direct position yet.
- Blend is near the cat or water drinker (Clues 10 and 15).
- Bluemaster drinks beer (Clue 12), German smokes Prince (Clue 13), and Norwegian is near blue or another color not specified (Clue 14).

## Step 11: Piece Together
Given the complexity, we need to deduce positions based on exclusions and direct clues. The table will be filled by process of elimination and direct clue application.


The final answer is:
