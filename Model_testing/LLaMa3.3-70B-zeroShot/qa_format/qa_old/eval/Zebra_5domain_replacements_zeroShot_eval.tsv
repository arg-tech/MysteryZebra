Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information given and start filling in the blanks step by step.

1. Indie fan eats onion.
2. Pop fan grows azalea.
3. Go player eats zucchini.
4. Techno fan plays domino.
5. Zucchini eater is to the right of carrot eater.
6. Colonial house owner grows bellflower.
7. Victorian house owner eats radish.
8. Monopoly player is in the middle (3rd position).
9. Electronic fan is on the far left.
10. Gothic-revival house is next to marigold grower.
11. Victorian house is next to orchid grower.
12. Townhouse owner plays mah-jongg.
13. Trance fan lives in futuristic house.
14. Electronic fan is next to lettuce eater.

From (9), we know the order starts with the electronic fan on the left. 

Given (14), and knowing the electronic fan is on the far left, the person eating lettuce must be in the 2nd position because the electronic fan has to be to the left or right of the lettuce eater, and since they're on the far left, it means lettuce is next to them.

So, we have:
- Position 1: Electronic fan
- Position 2: Lettuce eater

From (8), we know the monopoly player is in the middle, so:
- Position 3: Monopoly player

Now, let's place some houses and foods based on other clues:

- Since the Victorian house is to the left or right of the orchid grower (11) and the victorian house owner eats radish (7), but we don't know the exact position yet, we'll come back to this.
- The colonial house owner grows bellflower (6), but again, no exact position given.

Given (5), zucchini eater is to the right of carrot eater. Since go player eats zucchini (3), and considering the positions we've established:
- If carrot were in position 2, it would conflict with lettuce already being there based on clue (14) and our deduction. Therefore, carrot must be in a position that allows zucchini (and thus go player) to be to its right.

Given the monopoly player is in the middle (position 3), and considering the need for carrot and then zucchini (go player) to be placed:
- A possible arrangement could be carrot in position 2 or 4, but since lettuce is already in position 2, carrot must be after the monopoly player, so carrot could be in position 4.

However, this creates a conflict because we need to place onion (indie fan), radish (victorian house), and ensure zucchini (go player) is to the right of carrot. Considering all placements and the clue that electronic fan is next to lettuce eater, let's solidify some positions based on what we know for sure:

1. Electronic fan (position 1)
2. Lettuce eater (position 2)
3. Monopoly player (position 3)

Given (1) indie fan eats onion and (9) electronic fan is on the far left, and considering the proximity of the electronic fan to the lettuce eater:
- The indie fan could potentially be next to the electronic fan but must be considered with other clues.

From (2), pop fan grows azalea, but no direct position clue. 
From (4), techno fan plays domino, again without a direct position clue yet.

Let's address houses and their possible positions:
- Victorian house (radish eater) needs to be next to orchid grower.
- Colonial house (bellflower grower) doesn't have a specified neighbor yet.
- Gothic-revival house is next to marigold grower, but without specific positions.
- Townhouse (mah-jongg player) and futuristic house (trance fan) also need placement.

Given the complexity and the clues provided, let's try to fit in what we know about games, houses, and foods into 5 positions:

1. Electronic fan (onion eater, because indie fan could be here given no conflict with being next to lettuce eater indirectly through other arrangements)
2. Lettuce eater
3. Monopoly player
4. Carrot eater
5. Zucchini eater (go player)

Now, let's place chess, considering it hasn't been directly mentioned in relation to a specific house or food type yet:

Given the arrangement and clues:
- The electronic fan is on the far left (position 1).
- Lettuce must be next to the electronic fan (in position 2 because of the direct clue about proximity).
- Monopoly player is in the middle (position 3).
- Considering the placements and clues, chess hasn't been directly linked to a food or house type yet but needs to fit into one of these positions or be associated with one of the remaining elements not directly placed (like marigold, dahlia, orchid for flowers; or indie, pop, techno, trance for music; and considering houses).

However, we have:
- Electronic fan (indie) in position 1.
- Lettuce eater in position 2.
- Monopoly player in position 3.

For chess to fit into the remaining slots or be associated with an element, let's consider what's left:
- Carrot and zucchini need placement with their respective game or music associations.
- Given go is with zucchini, domino with techno, monopoly in the middle (but not directly associated with a food or house here), mah-jongg with townhouse, we have chess left without direct association.

Since chess hasn't been directly linked to any specific food, music genre, or house style, and considering all other games are accounted for in some manner:
- Chess must be associated with one of the remaining slots not directly filled by a game, which means looking at associations indirectly through houses or foods not explicitly mentioned with a game.

Given the futuristic house is with trance (13), and townhouse with mah-jongg (12), and considering the need to place chess:
- The only position left that hasn't been directly associated with a specific game (considering go with zucchini, domino with techno, monopoly in the middle) would be either position 4 or 5, depending on how we associate carrot and radish eaters with their respective houses and music genres.

However, without direct clues linking chess to a specific food, house, or being able to disrupt the established order significantly without conflicting clues:
- We look for what's not directly associated: chess isn't linked to any food, house, or music genre explicitly in the clues provided.

Given all placements and considering we need to find where chess is without disrupting established relationships:
- Since the monopoly player is in the middle (position 3), and we have electronic fan on the far left (position 1) and lettuce eater next to them (position 2), the remaining games and their associations need to fit around these fixed points.

Considering all clues again for a final assessment:
- The direct placement of chess isn't provided, but given the structure, it seems we're looking at how to fit chess into an arrangement where most elements have some form of clue leading to their position or association.

Given this is a logic puzzle requiring step-by-step deduction and considering all provided clues:
- It appears there might be a misunderstanding in directly applying all clues to find the exact position of chess without making assumptions beyond the provided information.

To solve for chess directly based on given clues without over-assuming:
- We need a clear, direct link or a process of elimination that hasn't been fully established through the clues alone as presented.

However, considering the format and typical structure of such puzzles, the intention might be to deduce based on elimination and direct clues. Given this, let's reassess the critical clues for chess placement indirectly:

- If electronic is on the far left (1), and lettuce is next to them (2), followed by monopoly in the middle (3), we have carrot and zucchini (with go) to place, considering their relationship.

Given these deductions and the need to place chess:
- Without a direct clue linking chess to a specific element (food, house, music), the puzzle as presented suggests using elimination and indirect clues.

For a final determination on chess's placement based on provided information and adhering strictly to logic puzzle conventions:
- It seems we're guided towards considering which elements are not directly associated with games or have been placed, thus requiring an association with chess indirectly through elimination.

The final answer is: $\boxed{5}$"	chess:1	chess:5	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by using the information given to place people and their preferences into positions.

1. Indie fan eats onion.
2. Pop fan grows azalea.
3. Go player eats zucchini.
4. Techno fan plays domino.
5. Zucchini eater is to the right of carrot eater.
6. Colonial house grows bellflower.
7. Victorian house eats radish.
8. Monopoly player is in the middle (position 3).
9. Electronic fan is on the far left (position 1).
10. Gothic-revival house is next to marigold grower.
11. Victorian house is next to orchid grower.
12. Townhouse plays mah-jongg.
13. Trance fan lives in futuristic house.
14. Electronic fan is next to lettuce eater.

Given that there are 5 positions, let's start filling them based on the clues:

- Position 1 (far left): Electronic fan
- Position 3 (middle): Monopoly player

From clue 9 and 14, since the electronic fan is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce and is on the far left, the person eating lettuce must be in position 2.

Now, let's use other clues to fill in more information:

- The indie fan eats onion (clue 1), but we don't know where they are yet.
- The pop fan grows azalea (clue 2), and again, their position is unknown.
- The go player eats zucchini (clue 3) and must be to the right of the carrot eater (clue 5). This doesn't give us an exact position but a relationship.
- Techno fan plays domino (clue 4), no specific position yet.

Given that the monopoly player is in the middle, let's try to place other activities around them:

Since the electronic fan is on the far left and next to the lettuce eater, we have:
1. Electronic fan
2. Lettuce eater

The monopoly player is in the middle, so:
3. Monopoly player

We know the Victorian house (radish eater) must be next to the orchid grower (clue 11), but without more direct connections, let's look at other clues for more specific information.

Given that the zucchini eater (go player) is to the right of the carrot eater and considering positions, if we place the carrot eater in position 2 or 3, it conflicts with our current setup since lettuce is already suggested for position 2. Thus, a possible arrangement could be:
1. Electronic fan
2. Lettuce eater
3. Monopoly player (and possibly carrot eater, but we need to confirm)
4. Zucchini eater (go player)
5. (This leaves the last spot for onion or radish, considering the other clues)

Let's incorporate more information:

- The colonial house grows bellflower (clue 6), and without direct connection to food or music yet, we keep it in mind.
- The townhouse plays mah-jongg (clue 12), which could fit into our remaining spots but needs a clearer connection.

Considering the need for the gothic-revival house to be next to marigold (clue 10) and Victorian next to orchid, these houses and their respective flower growers must be in adjacent positions. Given that the Victorian house eats radish (clue 7), it's likely in one of the end positions due to its specific food association.

Since we're looking for where dahlia is grown and we have a lot of information but not direct clues on dahlia, let's use elimination and positioning:

- Electronic fan is on the far left.
- Lettuce eater is next to them (position 2).
- Monopoly player in the middle.
- Given relationships, possible positions for others can be inferred but require careful placement.

Directly solving for dahlia without more explicit connections requires making some educated guesses based on the given clues. However, we've established a framework that can help narrow down possibilities:

Given all clues and trying to fit them together:
1. Electronic fan (far left) - Must be eating something not yet specified directly.
2. Lettuce eater
3. Monopoly player
4 & 5. Remaining preferences and houses.

Since direct placement of dahlia isn't straightforward without assuming the positions of other flowers or houses relative to each food type, let's consider what we know about houses and their possible placements:

- Colonial (bellflower) can't be directly linked yet.
- Victorian (radish) is likely on an end due to its specificity and relation to orchid.
- Gothic-revival is next to marigold.
- Townhouse (mah-jongg) could fit but needs a clearer connection.

Given the complexity and the clues provided, without making incorrect assumptions or over-speculating based on incomplete direct links, let's focus on what we can deduce about dahlia's possible position:

Since we have:
- Electronic fan on the left.
- Lettuce eater next to them.
- Monopoly player in the middle.

And considering all other clues about music genres, houses, and games without specific placements for onion (indie), zucchini (go), radish (Victorian), and carrot's exact position but knowing its relation to zucchini, we must carefully place these preferences.

However, given the constraints of this format and the need for a precise answer, let's focus on what typically happens in such puzzles: each person has a unique combination of food, music, house type, game, and flower. Without direct clues linking dahlia to a specific position or set of preferences, we must consider the elimination process based on given clues.

Since a detailed step-by-step placement of all individuals with their preferences is required for an accurate solution, and given the complexity of this puzzle, let's directly address the query about dahlia:

Given that each clue must be used to precisely place individuals and their preferences, and acknowledging that some steps might require guessing or further clarification, the precise location of **dahlia** depends on correctly aligning all other clues.

For a solution like this, typically, one would create a grid or table and fill in knowns and unknowns systematically. However, without explicit connections for dahlia in the provided clues, we must recognize that solving it directly here might not lead to an accurate placement without assuming information not given.

Therefore, based on the constraints of the puzzle and the format requested for the answer, I must clarify that a precise numerical position for **dahlia** would ideally be derived from a comprehensive table or grid that aligns all clues perfectly, which isn't fully achievable in this response format without making speculative assumptions.

Given the need to follow your instructions precisely and acknowledging the complexity of providing a definitive numerical answer without visual aids or further clarification on specific clue relationships, I'll provide a response that adheres to your requested format while noting the above considerations:

**dahlia:4**"	dahlia:5	dahlia:4	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we'll break it down step by step based on the given clues.

1. The fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague.
2. The fan of d&b is the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
3. The chef is the person traveling to Hannover.
4. The fan of ambient is the bartender.
5. The person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
6. The person whose hobby is sudoku is the person whose sport is baseball.
7. The person whose hobby is photography is the person traveling to Rome.
8. The dressmaker is in the middle.
9. The fan of soul is on the far left.
10. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person whose sport is badminton.
11. The person whose hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person whose sport is cricket.
12. The person whose hobby is skydiving is the software-developer.
13. The fan of blues is the person whose hobby is cooking.
14. The fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin.

From clue 9, we know the order starts with the soul fan on the far left.

Given:
- Soul fan is on the far left (Clue 9).
- Dressmaker is in the middle (Clue 8), which means there are two people to the left and right of the dressmaker.
- Chef travels to Hannover and is to the right of Edinburgh (Clues 3 and 5).

Let's establish a preliminary order based on cities, knowing that Prague (Gospel) and Rome (Photography) haven't been placed yet, but we know Hannover (Chef) is to the right of Edinburgh:

1. Soul fan
2. ? (Could be Edinburgh or another city not yet determined)
3. Dressmaker (Middle)
4. Chef (Hannover)
5. ?

From clue 14, since soul is on the far left and next to Berlin, we deduce:
- Berlin must be second because soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin.

So, the order for cities so far is:
1. Soul fan (City not specified but can't be Berlin as per clue 14)
2. Berlin
3. Dressmaker (Middle) - City not yet determined
4. Hannover (Chef)
5. ? 

Given that Edinburgh must come before Hannover (Clue 5), and considering the positions:
- Soul fan is already placed on the far left, which aligns with being next to Berlin.
- The only spot for Edinburgh that fits all conditions (especially considering Prague needs a spot) is the third position, as it allows for the necessary placement of other cities and hobbies/sports without contradicting any clues.

Thus, the city order starts to look like this:
1. Soul fan - ? (Not specified but can't be Berlin)
2. Berlin
3. Edinburgh
4. Hannover (Chef)
5. ?

Since Prague is associated with Gospel (Clue 1) and we've established a preliminary order for cities, let's place Prague:
- Given that the soul fan is on the far left next to Berlin and considering all other placements, Prague must fit into one of the remaining spots.

However, since the dressmaker is in the middle (Clue 8), and if we consider Edinburgh as part of this arrangement due to its need to be before Hannover:
- The order with cities starts becoming clearer: Soul fan can't travel to Berlin but is next to it. If Berlin is second, and considering the need for Prague (Gospel) and Rome (Photography) to fit, along with the constraints provided by other clues, we see that:
  - Soul must be paired with a city not yet mentioned directly in these steps.

Given all this, let's clarify positions based on hobbies and sports as well since direct city assignments beyond Berlin, Hannover, and implied placements are tricky without considering all preferences:

1. **Soul fan** is next to Berlin but can't be in Berlin (Clue 14), so soul could potentially be in Prague or another unassigned city, given the constraints about gospel and other cities.
2. **Gospel fan** travels to Prague (Clue 1).
3. Considering all clues again for clarity:
   - The fan of **blues** is the person whose hobby is **cooking** (Clue 13).
   - **Dressmaker** is in the middle (Clue 8), implying if we have a fixed position for cities, it would help to solidify hobbies and sports.

To place **musician**, let's consider unassigned information:
- We know from clue 12 that the person whose hobby is **skydiving** is the **software-developer**.
- And clue 4 states the fan of **ambient** is the **bartender**.

Since we're trying to find where the **musician** is, and knowing that each person has a unique job, sport, hobby, music genre, and city:
- The only position not directly associated with another profession (based on given clues) that could potentially fit without contradicting other information would be to align with one of the cities or hobbies/sports not yet fully assigned.

However, given the complexity and direct question about **musician**, let's simplify based on necessary deductions from clues:
- The direct placement of **musician** requires considering which city or hobby/sport combination hasn't been ruled out by other clues.

Given that we need to match each person with a city, job, hobby, sport, and music genre without overlap and ensuring all clues are respected:
- Without explicit details on the **musician's** city, hobby, sport, or music preference directly from the clues provided, we must infer based on exclusions and necessary placements.

Considering the clues again for any direct or indirect mention of the **musician**:
- Since the puzzle doesn't provide a direct link between the **musician** and other characteristics (city, hobby, sport) that could be used to place them without contradicting given information, we must look at what's not explicitly stated.

The puzzle's constraints make it challenging to directly deduce the **musician's** position without making assumptions. However, let's summarize what we know that might help:
- Cities: Prague (Gospel), Hannover (Chef), Edinburgh, Rome (Photography), Berlin
- Jobs: Chef (Hannover), Dressmaker (Middle), Bartender (Ambient), Software-developer (Skydiving)
- The **musician** hasn't been directly linked to a city or other characteristics that would place them in one of the five slots without contradicting given clues.

Given this, and considering we might have missed aligning some clues perfectly due to the puzzle's complexity:
- A direct answer based on provided information seems challenging without making an incorrect assumption.

However, knowing the format requires a specific answer and acknowledging the puzzle's complexity and potential for misinterpretation of clues:
- It seems we must deduce or infer based on given constraints and acknowledge any oversight in aligning all clues perfectly.

Therefore, considering all complexities and the need to adhere strictly to provided information without overstepping into assumptions:
- **musician:5**"	musician:1	musician:5	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by establishing the positions based on the clues given:

1. Gospel fan travels to Prague.
2. D&B fan plays ice-hockey.
3. Chef travels to Hannover.
4. Ambient fan is a bartender.
5. Hannover is to the right of Edinburgh.
6. Sudoku hobbyist plays baseball.
7. Photography hobbyist travels to Rome.
8. Dressmaker is in the middle (3rd position).
9. Soul fan is on the far left.
10. Filmmaking hobbyist is next to badminton player.
11. Photography hobbyist is next to cricket player.
12. Skydiving hobbyist is a software-developer.
13. Blues fan's hobby is cooking.
14. Soul fan is next to Berlin traveler.

Let's assign positions based on the clues:

- **Soul fan** is on the far left (Position 1).
- Since the **dressmaker** is in the middle, this means the dressmaker is in position 3.
- Given that **Hannover** is to the right of **Edinburgh**, and considering the positions we have so far, Edinburgh must be in position 2, and Hannover (with the chef) in position 4, because the dressmaker is already set for the middle (position 3).

So, our initial setup looks like this:
1. Soul - ? 
2. ? - Edinburgh
3. Dressmaker - ?
4. Chef - Hannover
5. ? 

Given that **Prague** is associated with the **gospel fan**, and considering the constraints about positions relative to other cities and activities, Prague can't be on the far left (taken by soul), so it must fit into one of the remaining slots.

Considering clue 14 (**Soul fan** is to the left or right of the person traveling to **Berlin**), Berlin must be either in position 2 or not in the first two positions at all if we consider ""to the left or right"" strictly in terms of adjacency. Given that Edinburgh already occupies a slot and needs Hannover (chef) to its right, Berlin's placement becomes tricky without disrupting the soul fan's adjacency requirement unless it fits into one of the slots directly next to the soul fan.

However, considering all clues about hobbies and sports:
- **D&B** with ice-hockey doesn't specify a city directly.
- **Ambient** is the bartender but no direct city link.
- The person who likes **blues** has cooking as their hobby, with no direct city mentioned.
- **Sudoku** player plays baseball, again without a specific city.

And given that:
- Photography (Rome) must be next to cricket.
- Filmmaking is next to badminton.
- Skydiving (software-developer) doesn't have a specified adjacent sport or city directly from the clues provided.

The puzzle pieces together with the following key deductions:
- Since **Edinburgh** and **Hannover** are already placed relatively, and knowing **Prague** must be somewhere because of its association with gospel, we need to fit in **Rome** (photography) and **Berlin**, considering all hobby and sport associations.

Given that **surfing** isn't directly linked to any city or person through a unique identifier in the clues provided but is part of the sports list, we must deduce its placement by elimination and association with other hobbies and cities.

Let's solidify known positions:
1. Soul fan - Berlin (to satisfy clue 14)
2. ? - Edinburgh
3. Dressmaker - ?
4. Chef - Hannover
5. ? 

Since **Rome** is linked to photography, which must be next to cricket (clue 11), and considering the constraints around filmmaking being next to badminton, we have to fit these hobbies and sports into our existing framework.

Given that the **gospel fan** travels to Prague and is not specified beyond clue 1, if we try to place Prague in a way that respects all given constraints:
- If Berlin were directly next to the soul fan (on either side), and considering Edinburgh's placement relative to Hannover, we'd have a tight squeeze for placing Rome (photography) and satisfying its adjacency requirement with cricket unless it fits into one of the slots directly.

Since **surfing** is not directly tied to any specific city or hobby in a unique way but must be part of the puzzle, let's look at the potential placement considering all constraints. Given that we have specific hobbies linked to cities (Rome with photography) and sports (like cricket being next to photography), surfing's placement would depend on which slot remains after satisfying these conditions.

Without explicit connections for **surfing** beyond being one of the sports, its placement must be inferred from the remaining slots not explicitly taken by other sports or hobbies directly mentioned in the clues. 

Given the complexity and the need to place each item according to the clues without a direct reference point for surfing, we deduce:
- Soul fan on the far left (Position 1) with Berlin.
- The dressmaker is in the middle (Position 3).
- Chef in Hannover (Position 4).

To fit **surfing** into this puzzle while respecting all given constraints and knowing that direct associations are key to solving these puzzles, we look for where surfing could logically fit without disrupting other known placements.

Since direct city assignments for some sports/hobbies are lacking, and given the clues about relative positions and adjacencies:
- We know **Rome** (photography) must be next to cricket.
- **Edinburgh** is before **Hannover**, with the chef in Hannover.
- The **dressmaker** occupies the middle slot.

Considering all provided clues and deducing from the constraints about hobbies, sports, and cities:
- We have a tight squeeze for placing all activities without direct contradictions.

However, to directly answer where **surfing** is based on the given clues and without explicit placement throughout the logic steps here outlined, let's simplify our thought process focusing on the knowns:

1. Soul fan - Berlin
2. ? - Edinburgh (Given that Prague must be somewhere but isn't specified in relation to these positions beyond being associated with gospel)
3. Dressmaker - ?
4. Chef - Hannover
5. ? 

Since **surfing** isn't directly tied to any city or hobby explicitly mentioned, its placement requires fitting into the remaining structure without violating given constraints.

Considering the constraints and aiming for a logical fit:
- The puzzle's complexity necessitates careful consideration of each clue.
- With direct placements and associations provided for some hobbies and sports but not others, like surfing, we must infer based on the slots that remain after satisfying more directly stated conditions.

Given this, without explicit error in logic deduction but acknowledging the oversight in directly calculating **surfing**'s position from given clues:
The final answer is: $\boxed{surfing:2}$"	surfing:5	surfing:2	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll need to break it down step by step based on the given clues.

1. The manager travels to Venice.
2. The journalist's hobby is writing.
3. The rock fan travels to Hamburg.
4. The analyst likes salsa.
5. Hamburg (rock fan) is to the right of Colone.
6. The modern house belongs to someone who collects things.
7. The palace house is associated with New-York.
8. The funk fan is in the middle.
9. The police-officer is on the far left.
10. The wooden house is next to the person whose hobby is drawing.
11. The palace house is next to the chess player.
12. The colonial house belongs to the dubstep fan.
13. The engineer lives in a gothic-revival house.
14. The police-officer is next to the person traveling to Liverpool.

Given these clues, let's start arranging:

- **Police-officer** is on the far left (Clue 9).
- Since the **police-officer** must be next to the person traveling to **Liverpool** (Clue 14), and considering the destinations and jobs, we can start forming a possible sequence.

Let's consider the destinations first because they give us more concrete positions:
- Venice (Manager)
- Hamburg (Rock fan) is to the right of Colone.
- New-York (Palace house)

The order for some cities is: ..., Colone, Hamburg, ...

Given that the **funk fan** is in the middle (Clue 8), and considering we have five people/cities, the middle position would be the third spot if we line them up.

Since the **police-officer** is on the far left and must be next to **Liverpool**, a possible initial arrangement could look like this:
- Police-officer (Liverpool)
- ? (Colone)
- Funk fan (?)
- ? (Hamburg)
- ? (New-York or Venice, considering other clues)

Now, let's integrate more information:
- The **manager** goes to **Venice** (Clue 1), and this could potentially be on the far right since we don't have a direct clue placing it otherwise.
- The **rock fan** goes to **Hamburg**, which is to the right of **Colone** (Clue 3 & Clue 5).
- Given that the **palace house** is associated with **New-York** (Clue 7), and it must be next to the **chess player** (Clue 11), we need to find a spot for New-York that fits.

Considering all clues and trying to fit them together:
1. Police-officer (Liverpool, far left)
2. ? (Colone) - This could potentially be the wooden house since it needs to be next to drawing (Clue 10).
3. Funk fan (?)
4. Rock fan (Hamburg)
5. Manager (Venice)

We also know:
- The **analyst** likes **salsa** (Clue 4), but we don't have a direct link to a city yet.
- The **colonial house** is the **dubstep fan** (Clue 12).
- The **engineer** lives in a **gothic-revival house** (Clue 13).

Given that **pop** hasn't been directly linked to any clue except by exclusion, we need to find where it can fit based on what's left.

Since the **funk fan** is in the middle and we've established an order for some cities, let's solidify the middle:
- If the police-officer is at Liverpool (far left), and considering other clues about houses and jobs, a potential arrangement starts to form but remains incomplete without directly assigning jobs and music preferences to each city except where explicitly stated.

However, to directly answer your question without further speculation on exact arrangements for every detail:
- **Pop** would logically fit into the remaining slot not assigned to another genre based on exclusion. Given that we have specific genres mentioned with destinations or hobbies (rock with Hamburg, salsa with analyst, funk in the middle), and considering the arrangement of cities and jobs, **pop**'s placement depends on resolving the remaining slots.

Given the clues:
- The direct question about **pop** can't be answered without making some assumptions based on the process of elimination and the given clues. 

However, since we're asked to give a specific format answer and considering we must deduce the position of **pop** through the clues provided, let's assume we've arranged everything correctly up to this point with the information given.

If we have:
1. Police-officer (Liverpool) - Could be pop if not otherwise assigned.
2. ? (Colone)
3. Funk fan (?)
4. Rock fan (Hamburg)
5. Manager (Venice)

And knowing **pop** must fit somewhere, but without direct clues linking it to a specific city or job except by exclusion and the need for each person to have a unique music preference:

The final answer is: $\boxed{pop:2}$"	pop:1	pop:2	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll need to break down each clue and assemble the information step by step.

1. The manager is the person traveling to Venice.
2. The journalist is the person whose hobby is writing.
3. The fan of rock is the person traveling to Hamburg.
4. The analyst is the fan of salsa.
5. The person traveling to Hamburg is to the right of the person traveling to Cologne.
6. The modern house is the person whose hobby is collecting.
7. The palace house is the person traveling to New York.
8. The fan of funk is in the middle.
9. The police-officer is on the far left.
10. The wooden house is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is drawing.
11. The palace house is to the left or right of the person whose hobby is chess.
12. The colonial house is the fan of dubstep.
13. The engineer is the Gothic-revival house.
14. The police-officer is to the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool.

Given these clues, let's start by placing what we can:

- **Police-officer** is on the far left (9).
- Since the police-officer is to the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool (14), and given the police-officer's fixed position, Liverpool must be second.
- The manager travels to Venice (1), but we don't know where Venice is yet.
- Hamburg is to the right of Cologne (5), and since the rock fan goes to Hamburg (3), we have a sequence but not a position yet.

Let's assign positions based on what we know:

1. Police-officer
2. Liverpool
3. ? (Could be Cologne or another city, but since Hamburg must be after Cologne, it can't be Hamburg)
4. ? (Funk fan is in the middle, so this could potentially be the funk fan, depending on how we interpret ""middle"" with an odd number of positions. However, if the middle is considered the third position in a five-position setup, then the funk fan would actually be in the third spot.)
5. ?

From clue 7, the palace house (New York) must be next to someone whose hobby is chess (11). We don't know where New York is yet.

Since the police-officer is on the far left and is next to Liverpool (14), let's try to place other known elements:

- **Colonial house** is the fan of dubstep (12).
- **Engineer** lives in a Gothic-revival house (13).

Given that Hamburg must be after Cologne, and if we consider the ""middle"" for the funk fan as the third position in our lineup, we start to build a possible arrangement. However, without direct connections between many elements, we have to piece together based on exclusions and direct clues.

Let's try placing known elements with cities:
- Police-officer (Liverpool?) - This doesn't directly match any given city yet.
- The **manager** goes to Venice (1).
- The rock fan goes to Hamburg (3), which is after Cologne (5).

Given the constraints, let's assign positions more directly where possible:

1. Police-officer - Liverpool
2. ? 
3. Funk fan
4. ?
5. ?

Considering the palace house (New York) must be next to chess (11), and without direct placement yet, we need to figure out how these fit with the cities and hobbies.

Given the clues about houses and hobbies:
- Modern house is collecting (6).
- Wooden house is next to drawing (10).

The puzzle mentions specific placements relative to each other but doesn't directly state where **puzzles** fits in terms of hobby. However, by deduction and filling in known elements:

1. Police-officer (Liverpool) - Since the police-officer is on the far left.
2. Manager (Venice) - This could fit here as we have no direct conflict.
3. Funk fan (Unknown city directly but must be in the middle) - Given this, if ""middle"" means third, then this person's city isn't specified yet, but their music genre is.
4. Analyst (Salsa fan, unknown city) - Could potentially fit here or elsewhere depending on other clues.
5. ? 

Considering we need to place **puzzles** and given that the journalist is the person whose hobby is writing (2), and no direct mention of puzzles as a hobby in relation to any specific clue directly, let's fill in what we can about hobbies and cities:

Given all constraints and trying to fit everything:
- The police-officer must be on the far left.
- Liverpool is next to the police-officer.
- The manager goes to Venice, which doesn't conflict with being second if we consider the arrangement of cities and hobbies.

Since **puzzles** isn't directly mentioned in relation to any specific clue about music genres or houses but is a hobby, let's place it where it fits without conflicting with other clues. 

The direct placement of puzzles as a hobby isn't specified, so let's deduce based on exclusions:
- Writing (Journalist)
- Collecting (Modern house)
- Drawing (Next to Wooden house)
- Chess (Next to Palace/New York)
- Puzzles (Not directly mentioned with any house or city specifically)

Given the constraints and without direct information linking puzzles to a specific position, we must infer based on what's given. However, since each person has a unique hobby and **puzzles** is listed as one of them, it must fit into one of the five slots. Without a direct clue linking puzzles to a city or house type directly, and considering all other information provided:

Since we're tasked with finding where **puzzles** fits without a direct link to any specific clue that would place it in a particular position relative to cities or houses directly, let's consider what we know about each hobby and their potential placements based on given clues.

Given this is a logic puzzle requiring step-by-step deduction and considering the format requested for the answer, we'll finalize the placement of **puzzles** based on the process of elimination and direct clues provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{puzzles:3}$"	puzzles:5	puzzles:3	False	True
