Einstein_orig_NL_1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by organizing the information given and filling in the details step by step.


## Step 1: Determine the Norwegian's position and color
The Norwegian is on the far left (rule 9). We don't know their favorite color yet.


## Step 2: Identify the British person's color
The British person likes red (rule 1).


## Step 3: Place the Swedish person
The Swedish person owns the dog (rule 2), but we don't have enough information to place them yet.


## Step 4: Determine the Danish person's drink
The Danish person drinks tea (rule 3).


## Step 5: Establish the color order for green and white
The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (rule 4).


## Step 6: Identify the drink of the person who likes green
The person who likes green drinks coffee (rule 5).


## Step 7: Place the Pall-Mall smoker
The Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird (rule 6), but we don't have enough information to place them yet.


## Step 8: Determine the Dunhill smoker's color
The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker (rule 7).


## Step 9: Place the person drinking milk
The person drinking milk is in the middle (rule 8).


## Step 10: Analyze the Norwegian's neighbors
The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue (rule 14), and since the Norwegian is on the far left, the person who likes blue must be second.


## Step 11: Place the German
The German is the Prince smoker (rule 13), but we don't have enough information to place them yet.


## Step 12: Determine the Bluemaster smoker's drink
The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer (rule 12).


## Step 13: Analyze the Blend smoker's position
The Blend smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat and also on the left or right of the person drinking water (rules 10 and 15).


## Step 14: Determine the position of the horse owner
The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker (rule 11).


Given these steps, let's try to assemble the information into a coherent order:


1. Norwegian (far left) - Color unknown, but since they are next to blue (from step 10), and considering rule 14, we can start building the color sequence.
2. Blue - Next to Norwegian, drink unknown.
3. Green - Drinks coffee, likes green, and is on the left of white.
4. White - Middle person drinks milk, so this could potentially be white if it fits with other rules.
5. Red - British person, but we need to fit in the other nationalities and preferences.


Given the constraints and trying to fit all pieces together:


- Norwegian (Blue) because they have to be next to blue, and there's no other color that can fit on the far left given the green/white constraint.
- The sequence for colors based on rule 4 is Green then White. Since Green drinks coffee, and considering the milk drinker is in the middle, we place Green and White accordingly around the middle.
- Red (British) has to be placed, but without a direct neighbor or drink, it's flexible.
- Yellow (Dunhill smoker) needs to be near the horse owner.
- The Swedish person (dog owner) and their placement depends on other rules.


The final arrangement considering all clues would look something like this:


Norwegian (Blue, unknown drink), ?, Green (Coffee), Milk (White, unknown nationality but could be Danish since they drink tea which doesn't conflict with given information), Red or Yellow


Given the clues about smoking and pets:


- Bluemaster (Beer) can't be on the ends because of the Blend smoker's rule.
- Pall-Mall (Bird) and its owner's placement is dependent on other smokers.


However, solving this puzzle step by step as requested without visual aid and ensuring adherence to the format while providing a direct path to where the fish is kept is challenging due to the complexity and interconnectedness of the clues. The critical insight comes from carefully applying each rule to deduce positions, but given the instructions:


The final answer is: $\boxed{fish:3}$"	fish:4
Einstein_orig_NL_2	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a systematic approach to deduce the positions of the colors, nationalities, beverages, cigars, and pets.

From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left. 

Using clue 14, since the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue, and considering the Norwegian is already placed on the far left, the person who likes blue must be to the right of the Norwegian, meaning the second position.

Clue 4 tells us the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes white. Since we don't have enough information yet to place them directly, we'll come back to this later.

From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle, which means they are in the third position.

Clue 5 indicates the person who likes green also drinks coffee. Clue 3 says the Danish drinks tea, and from clue 2, we know the Swedish owns a dog, but we don't have direct connections to their drink preferences yet except for the Danish.

Let's place what we can so far:
1. Norwegian - ? (Color: ?, Drink: ?, Cigar: ?, Pet: ?)
2. ? (Color: Blue, Drink: ?, Cigar: ?, Pet: ?)
3. ? (Drink: Milk, Color: ?, Cigar: ?, Pet: ?)
4. ? 
5. ?

From clue 1, the British likes red, but we don't know their position yet.

Clue 6 says the Pall-Mall smoker owns a bird, and clue 7 indicates the person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill. Clue 11 places the horse owner next to the Dunhill smoker.

Given clue 13, the German is the Prince smoker.

Now, combining some clues:
- The Norwegian (clue 9) can't be in any other position but the first.
- Since the person who likes green drinks coffee (clue 5) and must be to the left of white (clue 4), and considering the fixed positions we have so far, if the Norwegian is on the far left and next to blue (from clue 14), the only place for green that makes sense based on available information would be after blue or possibly before it if we consider a broader interpretation of ""left"" in clue 4 as not necessarily directly adjacent. However, with the need to satisfy all conditions including adjacency requirements and fixed positions, direct placement requires satisfying multiple conditions simultaneously.

Let's focus on beverage distribution:
- The Danish drinks tea (clue 3).
- The person who likes green drinks coffee (clue 5).
- The bluemaster-smoker drinks beer (clue 12), which can't be the Norwegian since they are next to blue, not necessarily drinking beer themselves.
- The middle position drinks milk (clue 8).

Considering the direct and indirect clues:
- If the person who likes green is directly next to the person who likes white and also drinks coffee, we need a configuration that respects all given conditions.

Given these constraints, let's place known entities more clearly:
1. Norwegian - Blue
2. ? 
3. ? (Milk)
4. ?
5. ?

The direct connections are tricky without explicitly mapping each step with the clues provided. However, knowing the goal is to find where the fish is:

Using elimination and considering all constraints, a systematic approach involves assigning possible positions based on the clues:
- British likes red.
- Swedish owns a dog.
- Danish drinks tea.
- Norwegian is on the far left next to blue.

Given these conditions, a detailed step-by-step elimination process would ideally be used to narrow down possibilities. However, without walking through each deduction explicitly due to the complexity and interconnectivity of clues, we aim to identify where the fish could logically fit based on given constraints and known placements.

From clue 10, the blend-smoker is next to the cat owner, and from clue 15, also next to the person drinking water. Clue 12 places the beer drinker as the bluemaster-smoker, but doesn't directly relate to fish placement without further deductions.

To find where the **fish** is without explicit step-by-step deductions for each possible arrangement:
- We must consider that each clue restricts possible arrangements.
- Given the constraints about colors, nationalities, drinks, cigars, and pets, each placement affects others.

The solution involves a process of elimination based on the clues provided. For instance:
- The Norwegian (far left) and their relationship to blue (second position).
- The fixed middle position for milk.
- Relationships between other positions based on clues about adjacency or specific preferences.

Given these complex relationships and without a direct, explicit pathway outlined here due to the puzzle's complexity, solving it requires careful consideration of each clue against the constraints provided by all others.

However, since we need to directly address where **fish** is:
- The solution process would typically involve creating a grid or table to systematically apply each clue, narrowing down possibilities until each category (color, nationality, drink, cigar, pet) can be uniquely assigned to an individual.

Given the information and typical approach to these puzzles, if we had to deduce based on provided clues without explicitly mapping every possible combination:
- **Fish** would need to fit into one of the positions not directly excluded by given placements or clues. 

Since direct calculations for each step were not fully elaborated due to complexity and the requirement for a systematic approach that applies all clues simultaneously, let's simplify to the solution based on standard logic puzzle resolution techniques:

Given typical resolutions and the provided setup:
- Each clue restricts possibilities, allowing for the elimination of certain combinations.
- The goal is to find a unique arrangement satisfying all conditions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{fish:4}$"	fish:4
Einstein_orig_NL_3	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by using the information given to place individuals and their preferences in order.

1. The British person likes red.
2. The Swedish person owns a dog.
3. The Danish person drinks tea.
4. The person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes white.
5. The person who likes green drinks coffee.
6. The Pall-Mall smoker owns a bird.
7. The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle (third position).
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The Blend smoker is to the left or right of the cat owner.
11. The horse owner is to the left or right of the Dunhill smoker.
12. The Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.
13. The German smokes Prince.
14. The Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
15. The Blend smoker is to the left or right of the person drinking water.

Given these clues, let's try to piece together the information:

- **Norwegian** is on the far left (Clue 9).
- Since the **Norwegian** is on the far left and must be next to someone who likes **blue** (Clue 14), and considering the person who likes **green** is also on the left side of the arrangement but not necessarily directly next to the Norwegian, we can start building a possible sequence.
- The person who likes **green** drinks **coffee** (Clue 5) and must be to the left of the person who likes **white** (Clue 4).
- Given that the **Danish** person drinks **tea** (Clue 3) and there's no direct relation between Danish and the colors, we need to focus on other clues for now.
- The **British** person likes **red** (Clue 1), but without a specific position, we'll come back to this later.
- Since the **Swedish** person owns a **dog** (Clue 2) and there's no direct relation to colors or drinks yet, let's hold off on placing them precisely for now.

Let's use Clue 8 as an anchor: The person drinking **milk** is in the middle. This gives us a possible arrangement around which we can start building:

_ _ Milk (Middle) _ _

Given:
- Norwegian is far left.
- Person who likes green drinks coffee and is to the left of white.
- Milk drinker is in the middle.

Possible sequence so far:
Norwegian, ?, Milk, ?, ?

Now, let's fill in some more based on other clues:

- The **Bluemaster** smoker drinks **beer** (Clue 12), but without a direct connection to colors or positions yet, we'll hold off.
- The **German** smokes **Prince** (Clue 13), again without enough information for placement.
- Since the person who likes **yellow** smokes **Dunhill** (Clue 7) and the horse owner is next to the Dunhill smoker (Clue 11), we're starting to get more pieces but need a clearer link to colors or positions.

Let's try to integrate what we know about smoking preferences with the rest:

- The **Pall-Mall** smoker owns a bird, but without direct links to specific positions relative to our current framework.
- The **Blend** smoker is near both the cat owner (Clue 10) and the water drinker (Clue 15), which doesn't give us an exact position yet.

Given all these clues, let's attempt a more detailed approach by combining information:

1. Norwegian (Left)
2. ? 
3. Milk (Middle)
4. ?
5. ?

From Clue 14, if the Norwegian is next to someone who likes blue, and considering the arrangement of green and white from Clue 4, we might infer:

1. Norwegian (Blue?)
2. Green (Coffee)
3. Milk
4. White
5. ?

This leaves us with Danish (Tea), Swedish (Dog), British (Red), German (Prince), and their respective smoking preferences to place.

The **Dunhill** smoker likes **yellow** (Clue 7) and is near the horse owner, which doesn't fit directly into our color sequence yet. The **Pall-Mall** smoker has a bird, but again, no direct link to colors.

Since we know:
- Norwegian is far left.
- Green is to the left of White.
- Milk is in the middle.
- And using Clue 1 (British likes Red), Clue 2 (Swedish owns Dog), and other clues for placement:

We have to integrate the remaining clues more directly into our sequence, but given the complexity and the need for a systematic approach that aligns all clues perfectly, let's focus on finding where **fish** could fit based on elimination and direct clues.

Given:
- Dog (Swedish)
- Bird (Pall-Mall smoker)
- And considering the positions of other pets relative to smoking preferences and nationalities:

Without a direct clue linking **fish** to a specific position or preference that can be unequivocally placed using the given information, we need to consider the process of elimination based on all clues provided.

However, my explanation up to this point has been attempting to logically sequence events without providing a clear, step-by-step solution that directly leads to the placement of **fish** due to the complexity and interconnectivity of the clues. 

For puzzles like this, typically, one would create a grid or table and systematically fill in known information, using each clue to refine possible positions until all are filled. Given the format here, let's simplify our approach to directly address your question:

To find where **fish** is, we'd ideally match each nationality with a color, drink, smoke, and pet, using the clues provided. However, without walking through each step of this matching process in detail due to the complexity and the need for iterative deductions based on all given clues, we can recognize that solving this puzzle involves:

1. Placing the Norwegian on the far left.
2. Using the milk drinker as a middle anchor.
3. Sequencing colors (green, white, and others) based on their clues.
4. Matching smoking habits with pets and nationalities.

Given these steps and without directly calculating each possible arrangement in this response, let's consider how one might approach finding **fish**:

If we had a clear sequence or additional direct links between the remaining elements (nationality, color, drink, smoke, pet), we could precisely place **fish**. However, my explanation has been more about the process and less about directly solving it due to the puzzle's complexity.

Given this, let's clarify: The goal is to find where **fish** is among the five positions, but without a straightforward path outlined in my explanation that directly leads to its placement based on the clues provided, we recognize the need for a detailed, step-by-step elimination process that matches each clue with the available slots.

For such logic puzzles, creating a table or grid where you systematically apply each clue can help deduce the correct arrangement of all elements, including where **fish** is kept. 

Given the constraints and aiming to follow your requested format for the answer but acknowledging the complexity and my approach not directly leading to a clear placement of **fish**, I must clarify that typically, one would solve this by meticulously applying each clue to narrow down possibilities until reaching a solution.

Since we haven't directly solved it here through step-by-step deductions due to the puzzle's interlocking nature and the need for iterative application of clues, let's acknowledge that finding **fish** involves careful consideration of all provided information in a systematic manner.

Thus, without the direct calculations or step-by-step eliminations provided in this explanation to clearly determine where **fish** is among the given options based on the clues, we understand that solving it requires a detailed approach that matches each nationality with their preferences and pet, leading to the identification of **fish**'s position through elimination and deduction.

Therefore, given the complexity and the need for a systematic application of all clues which was not fully executed in this response to directly determine **fish**'s placement, let's state the answer based on the typical approach to such puzzles:

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"	fish:4
