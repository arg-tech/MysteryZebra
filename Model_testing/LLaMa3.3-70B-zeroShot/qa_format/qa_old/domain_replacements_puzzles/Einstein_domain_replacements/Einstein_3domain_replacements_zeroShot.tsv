Einstein_3domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we will need to carefully analyze each clue and systematically fill in the information. Given the complexity of the problem, let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Establishing Known Facts
- The British person travels to Venice (Clue 1).
- The Swedish person owns a dog (Clue 2).
- The Danish person's hobby is photography (Clue 3).
- The person traveling to Miami has a hobby of traveling and is to the left of the person going to Hannover (Clues 4 & 5).
- The person watching documentaries owns a bird (Clue 6).
- The person traveling to Nizza watches western movies (Clue 7).
- The person whose hobby is fishing is in the middle (Clue 8).
- The Norwegian is on the far left (Clue 9).

### Step 2: Deductions from Given Clues
- Since the Norwegian is on the far left (Clue 9), and considering Clue 14, which states the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool, it implies the person traveling to Liverpool cannot be on the far left. Thus, the person traveling to Liverpool must be second from the left.
- Given that the person going to Miami is to the left of Hannover (Clue 4) and has a hobby of traveling (Clue 5), and knowing the Norwegian's position, it suggests the order could start with Norwegian, then possibly Miami, but we need more information to confirm.

### Step 3: Analyzing Hobbies and Pets
- The Danish person does photography (Clue 3).
- The Swedish person owns a dog (Clue 2), which doesn't directly tell us their hobby or city.
- The person watching comedy movies has woodworking as a hobby (Clue 12).

### Step 4: Piecing Together Movie Preferences and Pets
- The German watches horror movies (Clue 13).
- The person who watches zombie movies is near the cat owner (Clue 10) and also near the reader (Clue 15).
- The horse owner is near the western movie fan (Clue 11), who goes to Nizza (Clue 7).

### Step 5: Finalizing Positions
Given the complexity and without a clear, step-by-step elimination process for each clue in this format, let's directly address the question regarding **fish**.

From Clue 8, we know the person whose hobby is fishing is in the middle. However, to find where **fish** (the pet) is located, we need to cross-reference with other clues about pets and hobbies.

Since direct deductions are challenging without a grid or table to systematically fill out based on each clue, let's focus on what we can infer:
- The person watching documentaries owns a bird.
- The Swedish person owns a dog.
- Other pets (cat, fish, horse) and their owners' preferences need to be deduced from the remaining clues.

Given the constraints of this format and the puzzle's complexity, a detailed step-by-step grid analysis is necessary for an accurate solution. However, since we're tasked with finding where **fish** is:

The final answer is: $\boxed{fish:3}$"	fish:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_1	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each statement and deduce the positions and characteristics of the individuals.

From statement 9, we know the person traveling to Prague is on the far left.

Statement 14 tells us that the person traveling to Prague is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the person going to Prague is at one end (the far left), the person who likes blue must be next to them, which means this person cannot be in any other position but the second from the left.

Statement 4 indicates that the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Statement 5 tells us that the person who likes green has a birthday in March.

Statement 8 says the person whose birthday is in July is in the middle, which means they are in the third position since there are five people.

Given statement 3 (the person traveling to San Francisco is the person whose birthday is in February) and knowing the birthdays for some positions, we start piecing together the information:

- The far left goes to Prague.
- Second from the left likes blue (because they have to be next to the person going to Prague).
- Middle position (third) has a birthday in July.

Statement 1 tells us that the person traveling to New York is the person who likes red, but we don't know where this person is yet.

From statement 2, we know the dressmaker travels to Nizza. Statement 6 says the Pall Mall smoker is the dancer. Statement 7 indicates the person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill.

Statement 10 tells us that the Blend smoker is on the left or right of the nurseerman, and statement 15 says the Blend smoker is also on the left or right of the person whose birthday is in May. This gives us a clue about possible positions for these individuals but requires more information to place them accurately.

From statement 11, we know the librarian is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker (who likes yellow).

Statement 12 says the Bluemaster smoker has a birthday in November, and statement 13 tells us that the person traveling to Venice smokes Prince.

Now, let's try to piece together some positions based on what we've deduced:

1. Prague - ? (far left)
2. Blue - ? (second from the left, next to Prague traveler)
3. July birthday - ? (middle position)

The green liker has a March birthday and must be to the left of the white liker. Since the middle position is taken by the July birthday person, and considering the far left and second positions are somewhat defined, we need to fit the green and white likers into our structure.

Given the constraints:
- The person who likes green (March birthday) cannot be in the middle because that's occupied by the July birthday. Thus, if they were on the far right, it would violate statement 4 (green to the left of white), considering the fixed positions we've somewhat established.
- The person traveling to Prague is on the far left, followed by the blue liker.

So, we have:
1. Prague - ? 
2. Blue - ?
3. July birthday - ?

Considering statement 5 and that green must be before white, if green were in position 2 (next to Prague), it could work because then white could potentially follow later (though we don't know exactly where yet).

Let's address the professions and travel destinations more directly now:

- The dressmaker goes to Nizza.
- The Pall Mall smoker is the dancer.
- The person traveling to Venice smokes Prince.

Given all these clues, let's try to assemble a coherent picture:

1. **Prague** - Green (March birthday) doesn't fit here because of statement 14 (Prague next to Blue). So, if we consider Prague and its neighbor:
   - **Prague** could be next to Blue as per statement 14.
2. **New York** is the person who likes red (statement 1).
3. **San Francisco** has a birthday in February (statement 3).
4. **Venice** smokes Prince (statement 13).
5. **Nizza** is the dressmaker (statement 2).

Let's assign some positions based on what we know:
- If Green (March) is to be next to someone and before White, and considering Blue must be next to Prague (far left), a possible arrangement starts forming.
- Since the person whose birthday is in July is in the middle, this gives us some flexibility with the remaining clues.

Given all these conditions, let's deduce where **nurse** could fit:

Considering statement 10 (Blend smoker on the left or right of nurseerman) and statement 15 (Blend smoker also on the left or right of May birthday), we start seeing that Blend, nurseerman, and the person with a birthday in May are closely linked.

However, without explicit connections to the colors or cities for **nurse**, we must consider the remaining slots and characteristics not yet assigned:

1. The **nurse** could potentially fit into any slot not explicitly defined by other clues, but since we have specific destinations and some professions tied to those destinations or characteristics (like smoker types), we need a slot that hasn't been ruled out by other conditions.

Given the puzzle's complexity and the fact that direct deductions lead to multiple possibilities without explicit color or destination connections for **nurse**, let's analyze what we can conclude directly:

- The positions are constrained by colors, smoking brands, birthdays, professions, and destinations.
- Some clues directly place individuals (e.g., Green in March, next to Blue because of the Prague connection).

Given this analysis and without direct evidence linking **nurse** to a specific position through an unbroken chain of clues from the statements provided, it's challenging to pinpoint **nurse**'s exact location based solely on the information given.

However, if we must deduce based on available slots and considering all constraints:
- The puzzle doesn't provide a direct clue linking **nurse** to a specific position or set of characteristics that can be uniquely identified without ambiguity.
- Thus, any placement of **nurse** would require assumptions not directly supported by the clues as given.

Given this complexity and the need for a precise answer based on the clues provided:
The final answer is: $\boxed{nurse:4}$"	nurse:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_2	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the person whose birthday is in July.
From clue 9, we know the person whose birthday is in July is on the far left.

## Step 2: Identify the music genre of the person whose birthday is in April.
From clue 1, the person whose birthday is in April is a fan of metal.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the fan of country and salsa.
From clue 4, the fan of country is to the left of the fan of salsa.

## Step 4: Identify the beverage consumed by the fan of country.
From clue 5, the fan of country drinks coffee.

## Step 5: Determine the job of the musician.
From clue 6, the musician owns a bird.

## Step 6: Identify the music genre of the photographer.
From clue 7, the fan of soul is the photographer.

## Step 7: Determine the position of the person drinking milk.
From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle.

## Step 8: Analyze the positions based on clues 10 and 11.
The paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (clue 10), and the owner of the horses is on the left or right of the photographer (clue 11).

## Step 9: Determine the job of the teacher.
From clue 12, the teacher drinks beer.

## Step 10: Identify the job of the person whose birthday is in December.
From clue 13, the person whose birthday is in December is the police-officer.

## Step 11: Analyze the position of the fan of indie based on clue 14.
The person whose birthday is in July is on the left or right of the fan of indie.

## Step 12: Determine the position of the paramedic based on clue 15.
The paramedic is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

## Step 13: Combine all clues to find a possible arrangement.
Given the constraints:
- July (far left) is near indie (from clue 14).
- April (metal) can't be in July, so it must be in another position.
- September (dog owner) and June (tea drinker) have fixed positions relative to their preferences but not absolutely set yet.
- Country fan drinks coffee and is to the left of salsa fan.
- Soul fan is the photographer.
- Milk drinker is in the middle.
- Teacher drinks beer, and December is the police-officer.

Considering all clues:
1. July (indie?) - Far Left
2. ? (country) - Coffee, before salsa
3. Middle - Milk drinker
4. ? (salsa)
5. September (dog owner) - Far Right

Given that the paramedic must be near the cat or water and considering other constraints:
- The fan of country is on the left of the fan of salsa.
- The musician owns a bird, and there's no direct clue linking them to a specific position yet.

## Step 14: Finalize positions based on remaining clues.
Since we know:
- The teacher drinks beer (clue 12).
- December is the police-officer (clue 13).

And considering all other constraints:
- The person whose birthday is in June drinks tea (clue 3), which doesn't directly link to a music genre or pet yet.

Given that we need to find where **fish** is, let's assume positions based on given clues and try to fit the remaining pieces:
- If July is far left and near indie, and country must be before salsa, a possible arrangement considering all jobs, pets, and drinks could start forming. However, without direct links for each clue to every other piece of information, we deduce based on process of elimination.

The final answer is: $\boxed{fish:3}$"	fish:4
