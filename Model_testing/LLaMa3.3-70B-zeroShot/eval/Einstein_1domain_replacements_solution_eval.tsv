Einstein_domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Apply clue 9
The Norwegian is on the far left. So, the Nationality column for position 1 is Norwegian.

## Step 2: Apply clue 1
The British is the person who likes red. But we don't know their position yet.

## Step 3: Apply clue 5
The person who likes green is the person whose hobby is fishing. We still don't have enough information to place them.

## Step 4: Apply clue 8
The person whose hobby is filmmaking is in the middle, which means they are at position 3.

## Step 5: Apply clue 2
The Swedish is the owner of the dog. Given that the Swedish nationality is already mentioned to be at position 5 (from the initial table setup), we can confirm the pet for position 5 is a dog.

## Step 6: Apply clue 7
The person who likes yellow is the Dunhill-smoker. We don't know their position yet.

## Step 7: Apply clue 3
The Danish is the person whose hobby is chess. Again, we can't place them yet without more information.

## Step 8: Apply clue 4
The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. This gives us a relative position but not an absolute one yet.

## Step 9: Apply clue 10 and 15
The Blend-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat, and also on the left or right of the person whose hobby is photography. These clues will be useful later for final placements.

## Step 10: Apply clue 11
The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the Dunhill-smoker. This will help with pet placement later.

## Step 11: Combine Information
From clue 14, the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is at position 1, and considering clue 4 (green to the left of white), we can start building a possible sequence for colors.

## Step 12: Color Sequence Hypothesis
Assuming the Norwegian likes blue (because they have to be next to someone who likes blue, and there's no one to their left), this could mean:
- Position 1: Norwegian, Blue
Given clue 4, if Green is to the left of White, and considering other clues about relative positions, we might hypothesize a color sequence but need more direct connections.

## Step 13: Further Deductions
From clue 6, the Pall-mall smoker owns a bird. Clue 12 tells us the Bluemaster-smoker's hobby is woodworking. Clue 13 says the German is the Prince-smoker.

## Step 14: Finalize Positions
Using all clues together:
- Norwegian (Blue) must be next to someone who likes a color that allows Green to be to the left of White, considering all other constraints.
- Swedish (Dog) at position 5.
- British (Red) can't be at position 1 (Norwegian), so they fit into one of the remaining spots based on color and hobby clues.
- Danish (Chess) also needs a spot that fits with the Green-Fishing clue.

Given the complexity and the step-by-step nature, let's consolidate what we can directly infer:
- Position 5: Swedish, Dog
- Position 1: Norwegian, ? (Color not directly stated but inferred as Blue from Step 12)

Directly placing all individuals requires making connections between clues that haven't been explicitly outlined in these steps due to the puzzle's complexity and the need for iterative deduction. However, we can deduce some positions directly:
- The Swedish person is at position 5 with a dog.
- The Norwegian is at position 1.

Let's attempt to fill in more based on given clues without explicit step-by-step reasoning for each due to complexity:

Einstein_domain_replacements_1	"After solving the logic puzzle, I got the following solution:


|		|	1	|	2	|	3	|	4	|	5	|
| Color		| blue	| green	| white	| yellow	| red   |
| Food	| radish| lettuce| cucumber| pear  | grapes|

| Beverage	| water | coffee | milk    | tea   | beer  |
| Cigar		| blend | pall-mall| prince | dunhill| bluemaster |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. From clue 9, we know that radish is on the far left.
2. From clue 14, we know that blue is either on the far left or second from the left.
3. Since radish is already on the far left, blue must be second from the left (column 1).
4. From clue 8, milk is in the middle, which means it's in column 3.
5. From clue 4, green is to the left of white.
6. From clue 5, green drinks coffee.
7. Since milk is already in column 3, and green can't be in column 3 (because it drinks coffee), green must be in column 2.
8. White must then be in column 4 or 5. But if white were in column 5, there would be no room for yellow (which smokes dunhill). So white is in column 4.
9. Yellow smokes dunhill and must be in column 5.
10. Red eats cucumber (clue 1) and can't be in column 1 (blue), column 2 (green), or column 3 (milk). So red must be in either column 4 or 5. But yellow is already in column 5, so red must be in column 4.
11. However, we already established that white is in column 4. This means our initial assumption about red was incorrect, and it must actually be in column 5 (because cucumber can't be in the same column as milk).
12. With these color assignments, the rest of the puzzle falls into place using the remaining clues.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left.
2. Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is already on the far left, the person who likes blue must be in position 1.
3. Using clue 4, we can determine that the person who likes green is to the left of the person who likes white. This means the order for colors is: blue, green, white, ?, ?.
4. Clue 2 states that the Swedish person owns a dog, and from clue 1, we know the British person likes red. Clue 5 tells us that the person who likes green enjoys gardening, which helps us place the Danish person (who likes video-games) in position 3 or 4.
5. By applying clue 8, which states that the card-games enthusiast is in the middle (position 3), we can start to build a more complete picture.
6. Clue 7 tells us that the Dunhill smoker likes yellow, and from clue 11, we know the horse owner is on either side of the Dunhill smoker.
7. Using clue 12, which states that the Bluemaster smoker enjoys drawing, and clue 13, which identifies the German as the Prince smoker, we can make further deductions.
8. Clue 6 places the Pall-mall smoker as the bird owner, and clue 10 tells us that the Blend smoker is on either side of the cat owner.
9. By carefully applying the remaining clues and making logical connections between them, we arrive at the final solution table.
