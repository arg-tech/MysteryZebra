Zebra_orig_1	"To solve this puzzle, let's start by using the given clues to fill in the information we have:


1. **The Englishman lives in the red house.**
2. **The Norwegian lives in the first house.** This means the order starts with Norwegian.
3. **The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.**
4. **Milk is drunk in the middle house.** Since there are five houses, this would be house number 3.
5. **The Japanese smokes Parliaments and lives in house 5 (given).**

From clue 15, **The Norwegian lives next to the blue house**, and since the Norwegian lives in the first house, the blue house must be the second house.


Now, let's incorporate more clues:


- Clue 8: **Kools are smoked in the yellow house.**
- Clue 12: **Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.** This means the yellow house cannot be at either end (since one end is Norwegian and the other is Japanese, and we don't have enough space for all combinations if it were at an end).
- Given that milk is drunk in the middle (3rd) house, and knowing the green house must be to the right of the ivory house, we can start piecing together the order.


Let's try placing the yellow house as the 4th house since Kools need to be next to a horse and there needs to be space for all combinations:


Norwegian (1), Blue (2), Milk (3) - which could be green or ivory but we know green is to the right of ivory, Yellow (4), Japanese (5)


Given **the Englishman lives in the red house** and **the Spaniard owns the dog**, without direct placement clues for them yet, let's consider other clues:


- Clue 11: **The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.**
- Since **Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse**, and if we place yellow as the 4th house, this means either the horse is in the 3rd (milk) or 5th house, but given other constraints, it's more likely the horse would be associated with another house not directly mentioned yet.


Considering **coffee is drunk in the green house** and **the green house is to the right of the ivory house**, if we place milk in the middle (which could be either green or ivory), coffee being in green suggests that the order must accommodate this:


Ivory cannot be 3rd because then green would have to be 4th, but we've tentatively placed yellow as 4th. So, green must be after ivory, meaning if milk is in the middle (3rd house), it has to be in the ivory house for green to follow.


So, let's piece this together with what we know:


1. Norwegian
2. Blue
3. Ivory - Milk
4. Yellow - Kools
5. Japanese - Parliaments


Now filling in other details based on clues:


- **The Old Gold smoker owns snails**, and since we have a smoker for each house except the first and third, Old Gold must be associated with either the Norwegian or the person in the ivory house (since milk is drunk there).
- **Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.**
- Given the Englishman lives in the red house, but not knowing where it fits yet, let's try to place other houses.


We know from clue 6 and others that we have a sequence like this:


Norwegian (1), Blue (2), Ivory - Milk (3), Yellow - Kools (4), Japanese - Parliaments (5)


The Englishman in the red house hasn't been placed yet. Considering **the green house is to the right of the ivory house**, if ivory is 3rd, then green must be after it, which means our initial guess needs adjustment since yellow was tentatively placed as 4th.


Let's correctly place the houses based on clues without contradicting any information:


1. Norwegian
2. Blue
3. Ivory - Milk (since milk is in the middle)
4. Green - Coffee (because green must be to the right of ivory)
5. Red or Yellow hasn't been placed for color yet, but we know Japanese lives in house 5 and smokes Parliaments.


Given this setup:


- Norwegian cannot smoke Kools because it's at an end.
- Blue is next to Norwegian, so the fox (from clue 11) could be here if we adjust other clues accordingly.


Let's finalize with pets, drinks, and cigarettes based on remaining clues:


1. **The Spaniard owns the dog**, which hasn't been placed yet.
2. **Coffee is drunk in the green house**.
3. **The Ukrainian drinks tea**, not yet placed.
4. **Milk is drunk in the middle house**, which we've established as ivory.


Given all constraints and clues, here's a potential solution:


|       | 1     | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Color | Yellow| Blue   | Ivory  | Green  | Red    |
| Nationality | Norwegian | English | Ukrainian | Spanish | Japanese |
| Beverage | Water | Tea    | Milk    | Coffee  | Orange Juice |
| Cigar   | Kools | Chesterfield | Old Gold | Lucky Strike | Parliaments |
| Pet     | Fox   | Horse   | Snails  | Dog     | Zebra    |


However, upon closer examination and re-evaluation of all clues to ensure accuracy:


The correct sequence that respects all given conditions is actually different from the initial attempt. Let's re-analyze with a focus on accurate placement based on the provided clues without making assumptions beyond what's directly stated or implied.


Given the complexity and the need for precise step-by-step deduction, let's reconsider the information:


- **Norwegian lives in the first house**.
- **The Englishman lives in the red house**, but we don't know its position yet.
- **Blue is next to Norwegian** (from clue 15).
- **Green is to the right of Ivory**.
- **Milk is drunk in the middle house**.


The Japanese smokes Parliaments and lives in the last house. Considering all clues again for a precise fit:


1. The order must accommodate the Englishman, Spaniard, Ukrainian, Norwegian, and Japanese with their respective houses (red, unknown for others yet), pets, drinks, and cigarettes.
2. Each clue must be used to place individuals without contradicting other statements.


Given the direct information and constraints:


- Clue 11: Chesterfields are next to the fox.
- Clue 12: Kools are smoked next to the horse.
- The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
- Old Gold smokes snails.


The puzzle's complexity requires a methodical approach, ensuring each clue aligns with the deductions. Upon re-examination and careful consideration of all provided clues:


#############
|       | 1     | 2      | 3      | 4      | 5      |
|-------|-------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Color | Yellow| Blue   | Red    | Green  | Ivory  |
| Nationality | Norwegian | English | Spanish | Ukrainian | Japanese |
| Beverage | Water | Tea    | Milk    | Coffee  | Orange Juice is not correct based on clues, reevaluation needed |
| Cigar   | Kools | Chesterfield | Old Gold | Lucky Strike | Parliaments |
| Pet     | Fox   | Horse   | Snails  | Dog     | Zebra    |
#############


This final arrangement considers the need for accurate placement according to all given conditions and clues, acknowledging that precise deduction requires careful alignment of each piece of information provided in the puzzle. The initial misplacement and subsequent reevaluation underscore the importance of methodically addressing each clue to arrive at a coherent solution that respects all constraints."	{'color': ['yellow', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'ivory'], 'nationality': ['norwegian', 'english', 'spanish', 'ukrainian', 'japanese'], 'beverage': ['water', 'tea', 'milk', 'coffee', 'orange-juice is not correct based on clues, reevaluation needed'], 'cigar': ['kools', 'chesterfield', 'old-gold', 'lucky-strike', 'parliament'], 'pet': ['fox', 'horse', 'snails', 'dog', 'zebra']}	True	12	False
Zebra_orig_2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll use a step-by-step approach based on the given clues.


## Step 1: Determine the order of houses based on colors and nationalities
From clue 2, we know the Englishman lives in the red house.
From clue 10, the Norwegian lives in the first house.
Given clue 15, the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means the second house must be blue because if the first house were blue, there wouldn't be a house for the Norwegian to live in next to the blue one.


## Step 2: Establish the color of each house
From clue 6, we know the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
Since we have the Norwegian (first house) and then blue (second house), the order so far is:
1. Norwegian - Yellow/Red (Unknown yet)
2. Blue - Unknown nationality

Given that milk is drunk in the middle house (clue 9), and considering the green house must be to the right of the ivory house, we can start building a possible sequence.


## Step 3: Integrate the information about drinks
From clue 4, coffee is drunk in the green house.
Clue 5 tells us the Ukrainian drinks tea.
Clue 9 says milk is drunk in the middle house.

So far:
1. Norwegian - ? (first house)
2. Blue - ? (second house)
3. Milk - Middle house (third house)
4. Green - Coffee (fourth or fifth house, but since green must be to the right of ivory, and there's a sequence of houses already started, we'll have to fit it accordingly)
5. Ivory - ? (must be before green)

Given that the Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2) and considering all other information:
- If Norwegian is first and blue is second, we can place the Englishman in a way that respects the given constraints.


## Step 4: Finalize the placement of houses based on all clues
Considering clue 8 (Kools are smoked in the yellow house), clue 11 (Chesterfields smoker lives next to the man with the fox), and clue 12 (Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse), we can start filling in more details.

Since the Japanese smokes Parliaments (clue 14) and given the constraints about pets, drinks, and cigarettes:
- The table starts to fill out as we match each resident with their preferences.


## Step 5: Combine all information for a final solution
Given all clues:
1. Norwegian lives in the first house.
2. Blue is the second house.
3. Middle house (third) has milk.
4. Green must be after ivory, and since coffee is drunk there, it fits after milk.
5. Red (Englishman's house) can only fit if it's not next to blue (because of other constraints), suggesting a possible order.

Let's fill out the table based on all clues:


|        | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5       |
|--------|--------|-------|------|-------|---------|
| Color  | Yellow | Blue  | Red  | Green | Ivory   |
| Nationality | Norwegian | Japanese (from given table) is incorrect based on our deductions; it should be: Norwegian, English doesn't fit here due to other constraints, so let's correct this: Norwegian, Ukrainian can't be here because of tea, so it must align with other clues | English    | Ukrainian | Spanish  | Japanese |
|        |        |       |      |       |         |
| Beverage| Water   | Tea   | Milk | Coffee| Orange Juice|
| Cigar  | Kools   | Chesterfield| Lucky Strike | Old Gold | Parliament|
| Pet    | Fox     | Horse  | Snails| Dog    | Zebra    |

Correcting the initial table with our deductions and ensuring all clues fit:


The final answer is: 
#############
|        | 1      | 2     | 3    | 4     | 5       |

| Color  | Yellow | Blue  | Red  | Green | Ivory   |
| Nationality | Norwegian | Ukrainian | English | Spanish  | Japanese |
| Beverage| Water   | Tea   | Milk | Coffee| Orange Juice|

Zebra_orig_3	"To solve this puzzle, we'll follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the order of houses based on given clues
From clue 6, we know the green house is to the right of the ivory house.
From clue 10, the Norwegian lives in the first house.
From clue 15, the Norwegian lives next to the blue house, so the blue house must be the second house because the Norwegian cannot live in the blue house (as per clue 5 and other nationality clues).
Given that the Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2) and the Japanese is already placed in house 5 (given table), we start to form a picture.


## Step 2: Place the Englishman and determine the color of his house
The Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2). Since the Norwegian lives in the first house and next to the blue house, and given the constraints about house colors and nationalities, we need to find where the red house fits.


## Step 3: Use clue 9 to place milk in the middle house
Milk is drunk in the middle house (clue 9), which means the third house. This clue helps us start placing beverages.


## Step 4: Apply clue 5 to place the Ukrainian
The Ukrainian drinks tea, but we don't have enough information yet to place them directly.


## Step 5: Use clues about pets and smoking to fill in gaps
From clue 7, the Old Gold smoker owns snails.
From clue 11, the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox.
Clue 12 indicates Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse.


## Step 6: Piece together remaining information
Given that we have specific clues about the location of certain houses (like green being next to ivory, and the blue house's position), we can start piecing together the order based on nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette brand.


## Step 7: Finalize house order and occupant details
1. Norwegian - Yellow - Water - Kools - Fox (inferred from clues about neighboring houses and remaining options)
2. Japanese is in house 5, so we need to fill in the other nationalities around the fixed points.
3. Englishman in the red house, which can't be next to the blue (Norwegian's neighbor), suggesting it might be the third or fourth house based on earlier deductions.
4. The green house (coffee) is to the right of ivory, and with milk in the middle, this helps place some houses.


Given all clues and steps, let's assemble what we know into a table format for clarity:


| House # | Color    | Nationality | Pet     | Drink      | Cigar      |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1      | Yellow   | Norwegian   | Fox     | Water      | Kools      |
| 2      | Blue     | Japanese    | Horse   | Orange Juice| Parliaments|
| 3      | Ivory    | English     | Snails  | Milk       | Old Gold   |
| 4      | Green    | Ukrainian   | Dog     | Coffee     | Chesterfield|
| 5      | Red      | Spanish     | Zebra   | Tea        | Lucky Strike|


The final answer is: 
#############
| House # | Color    | Nationality | Pet     | Drink      | Cigar      |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------|------------|------------|
| 1      | Yellow   | Norwegian   | Fox     | Water      | Kools      |
| 2      | Blue     | Japanese    | Horse   | Orange Juice| Parliaments|
| 3      | Ivory    | English     | Snails  | Milk       | Old Gold   |
| 4      | Green    | Ukrainian   | Dog     | Coffee     | Chesterfield|
| 5      | Red      | Spanish     | Zebra   | Tea        | Lucky Strike|
