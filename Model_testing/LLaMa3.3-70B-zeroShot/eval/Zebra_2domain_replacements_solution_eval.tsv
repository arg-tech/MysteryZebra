## Step 1: Start with the known information from clue 9
The person traveling to London is on the far left.

|       | 1          | 2        | 3      | 4     | 5    |
| City  | London     |          |        |       |      |
| Color |            |          |        |       |      |
| Job   |            |          |        |       |      |
| Cigar |            |          |        |       |      |
| Pet   |            |          |        |       |      |

## Step 2: Use clue 1 to determine the color for London
The person traveling to Berlin is the person who likes red. Since London is on the far left, Berlin must be in one of the other positions.

## Step 3: Apply clue 8 to find the social worker's position
The social-worker is in the middle, which means they are in position 3.

|       | 1          | 2        | 3            | 4     | 5    |
| City  | London     |          |               |       |      |
| Color |            |          |               |       |      |
| Job   |            |          | Social-worker |       |      |
| Cigar |            |          |               |       |      |
| Pet   |            |          |               |       |      |

## Step 4: Use clue 2 to place Nizza and the dog owner
The person traveling to Nizza is the owner of the dog. We don't know the exact position yet, but we'll keep this in mind.

## Step 5: Apply clue 3 to find the architect's color
The architect is the person who likes green. This doesn't give us an immediate position, but it helps with future deductions.

## Step 6: Use clue 4 to place Marseilles and the dancer
The person traveling to Marseilles is the dancer. Like Nizza, we don't know the exact position yet.

## Step 7: Apply clue 5 to relate green and ivory
The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. This will help us when placing colors.

## Step 8: Use clue 6 to place the old-gold smoker and snails owner
The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails. This gives us a direct relationship between a cigar brand and a pet but not an immediate position.

## Step 9: Apply clue 7 to relate kools and yellow
The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow. Another direct relationship, but we need more information for placement.

## Step 10: Use clue 10 to relate chesterfields and fox
The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. We have a chesterfield smoker in position 2 from the initial puzzle statement.

|       | 1          | 2        | 3            | 4     | 5    |
| City  | London     |          |               |       |      |
| Color |            |          |               |       |      |
| Job   |            |          | Social-worker |       |      |
| Cigar |            | Chesterfield |               |       |      |
| Pet   |            |          |               |       |      |

## Step 11: Apply clue 11 to relate kools and horse
The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. This gives us another relationship but requires more information for exact placement.

## Step 12: Use clue 12 to place the lucky-strike smoker and project manager
The lucky-strike-smoker is the project-manager. We don't have an immediate position, but this helps with job placements.

## Step 13: Apply clue 13 to place Colone and parliaments
The person traveling to Colone is the parliaments-smoker. Given the initial puzzle statement, we see Parliament in position 5.

|       | 1          | 2        | 3            | 4     | 5    |
| City  | London     |          |               |       | Colone|
| Color |            |          |               |       |      |
| Job   |            |          | Social-worker |       |      |
| Cigar |            | Chesterfield |               |       | Parliament |
| Pet   |            |          |               |       |      |

## Step 14: Use clue 14 to relate London and blue
The person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Given London's position, this means blue could be in position 2.

## Step 15: Combine all clues for final placement
Given the complexity and the need for step-by-step elimination based on all clues, we deduce as follows:

- From clue 1 and the table, Berlin must be associated with red, but its exact position isn't specified yet.
- Clue 9 places London on the far left.
- The social worker is in the middle (clue 8).
- The dancer is in Marseilles (clue 4), which could help place other cities and jobs relative to each other.
- Green is to the right of ivory (clue 5), and since the architect likes green, this helps with color placement but requires knowing positions.
- Old-gold smoker owns snails (clue 6).
- Kools smoker likes yellow (clue 7).
- Chesterfields smoker is next to the fox owner (clue 10), which could be in position 2 or another position based on other clues.
- Lucky-strike smoker is the project manager (clue 12).
- Parliament smoker goes to Colone (clue 13).

Considering all relationships and given positions:

1. London is on the far left, associated with clue 14 (blue), but we can't directly place blue without considering other colors and clues.
2. The social worker is in the middle, which means position 3.
3. Berlin likes red, Nizza has a dog, Marseilles has a dancer, and Colone has parliaments.

Given these steps and deductions, let's assemble what we can:

|       | 1          | 2        | 3            | 4     | 5    |
| City  | London     | Berlin   | Marseilles   | Nizza | Colone|
| Color | Blue       | Red      |              | Ivory | Green |
| Job   | Electrician| Architect| Dancer       | Social-worker | Project-manager |
| Cigar | Kools      | Old-gold | Chesterfield | Lucky-strike | Parliament |
| Pet   | Horse      | Snails   | Fox          | Dog    | Zebra  |

This assembly considers the clues about relative positions, colors, jobs, cigars, and pets. Note that some direct placements (like specific job-color matches beyond what's directly stated) require using all given clues to deduce the most likely arrangement.


The final answer is:

From clue 1, the person eating strawberry is the person who likes red. But we don't know where they are yet.

From clue 14, the person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since pomegranate is on the far left, blue must be in position 2.

From clue 3, the person whose sport is skiing is the person who likes green. From clue 5, the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. But we don't know where they are yet.

From clue 8, the person whose sport is surfing is in the middle, which means position 3.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Food	| pomegranate |           |                |         |          |

From clue 6, the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails. We don't know where they are yet.

From clue 2, the person eating lime is the owner of the dog. But we don't know where they are yet.

From clue 4, the person eating potato is the person whose sport is cycling.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|

From clue 7, the kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow. From clue 11, the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.

From clue 12, the lucky-strike-smoker is the person whose sport is handball.

From clue 13, the person eating peach is the parliaments-smoker.

Now we have enough information to start filling in more details.


Given that surfing is in position 3 and cycling is in position 4, and skiing (which likes green) must be to the right of ivory but we don't know where exactly yet, let's try to place some of the other sports and colors based on the clues provided.


We have blue in position 2. Given that green must be to the right of ivory and there's surfing in the middle, it seems likely that ivory could be in position 1 or 2, but since blue is already in position 2, let's consider ivory being in a different position if possible, keeping in mind green has to be after it.


Considering clue 10 (the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox) and knowing the positions of some sports, we can start deducing more information.


Since pomegranate is on the far left, and from clue 1 (strawberry likes red), strawberry cannot be in position 1. Given this and other clues, let's continue to piece together the puzzle:


Given all these considerations and revisiting each clue with the current state of the table:


1. Strawberry eater likes red.
2. Lime eater owns a dog.
3. Skier likes green.
4. Potato eater cycles.
5. Green is to the right of ivory.
6. Old-gold-smoker owns snails.
7. Kools-smoker likes yellow.
8. Surfer is in the middle (position 3).
9. Pomegranate eater is on the far left.
10. Chesterfields-smoker is next to fox owner.
11. Kools-smoker is next to horse owner.
12. Lucky-strike-smoker plays handball.
13. Peach eater smokes parliaments.
14. Pomegranate eater is next to blue.


Now, filling in the rest based on elimination and direct clues:


Given clue 10, chesterfield could be in position 1 or 5 because it has to be next to the fox owner, but since pomegranate (and thus possibly its associated color) is in position 1, let's see how we can fit everything else.


Considering the placement of colors and foods based on their associated pets, sports, and cigars:


Peach eater smokes parliaments (clue 13), so peach must be in either position 4 or 5 because parliaments are at the end. But potato is already with cycling in position 4, so peach (and thus parliaments) should go in position 5.


With surfing in the middle and given that skiing likes green and must be after ivory, we start seeing a possible arrangement for sports and colors:


If we place strawberry (which likes red) in position 5, it conflicts with clue 13 (peach eater smokes parliaments). So, considering all other clues, let's try fitting the rest.


Since old-gold is associated with snails (clue 6), and given the arrangement so far, we can start deducing cigar placements based on their association with pets and sports.


Now, trying to fit in the pets:


The kools-smoker likes yellow (clue 7) and must be next to the horse owner. The lucky-strike-smoker plays handball (clue 12), which could potentially fit into one of the remaining slots for sports.


Given that pomegranate is on the far left, followed by blue, and considering all pet, sport, color, food, and cigar associations:


Let's make a final attempt to solve it based on these deductions and clues provided:


Considering clue 1 (strawberry likes red), strawberry can't be in position 1. If we try placing foods with their respective colors and pets, keeping the sports in mind:


Now let's see if we can fit everything together correctly.


Given that pomegranate is next to blue (clue 14), and considering all other clues about colors, pets, and cigars:


After re-evaluating each clue with the table's current state:


Since peach smokes parliaments (position 5) and is associated with a color, let's consider placing the rest of the foods and colors based on their associations.


We have enough information now to make an educated guess at the arrangement.


Given all these clues, we try to solve for each category:


Now that we've placed some key items, let's fill in the rest.


Based on all deductions, here is a final possible solution:


1. Pomegranate (color: possibly ivory or another, but we know blue is next to it), sport: handball (to fit lucky-strike-smoker), pet: dog (because lime eater owns a dog and could fit here if colors align), cigar: chesterfield (as it fits being next to fox owner potentially).
2. Blue, sport: possibly skiing (since green must be after ivory, but we have blue here; thus, skiing might not directly follow ivory as previously thought), pet: fox (next to chesterfield smoker), cigar: old-gold.
3. Lime (as it fits with the remaining options and could align colors appropriately), color: green (because surfing is in the middle, and if ivory were before blue, this would place green after a potential ivory or another arrangement), sport: surfing, pet: horse (since kools-smoker is next to horse owner), cigar: kools.
4. Potato, color: yellow (kools-smoker likes yellow), sport: cycling, pet: snails (old-gold-smoker owns snails), cigar: lucky-strike.
5. Peach, color: red (strawberry eater likes red; peach is the only fit left for parliaments and a color), sport: possibly golf or another not mentioned directly (since other sports are placed), pet: possibly another not directly associated with given clues, cigar: parliaments.


This attempt considers all provided clues but may require adjustments based on a detailed re-evaluation of each clue's implications on the arrangement:


The final answer is: 
No direct solution can be accurately provided without making several assumptions due to the complexity and interconnectivity of the clues. However, by methodically applying each clue to the table and considering the restrictions and possibilities they present, one can deduce a potential arrangement that satisfies all given conditions."	{'food': ['pomegranate', '', '', '', ''], 'color': ['', 'blue', '', '', ''], 'sport': ['', '', 'surfing', 'cycling', ''], 'cigar': ['', '', '', '', ''], 'pet': ['', '', '', '', '']}	True	3	False
