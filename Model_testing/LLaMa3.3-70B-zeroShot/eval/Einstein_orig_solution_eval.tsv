Einstein_orig_1	"To solve this puzzle, we will follow the clues step by step and fill in the information as we go.


## Step 1: Determine the Norwegian's house color and position
From clue 9, the Norwegian lives in the first house. Clue 14 tells us the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house. Since the Norwegian is in the first house, the Blue house must be second.


## Step 2: Identify the Brit's house color
Clue 1 states the Brit lives in a Red house.


## Step 3: Place the Green and White houses
From clue 4, the Green house is on the left of the White house.


## Step 4: Determine the drinker of Coffee
Clue 5 says the Green house owner drinks Coffee.


## Step 5: Identify the center house's beverage
Clue 8 tells us the owner living in the center house drinks Milk.


## Step 6: Place the Yellow house and its owner's cigar brand
Clue 7 states the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.


## Step 7: Determine the pet of the Swede
From clue 2, the Swede keeps Dogs as pets.


## Step 8: Identify the drinker of Tea
Clue 3 says the Dane drinks Tea.


## Step 9: Place the owner who smokes Pall Mall and their pet
Clue 6 tells us the owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds.


## Step 10: Determine the German's cigar brand
From clue 13, the German smokes Prince.


## Step 11: Identify the smoker of Bluemaster and their drink
Clue 12 states the owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.


## Step 12: Use remaining clues to fill in gaps
- Clue 10: The owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats.
- Clue 11: The owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.
- Clue 15: The owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water.


Given all these clues, let's start filling in the houses from left to right:


1. Norwegian (First house) - Next to Blue
2. Blue house (Second house)
3. Center house (Third house) - Drinks Milk
4. Fourth house
5. Fifth house


From clue 14 and step 1, we have:
- Norwegian (Yellow, because if it were any other color, the Blue would not be next to it given the constraints of other houses), First house.
- Blue house, Second house.


The only configuration that allows all conditions to be met is:


Norwegian (Yellow) - Blue (Dane) - Brit (Red) - German (Green) - Swede (White)


Now filling in the pets and cigars based on the clues:


1. Norwegian (Yellow) - Cat - Water - Dunhill
2. Dane (Blue) - Horse - Tea - Blend
3. Brit (Red) - Birds - Milk - Pall Mall
4. German (Green) - Fish - Coffee - Prince
5. Swede (White) - Dog - Beer - Bluemaster


This configuration satisfies all given conditions.


The final answer is:

Einstein_orig_2	"To solve this puzzle, we'll go through the clues step by step and fill in the information as we get it.


## Step 1: Determine the Norwegian's house color and position
From clue 9, the Norwegian lives in the first house. From clue 14, the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house. This means the second house must be Blue because the Norwegian cannot live next to themselves.


## Step 2: Place the Green and White houses
From clue 4, the Green house is on the left of the White house. We don't know their exact positions yet, but we know they are a pair with Green before White.


## Step 3: Identify the Brit's house color
From clue 1, the Brit lives in a Red house. We don't know where it is yet.


## Step 4: Determine the Yellow house owner's cigar brand and neighbor
From clue 7, the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill. From clue 11, the owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.


## Step 5: Place the center house beverage
From clue 8, the owner living in the center house drinks Milk.


## Step 6: Combine information and start placing houses
Given that we have a few fixed points:
- Norwegian (first house)
- Blue house (second house, because it's next to the Norwegian)
- The Green and White houses are together with Green first.
- The Yellow house smokes Dunhill.

Let's consider possible positions for these houses while keeping in mind the clues about the beverages, pets, and cigars.


## Step 7: Analyze the beverage clues
From clue 3, the Dane drinks Tea. From clue 5, the Green house owner drinks Coffee. We also know from clue 8 that the middle house owner drinks Milk.


## Step 8: Use the Swede's pet to narrow down possibilities
From clue 2, the Swede keeps Dogs as pets. This doesn't directly tell us which house is the Swede's but gives us another piece of information to fit into our puzzle.


## Step 9: Piece together more clues about cigars and neighbors
From clue 6, the owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds. From clue 10, the owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats. Clue 12 tells us the owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer.


## Step 10: Finalize house positions and occupants based on all clues
Let's use all the information gathered:
- Norwegian in the first house.
- Blue house second (next to Norwegian).
- The Green house is before the White house, and since the center house drinks Milk, we can start building a sequence that fits all given conditions.

Given the constraints:
1. Norwegian (Yellow, because if it were any other color, we'd violate another rule) in the first house.
2. Blue house second.
3. The only configuration that allows for all rules to be obeyed regarding neighbors and drinks is having Green third (because its owner drinks Coffee), which places White fourth since it must be after Green.
4. Red fifth because it's the only remaining color, and from clue 1, we know the Brit lives in a Red house.

Now, filling in the blanks with what we've deduced:
- Norwegian (first) smokes Dunhill (clue 7), drinks Water (since other drinks are accounted for or don't fit), keeps a Cat (other pets are assigned or don't fit).
- Blue house second; from clue 9 and deduction, this is the Dane who drinks Tea.
- Green third; owner drinks Coffee.
- White fourth; since the center house drinks Milk, and our sequence has the Green house in the third position, the actual center (third) house's drink doesn't match our initial assumption. The correct sequence must consider all clues about neighbors and preferences. Thus, adjusting based on clue 8, if we place the houses as Yellow-Blue-Green-White-Red, the middle (third) house indeed drinks Milk, fitting clue 8 perfectly when considering the whole puzzle.
- Red fifth; Brit lives here.

For pets:
- Norwegian keeps Cats.
- The Swede keeps Dogs and must live in either the Green or White house since those are the only options left that fit without violating any rules. Given the constraints about neighbors and the remaining houses, we can place the Swede.
- Other pets (Birds for Pall Mall smoker, Horses for Dunhill's neighbor) are placed based on clues.

Cigars:
- Norwegian smokes Dunhill.
- German smokes Prince.
- Bluemaster smokes Beer; this must be in the Red house since it's the only one left that could logically fit without breaking any other rules.


The final answer is: 
#############
| Color    | Yellow  | Blue   | Green | White | Red    |
| Nationality | Norwegian | Dane   | Swede | German | Brit   |
| Pet      | Cat     | Horse  | Dog   | Birds | Fish   |
| Beverage | Water   | Tea    | Coffee| Milk  | Beer   |
| Cigar    | Dunhill | Blend  | Bluemaster | Prince | Pall Mall|

Einstein_orig_3	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully analyze each clue and use a process of elimination to figure out the characteristics of each house.


From clue 9, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house.
From clue 14, we know the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house, so the second house must be Blue.


Using clue 1, the Brit lives in a Red house. We don't know where the Red house is yet.
From clue 3, the Dane drinks Tea.
From clue 5, the Green house owner drinks Coffee, and from clue 4, the Green house is to the left of the White house.
We also know from clue 7 that the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.


Now let's try to assemble what we have so far:


|       | 1        | 2      | 3    | 4     | 5     |
|-------|----------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Color | ?        | Blue   | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Nationality| Norwegian | ?     | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Pet     | ?       | ?      | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Beverage| ?       | ?      | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Cigar   | ?       | ?      | ?    | ?     | ?     |


From clue 8, the owner in the center house (3) drinks Milk.


Now we use clue 6: The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds. We don't know where this is yet.
Clue 10 says the owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats. Still not enough info to place them.
Clue 11 tells us the owner who keeps Horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill, and since we know the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (clue 7), this helps a bit but still isn't enough on its own.


From clue 2, the Swede keeps Dogs as pets.
Clue 12 says the owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer. Not placed yet.
Clue 13 tells us the German smokes Prince. Also not placed.


Let's think about the colors and nationalities first since we have a bit more information on those:


- Norwegian is in house 1 (clue 9).
- The Blue house is next to the Norwegian, so it must be house 2.
- The Green house drinks Coffee and is to the left of the White house (clues 4 and 5), but we don't know where they are yet.
- The Brit lives in a Red house (clue 1), but we don't know its position.


Since the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house, and given the constraints about the Green and White houses, let's place what we can:


|       | 1        | 2      | 3    | 4     | 5     |
|-------|----------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Color | Yellow   | Blue   | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Nationality| Norwegian | ?     | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Pet     | ?       | ?      | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Beverage| ?       | ?      | Milk | ?     | ?     |
| Cigar   | Dunhill | ?      | ?    | ?     | ?     |


We placed Yellow in house 1 because the Norwegian lives there, and from clue 7, the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.


Now, let's place the Green and White houses. Since the Green house is to the left of the White house (clue 4), and considering we have a Blue house in position 2, the only way to fit them without contradicting other clues (like the Brit living in a Red house) is to place them after the Blue house but keeping in mind that one of these houses needs to be the center house where Milk is drunk.


Given this setup, and knowing the Yellow house smokes Dunhill, we use clue 11: The owner who keeps Horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. Since the Norwegian (in the Yellow house) can't keep horses because there's no one to his left, Horses must be kept by someone in the Blue house or to the right of the Yellow house.


Let's correct our table with what we know and apply more clues:


The center house drinks Milk (clue 8), so let's place the Green and White houses considering this:


|       | 1        | 2      | 3    | 4     | 5     |
|-------|----------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Color | Yellow   | Blue   | Green| White | Red   |
| Nationality| Norwegian | ?     | ?    | ?     | Brit  |
| Pet     | ?       | Horses | ?    | ?     | ?     |
| Beverage| Water   | ?      | Coffee| Milk  | Tea   |
| Cigar   | Dunhill | ?      | ?    | ?     | Blend |


We've placed the Red house last because of clue 1 and the need to balance out the other colors with the remaining houses.


Now, let's apply more clues:


- The Dane drinks Tea (clue 3), so the Dane must live in the last house since that's where we have Tea.
- The Swede keeps Dogs as pets (clue 2).
- The German smokes Prince (clue 13).


Using clue 10, the owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats. Given our current setup, this means either the Green house or the White house could have Cats because they are next to each other.


But from clue 15, the owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water. Since we've placed Water in the Norwegian's (Yellow) house and Milk in the center (Green) house, and considering the need for each person to have different pets, cigars, and beverages:


|       | 1        | 2      | 3    | 4     | 5     |
|-------|----------|--------|------|-------|-------|
| Color | Yellow   | Blue   | Green| White | Red   |
| Nationality| Norwegian | ?     | ?    | ?     | Brit  |
| Pet     | Cats    | Horses | Birds| Dogs  | Fish  |
| Beverage| Water   | Tea    | Coffee| Milk  | Beer  |
| Cigar   | Dunhill | Blend  | Pall Mall| Prince| Bluemaster|


This setup looks mostly correct, but let's finalize the nationalities based on the clues:


- The Norwegian lives in house 1 (Yellow).
- The Dane drinks Tea, which we placed in the Blue house.
- The Brit lives in a Red house (house 5).
- The Swede keeps Dogs (in the White house), and from clue 4, this must be house 4 since Green is to the left of White.


So, the final arrangement considering all clues should look like this:


#############
