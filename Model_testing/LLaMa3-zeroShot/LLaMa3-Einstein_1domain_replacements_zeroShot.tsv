From statement 13, we know the German is the Prince smoker. Since the German is already assigned, the Prince smoker must be the German.

| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Hobby	| Cigar	|

| blue	| Norwegian	| horse	| drawing	| Bluemaster	|
| green	| Danish	|?	| gardening	|?	|

From statement 14, we know the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is already assigned, the person who likes blue must be the Norwegian.

| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Hobby	| Cigar	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| blue	| Norwegian	| horse	| drawing	| Bluemaster	|
| green	| Danish	|?	| gardening	|?	|
| red	| British	| cat	|?	| Blend	|
| white	|?	|?	| card-games	|?	|
| yellow	| Swedish	|?	|?	| Dunhill	|

From statement 15, we know the Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is not yet assigned, the Blend smoker must be the British.

| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Hobby	| Cigar	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| blue	| Norwegian	| horse	| drawing	| Bluemaster	|
| green	| Danish	|?	| gardening	|?	|
| red	| British	| cat	| fishing	| Blend	|
| white	|?	|?	| card-games	|?	|
| yellow	| Swedish	|?	|?	| Dunhill	|

Now, let's assign the remaining pets:

* The bird is owned by the German (Pall-Mall smoker).
* The fish is owned by the Danish (green).
* The dog is owned by the Swedish (yellow).
* The cat is owned by the British (red).

Here is the final solution:

#############
| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Hobby	| Cigar	|
| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	| ---	|
| blue	| Norwegian	| horse	| drawing	| Bluemaster	|
| green	| Danish	| fish	| gardening	|?	|
| red	| British	| cat	| fishing	| Blend	|
| white	| German	| bird	| card-games	| Prince	|
| yellow	| Swedish	| dog	|?	| Dunhill	|
#############

Note that the? in the green row indicates that the cigar is not yet assigned. However, since the German is already assigned to the Prince smoker, the German cannot be the Pall-Mall smoker. Therefore, the Pall-Mall smoker must be the Norwegian, and the Norwegian's cigar is the Pall-Mall. This completes the solution."
