From statement 2, we know the Australian is not to the left of the person watching adventure movies. This means the Australian must be watching adventure movies.

From statement 5, we know the person watching family movies is either the Egyptian or the bartender, but not both. Since the Australian is watching adventure movies, the bartender must be watching family movies.

From statement 6, we know the designer is not to the left of the Egyptian. This means the designer must be to the right of the Egyptian.

From statement 9, we know the designer is between the person driving the taxi (German) and the Australian. This means the designer must be to the right of the German and to the left of the Australian.

From statement 10, we know the designer is not to the right of the Egyptian. This means the Egyptian must be to the left of the designer.

Now we can fill in the table:

8. The Italian is on the left or right of the Argentine.
9. The person watching romance movies is the Argentine.
10. The person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the dog.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the ferret is on the far left. From statement 7, we know the fan of house is on the far left, so the owner of the ferret must be the fan of house.

From statement 9, we know the Argentine is the person watching romance movies. From statement 5, we know the Argentine is not the owner of the ferret, so the owner of the ferret must be someone else.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the dog is not to the right of the Italian. From statement 4, we know the owner of the dog is on the left of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is not to the right of the Italian (statement 3), the Italian must be to the right of the fan of salsa. Therefore, the owner of the dog must be to the left of the Italian.

From statement 10, we know the person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is to the left of the Italian, the person watching family movies must be to the right of the Italian.

Lv1-4x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 8, we know the owner of the ferret is the fan pop.

From statement 1, we know the fan pop and the person who's hobby is card-games have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the ferret is the fan pop, the person who's hobby is card-games must be on the same parity position as the ferret.

From statement 9, we know the italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the malaysian. This means the italian cannot be the fan metal (since the fan metal is either the owner of the goat or the malaysian, and the malaysian is already between the italian and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing).

From statement 3, we know the owner of the goat is the fan metal or the fan metal is the malaysian, but not both. Since the italian cannot be the fan metal, the malaysian must be the fan metal.

From statement 4, we know the fan pop is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the ferret is the fan pop, the owner of the pony must be on the opposite side of the fan pop.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the owner of the pony is not the fan pop, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be on the same side as the fan pop.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the goat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the owner of the goat is the fan metal, the person who's hobby is drawing must be on the left side of the fan metal.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the goat is not the person who's hobby is drawing. This means the person who's hobby is drawing must be the malaysian (since the malaysian is already the fan metal).

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is card-games and the owner of the ferret have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is already on the same parity position as the ferret, the owner of the ferret must be on the same parity position as the person who's hobby is card-games.

Now we can fill in the table:

From statement 6, we know S is not the photographer. This means the photographer is someone else.

| Nationality   |  Egyptian  |          |          |

Since the Egyptian is either the person drinking lemonade or the person watching documentary movies, but not both, and the person drinking lemonade is either in an odd or even position, the Egyptian must be the person watching documentary movies.

|               |      1      |    2     |     3     |

1. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
2. The person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
From these two statements, we can conclude that the person who's sport is basketball is in the middle.

This statement doesn't give us much information, but it's useful to know.

7. The person drinking cola is the person eating radish or the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is video-games, but not both.
