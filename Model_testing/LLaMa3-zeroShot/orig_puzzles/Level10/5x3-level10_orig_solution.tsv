Lv1-5x3-1	"Let's start by analyzing the given information and making some deductions.

From statement 7, we know the person driving the airplane is the Chinese.

From statement 11, we know the person drinking soy-milk is either the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person driving the airplane (who is the Chinese). Since the Chinese is already driving the airplane, the person drinking soy-milk must be the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

From statement 12, we know the person drinking soy-milk is in an even position. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's hobby is filmmaking, and filmmaking is not a job, the person drinking soy-milk must be in an even position.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is in an even position, the person drinking tea must be in an odd position.

From statement 13, we know the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person drinking tea is in an odd position, the person driving the motorbike must be in an even position.

From statement 2, we know the architect is on the left of the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in an even position, the architect must be in an odd position.

From statement 5, we know the architect and the person driving the airplane have the same parity positions. Since the architect is in an odd position, the person driving the airplane (who is the Chinese) must also be in an odd position.

From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is either the Chinese or the fisherman, but not both. Since the Chinese is already driving the airplane, the person who's hobby is video-games must be the fisherman.

From statement 1, we know the police-officer is not to the right of the police-officer. This statement is redundant, but it doesn't provide any new information.

From statement 4, we know the French is on the left or right of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is already driving the airplane, the French must be in an even position.

From statement 6, we know the police-officer is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is in an even position, the police-officer must be in an odd position.

From statement 8, we know the fisherman is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the fisherman is the person who's hobby is video-games, and video-games is not card-games, the fisherman must be to the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-5x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.

This means that the owner of the hedgehog is either the first or second person from the left.

| Movie-Genre   |         |          |            |

| Transport     |         |          |            |

From 5, the person watching crime movies is the first person from the left. From 4, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching sports movies, so the person watching sports movies is the third person from the left.

From 9, the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the airplane. From 11, the person driving the airplane is the fan blues, so the person driving the trike is the first person from the left.

From 6, the fan d&b is not to the right of the person driving the van. Since the person driving the van is not mentioned yet, let's assume the person driving the van is the second person from the left.

From 7, the person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the person who's sport is golf is either the second or third person from the left, and the person who's sport is rugby is not mentioned yet, let's assume the person who's sport is golf is the second person from the left.

From 8, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan d&b or the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person watching crime movies, but not both. Since the person watching crime movies is the first person from the left, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan d&b.
