| Sport         |  ice-hockey|  rowing   |  skateboarding|  climbing  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 2 and 1, we know the fan of electronic music is on the left of the person drinking cola, and the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person drinking cola. This means the fan of electronic music is in position 2, and the person who's hobby is camping is in position 4.
2. From clue 6, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is the brazilian. From clue 26, we know the malaysian is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the malaysian is in position 1.
3. From clue 7, we know the accountant is on the far right. From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person drinking cola, so the accountant is in position 4.
4. From clue 14, we know the paramedic is on the left or right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is not in position 1 (because the malaysian is), the paramedic is in position 2.
5. From clue 9, we know the writer is not to the left of the fan folk. From clue 15, we know the fan folk is not the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the fan folk is not in position 1 (because the malaysian is), the fan folk is in position 3.
6. From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. From clue 17, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 2, and the person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 3.
7. From clue 11, we know the person eating apple is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. From clue 25, we know the person eating cherry is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. This means the person eating apple is in position 3, and the person eating cherry is in position 4.
8. From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cherry have different parity positions. This means the person eating cherry is in an even position, so the person eating cherry is in position 4.
9. From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the person eating apple. From clue 24, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the right of the person eating lime. This means the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 2, and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 3.
10. From clue 16, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not to the right of the person eating lime. This means the person eating lime is in position 1.
11. From clue 20, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person who's hobby is traveling have the same parity positions. This means the person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position, so the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 1.
12. From clue 22, we know the person drinking water is the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the person eating apple is the person drinking water, but not both. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 2, the person drinking water is in position 2.
13. From clue 23, we know the paramedic is not to the right of the fan electronic. This means the paramedic is in position 2.
14. From clue 27, we know the fan electronic is somewhere to the right of the writer. This means the fan electronic is in position 3.
15. From clue 29, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person eating cherry. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 2.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."
