From statement 36, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person drinking iced-tea or the chef is the person who's sport is ice-hockey, but not both. Since the person drinking iced-tea is already assigned, the chef must be the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

From statement 30, we know the person drinking water is not to the left of the person driving the boat.

From statement 27, we know the person driving the bus is the owner of the fish or the person driving the bus is the fan jazz, but not both.

| Transport     |  van      |  bike    |  boat     |  airplane |  skateboard|  ship     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the given information to create a rough outline of the table. I focused on the food, hobby, and movie-genre columns first, as they seemed to have the most constraints.
2. I used the constraints to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options. For example, from constraint 1, I knew that the person eating eggplant was to the left of the person watching romance movies, so I could eliminate some possibilities for the eggplant and romance movie columns.
3. I continued to use the constraints to fill in the table, working from left to right and top to bottom. I paid attention to the parity positions (even or odd) of the people and pets, as well as the relationships between them.
4. I used the constraints to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options, until I had a complete solution.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the one I provided is one possible solution."

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1, 2, and 7, we can deduce that the fan gospel is not the person drinking 7up, and the person drinking juice and the fan gospel have the same parity positions. This means the fan gospel is either the 2nd or 4th person.
2. From clues 3, 4, and 18, we can deduce that the malaysian is not to the left of the fan blues, the fan blues is not to the right of the fan hip-hop, and the person driving the bus is not to the left of the fan blues. This means the malaysian is either the 1st or 6th person.

| Watermelon   | Photographer | Trance        | Indonesian    | Ice-Hockey    | Scooter      |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1, 2, and 6, we can determine that the person eating apricot is on the left of the person driving the skateboard, and the person eating banana is on the right of the photographer. Since the person driving the skateboard is the Japanese (from clue 37), the person eating apricot must be on the left of the Japanese.
2. From clues 3, 4, and 9, we can determine that the fan trance is on the left or right of the project-manager, and the person eating pepper is not the fan trance. Since the project-manager is on the left or right of the indonesian (from clue 9), the fan trance must be the photographer.
3. From clues 5, 10, and 12, we can determine that the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the security-guard, and the fan electronic is somewhere to the left of the person eating apricot. Since the person driving the snowmobile is not to the right of the security-guard (from clue 5), the fan electronic must be the person eating apricot.
4. From clues 11, 14, and 16, we can determine that the fan country is not the person eating apricot, and the person eating peach is not to the right of the fan rock. Since the fan country is not the person eating apricot, and the fan rock is not the person eating peach, the fan country must be the project-manager.
5. From clues 15, 17, 20, and 22, we can determine that the pilot is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, and the musician and the person eating watermelon have different parity positions. Since the pilot is not to the right of the spanish (from clue 26), the pilot must be on the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
6. From clues 18, 21, 24, 25, 27, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 45, 47, 48, 50, 52, 53, 55, 56, 57, and 58, we can fill in the remaining positions using a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination.

Note that this solution assumes that the parity positions refer to the positions of the people in the table, with even positions being on the left and odd positions being on the right. If the parity positions refer to something else, the solution may be different."
