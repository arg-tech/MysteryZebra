Lv1-3x6-1	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've found the solution. Here it is:

#############
|            |       1       |     2     |   3    |     4      |    5     |    6     |
| Beverage   |  Water  |  Coffee  |  Tea    |  Cola    |  Fanta  |  Juice  |
| Pet        |  Bird   |  Cat    |  Dog    |  Rat    |  Snake  |  Goldfish |
| Sport      |  Rowing |  Badminton |  Rugby  |  Basketball |  Lacrosse |  Weightlifting |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 10, we know the person drinking coffee is either the owner of the goldfish or the person who's sport is badminton, but not both. Since the owner of the goldfish is already taken by statement 16, the person drinking coffee must be the person who's sport is badminton.
2. From statement 11, we know the person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the dog is already taken by statement 9, the person drinking tea must be the owner of the dog.
3. From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is the owner of the snake or the owner of the snake is the person drinking fanta, but not both. Since the owner of the snake is already taken by statement 17, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be the owner of the snake.
4. From statement 15, we know the person drinking coffee is between the owner of the rat and the person drinking tea. Since the owner of the rat is not the person drinking fanta (statement 20), the owner of the rat must be the person drinking juice.
5. From statement 19, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball. Since rowing is already taken by statement 19, basketball must be the sport of the person in position 5.
6. From statement 21, we know the owner of the bird is somewhere between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is already taken by statement 9, the owner of the bird must be in position 1.
7. From statement 13, we know the person drinking cola is not to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is already taken by statement 8, cola must be the beverage of the person in position 6.
8. From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is already taken by statement 12, weightlifting must be the sport of the person in position 6.
9. From statement 16, we know the person drinking water is the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is already taken by statement 16, water must be the beverage of the person in position 1.
10. From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is already taken by statement 16, lacrosse must be the sport of the person in position 3.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."

| Indie | Cat | Cycling |
| Punk | Rat | Cricket |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 9, we know the fan of disco is on the far left. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the fan of disco is on the far left, the person who's sport is sailing must be on the left of the fan of disco.
2. From statement 2, we know the owner of the dog is the person who's sport is water-polo. From statement 26, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the owner of the rat. Therefore, the owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the rat.
3. From statement 3, we know the fan of techno is the person who's sport is lacrosse or the fan of techno is the owner of the chinchilla, but not both. Since the fan of techno is in an odd position (statement 11), it cannot be the owner of the chinchilla. Therefore, the fan of techno is the person who's sport is lacrosse.

8. From statement 24, we know the fan of punk is the owner of the rat or the fan of punk is the person who's sport is cycling, but not both. Since the fan of punk is not the person who's sport is skiing (statement 18), it must be the owner of the rat.
9. From statement 27, we know the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the fan of techno. From statement 3, we know the fan of techno is the person who's sport is lacrosse. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be on the right of the fan of techno.
10. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is cycling and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the rabbit is in an even position, the person who's sport is cycling must also be in an even position.
11. From statement 22, we know the owner of the hamster is not the fan of soul. From statement 4, we know the fan of soul is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Therefore, the fan of soul must be on the right of the owner of the hamster.

7. From statement 1, we know the person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. From statement 19, we know the person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person driving the trike. Combining these, we can deduce that the person eating pineapple is driving the ship, which is to the left of the person driving the trike.
8. From statement 20, we know the owner of the snake is to the left of the owner of the rat. From statement 10, we know the person eating pineapple is either the person driving the ship or the owner of the rat.
