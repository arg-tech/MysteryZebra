| Music-Genre   | Ambient      | Dubstep     | R&B        | Hip-hop      | Blues      |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 12, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching animation movies. From statement 2, we know the person watching spy movies and the fan hip-hop have different parity positions. Since the person watching spy movies is the videographer (statement 23), the fan hip-hop must be on the left of the videographer.
2. From statement 13, we know the fan dubstep is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or the fan dubstep is the person watching animation movies, but not both. Since the person watching animation movies is already taken, the fan dubstep must be the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
3. From statement 6, we know the coach is somewhere between the fan r&b and the fan blues. Since the fan r&b is on the far left or far right (statement 11), the coach must be in the middle.
4. From statement 8, we know the coach is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Since the coach is in the middle, the person watching horror movies must be on the right of the coach.
5. From statement 14, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching disaster movies is in an even position (statement 22), the person who's hobby is card-games must be on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
6. From statement 15, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the fan dubstep is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, the person who's hobby is cooking must be on the right of the fan dubstep.
7. From statement 19, we know the musician is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the fan dubstep, the musician must be on the left of the fan dubstep.
8. From statement 20, we know the fan hip-hop is on the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is the videographer, the fan hip-hop must be on the left of the videographer.
9. From statement 21, we know the nurse is not the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is already taken, the nurse must be the person watching disaster movies.
10. From statement 24, we know the fan blues and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have different parity positions. Since the fan dubstep is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, the fan blues must be on the opposite side of the fan dubstep.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the fan of electronic music and the person driving the subway have the same parity positions. Since the subway is in position 5, the fan of electronic music must be in position 5 as well.
2. From statement 2, we know the person driving the roller is on the right of the fan of trance music. Since the roller is in an even position (statement 3), it must be in position 4. This means the fan of trance music is in position 3.
3. From statement 4, we know the fan of soul music and the German have the same parity positions. Since the German is not in position 5 (due to statement 1), the fan of soul music must be in an odd position. The only odd position available is position 1, so the fan of soul music is in position 1.
4. From statement 5, we know the person driving the roller is either the police-officer or the Japanese, but not both. Since the roller is in position 4, the police-officer must be in position 4.
5. From statement 6, we know the German is not to the left of the chef. Since the German is not in position 5, it must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 2 already placed the fan of trance music in position 3, so the German must be in position 2.
6. From statement 7, we know the Turkish is on the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard is in position 1, the Turkish must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 6 already placed the German in position 2, so the Turkish must be in position 3.
7. From statement 8, we know the fan of soul music is on the left of the doctor. Since the fan of soul music is in position 1, the doctor must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 6 already placed the German in position 2, so the doctor must be in position 3.
8. From statement 9, we know the chef is not the person driving the bike. Since the bike is in position 2, the chef must be in position 1 or 3. However, statement 1 already placed the fan of electronic music in position 5, so the chef must be in position 1.
9. From statement 10, we know the fan of electronic music is not to the right of the fan of soul music. Since the fan of electronic music is in position 5, it must be to the left of the fan of soul music.
10. From statement 11, we know the fan of electronic music is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the fan of electronic music is already in position 5, it must be to the left of the roller.
11. From statement 12, we know the fan of trance music is somewhere to the right of the German. Since the German is in position 2, the fan of trance music must be in position 3 or 4. However, statement 2 already placed the fan of trance music in position 3, so it's correct.
12. From statement 13, we know the fan of soul music is not the freelancer. Since the fan of soul music is in position 1, the freelancer must be in position 2, 3, or 4. However, statement 6 already placed the German in position 2, so the freelancer must be in position 3 or 4.
13. From statement 14, we know the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the German. Since the German is in position 2, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3 or 4. However, statement 2 already placed the fan of trance music in position 3, so the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 4.
14. From statement 15, we know the person driving the bike is on the left of the German. Since the bike is in position 2, the German must be in position 3 or 4. However, statement 6 already placed the German in position 2, so the bike must be in position 1.
15. From statement 16, we know the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person driving the subway. Since the roller is in position 4, the person driving the subway must be in position 3 or 5. However, statement 1 already placed the fan of electronic music in position 5, so the person driving the subway must be in position 3.
16. From statement 17, we know the fan of pop music is not to the right of the journalist. Since the journalist is not in position 5 (due to statement 1), the fan of pop music must be in position 1 or 2. However, statement 9 already placed the chef in position 1, so the fan of pop music must be in position 2.
17. From statement 18, we know the fan of electronic music is not to the right of the person driving the bike. Since the fan of electronic music is in position 5, it must be to the left of the person driving the bike.
18. From statement 19, we know the fan of house music is on the left of the person driving the subway. Since the fan of house music is not in position 1 (due to statement 17), it must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 16 already placed the person driving the subway in position 3, so the fan of house music must be in position 2.
19. From statement 20, we know the journalist is not to the right of the Mexican. Since the Mexican is not in position 5 (due to statement 1), the journalist must be in position 1 or 2. However, statement 17 already placed the fan of pop music in position 2, so the journalist must be in position 1.
20. From statement 21, we know the Australian is not to the left of the chef. Since the chef is in position 1, the Australian must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 6 already placed the German in position 2, so the Australian must be in position 3.
21. From statement 22, we know the Japanese is not to the right of the Australian. Since the Australian is in position 3, the Japanese must be in position 1 or 2. However, statement 20 already placed the journalist in position 1, so the Japanese must be in position 2.

| Transport     |  Bus       |  Boat     |  Motorbike|  Tram      |  Snowmobile|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 10, we know the person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating garlic. From clue 25, we know the British and the person eating garlic have the same parity positions. Therefore, the British must be eating garlic.
* From clue 12, we know the Canadian is the person eating avocado or the person eating avocado is the owner of the chinchilla, but not both. Since the British is eating garlic, the Canadian must be eating avocado.
* From clue 19, we know the British is the owner of the ferret. From clue 3, we know the owner of the ferret is not the Canadian. Therefore, the Canadian cannot be the owner of the ferret.
* From clue 20, we know the person driving the bus is the person eating potato. From clue 1, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the bus driver is eating potato, the owner of the frog must be eating nectarine.
* From clue 14, we know the owner of the frog is on the left of the Italian. From clue 24, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be on the right of the Italian.
* From clue 22, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the person eating garlic. Since the British is eating garlic, the owner of the hedgehog must be on the right of the British.
* From clue 23, we know the person eating avocado and the person driving the boat have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is eating avocado, the person driving the boat must be the Canadian.
* From clue 16, we know the Canadian is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram. From clue 2, we know the person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the tram. Therefore, the Canadian must be driving the tram.
* From clue 15, we know the person eating nectarine is not to the left of the Pakistani. From clue 1, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Therefore, the owner of the frog must be eating nectarine and the Pakistani must be eating radish.
* From clue 18, we know the Italian is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. From clue 21, we know the Italian is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Therefore, the Italian must be driving the motorbike.
* From clue 7, we know the person driving the tram is not to the right of the Italian. From clue 16, we know the Canadian is driving the tram. Therefore, the Canadian must be driving the tram and the Italian must be driving the motorbike.
* From clue 8, we know the Chinese is not to the left of the British. From clue 9, we know the owner of the frog is not to the left of the British. Therefore, the Chinese must be eating garlic.
* From clue 11, we know the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position. From clue 24, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the Italian. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 4.
* From clue 5, we know the Canadian is the person driving the motorbike or the owner of the frog is the Canadian, but not both. Since the Canadian is driving the tram, the owner of the frog must be the Canadian. However, this is a contradiction, so we can conclude that the Canadian is not the owner of the frog.
