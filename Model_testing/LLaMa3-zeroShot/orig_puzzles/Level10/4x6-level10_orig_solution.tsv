| potato       | jazz          | indian      | van          |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 3, we know the person eating papaya is on the far left. From statement 20, we know the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the canadian. Since the canadian is not on the far left, the person eating papaya must be on the far right.

Since the person eating papaya is on the far right, the person eating garlic cannot be the person driving the tram. Therefore, the person eating garlic must be a fan of electronic.
3. From statement 12, we know the person eating apple and the fan electronic have the same parity positions. Since the person eating garlic is a fan of electronic, the person eating apple must be on the same side as the person eating garlic.

5. From statement 25, we know the fan jazz is in an even position. Since the person eating potato is on the far right, the fan jazz must be on the second position from the left.
6. From statement 26, we know the fan hip-hop is the person driving the bus or the fan hip-hop is the canadian, but not both. Since the person eating apple is on the same side as the person eating garlic, the fan hip-hop cannot be the person eating apple. Therefore, the fan hip-hop must be the person driving the bus.
7. From statement 27, we know the fan soul and the nigerian have the same parity positions. Since the person eating papaya is on the far right, the fan soul must be on the same side as the person eating papaya.
8. From statement 30, we know the fan soul is between the person driving the van and the indian. Since the person eating papaya is on the far right, the fan soul must be on the far left.
9. From statement 31, we know the canadian is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since the person eating garlic is a fan of electronic, the canadian must be on the left of the person eating apple.
10. From statement 32, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the fan gospel. Since the fan gospel is not on the far left, the person driving the scooter must be on the far left.
11. From statement 33, we know the person eating garlic is somewhere to the left of the indian. Since the person eating garlic is a fan of electronic, the person eating garlic must be on the left of the person eating apple.

By combining these statements, we can fill in the rest of the table."
