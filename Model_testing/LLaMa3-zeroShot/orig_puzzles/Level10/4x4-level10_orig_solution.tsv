Lv1-4x4-1	"Let's start by analyzing the given clues and trying to figure out the relationships between the people and their preferences.

From clue 12, we know that the engineer is the person watching satire movies.

From clue 15, we know that the security-guard is the person watching scientific movies.

From clue 13, we know that the person driving the roller and the security-guard have the same parity positions, and from clue 14, we know that the security-guard is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. This means that the person driving the roller is the designer.

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the roller is the designer or the person watching zombie movies is the person driving the roller, but not both. Since we've already established that the person driving the roller is the designer, this means that the person watching zombie movies is not the designer.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of classical music and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions. Since the designer is the person driving the roller, and the person driving the roller is not the person watching zombie movies, the designer must be the fan of classical music.

From clue 2, we know that the engineer and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since the engineer is the person watching satire movies, and the designer is the fan of classical music, the person driving the tram must be the nurse.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of blues music is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is not the designer (who is the fan of classical music), the fan of blues music must be the security-guard.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of disco music is not to the right of the fan of blues music. Since the fan of blues music is the security-guard, the fan of disco music must be the nurse.

From clue 8, we know that the fan of disco music is not to the right of the nurse. This means that the fan of disco music is the nurse.

From clue 10, we know that the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the fan of disco music. Since the person watching scientific movies is the security-guard, and the fan of disco music is the nurse, the security-guard must be on the left of the nurse.

From clue 9, we know that the person driving the roller is the designer or the person watching zombie movies is the person driving the roller, but not both. Since we've already established that the person driving the roller is the designer, this means that the person watching zombie movies is not the designer.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is not the designer, and the person watching zombie movies is not the designer, the person watching martial-arts movies must be the engineer.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is not the person driving the tram. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is the engineer, and the person driving the tram is the nurse, the engineer must be on the left of the nurse.

Here is the final solution table with the people and their preferences:

| Job           | journalist | doctor        | project-manager | chef     |
| Movie-Genre   | animation | mystery       | disaster   | satire   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 14, we know the person drinking 7up is either the person watching animation movies or the journalist. Since the journalist can't be watching animation movies (from statement 1), the person drinking 7up must be the person watching animation movies.
2. From statement 2, we know the person drinking milk is to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the person drinking 7up is watching animation movies, the person drinking milk must be in position 1.
3. From statement 16, we know the person drinking milk is in an even position. Since the person drinking milk is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in an odd position (from statement 3).
4. From statement 5, we know the project-manager is to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is not in position 1 (from statement 2), the doctor must be in position 3.
5. From statement 12, we know the person eating carrot is between the chef and the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 3, the person eating carrot must be in position 2.
6. From statement 13, we know the person watching mystery movies is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person watching satire movies. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not in position 1 (from statement 2), the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 4.
7. From statement 18, we know the person eating strawberry is on the far right. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 4, the person eating strawberry must be in position 4.
8. From statement 10, we know the person eating blueberry is not the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person eating blueberry is not in position 4 (from statement 18), the person eating blueberry must be in position 3.
9. From statement 7, we know the person watching mystery movies is either the person eating spinach or the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is watching animation movies (from statement 14), the person watching mystery movies must be the person eating spinach.
10. From statement 11, we know the person watching disaster movies and the person drinking 7up have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is watching animation movies, the person watching disaster movies must be in an odd position.
11. From statement 15, we know the person drinking 7up and the person eating blueberry have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in an odd position (from statement 11), the person eating blueberry must be in an odd position.
12. From statement 9, we know the person watching satire movies is to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1, the person watching satire movies must be in position 4.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."

Lv1-4x4-5	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've found the solution. Here it is:

#############
|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |     4      |
| Beverage      |  Coffee  |  Juice   |  Milk     |  Sprite   |
| Movie-Genre   |  Fantasy |  Zombie  |  Scientific|  Mystery  |
| Nationality   |  Italian |  Mexican |  American |  Polish   |
| Sport         |  Climbing|  Ice-Hockey|  Biathlon |  Soccer   |
#############

Here's the breakdown of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person watching scientific movies is to the right of the person drinking coffee. From statement 10, we know the person drinking coffee is not watching fantasy movies. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies is not watching fantasy movies either.
2. From statement 2, we know the person drinking juice is between the person watching zombie movies and the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person drinking milk (statement 7), the person drinking juice must be to the right of the person drinking milk.
3. From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is either the person drinking sprite or the person watching scientific movies, but not both. Since the person drinking sprite is already occupied by the person who's sport is biathlon (from statement 3), the person watching scientific movies must be the one who's sport is biathlon.
4. From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is climbing and the person watching scientific movies have different parity positions. Since the person watching scientific movies is the one who's sport is biathlon, the person who's sport is climbing must be on the opposite side of the person drinking coffee.
5. From statement 5, we know the American is not to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is the one who's sport is biathlon, the American must be to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.
6. From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the American. Since the American is to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
7. From statement 8, we know the person drinking juice is on the left of the Mexican. Since the person drinking juice is to the right of the person drinking milk, the Mexican must be to the right of the person drinking milk.
8. From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person drinking coffee (statement 12), the person who's sport is climbing must be to the right of the person drinking coffee.
9. From statement 15, we know the Italian and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions. Since the Italian is already placed, the person watching zombie movies must be on the same side of the Italian.

By combining these statements, we can deduce the final solution table."
Lv1-4x4-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 6, we know the fan pop is on the far left. From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is either the fan pop or the owner of the goat. Since the fan pop is on the far left, the owner of the goat cannot be the fan pop. Therefore, the person who's hobby is video-games is the fan pop.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the goat is in an even position. Since the fan pop is on the far left, the owner of the goat must be in the second position.

From statement 8, we know the owner of the goat is either the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the fan country. Since the owner of the goat is in the second position, and the fan country is somewhere between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (statement 7), the owner of the goat must be the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

From statement 9, we know the person eating lemon and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the goat is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person eating lemon must be in an odd position.

From statement 2, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is the person eating lemon. Therefore, the person who's hobby is traveling is in an odd position.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the left of the fan country. Since the fan country is somewhere between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (statement 7), the fan country must be in the third position.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel. Since the fan gospel is not mentioned anywhere else, it must be in the fourth position.

From statement 13, we know the owner of the rat is not to the left of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating cucumber is not mentioned anywhere else, it must be in the second position.

From statement 11, we know the person eating cucumber and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions. Since the person eating cucumber is in the second position, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in an even position.

From statement 12, we know the person eating asparagus is on the far right. Since the person eating asparagus is not mentioned anywhere else, it must be in the fourth position.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the pony is on the far right. Since the owner of the pony is not mentioned anywhere else, it must be in the fourth position.

Now we can fill in the table:

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is photography. This means that photography cannot be the first hobby.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower. This means that cauliflower cannot be the first food.

From statement 9, we know that the person eating potato is the person driving the subway or the person driving the subway is the person who's hobby is puzzles, but not both. This means that potato cannot be the first food.

From statement 10, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere between the person eating potato and the person watching thriller movies. This means that potato cannot be the last food.

From statement 11, we know that the person eating avocado and the person watching spy movies have the same parity positions. This means that either both are odd or both are even.

From statement 12, we know that the person driving the subway is the person watching thriller movies. This means that potato is the last food.
