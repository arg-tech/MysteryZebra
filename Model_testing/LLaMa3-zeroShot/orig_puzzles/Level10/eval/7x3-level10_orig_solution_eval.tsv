#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 4, we know the fan of dubstep is driving the helicopter. From statement 9, we know the fan of R&B is the architect. Since the architect is not driving the helicopter (from statement 4), the fan of R&B is not the fan of dubstep. Therefore, the fan of R&B is the architect, and the fan of dubstep is someone else.
2. From statement 1, we know the Canadian and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions. Since the fan of R&B is the architect, the Canadian must be the architect as well (from statement 9). This means the Canadian is the fan of R&B.
3. From statement 2, we know the person eating avocado and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. Since the Canadian is the fan of R&B, they cannot be the person eating avocado (from statement 1). Therefore, the person eating avocado is someone else.
4. From statement 13, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left or right of the person eating avocado. Since the person eating avocado is not the Canadian, the person driving the quad-bike must be the Canadian (from statement 1).
5. From statement 6, we know the fan of punk is somewhere between the journalist and the person eating pumpkin. Since the fan of punk is not the Canadian (from statement 1), the fan of punk must be the journalist.
6. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not the Canadian (from statement 16), the person drinking iced-tea must be someone else.
7. From statement 7, we know the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person driving the scooter is not the Canadian (from statement 1), the person driving the scooter must be someone else.
8. From statement 8, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person eating avocado. Since the person driving the scooter is not the Canadian, the person driving the scooter must be someone else.
9. From statement 12, we know the Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the Colombian is not the Canadian, the Colombian must be someone else.
10. From statement 15, we know the person driving the quad-bike and the person drinking fanta have different parity positions. Since the person driving the quad-bike is the Canadian, the person drinking fanta must be someone else.
11. From statement 16, we know the person drinking iced-tea is the Canadian or the Canadian is the person driving the helicopter, but not both. Since the Canadian is the fan of R&B, they cannot be the person driving the helicopter (from statement 4). Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is the Canadian.
12. From statement 17, we know the Canadian is not to the right of the person eating avocado. Since the Canadian is the fan of R&B, they cannot be the person eating avocado (from statement 1). Therefore, the person eating avocado is someone else.

Lv1-7x3-3	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the Japanese. This means that the Japanese must be on the left side of the table.

From clue 4, we know that the Canadian is not to the right of the Japanese. This means that the Canadian must be on the left side of the table, possibly next to the Japanese.

From clue 9, we know that the person eating blueberry is on the left of the Nigerian. This means that the Nigerian must be on the right side of the table.

From clue 11, we know that the person eating kale is either the person driving the trike or the Canadian, but not both. This means that the Canadian cannot be eating kale, so the Canadian must be eating blueberry.

From clue 5, we know that the engineer is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the Nigerian. This means that the engineer must be on the right side of the table, possibly next to the Nigerian.

From clue 2, we know that the doctor is somewhere to the right of the bartender. This means that the doctor must be on the right side of the table.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies. This means that the person watching horror movies must be on the left side of the table.

10. From statement 14, the fan of R&B is somewhere to the left of the fan of folk. Since the fan of R&B is in the second position, the fan of folk must be in the third position.
11. From statement 15, the person eating cauliflower is not the Canadian. Since the person eating pineapple is not the Canadian (statement 8), the person eating cauliflower must be the Canadian.
12. From statement 16, the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This statement is redundant, but it helps to confirm the previous positions.
13. From statement 17, the person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. This statement is also redundant, but it helps to confirm the previous positions.

| Transport     | Bike      | Ship       | Tram       |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the Nigerian is the analyst.
2. From statement 8, we know the Nigerian is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the designer. This means the designer is to the right of the Nigerian.
3. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the Mexican. This means the Mexican is to the left of the Nigerian.
4. From statement 6, we know the Dutch is the person who's hobby is board-games or the Dutch is the person eating grapefruit, but not both. Since the Dutch can't be eating grapefruit (statement 12), they must be the person who's hobby is board-games.
5. From statement 12, we know the person eating grapefruit is the person driving the bike. This means the Dutch is not driving the bike (since they're not eating grapefruit).
6. From statement 14, we know the owner of the goat and the person eating grapefruit have the same parity positions. Since the person eating grapefruit is driving the bike, the owner of the goat must also be driving the bike.
7. From statement 5, we know the owner of the bird and the person driving the bike have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the goat is driving the bike, the owner of the bird must also be driving the bike.
8. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is photography and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the bird is driving the bike, the person driving the tram must be the owner of the hedgehog.
9. From statement 13, we know the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the person eating banana. Since the person eating banana is not the owner of the hedgehog (statement 7), the person eating banana must be the owner of the bird.
10. From statement 15, we know the person watching epic movies is not to the left of the designer. This means the designer is watching epic movies.
11. From statement 16, we know the person watching epic movies and the chef have different parity positions. Since the designer is watching epic movies, the chef must be watching satire.
12. From statement 1, we know the person driving the tram is not to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person driving the tram is the owner of the hedgehog, the person watching comedy movies must be the owner of the bird.

The rest of the table can be filled in using the above information."	{'food': ['banana', 'cranberry', 'grapefruit'], 'hobby': ['video-games', 'photography', 'board-games'], 'job': ['designer', 'analyst', 'chef'], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', 'epic', 'satire'], 'nationality': ['dutch', 'nigerian', 'mexican'], 'pet': ['bird', 'hedgehog', 'goat'], 'transport': ['bike', 'ship', 'tram']}	True	12	False

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the Spanish person is on the left of the Pakistani person.
2. From clue 2, we know the fan of rock music is on the left or right of the person who plays lacrosse. Since the fan of rock music is not yet placed, we can't determine their exact position.

6. From clue 6, we know the fan of salsa music is not to the left of the Pakistani person.
7. From clue 7, we know the person who drives the roller is not to the left of the person who cooks. Since the person who cooks is not yet placed, we can't determine their exact position.
