| Pet    | Frog      | Turtle    | Hedgehog | Goat        | Lizard      | Chinchilla | Dog       |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From constraint 10, we know the firefighter is in the middle. From constraint 20, we know the firefighter is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so the firefighter must be in position 4.
2. From constraint 15, we know the person eating watermelon is not the owner of the frog. From constraint 31, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the owner of the frog, so the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 7.
3. From constraint 14, we know the dancer and the owner of the hedgehog have different parity positions. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 7, the dancer must be in an even position. From constraint 4, we know the person eating corn is in an odd position, so the dancer must be in position 2.
4. From constraint 13, we know the person eating carrot is the owner of the frog or the person eating carrot is the coach, but not both. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 7, the owner of the frog must be in position 1. From constraint 13, we know the person eating carrot is the owner of the frog, so the person eating carrot must be in position 1.
5. From constraint 22, we know the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the person eating corn and the architect. Since the architect is in position 7, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 6.
6. From constraint 12, we know the electrician is somewhere between the owner of the turtle and the lawyer. Since the lawyer is in position 7, the electrician must be in position 5.
7. From constraint 28, we know the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the right of the person eating nectarine. Since the person eating nectarine is in position 5, the person eating cranberry must be in position 6.
8. From constraint 26, we know the person eating onion is on the right of the person eating cranberry. Since the person eating cranberry is in position 6, the person eating onion must be in position 7.
9. From constraint 29, we know the project-manager is somewhere to the right of the person eating mango. Since the person eating mango is in position 3, the project-manager must be in position 5.
10. From constraint 18, we know the architect and the owner of the dog have the same parity positions. Since the architect is in position 7, the owner of the dog must be in position 7.
11. From constraint 23, we know the owner of the dog is not to the left of the architect. Since the architect is in position 7, the owner of the dog must be in position 7.
12. From constraint 24, we know the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the hedgehog is in position 7, the owner of the lizard must be in position 6.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 16, we know the dutch is the person eating pineapple. From statement 25, we know the indonesian and the person eating pineapple have different parity positions, so the indonesian cannot be eating pineapple. Therefore, the indonesian must be eating papaya.
2. From statement 33, we know the chinese is on the left of the person eating broccoli. From statement 23, we know the person eating broccoli is not to the right of the person driving the scooter, so the chinese must be eating broccoli.
3. From statement 14, we know the person eating apple and the person driving the skateboard have the same parity positions. From statement 18, we know the person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating tomato is not the chinese (statement 28), the person eating tomato must be the person eating papaya. Therefore, the person eating apple must be the person driving the skateboard.
4. From statement 20, we know the person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller. From statement 34, we know the person driving the van is between the person driving the roller and the thai. Therefore, the thai must be driving the roller.

6. From statement 15, we know the person eating apple is not to the left of the person driving the roller. From statement 4, we know the indonesian is not the person driving the scooter. Therefore, the indonesian must be eating papaya, and the person eating apple must be the person driving the skateboard.
7. From statement 22, we know the russian is somewhere to the left of the french. From statement 36, we know the indonesian and the person eating broccoli have different parity positions. Therefore, the indonesian must be eating papaya, and the person eating broccoli must be the french.
8. From statement 30, we know the french is on the left or right of the indonesian. From statement 25, we know the indonesian and the person eating pineapple have different parity positions. Therefore, the indonesian must be eating papaya, and the person eating pineapple must be the dutch.
9. From statement 31, we know the indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person eating tomato. From statement 18, we know the person eating tomato is somewhere to the right of the person eating lettuce. Therefore, the indonesian must be eating papaya, and the person eating lettuce must be the malaysian.
10. From statement 32, we know the person eating lettuce is not to the right of the person driving the van. From statement 20, we know the person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person driving the roller.

5. From clues 17 and 31, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog, and the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. This means the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 1 or 3.
