1. From clue 5, we know the person eating spinach is on the far left. From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is either the fan classical or the person watching drama movies, but not both. Since the person eating spinach is on the far left, the person who's hobby is drawing must be on the second position.
2. From clue 19, we know the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is on the second position, the person driving the car is also on the second position.
3. From clue 15, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. From clue 16, we know the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike. Combining these clues, we can conclude that the person drinking lemonade is on the first position, the person drinking tea is on the third position, and the person driving the trike is on the fourth position.
4. From clue 7, we know the person driving the train is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person driving the train is not on the first position (from clue 15), it must be on the second position. This means the person who's hobby is video-games is on the third position.
5. From clue 10, we know the fan classical is not to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is on the third position, the fan classical must be on the fourth position.
6. From clue 22, we know the fan reggae is not to the right of the fan dubstep. Since the fan reggae is not on the first or fourth position (from clue 20), it must be on the second position. This means the fan dubstep is on the third position.
7. From clue 23, we know the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.

From clue 12, we know the person watching western movies is between the person driving the trike and the person eating potato. Since the person driving the trike is on the fourth position, the person watching western movies must be on the third position. This means the person eating grapefruit is also on the third position.
8. From clue 14, we know the person drinking lemonade is not the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is on the second position, the person drinking lemonade is on the first position.
9. From clue 18, we know the fan dubstep is on the far left or far right. Since the fan dubstep is not on the first position (from clue 22), it must be on the fourth position. This means the fan reggae is on the second position.
10. From clue 21, we know the person driving the trike is not the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person driving the trike is on the fourth position, the person who's hobby is drawing is not on the fourth position. This means the person who's hobby is drawing is on the second position, which is already occupied by the person driving the car.
