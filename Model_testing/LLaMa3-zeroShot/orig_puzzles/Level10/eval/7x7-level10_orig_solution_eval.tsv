Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the given information to create a rough outline of the positions of the people and their preferences.
2. I then used the clues to fill in the remaining information, working from the top down and using the process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.
3. I paid close attention to the parity positions and used the clues to determine which people were in odd or even positions.
4. I also used the clues to determine which people were in the middle, and which people were on the far left or far right.
5. Finally, I used the remaining clues to fill in the final positions and preferences.
