Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The manager is in the middle:
This means the manager is either in position 2 or 2.

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey:
This means the guinea-pig owner cannot be the ice-hockey player.

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the dressmaker and the person who's sport is lacrosse:
This means the ice-hockey player is either in position 1 or 3.

4. The owner of the fish is not to the left of the manager:
This means the fish owner is either in position 2 or 3.

5. The dressmaker is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey:
This means the dressmaker is either in position 1 or 3.

6. The manager is the person who's sport is golf or the person who's sport is golf is the owner of the fish, but not both:
This means the manager is either the golf player or the fish owner, but not both.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The manager is in the middle (position 2).
* The guinea-pig owner is not the ice-hockey player, so the guinea-pig owner must be in position 1.
* The ice-hockey player is between the dressmaker and the lacrosse player, so the ice-hockey player is in position 3.
* The fish owner is not to the left of the manager, so the fish owner is in position 3.
* The dressmaker is not the ice-hockey player, so the dressmaker is in position 1.

Now, we can fill in the table:

Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the person driving the airplane is between the Malaysian and the Russian. This means the Russian is on the right side of the airplane driver.

From statement 3, we know the Russian is to the left of the Malaysian. This means the Malaysian is on the right side of the Russian.

From statement 2, we know the Malaysian is not driving the airplane and is not driving the motorbike. This means the Malaysian is eating garlic or is on the tram.

From statement 5, we know the Nigerian is on the left of the person eating garlic. This means the Nigerian is on the left of the Malaysian (since the Malaysian is eating garlic or is on the tram).

From statement 6, we know the Russian and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. This means the Russian and the motorbike driver are either both on the left or both on the right.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |     3     |

| Transport     |            |           |           |

From the above analysis, we can conclude:

* The Nigerian is on the left of the Malaysian (statement 5)
* The Malaysian is eating garlic or is on the tram (statement 2)
* The Russian is on the right of the Malaysian (statement 3)
* The person driving the airplane is between the Malaysian and the Russian (statement 1)
* The Russian and the motorbike driver have the same parity positions (statement 6)

Lv1-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the librarian is not the person watching animation movies, or the librarian is the person drinking juice. Let's assume the librarian is the person drinking juice. This means the librarian is not watching animation movies.

From statement 2, we know that the person watching comedy movies is to the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the librarian is not watching animation movies, the librarian cannot be watching comedy movies either. This means the person watching comedy movies is to the right of the person watching animation movies, and the librarian is not involved in this.

From statement 3, we know that the person watching spy movies is to the right of the nurse. This means the nurse cannot be watching spy movies, and the person watching spy movies is to the right of the nurse.

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the bartender. This means the bartender cannot be drinking soy-milk, and the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the bartender.

From statement 5, we know that the person watching animation movies is not the bartender. This means the bartender is not watching animation movies.

From statement 6, we know that the person watching spy movies is not the librarian. This means the librarian is not watching spy movies.

From statement 7, we know that the person watching animation movies and the bartender have different parity positions. This means the person watching animation movies is either to the left or to the right of the bartender.

From statement 1, we know the librarian is drinking juice. Let's assume the librarian is drinking juice and watching comedy movies. This means the person watching animation movies is to the right of the librarian.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the bartender. Since the librarian is drinking juice, the person drinking soy-milk must be the nurse.

From statement 3, we know the person watching spy movies is to the right of the nurse. This means the person watching spy movies is to the right of the nurse and to the right of the bartender.

From statement 5, we know the person watching animation movies is not the bartender. This means the person watching animation movies is either the librarian or the nurse.

From statement 7, we know the person watching animation movies and the bartender have different parity positions. This means the person watching animation movies is either to the left or to the right of the bartender.

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Argentine is not a fan of R&B.
2. The freelancer is on the left of the nurse.
3. The freelancer is either the Argentine or a fan of salsa, but not both.
4. The Argentine and the fan of R&B have different parity positions.
5. The Colombian and the nurse have different parity positions.
6. The fan of R&B is somewhere to the left of the teacher.
7. The fan of salsa is either the Argentine or the freelancer, but not both.
8. The freelancer and the fan of salsa have the same parity positions.

From statement 1, we know the Argentine is not a fan of R&B. Let's assume the Argentine is a fan of ambient (we'll come back to this later).

From statement 2, we know the freelancer is on the left of the nurse. This means the freelancer cannot be the teacher, as the teacher would be on the right of the nurse.

From statement 3, we know the freelancer is either the Argentine or a fan of salsa, but not both. Since we've already assumed the Argentine is a fan of ambient, the freelancer must be a fan of salsa.

From statement 4, we know the Argentine and the fan of R&B have different parity positions. Since the Argentine is a fan of ambient, the fan of R&B must be the Colombian (as the Colombian is the only one left).

From statement 5, we know the Colombian and the nurse have different parity positions. Since the Colombian is the fan of R&B, the nurse must be a fan of salsa.

From statement 6, we know the fan of R&B is somewhere to the left of the teacher. Since the Colombian is the fan of R&B, the Colombian must be on the left of the teacher.

From statement 7, we know the fan of salsa is either the Argentine or the freelancer, but not both. Since we've already established the freelancer is a fan of salsa, the fan of salsa must be the freelancer.

From statement 8, we know the freelancer and the fan of salsa have the same parity positions. Since the freelancer is a fan of salsa, the freelancer must be on an odd-numbered row.

Now, let's fill in the table:

4. The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position.
5. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

From clue 1, we know the Canadian is in an odd position, so they can't be in the 2nd or 4th position. From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is writing is in an even position, so they can't be in the 1st or 3rd position.

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is writing is either the Canadian or the person driving the tram, but not both. Since the Canadian is in an odd position, they can't be the person driving the tram. Therefore, the person driving the tram must be the person who's hobby is writing.

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the Nigerian. This means the Nigerian can't be in the 1st position, so they must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person driving the tram is the person who's hobby is writing, the person driving the trike must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 3, we know the Nigerian is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the Nigerian can't be in the 1st position, they must be in the 2nd position. This means the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 5, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person driving the tram is the person who's hobby is writing, the person driving the trike must be in the 3rd position.

Lv1-3x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The owner of the pony is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

From these two statements, we can conclude that the owner of the pony is not the person watching family movies. Let's call the person watching family movies ""F"".

3. The fan of funk is the person watching sports movies.

This statement tells us that the person watching sports movies is also the fan of funk. Let's call this person ""S"".

4. The person watching family movies is the fan of trance or the person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla, but not both.

This statement is a bit tricky, but it means that F is either the fan of trance or the owner of the chinchilla, but not both. Since we already know that F is the owner of the chinchilla, this statement is redundant.

5. The fan of funk is somewhere to the left of the person watching family movies.

This statement tells us that S (the fan of funk) is to the left of F (the person watching family movies).

6. The fan of d&b is not to the right of the owner of the pony.

This statement tells us that the fan of d&b is either to the left of the owner of the pony or is the owner of the pony itself.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Pet           |        |            |        |

From statement 1, we know that F is the owner of the chinchilla. From statement 2, we know that the owner of the pony is to the right of F. Let's place the pony owner on the right side of the table.

|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |

| Pet           | chinchilla | pony     |        |

From statement 3, we know that S is the fan of funk and the person watching sports movies. Since S is to the left of F, let's place S on the left side of the table.

|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |

| Music-Genre   | funk   |            |        |
| Pet           | chinchilla | pony     |        |

From statement 5, we know that S is to the left of F. Since S is already on the left side, we can't move F to the left of S. Therefore, F must be in the middle.

|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | sports | family |        |
| Music-Genre   | funk   |            |        |
| Pet           | chinchilla | pony     |        |

From statement 6, we know that the fan of d&b is not to the right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony owner is already on the right side, the fan of d&b must be on the left side.

|               |   1    |     2      |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   | sports | family |        |
| Music-Genre   | funk   | d&b    |        |
| Pet           | chinchilla | pony     |        |

Now, let's check if the solution satisfies all the statements:

1. The person watching family movies is the owner of the chinchilla. (True)
2. The owner of the pony is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. (True)
3. The fan of funk is the person watching sports movies. (True)

From statement 2, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is either the person who's sport is basketball or the person who's sport is basketball is the fan d&b, but not both. This means that P's sport is not basketball, and the fan d&b is not P.

From statement 3, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving and the fan funk have the same parity positions. This means that the person who's hobby is skydiving is either to the left or to the right of the fan funk.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means that P (who's hobby is puzzles) is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is not to the right of the fan d&b. This means that the fan d&b is either to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse or in the same position.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is between the fan funk and the fan d&b. This means that the person who's hobby is writing is to the left of the fan funk.

This means that the person watching drama movies is on the left of the fan of house.

2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

This means that the person watching disaster movies is either on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

3. The fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian.

This means that the Italian is either on the left of the fan of punk or is the fan of punk itself.

4. The Italian is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies.

This means that the Italian is either on the right of the person watching drama movies or is the person watching drama movies.

5. The Italian is somewhere between the Nigerian and the fan of blues.

This means that the Nigerian is on the left of the Italian, and the fan of blues is on the right of the Italian.

6. The Italian is the person watching drama movies or the Italian is the fan of house, but not both.

This means that the Italian is either the person watching drama movies or the fan of house, but not both.

Now, let's combine the clues and create a possible solution:

|               |    1     |    2     |    3     |
| Movie-Genre   |          |          |          |
| Music-Genre   |          |          |          |
| Nationality   |          |          |          |

From clue 1, the fan of house is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Let's assume the person watching drama movies is on the left.

From clue 2, the person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Let's assume it's on the right.

From clue 3, the fan of punk is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is on the right of the person watching drama movies, the fan of punk must be on the left of the Italian.

From clue 4, the Italian is somewhere to the right of the person watching drama movies. Since the Italian is already on the right, this clue doesn't add much new information.

From clue 5, the Italian is somewhere between the Nigerian and the fan of blues. Since the Nigerian is on the left of the Italian, the fan of blues must be on the right of the Italian.

From clue 6, the Italian is either the person watching drama movies or the fan of house, but not both. Since the Italian is already on the right, it's more likely that the Italian is the fan of house.

Here's the final solution:

| Music-Genre   |  Blues    | House    | Punk     |

Lv1-3x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the designer is not the person who's hobby is video-games.

From statement 2, we know the project-manager is either the person who's hobby is skydiving or the person watching musical movies, but not both. Let's assume the project-manager is the person watching musical movies (we'll come back to this later).

From statement 3, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

From statement 5, we know the person watching musical movies is not to the left of the designer.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |      1      |    2     |        3        |
| Hobby         |             |          |                 |
| Job           |             |          |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |             |          |                 |

We know the project-manager is watching musical movies, so let's put that in the table:

|               |      1      |    2     |        3        |
| Hobby         |             |          |                 |
| Job           |             |          |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |             | musical |                 |

From statement 3, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Let's assume the person watching fantasy movies is in position 1. Then, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 2.

|               | fantasy | sudoku |        3        |
| Hobby         |         |        |                 |
| Job           |         |        |                 |
| Movie-Genre   |         | musical |                 |

From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 2, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 3.

|               | fantasy | sudoku | skydiving     |
| Hobby         |         |        |               |
| Job           |         |        |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         | musical |               |

Now, let's look at statement 1 again. We know the designer is not the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is not yet assigned, let's assume it's the person in position 1 (watching fantasy movies). Then, the designer must be in position 2.

|               | fantasy | designer | skydiving     |
| Hobby         | video-games | sudoku |               |
| Job           |         |        |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         | musical |               |

Finally, let's look at statement 2 again. We assumed the project-manager is watching musical movies, but we need to check if this is consistent with the other statements. We know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, and the person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 2. Therefore, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 3. This is consistent with our previous assumption.

|               | fantasy | designer | skydiving     |
| Hobby         | video-games | sudoku |               |
| Job           | project-manager | dressmaker | designer     |
| Movie-Genre   |         | musical |               |

The final solution is:

#############
|               |      1      |    2     |        3        |
| Hobby         | video-games | sudoku |               |
