| Sport         |          |             |            |

From clue 11, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is the person watching action movies. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | soy-milk  |            |
| Job           |          |             |            |

| Sport         |          |             |            |

From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. This means that the person who's sport is water-polo is also the person drinking soy-milk. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | soy-milk  |            |

| Sport         |          | water-polo|            |

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is already in position 2, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 3. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | soy-milk  |            |

| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of punk music is the person who's sport is tennis. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | soy-milk  |            |
| Job           |          |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | action    |            |
| Music-Genre   |          | punk      |            |
| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 7, we know that the fan of folk music is on the left of the doctor. Since the doctor is not yet in the table, let's put the fan of folk music in position 1:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | folk    | soy-milk  |            |
| Job           |          |             |            |
| Movie-Genre   |          | action    |            |
| Music-Genre   |          | punk      |            |
| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 5, we know that the mechanic is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is not yet in the table, let's put the mechanic in position 3:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | folk    | soy-milk  | mechanic  |
| Job           |          |             |            |

| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 3, we know that the coach is either the person watching zombie movies or the owner of the hedgehog, but not both. Since the coach is not yet in the table, let's put the coach in position 1:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | folk    | soy-milk  | mechanic  |
| Job           | coach   |             |            |

| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is already in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 1. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| soy-milk  | mechanic  |

| Pet           |          |             |            |
| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is either the person who's sport is water-polo or the owner of the guinea-pig, but not both. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is already in position 2, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1. Let's put this in the table:

|               |    1     |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| soy-milk  | mechanic  |

| Sport         |          | water-polo| golf       |

Now, let's summarize the final solution:

Lv1-6x3-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've come up with the solution. Here it is:

#############
|             |     1     |      2       |     3      |
| Beverage    |  Fanta   |  Sprite    |  Tea      |

| Sport       |  Badminton|  Basketball|  Rowing   |
| Transport   |  Taxi    |  Skateboard|  Boat     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the dog owner is on the left or right of the pilot. Since the pilot is in an odd position (statement 13), the dog owner must be in an even position.
2. From statement 2, we know the badminton player is not to the right of the fanta drinker. Since the fanta drinker is to the left of the skateboard driver (statement 12), the badminton player must be in position 1 or 2.
3. From statement 3, we know the photographer is the lizard owner or the video-games hobbyist, but not both. Since the photographer is not the lizard owner (statement 7), they must be the video-games hobbyist.
4. From statement 4, we know the lizard owner is not to the left of the badminton player. Since the lizard owner is to the left of the photographer (statement 7), they must be in position 1.
5. From statement 5, we know the photographer and dog owner have the same parity positions. Since the photographer is in an even position (statement 3), the dog owner must also be in an even position.
6. From statement 6, we know the tea drinker is the tea drinker. This statement is redundant, but it helps to confirm the solution.
7. From statement 8, we know the taxi driver is the basketball player. Since the taxi driver is to the right of the skateboard driver (statement 15), the basketball player must be in position 3.
8. From statement 9, we know the drawing hobbyist is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the drawing hobbyist is in position 1 (statement 2), the lawyer must be in position 2 or 3.
9. From statement 10, we know the pilot is not to the left of the lawyer. Since the pilot is in an odd position (statement 13), the lawyer must be in an even position.
10. From statement 11, we know the mouse owner and rowing player have different parity positions. Since the mouse owner is in an odd position (statement 1), the rowing player must be in an even position.
11. From statement 12, we know the fanta drinker is to the left of the skateboard driver. Since the fanta drinker is in position 1 (statement 2), the skateboard driver must be in position 2.
12. From statement 14, we know the fishing hobbyist is the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is in position 3 (statement 6), the fishing hobbyist must also be in position 3.
13. From statement 15, we know the skateboard driver is to the left of the taxi driver. Since the taxi driver is in position 3 (statement 8), the skateboard driver must be in position 2.

By combining these statements, we can deduce the final solution table."	{'beverage': ['fanta', 'sprite', 'tea'], 'hobby': ['drawing', 'fishing', 'video-games'], 'job': ['pilot', 'lawyer', 'photographer'], 'pet': ['dog', 'lizard', 'mouse'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'basketball', 'rowing'], 'transport': ['taxi', 'skateboard', 'boat']}	True	7	False
Lv1-6x3-3	"I'd be happy to help you solve the logic puzzle. After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Pet           |  Horse  |  Dog     |  Hedgehog |
| Sport         |  Baseball|  Cricket |  Ice-Hockey|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the French person's sport is either cricket or the person eating radish, but not both. Since the French person can't be eating radish (they're eating papaya), their sport must be cricket.
2. From clue 2, we know the Thai person is not to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the Thai person can't be drinking cola (they're drinking water), they must be on the left side of the table.
3. From clue 3, we know the owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the fan ambient. Since the fan ambient is on the left of the person drinking juice (clue 10), the owner of the dog must be on the right side of the table.
4. From clue 4, we know the person drinking water and the French person have different parity positions. Since the French person is eating papaya, they must be on an odd-numbered position, and the person drinking water must be on an even-numbered position.
5. From clue 5, we know the owner of the dog is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the dog is on the right side of the table, the owner of the horse must be on the right side as well.
6. From clue 6, we know the Egyptian person is on the far left or far right. Since the Thai person is on the left side, the Egyptian person must be on the far right.
7. From clue 7, we know the person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person eating onion is on the left side, they must be in position 1.
8. From clue 9, we know the person eating papaya is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person eating papaya is the French person, they must be on the left side of the table.
9. From clue 11, we know the Egyptian person is the person who's sport is baseball or the person drinking cola is the Egyptian, but not both. Since the Egyptian person is on the far right, they must be the person who's sport is baseball.
10. From clue 12, we know the fan pop and the person drinking cola have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking cola is on an even-numbered position, the fan pop must be on an even-numbered position as well.
11. From clue 13, we know the person drinking water is not the Thai person. Since the Thai person is on the left side, the person drinking water must be on the right side.

From statement 12, we know the Dutch is on the far left. From statement 13, we know the Dutch is either the owner of the frog or the person who's hobby is puzzles, but not both. Since the Dutch is on the far left, it's likely that the Dutch is the owner of the frog.

From statement 4, we know the American is between the Polish and the Dutch. Since the Dutch is on the far left, the American must be in the second position.

From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position. Since the American is in the second position, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in the fourth position.

From statement 9, we know the manager is the owner of the bird. Since the manager is not to the left of the photographer (statement 5), the manager must be in the third position.

From statement 8, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the far right. Since the manager is in the third position, the person eating cauliflower must be in the sixth position.

From statement 11, we know the person eating cauliflower and the person who's hobby is video-games have the same parity positions. Since the person eating cauliflower is in the sixth position, the person who's hobby is video-games must also be in the sixth position.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the owner of the bird. Since the manager is the owner of the bird, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in the first position.

From statement 3, we know the fan of classical music is not the Dutch. Since the Dutch is on the far left, the fan of classical music must be in the second position (American).

From statement 7, we know the fan of salsa is somewhere between the person eating orange and the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person eating orange is not yet placed, we'll come back to this statement later.

From statement 6, we know the owner of the frog is not to the left of the person eating orange. Since the Dutch is the owner of the frog, the Dutch must be to the right of the person eating orange.

From statement 10, we know the American is not to the right of the photographer. Since the American is in the second position, the photographer must be in the fifth position.

|               |      1      |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Mirinda       | Tea        |
| Hobby         | Cooking     | Board-games   | Chess      |
| Job           | Police-officer | Analyst      | Accountant |
| Movie-Genre   | Family      | Scientific   | Superhero  |
| Nationality   | Russian     | Indonesian   | Japanese   |
| Pet           | Turtle      | Hamster      | Cat        |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the Indonesian and the cat owner have the same parity positions. Since the cat owner is on the left, the Indonesian must be on the left as well.
2. From clue 2, we know the analyst is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the Indonesian is on the left, the analyst must be on the left of the Indonesian.
3. From clue 3, we know the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. Since the Indonesian is on the left, the person watching family movies must be on the left of the Indonesian.
4. From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the analyst is on the left, the person who's hobby is chess must be on the right of the analyst.
5. From clue 5, we know the police-officer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person watching scientific movies. Since the police-officer is not the Indonesian (from clue 7), the police-officer must be between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person watching scientific movies.
6. From clue 6, we know the Russian is on the left of the person watching family movies. Since the Russian is on the left, the person watching family movies must be on the left of the Russian.
7. From clue 7, we know the person drinking mirinda is not the Indonesian. Since the person drinking mirinda is on the right (from clue 11), the person drinking mirinda must be the Japanese.
8. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster owner is on the right (from clue 11), the person who's hobby is board-games must be on the right of the hamster owner.
9. From clue 9, we know the police-officer is the Indonesian or the police-officer is the person who's hobby is cooking, but not both. Since the police-officer is not the Indonesian (from clue 7), the police-officer must be the person who's hobby is cooking.
10. From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the right (from clue 8), the person who's hobby is board-games must be on the far right.
11. From clue 11, we know the owner of the turtle is the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is the Japanese, the owner of the turtle is the Japanese.

By combining these clues, we can arrive at the final solution table."	{'beverage': ['almond-milk', 'mirinda', 'tea'], 'hobby': ['cooking', 'board-games', 'chess'], 'job': ['police-officer', 'analyst', 'accountant'], 'movie-genre': ['family', 'scientific', 'superhero'], 'nationality': ['russian', 'indonesian', 'japanese'], 'pet': ['turtle', 'hamster', 'cat']}	True	7	False
