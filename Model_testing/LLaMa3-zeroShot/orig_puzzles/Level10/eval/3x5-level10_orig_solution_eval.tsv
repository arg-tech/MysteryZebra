| Transport   |  Jet-ski |  Skate  |  Subway|  Car      |  Tram    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person driving the subway is either the person drinking water or the person eating spinach, but not both. Since the person eating spinach is on the right of the person eating nectarine (statement 11), the person driving the subway must be the person drinking water.
2. From statement 6, we know the person eating spinach and the person drinking water have different parity positions. Since the person driving the subway is the person drinking water, the person eating spinach must be on the right of the person eating nectarine.
3. From statement 16, we know the person drinking milk is between the person eating nectarine and the person eating cherry. Since the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating spinach, the person drinking milk must be on the right of the person eating nectarine.
4. From statement 15, we know the person driving the car is somewhere between the person drinking water and the person driving the skateboard. Since the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking milk, the person driving the car must be on the left of the person drinking milk.
5. From statement 1, we know the person drinking mirinda and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the person driving the car is on the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking mirinda must be on the right of the person drinking milk.
6. From statement 4, we know the person eating garlic is on the right of the person eating apple. Since the person eating garlic is on the right of the person eating nectarine, the person eating apple must be on the left of the person eating nectarine.
7. From statement 8, we know the person eating nectarine and the person driving the jet-ski have the same parity positions. Since the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating spinach, the person driving the jet-ski must be on the right of the person eating spinach.
8. From statement 10, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person eating spinach, it must be on the far right.
9. From statement 14, we know the person driving the skateboard and the person eating nectarine have different parity positions. Since the person eating nectarine is on the right of the person eating spinach, the person driving the skateboard must be on the left of the person eating spinach.
10. From statement 9, we know the person driving the skateboard is somewhere between the person eating cherry and the person driving the tram. Since the person eating cherry is on the left of the person eating nectarine, the person driving the skateboard must be on the left of the person eating nectarine.
11. From statement 13, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking milk, the person drinking lemonade must be on the right of the person drinking milk.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the entire table. The final solution is shown above."	{'beverage': ['7up', 'lemon', 'milk', 'mirinda', 'water'], 'food': ['apple', 'cherry', 'nectar', 'garlic', 'spinach'], 'transport': ['jet-ski', 'skate', 'subway', 'car', 'tram']}	True	3	False

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 10, the coach is in the middle, so it must be in position 3.
2. From clue 2, the freelancer is between the coach and the person who's hobby is chess, so the freelancer must be in position 2.
3. From clue 3, the coach is on the left or right of the freelancer, so the coach must be in position 3, which we already know.
4. From clue 8, the person who's hobby is drawing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess, so the drawing person must be in position 5.
5. From clue 9, the person who's hobby is drawing is somewhere to the left of the police-officer, so the police-officer must be in position 4 or 5. Since the drawing person is in position 5, the police-officer must be in position 4.
6. From clue 6, the person drinking fanta is the police-officer or the person who's hobby is traveling, but not both. Since the police-officer is in position 4, the person drinking fanta must be the person who's hobby is traveling, which is in position 5.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 17, we know the fan punk is on the far left. From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the fan punk. Since the fan punk is on the far left, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be on the second position.
2. From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is the person driving the tram or the person driving the tram is the fan electronic, but not both. Since the fan electronic is not on the far left, the person driving the tram must be the fan electronic.
3. From statement 11, we know the fan electronic is somewhere between the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the tram. Since the fan electronic is not on the far left, the person who's sport is cricket must be on the third position.
4. From statement 2, we know the fan metal is the person driving the jet-ski or the person who's sport is cricket is the fan metal, but not both. Since the person who's sport is cricket is already on the third position, the fan metal must be the person driving the jet-ski.

10. From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is cycling and the fan electronic have the same parity positions. Since the fan electronic is already placed, the person who's sport is cycling must be on the same parity position as the fan electronic.
11. From statement 1, we know the fan techno and the person driving the boat have different parity positions. Since the person driving the boat is on the right of the fan trance, the fan techno must be on the opposite parity position.
