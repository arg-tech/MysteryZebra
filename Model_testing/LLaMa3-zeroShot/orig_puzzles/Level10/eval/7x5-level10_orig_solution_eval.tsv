Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

4. From statement 9, we know the person eating pomegranate is the owner of the ferret or the owner of the ferret is the american, but not both. Since the argentine is the person eating corn, the american is not the owner of the ferret. Therefore, the person eating pomegranate is the owner of the ferret, and the american is not the owner of the ferret.
5. From statement 35, we know the person driving the airplane is the person eating pomegranate, so the person eating pomegranate is the owner of the ferret.
