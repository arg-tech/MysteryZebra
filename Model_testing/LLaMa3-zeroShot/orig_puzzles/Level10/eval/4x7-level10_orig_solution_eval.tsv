2. From clue 19, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is the australian. From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is the owner of the hedgehog or the person watching western movies is the person who's sport is volleyball, but not both. Since the australian's sport is rugby, the australian can't be the owner of the hedgehog, so the australian must be the person watching western movies.
3. From clue 25, we know the owner of the turtle is the person watching western movies or the owner of the turtle is the american, but not both. Since the australian is watching western movies, the owner of the turtle must be the american.

From clue 31, we know the person watching romance movies is the owner of the goldfish or the owner of the goldfish is the person who's sport is golf, but not both. Since the turkish is the owner of the goldfish, the person watching romance movies must be the pakistani.
9. From clue 22, we know the pakistani is not the person watching zombie movies. From clue 23, we know the indian is somewhere between the person watching horror movies and the owner of the lizard. Since the pakistani is the owner of the mouse, the pakistani can't be watching horror movies, so the pakistani must be watching romance movies. The indian must be watching horror movies.
10. From clue 35, we know the person watching horror movies is the person who's sport is golf. From clue 29, we know the person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.
