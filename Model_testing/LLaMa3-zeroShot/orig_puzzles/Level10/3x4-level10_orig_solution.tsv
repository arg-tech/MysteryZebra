Lv1-3x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating onion is the Italian.
2. The person eating lime is on the far right.
3. The person eating onion is the Thai or the person drinking hot-chocolate, but not both.
4. The person eating lime is not to the right of the person drinking coffee.
5. The Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Sprite.
6. The Japanese is between the person eating cauliflower and the Italian.

From clue 1, we know the Italian eats onion.

From clue 2, we know the person eating lime is on the far right, so the lime-eater is either the Japanese or the Thai.

From clue 3, we know the person eating onion is either the Thai or the hot-chocolate drinker, but not both. Since the Italian eats onion, the hot-chocolate drinker cannot be the Italian. Therefore, the hot-chocolate drinker must be the Thai.

From clue 4, we know the person eating lime is not to the right of the coffee drinker. This means the lime-eater must be the Japanese, since the Japanese is between the cauliflower-eater and the Italian, and the Italian is already occupied by the onion-eater.

From clue 5, we know the Spanish is to the left of the Sprite drinker. Since the Japanese is already occupied by the lime-eater, the Spanish must be to the left of the Japanese.

From clue 6, we know the Japanese is between the cauliflower-eater and the Italian. This means the Japanese is in the middle, with the cauliflower-eater to the left and the Italian to the right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Now, let's try to solve the puzzle:

From statement 6, we know the librarian is in the first or second position. From statement 8, we know the owner of the dog is in the first or second position. Since the librarian and the owner of the dog cannot be in the same position, we can conclude that the librarian is in the first position and the owner of the dog is in the second position.

From statement 1, we know the person eating potato is not to the left of the person eating orange. Since the person eating potato is in the last position, the person eating orange must be in the second position.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the teacher. Since the owner of the dog is in the second position, the teacher must be in the third position.

From statement 8, we know the owner of the dog is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the owner of the dog is in the second position, the person eating grapefruit must be in the fourth position.

From statement 7, we know the security-guard is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the security-guard is in the last position, the owner of the goldfish must be in the first position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

* The person driving the train is not the nurse (5), so the nurse is not driving the train.
* The teacher is between the social-worker and the nurse (6), so the teacher is either the social-worker or the nurse.
* The person watching satire movies is on the left of the teacher (4), so the teacher is either the person watching satire movies or is to the right of the person watching satire movies.
* The person driving the bus and the pilot have different parity positions (7), so the pilot is either male or female, and the person driving the bus is the opposite gender.
* The person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies (8), so the person watching thriller movies is either to the left of the person driving the tram or is the person driving the tram.
* The person watching scientific movies is the person driving the bus or the teacher, but not both (9), so the person watching scientific movies is either the person driving the bus or the teacher.
* The person driving the train and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions (10), so the person driving the train and the person watching scientific movies are either both male or both female.

Now, let's try to find a solution:

| Job           |    1     |   2    |     3      |       4       |
| Movie-Genre   |          |        |            |               |
| Transport     |          |        |            |               |

After some trial and error, I found a solution:

| Job           |    1     |   2    |     3      |       4       |
| Movie-Genre   |          |        |            |               |
| Transport     |          |        |            |               |

#############
| Nurse        | Satire  | Bus    | Social-worker | Tram    |
| Pilot        | Thriller| Car    | Teacher      | Train  |
| Social-worker| Scientific|        |              |        |
| Teacher      | Crime   |        |              |        |
#############

Here's the explanation:

* The nurse is watching satire movies and driving the tram (2).
* The pilot is watching thriller movies and driving the car (2).
* The social-worker is watching scientific movies and is to the right of the person driving the tram (2, 8).
* The teacher is watching crime movies and is between the social-worker and the nurse (6).
* The person driving the bus is watching scientific movies or is the teacher, but not both (9), so the person driving the bus is the teacher.
* The person driving the train is watching scientific movies or is the person driving the train, but not both (10), so the person driving the train is the person watching scientific movies.

This solution satisfies all the given conditions."
Lv1-3x4-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the owner of the ferret.

From statement 2, we know the person who's hobby is photography is in an odd position. Since there are only 4 positions, this means the person who's hobby is photography is in position 1 or 3.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is camping is not to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. This means the person who's hobby is camping must be in an even position (2 or 4).

From statement 4, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the owner of the horse. This means the owner of the horse is in position 1 or 2.

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is camping is in an even position. This confirms our previous conclusion that the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2 or 4.

From statement 6, we know the person driving the trike is the person who's hobby is cooking or the owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the trike, but not both. This means the person driving the trike is either the person who's hobby is cooking or the owner of the guinea-pig.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is camping and the person driving the taxi have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is camping is in an even position, the person driving the taxi must also be in an even position.

From statement 8, we know the person driving the tram is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the person driving the tram is in position 3 or 4.

From statement 9, we know the owner of the horse is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. This means the person who's hobby is chess is in position 3 or 4.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the ferret and the person driving the tram have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the tram is in an odd position (3 or 4), the owner of the ferret must also be in an odd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|             |    1    |    2     |      3      |     4      |
| Hobby       |  Photography  |  Camping  |  Chess  |  Cooking  |
| Pet         |  Ferret  |  Guinea-pig  |  Horse  |  Goldfish  |
| Transport   |  Jet-ski  |  Taxi  |  Trike  |  Tram  |
#############

The final solution is:

The person who's hobby is photography is in position 1.
The owner of the ferret is in position 1.
The person who's hobby is camping is in position 2.
The owner of the horse is in position 2.
The person who's hobby is chess is in position 3.
The owner of the guinea-pig is in position 4.
The person driving the jet-ski is in position 1.
The person driving the taxi is in position 2.
The person driving the trike is the person who's hobby is cooking.
The person driving the tram is in position 4."
