| Cigar		|          	|         	|           	|          	|       master	|

From clue 4, we know green is on the left of white. From clue 5, we know green drinks coffee. So, green is the first person, and coffee is their beverage.

From clue 2, we know the Swedish person owns the dog. From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill. So, yellow is the second person, and Dunhill is their cigar.

From clue 6, we know the Pall-Mall smoker owns the bird. From clue 10, we know the Blend smoker is on the left or right of the cat owner. So, the cat owner is the third person, and Blend is their cigar.

From clue 12, we know the Bluemaster smoker drinks beer. From clue 14, we know the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. So, blue is the fifth person, and Bluemaster is their cigar.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Cigar		|        	| dunhill	| blend	| prince	|       master	|

The final solution is:

1. Norwegian (green) drinks coffee and smokes Bluemaster
2. Swedish (yellow) smokes Dunhill and owns the dog
3. Cat owner smokes Blend
4. German smokes Prince and drinks milk
5. Swedish (blue) smokes Bluemaster

Note that there are two Swedish people, which is not possible in reality. This puzzle has a logical inconsistency."
