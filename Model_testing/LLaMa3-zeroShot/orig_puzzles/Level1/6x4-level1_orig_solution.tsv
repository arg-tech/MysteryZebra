Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the Dutch is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. From clue 15, we know the Dutch is on the right of the coach, so the coach must be the one who's sport is skiing.
* From clue 2, we know the analyst is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person eating tomato, so the analyst must be eating tomato.
* From clue 3, we know the person driving the motorbike is the one who's sport is basketball. From clue 9, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the person eating lettuce, so the person eating lettuce must be the one who's sport is swimming.
* From clue 4, we know the photographer is on the left of the French. From clue 13, we know the photographer is on the left of the person eating tomato, so the French must be eating tomato.
* From clue 5, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person eating kale. From clue 11, we know the person eating kale is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming, so the person driving the skateboard must be the one who's sport is skiing.
* From clue 6, we know the Japanese is on the far right. From clue 14, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the Dutch, so the Japanese must be eating banana.
* From clue 7, we know the person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. From clue 8, we know the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so the person driving the bus must be watching animation movies.
* From clue 10, we know the person watching crime movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. From clue 3, we know the person driving the motorbike is the one who's sport is basketball, so the person watching crime movies must be the one who's job is police-officer.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person eating tomato. From clue 2, we know the analyst is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball, so the analyst must be eating lettuce.
* From clue 14, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the Dutch. From clue 15, we know the Dutch is on the right of the coach, so the coach must be the one who's sport is skiing.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table."
