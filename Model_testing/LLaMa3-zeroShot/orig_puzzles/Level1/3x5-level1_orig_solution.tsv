From statement 3, we know the person eating zucchini is on the right of the analyst. Since the person eating zucchini is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.

From statement 7, we know the doctor is on the right of the person eating zucchini. Since the person eating zucchini is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.

Now, let's summarize what we have so far:

|         |     1     |    2    |    3     |     4     |       5       |
| Food    | Nurse    |         |          |           |               |
| Hobby   |           |         |          |           |               |
| Job     |           |         |          |           |               |

The person eating kiwi is the person who's hobby is baking, and the person eating mango is on the left of the person eating kiwi. The person who's hobby is chess is in the middle.

Now, let's place the remaining people:

* The person eating zucchini is on the right of the analyst, and the doctor is on the right of the person eating zucchini. This means the analyst must be on the left of the person eating zucchini.
* The coach is on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling, and the person who's hobby is traveling is not yet placed. This means the coach must be on the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
* The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person eating zucchini, and the person eating zucchini is on the right of the analyst. This means the person who's hobby is camping must be on the left of the analyst.

Here's the final solution:
