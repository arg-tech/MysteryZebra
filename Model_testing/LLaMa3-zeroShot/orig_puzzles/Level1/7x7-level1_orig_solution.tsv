Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the given information to fill in some of the cells. For example, from clue 1, I knew the person watching martial-arts movies was the French, so I filled in the corresponding cell.
2. I then used the process of elimination to figure out the remaining cells. For example, from clue 2, I knew the person eating plum was on the right of the person drinking tea, so I eliminated the possibility of the person eating plum being the French (since they were already watching martial-arts movies).
3. I continued this process, using each clue to eliminate possibilities and fill in more cells.
4. As I filled in more cells, I was able to use the information to solve more clues. For example, from clue 8, I knew the person drinking 7up was on the right of the Pakistani, so I filled in the corresponding cell.
5. I repeated this process until I had filled in all the cells.

2. I then used the remaining statements to fill in the rest of the columns. For example, from statement 2, I knew the person who's hobby is fishing was on the left of the person eating peas, and from statement 34, I knew the person who's hobby is fishing was on the left of the person eating peas.
3. I also used the process of elimination to figure out which person was in which position. For example, from statement 18, I knew the person driving the ship was on the right of the person driving the subway, and from statement 36, I knew the turkish was the videographer, so the turkish couldn't be driving the ship.
4. Finally, I double-checked the solution to make sure it was consistent with all the given statements.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
