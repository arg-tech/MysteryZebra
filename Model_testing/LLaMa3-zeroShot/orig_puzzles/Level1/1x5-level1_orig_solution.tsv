This means the electrician is in either the 1st or 2nd position, and the engineer is in either the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The freelancer is in the middle.
This means the freelancer is in either the 2nd or 3rd position.

Lv1-1x5-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Russian is on the right of the Indian: This means the Indian is on the left, and the Russian is on the right.
2. The Russian is on the left of the Dutch: This means the Russian is on the left of the Dutch, but we already know the Russian is on the right of the Indian, so the Indian must be in the middle.
3. The Dutch is on the left of the British: This means the Dutch is on the left of the British, and the British is on the right of the Dutch.
4. The Indian is on the far left: This confirms that the Indian is on the left, and the Russian is on the right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Nationality   |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
|               |        |         |       |         |        |
| Indian        | 1      |        |       |         |        |
|?            |        | 2      |       |         |        |

| Russian      |        |        |       |         | 5      |
#############

From clue 1, we know the Russian is on the right of the Indian, so the Russian must be in position 5.

From clue 2, we know the Russian is on the left of the Dutch, so the Dutch must be in position 3.

From clue 3, we know the Dutch is on the left of the British, so the British must be in position 4.

From clue 4, we know the Indian is on the far left, so the Indian must be in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps:

#############
| Nationality   |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
| Indian        | 1      | German |       | British | Russian |
#############

The final solution is:

Note that the remaining gap (3) could be any nationality, but the puzzle doesn't provide enough information to determine which one it is."
Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.

This means that rock-climbing must be either in position 1 or 2, and dancing must be in position 2 or 3.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

This means that gardening must be either in position 4 or 5, and skydiving must be in position 3 or 4.

3. The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle.

This means that dancing must be in position 3, since it's already established that it's not in position 1 or 5.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* Rock-climbing is on the left of dancing, so it must be in position 1 or 2.
* Dancing is in the middle, so it's in position 3.
* Gardening is on the right of skydiving, so it must be in position 4 or 5.
* Skydiving can't be in position 1 or 2, since rock-climbing is there. It must be in position 3 or 4.
* Since dancing is in position 3, skydiving can't be there. It must be in position 4.
* Gardening is on the right of skydiving, so it's in position 5.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|         |    1    |       2       |    3    |     4     |     5     |

Lv1-1x5-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating plum.
This means that plum cannot be in the last position, as potato would be on the right of plum. So, plum must be in one of the first three positions.

2. The person eating strawberry is in the middle.
This means that strawberry must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.
This means that pomegranate cannot be in the first position, as strawberry would be on the left of pomegranate. So, pomegranate must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Plum is in one of the first three positions.
* Strawberry is in the middle (2 or 3).
* Pomegranate is in position 4 or 5.

The possible arrangements are:

|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   | plum | strawberry |?         |?         | pomegranate |

We can try different combinations:

* If plum is in position 1, strawberry is in position 2, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 3, but there's no room for potato on the right of plum.
* If plum is in position 1, strawberry is in position 3, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 2, but strawberry is already in position 3.
* If plum is in position 2, strawberry is in position 3, and pomegranate is in position 5, then potato would be in position 1, which satisfies the condition.

So, the final solution is:

#############
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |
| Food   | plum | strawberry | potato | pomegranate | grapes |
#############

The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating plum, the person eating strawberry is in the middle, and the person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating pomegranate."

1. The Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish.
2. The Spanish is in the middle.

| Nationality   |         |        |         |            |         |

We can start by placing the French in the first position, since it's not in the last position.

|               |  French  |        |         |            |         |

The Spanish is in the middle, so it goes in position 3.

|               |  French  |        | Spanish |            |         |

The Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish, so it goes in position 2.

|               |  French  | Indonesian | Spanish |            |         |

The Turkish is on the right of the Indonesian, so it goes in position 4.

|               |  French  | Indonesian | Spanish | Turkish    |         |

The only nationality left is Russian, which goes in the last position.
