Lv1-1x6-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
This means that camping cannot be on the far right, so we can place gardening on the far left.

|         |     1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |    6    |

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left.
We already placed gardening on the far left, so this clue doesn't add new information.

3. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing.
This means that sudoku cannot be on the far left, so we can place gardening on the far left.

|         |     1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |    6    |

4. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.
This means that writing cannot be on the far left, so we can place sudoku on the far left.

|         |     1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |    6    |
| Hobby   |  Gardening |  Sudoku  |  Filmmaking |  Writing |        |         |

5. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.

| Hobby   |  Gardening |  Sudoku  |  Filmmaking |  Writing |        |  Camping  |

Now we can fill in the remaining hobby, drawing. Since sudoku is on the left of drawing, and filmmaking is on the left of writing, drawing must be on the right of sudoku and left of writing.

|         |     1     |    2    |     3      |    4    |   5    |    6    |

Lv1-1x6-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the mouse.

This means the lizard and mouse cannot be next to each other, so the lizard must be on the far left, and the mouse must be on the right of the lizard.
