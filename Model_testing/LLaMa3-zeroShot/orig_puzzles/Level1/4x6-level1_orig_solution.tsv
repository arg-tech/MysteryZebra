#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 10, we know the person eating cabbage is on the far left. From clue 11, we know they are also on the left of the person driving the roller. This means the person driving the roller must be eating carrot (clue 13).
* From clue 4, we know the person eating potato is the Canadian. From clue 6, we know the Pakistani is on the left of the Canadian, so the Pakistani must be eating carrot (since the Canadian is eating potato).
* From clue 9, we know the person eating avocado is the fan of R&B. From clue 1, we know this person is on the right of the person driving the subway. Since the Canadian is eating potato and not driving the subway, the person driving the subway must be eating eggplant.
* From clue 3, we know the person driving the train is the Italian. From clue 15, we know the person driving the tram is on the left of the person eating eggplant, so the Italian must be eating eggplant.
* From clue 2, we know the Chinese is on the right of the fan of disco. From clue 8, we know the fan of disco is the Canadian, so the Chinese must be on the right of the Canadian. This means the Chinese must be eating banana.
* From clue 17, we know the fan of disco is on the right of the person eating carrot. Since the Canadian is eating potato and not carrot, the person eating carrot must be the Pakistani.
* From clue 16, we know the British is the person driving the scooter. From clue 14, we know the person driving the scooter is the fan of trance, so the British must be the fan of trance.
* From clue 5, we know the person eating carrot is on the left of the person driving the car. Since the Pakistani is eating carrot, the person driving the car must be eating eggplant.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the entire table with the correct placements."
