Lv1-5x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
This means that the person who drinks lemonade cannot be the one who plays skiing, and the person who plays skiing must be on the left of the person who drinks lemonade.

2. The person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the train.
This means that the person who drinks cola must be on the left of the person who drives the train.

3. The paramedic is the owner of the mouse.
This means that the paramedic cannot be the one who drinks cola (since the freelancer is the one who drinks cola, and the paramedic is not the freelancer).

4. The freelancer is the person drinking cola.
This means that the freelancer drinks cola and is on the left of the person driving the train.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The freelancer drinks cola and is on the left of the person driving the train.
* The paramedic is the owner of the mouse and is not the freelancer.
* The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who plays skiing.

We can start filling in the table:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |            |           |
| Job         |            |           |
| Pet         |            |           |
| Sport       |            |           |
| Transport   |            |           |

* Freelancer (cola) is on the left of the person driving the train.
* Paramedic (mouse) is not on the left of the person driving the train.
* The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who plays skiing.

Let's try to place the paramedic and the freelancer:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | cola      | lemonade |
| Job         | freelancer| paramedic|
| Pet         |            | mouse    |
| Sport       |            | skiing  |
| Transport   |            | train    |

Now, we can place the person who plays baseball:

* The person who plays skiing is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
* The person who plays baseball is not the one who plays skiing.
* The person who plays baseball is not the freelancer (since the freelancer drinks cola).

Let's place the person who plays baseball:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | cola      | lemonade |
| Job         | freelancer| paramedic|
| Pet         |            | mouse    |
| Sport       | baseball | skiing  |
| Transport   |            | train    |

Finally, we can place the person who drives the jet-ski:

* The person who drives the train is on the right of the person drinking cola.
* The person who drives the jet-ski is not the one who drives the train.

Let's place the person who drives the jet-ski:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | cola      | lemonade |
| Job         | freelancer| paramedic|
| Pet         |            | mouse    |
| Sport       | baseball | skiing  |
| Transport   | jet-ski  | train    |

The final solution is:

#############
|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | cola      | lemonade |
| Job         | freelancer| paramedic|
| Pet         |            | mouse    |

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The paramedic is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
This means the paramedic is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person drinking sprite is in the 1st or 2nd column as well.

2. The person driving the roller is on the far right.
This means the person driving the roller is in the 4th column.

3. The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is skateboarding.
This means the owner of the ferret is also the person who prefers skateboarding.

4. The owner of the ferret is the person drinking sprite.
This means the owner of the ferret is also the person drinking sprite.

From clue 4, we know the owner of the ferret is drinking sprite. From clue 3, we know the owner of the ferret prefers skateboarding. So, the person drinking sprite and preferring skateboarding is the owner of the ferret.

From clue 1, we know the paramedic is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is the owner of the ferret, the paramedic must be in the 1st column.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the roller is on the far right. Since the person driving the roller is in the 4th column, the person in the 3rd column must be the one using the tram (as there are only 2 means of transport).

Now we can start filling in the table:

#############
|             |     1     |       2       |

| Sport       | Skateboarding | Lacrosse     |
| Transport   | Tram      | Roller      |

Lv1-5x2-3	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues first.

From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left. Since there are only two hobbies, camping and collecting, and only one person can be on the far left, we can conclude that the person on the far left has the hobby collecting.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating grapes is on the far left. Since the person on the far left has the hobby collecting, we can conclude that the person eating grapes also has the hobby collecting.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of pop is on the right of the software-developer. This means that the software-developer cannot be on the far right, since the fan of pop would then be on the far right. Therefore, the software-developer must be in the second column.

From clue 3, we know that the fan of electronic is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person eating grapes is on the far left, the fan of electronic cannot be on the far left. Therefore, the fan of electronic must be in the third column.

Now we can start filling in the table:

Lv1-5x2-5	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the ferret is the person drinking sprite. Let's put the ferret and sprite in the same column.

```
|               |      1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |              | sprite  |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This means that the person with the magic-tricks hobby must be in column 1.

| Beverage      |              | sprite  |

```

Now we have a few possibilities left. From clue 1, we know that the person with the magic-tricks hobby is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This means that the person with the magic-tricks hobby cannot be the british person, since the british person is already in column 1. Therefore, the person with the magic-tricks hobby must be in column 2.

From statement 1, we know the coach's music genre is country. From statement 3, we know the italian's beverage is miranda. From statement 2, we know the italian is on the left of the person who prefers swimming.

Let's assume the italian is on the left in the table. Then, the person who prefers swimming must be on the right. Since the italian's beverage is miranda, the person on the right must drink iced-tea.

Lv1-5x2-7	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 4, we know the fan of reggae is on the far left. This means the person on the left is drinking 7up (since cola is on the far right).

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the person on the left (who is drinking 7up) is not the one who does skydiving. Therefore, the person who does skydiving is the one who drinks cola and is on the far right.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the person on the left is drinking 7up, the person who watches western movies must be on the right of the person who drinks 7up.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking cola is on the far right. This means the person who watches western movies must be on the right of the person who drinks cola.

But we're not done yet! We still need to figure out who likes which music genre and who does which hobby.

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the person who does skydiving is the one who drinks cola and is on the far right. Therefore, the person who does card-games must be the one who drinks 7up.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking cola is on the far right. This means the person who drinks cola must be the one who does skydiving.
