1. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.

This means that the order of movie genres is: mystery,?, time-travel

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is the person watching crime movies.

This means that the person watching crime movies is in the first column, and their hobby is fishing.

3. The person watching drama movies is on the far right.

This means that the order of movie genres is: mystery,?, time-travel, drama

4. The person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

This means that the person who's hobby is writing is in the third column, and the person watching time-travel movies is in the fourth column.

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

This means that the person who's hobby is traveling is in the second column, and the person watching drama movies is in the fourth column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 1, we know the owner of the mouse is on the far left. From clue 3, we know the fan of indie is also on the far left. Since the fan of indie is on the far left, the owner of the mouse must be the fan of indie.

1. Indie (owner of mouse)
2. Electronic
3.? (owner of?)
4. Salsa (owner of ferret)

We still need to figure out the music genre and pet for the third person. Since there are only two music genres left (classical and classical), the third person must be a fan of classical. Let's assume the third person owns a chinchilla.

| Music-Genre   | Indie  | Electronic | Classical | Salsa  |
| Pet           | Mouse  |?         | Chinchilla | Ferret |
