This means that the juice beverage is in the same row as the surfing sport.

3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.
This means that the almond-milk beverage is in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea.
2. The Canadian is on the far left.
3. The Canadian is the person drinking iced-tea.

From clue 2, we know the Canadian is on the far left. From clue 3, we know the Canadian is drinking iced-tea. So, the Canadian is drinking iced-tea and is on the far left.

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the Canadian is on the far left, the Argentine must be on the left of the person drinking tea, but not the far left. This means the Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea, and the person drinking tea is on the right of the Canadian.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |          |           |          |

| Canadian     | Fanta    | Iced-Tea  |          |

| Nigerian     |          |          |          |
#############

The final solution is:

The Canadian drinks iced-tea and is on the far left. The Argentine drinks tea and is on the right of the Canadian. The Nigerian's favorite beverage is not specified, but it must be Fanta (since it's not iced-tea or tea)."
Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish.
This means that the person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea.

2. The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry.
This means that the person eating raspberry is on the right of the person drinking water.

3. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish.
This means that the person eating radish is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea (from clue 1).
* The person eating radish is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (from clue 3).
* Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish, and the person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea.

* The person eating raspberry is on the right of the person drinking water (from clue 2).
* The person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry (from clue 2).
* Therefore, the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry.

Now we have a rough idea of the order:

* Person drinking soy-milk -> Person eating radish -> Person drinking tea
* Person drinking water -> Person eating raspberry

The only remaining question is which beverage corresponds to which food. Let's try to find a combination that satisfies all the clues:

* Person drinking soy-milk: Radish (from clue 3)
* Person drinking tea: Raspberry (since the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish)
* Person drinking water: Plum (since the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry)

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   | Soy-milk | Tea    | Water   |

This means that the person who eats radish is either in the middle or on the right.

2. The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
This means that the person who eats pomegranate is either in the middle or on the right.

3. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left.
This means that the person who eats radish cannot be on the left, since the person who's hobby is woodworking is already there.

Combining the clues, we can start filling in the table:

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Food    |             |            |             |
| Hobby   |             |            |             |

Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left, we can start with that:

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Food    |             |            |             |
| Hobby   | Woodworking |            |             |

Now, let's look at clue 1 again. The person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means that the person eating radish must be in position 2 or 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |

Now, let's look at clue 2 again. The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. This means that the person eating pomegranate must be in position 2 or 3.

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Food    |             | Radish    | Pomegranate |
| Hobby   | Woodworking |            |             |

Finally, let's look at the remaining hobby, puzzles. Since it's not mentioned in any of the clues, we can place it in the remaining position:

|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Food    |             | Radish    | Pomegranate |

2. The person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the bird.
3. The owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person driving the airplane.
4. The owner of the bird is in the middle.

From clue 1, we know the trike owner is the hedgehog owner.

From clue 2, we know the trike owner (hedgehog owner) is on the right of the bird owner.

From clue 3, we know the airplane owner is on the left of the hedgehog owner (trike owner).

Now, let's arrange the pets and transport in the correct order:

| Pet         |            |          |          |
| Transport   |            |          |          |

Since the bird owner is in the middle (clue 4), we can place the bird owner in position 2.

|             |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Pet         |            |  Bird  |          |
| Transport   |            |          |          |

The trike owner (hedgehog owner) is on the right of the bird owner, so we place the trike owner in position 3.

|             |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Pet         |            |  Bird  | Hedgehog |
| Transport   |            |          | Trike    |

The airplane owner is on the left of the hedgehog owner, so we place the airplane owner in position 1.

|             |     1      |    2     |    3     |
| Pet         | Airplane |  Bird  | Hedgehog |

2. The owner of the rabbit is on the far right.
This means the rabbit is on the rightmost column.

3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or in the middle, and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right.

Lv1-2x3-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching zombie movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
This means that the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

2. The person watching zombie movies is on the far right.
This means that the person watching zombie movies is in the third position from the right.

Combining the two clues, we can conclude that the person drinking sprite is in the second position from the right, and the person watching zombie movies is in the third position from the right.

3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking tea.
This means that the person drinking tea is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Movie-Genre   |        |           |        |

From clue 1, we know the person drinking sprite is in the second position. From clue 2, we know the person watching zombie movies is in the third position. From clue 3, we know the person drinking tea is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.

Let's assign the movie-genres to the positions:

| Beverage      |        |           |        |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Sprite    | Zombie |

Now, we need to assign the beverages to the positions. We know the person drinking sprite is in the second position, so the person drinking tea must be in the third position (since the person watching zombie movies is already in the third position). This means the person drinking cola must be in the first position.
