Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: epic, musical
This means that each person likes either epic or musical, but not both.
2. The people use 2 different means of transport: subway, trike
This means that each person uses either the subway or the trike, but not both.
3. The person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway
This means that the person who likes epic movies is sitting next to the person who uses the subway.

From clue 1, we know that each person likes either epic or musical. Let's assign the movie-genres to the people:

|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   |       |         |
| Transport     |       |         |

Since the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway, let's assume that person 1 likes epic movies and person 2 likes musical movies.

|               |   1 (Epic) |    2 (Musical)    |
| Movie-Genre   |       |         |
| Transport     |       |         |

From clue 2, we know that each person uses either the subway or the trike. Let's assign the transport modes to the people:

|               |   1 (Epic) |    2 (Musical)    |
| Movie-Genre   |       |         |
| Transport     | Subway | Trike         |

Now we have a complete solution:

#############
|               |   1 (Epic) |    2 (Musical)    |
| Movie-Genre   |       |         |
| Transport     | Subway | Trike         |
#############

The final solution shows that person 1 likes epic movies and uses the subway, while person 2 likes musical movies and uses the trike."
Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

This means that the person eating kiwi cannot be in the first column (since there's no one to the right of them). Therefore, the person eating kiwi must be in the second column.

2. There are 2 different types of food: eggplant, kiwi
3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: skateboarding, snowboarding

Since the person eating kiwi is in the second column, and there are only 2 columns, the person eating eggplant must be in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    |  Eggplant    |    Kiwi     |

Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person eating spinach.

This means that the person eating spinach is on the left, and the person drinking milk is on the right.

|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   |          | soy-     |
| Food       | spinach | orange |

Now, let's consider the remaining possibilities:

* The person eating orange can't drink soy-milk, because the person drinking soy-milk is on the right, and the person eating orange is on the left.
* The person eating spinach can't drink milk, because the person drinking milk is on the right, and the person eating spinach is on the left.

So, the only possible combination is:

|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-     | milk   |
| Food       | spinach | orange |

Final Solution:

Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. There are 2 different nationalities: french, indonesian
2. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, parkour
3. The indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling

From clue 3, we know that the indonesian is on the right of the person who prefers cycling. This means that the indonesian cannot be on the left of the person who prefers cycling.

Let's create a possible arrangement:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   |         |            |
| Sport         |         |            |

We can start by placing the french person on the left, since we don't have any information that suggests they should be on the right. We'll assume they prefer parkour.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   | French  |            |
| Sport         | Parkour |            |

Now, we know the indonesian is on the right of the person who prefers cycling. Since the french person prefers parkour, the indonesian must prefer cycling.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   | French  | Indonesian |
| Sport         | Parkour | Cycling    |

This is the final solution:

#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   | French  | Indonesian |
| Sport         | Parkour | Cycling    |

Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies. This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be watching crime movies, and the person watching crime movies cannot be drinking hot-chocolate.

Here's the initial table:

|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      |               |        |
| Movie-Genre   |               |        |

We can start by filling in the possible combinations:

|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | sprite |
| Movie-Genre   | crime        | horror |

Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies, we can swap the columns:

|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | sprite       | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | horror       | crime        |

Now, let's analyze the remaining possibilities:

* The person drinking sprite cannot be watching horror movies, because the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person watching crime movies, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is not watching crime movies. This means that the person drinking sprite must be watching horror movies.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate must be watching crime movies, because they are on the left of the person watching crime movies.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      | sprite       | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | horror       | crime        |
#############

The solution is that the person drinking sprite watches horror movies, and the person drinking hot-chocolate watches crime movies."

Lv1-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The writer is on the right of the person drinking Mirinda.

2. There are 2 different favourite beverages: Cola, Mirinda
3. The people have 2 different jobs: Firefighter, Writer

Now, let's create a table with the possible combinations:
