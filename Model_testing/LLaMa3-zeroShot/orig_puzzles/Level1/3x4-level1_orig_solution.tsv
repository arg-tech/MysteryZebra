Note that the sport for the person eating pepper is still unknown, but it can be determined by process of elimination."
Lv1-3x4-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking mirinda is the owner of the turtle.
2. The owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person eating spinach.
4. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the owner of the turtle.
5. The person eating tomato is on the far right.
6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the owner of the turtle.
7. The person eating pumpkin is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

From statement 1, we know the mirinda drinker is the turtle owner. From statement 4, we know the 7up drinker is on the right of the turtle owner. Since the turtle owner is already occupied, the 7up drinker must be the rabbit owner.

From statement 2, we know the mouse owner is on the left of the rabbit owner. Since the rabbit owner is already occupied, the mouse owner must be the person drinking fanta.

From statement 7, we know the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fanta drinker. Since the fanta drinker is the mouse owner, the pumpkin eater must be the person drinking iced-tea.

From statement 3, we know the iced-tea drinker is on the left of the spinach eater. Since the iced-tea drinker is already occupied, the spinach eater must be the person drinking mirinda (the turtle owner).

From statement 5, we know the tomato eater is on the far right. Since the pumpkin eater is already occupied, the tomato eater must be the person drinking 7up (the rabbit owner).

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:
