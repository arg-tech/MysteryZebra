Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime.
This means the pony owner is not the person eating lime, and is to the right of them.

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
This means the guinea-pig owner is not the person who's hobby is camping, and is to the right of them.

3. The person eating banana is the owner of the pony.
This means the person eating banana is on the right of the person eating lime.

4. The person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig.
This means the person who's hobby is puzzles is to the right of the person who's hobby is camping.

5. The person eating lime is on the far left.
This means the person eating lime is in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |         |         |            |
| Hobby   |         |         |            |
| Pet     |         |         |            |

From statement 5, we know the person eating lime is in the first column. From statement 3, we know the person eating banana is the owner of the pony, so they must be in the third column. This means the person eating kale must be in the second column.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person eating lime, so the pony owner must be in the third column. This means the person eating banana (who is the owner of the pony) must be in the third column.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person eating banana is in the third column, the person who's hobby is camping must be in the second column. This means the person who's hobby is puzzles (who is the owner of the guinea-pig) must be in the third column.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|         |    1    |    2    |     3      |
| Food    |  Lime  |  Kale  |  Banana  |
| Hobby   |        | Camping| Puzzles  |
| Pet     |        | Guinea-pig| Pony     |
#############

The final solution is:

* The person eating lime is on the far left.
* The person eating banana is the owner of the pony.
* The person eating kale is not the owner of the pony or the guinea-pig.
* The person who's hobby is camping is not the owner of the pony or the guinea-pig.
* The person who's hobby is puzzles is the owner of the guinea-pig."
Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far right.
This means the hedgehog owner is in column 3.

2. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.
This means the sports movie watcher is in column 2 or 3. Since the hedgehog owner is in column 3, the sports movie watcher must be in column 2.

3. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
This means the video-games person is in column 2 or 3. Since the sports movie watcher is already in column 2, the video-games person must be in column 3.

4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person watching family movies.
This means the family movie watcher is in column 1 or 2. Since the video-games person is already in column 3, the family movie watcher must be in column 1.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |

| Pet           |           |             |            |

From clue 4, the family movie watcher is in column 1. Let's assume the family movie watcher's hobby is gardening (we'll come back to this later).

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | gardening |           | video-games |

| Pet           |           |           | hedgehog   |

From clue 2, the sports movie watcher is in column 2. Since the family movie watcher is in column 1, the sports movie watcher must be in column 2.

From clue 3, the video-games person is in column 3. We already filled this in.

From clue 1, the hedgehog owner is in column 3. We already filled this in.

Now, let's come back to the family movie watcher's hobby. Since the family movie watcher is in column 1, and the person in column 1 has the hobby gardening, the family movie watcher must have the hobby gardening.

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |
| Hobby         | gardening |           | video-games |
| Movie-Genre   | family    | sports     |            |
| Pet           | dog       | hamster    | hedgehog   |

The only pet left is the hamster, which must be the pet of the person in column 2 (sports movie watcher).

The final solution table is:

Lv1-3x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
2. The fan of dubstep is on the far left.
3. The person driving the airplane is on the far left.
4. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
5. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is the person driving the trike.

From clue 2, we know the fan of dubstep is on the far left. From clue 3, we know the person driving the airplane is also on the far left, so the fan of dubstep must be driving the airplane.

From clue 1, we know the fan of funk is on the left of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the fan of dubstep is already on the far left, the fan of funk must be in the second position.

From clue 4, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is driving the trike (clue 5), the person who's sport is cycling must be in the third position.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1     |     2      |     3      |
| Music-Genre   |  Dubstep  |  Funk     |  Gospel   |
| Sport         |  Cycling | ?        |  Ice-Hockey|
| Transport     |  Airplane| ?        |  Trike     |
#############

From the remaining possibilities, we can deduce that the fan of gospel is in the third position, and the person who's sport is? is in the second position. However, we don't have enough information to determine the exact sport or music genre for this person.

Here's the final solution table:

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means that the person drinking milk is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person with the puzzle hobby is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is in the middle.
This means that the person with the fishing hobby is in the 2nd position.

3. The person drinking 7up is on the left of the dancer.
This means that the person drinking 7up is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the dancer is in the 3rd position.

4. The person drinking milk is on the right of the paramedic.
This means that the paramedic is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person drinking milk is in the 3rd position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person drinking milk is in the 3rd position (from clue 4).
* The person with the fishing hobby is in the 2nd position (from clue 2).
* The paramedic is either in the 1st or 2nd position (from clue 4).
* The person drinking 7up is either in the 1st or 2nd position (from clue 3).
* The dancer is in the 3rd position (from clue 3).

With this information, we can start filling in the table:

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   |              |         |                 |
| Hobby      |              |         |                 |
| Job        |              |         |                 |

Let's assume the paramedic is in the 1st position. Then, the person drinking 7up is in the 2nd position, and the dancer is in the 3rd position.

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | 7up         | milk    |                 |

| Job        | paramedic   |         | dancer         |

Now, we need to figure out who drinks milk. From clue 1, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person with the puzzle hobby. Since the person with the fishing hobby is in the 2nd position, the person drinking milk must be in the 1st position.

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | milk        | 7up     |                 |
| Hobby      |              | fishing |                 |
| Job        | paramedic   |         | dancer         |

Finally, we need to figure out who drinks juice. Since there are only two options left (juice and milk), and we already know who drinks milk, the person in the 2nd position must drink juice.

|            |      1       |    2    |        3        |
| Beverage   | milk        | juice   | 7up             |
| Hobby      |              | fishing |                 |
| Job        | paramedic   |         | dancer         |

3. The fan of d&b is on the far right.
This means the person who likes d&b is in the third column.

4. The person eating papaya is in the middle.
This means the person eating papaya is in the second column.

5. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person eating cabbage.
This means the person eating cabbage is in the first or second column, and the owner of the lizard is in the third column.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The fan of d&b is the owner of the dog, and the fan of d&b is on the far right, so the third column is d&b and dog.
* The person eating papaya is in the middle, so the second column is papaya.
* The owner of the lizard is on the right of the person eating cabbage, so the person eating cabbage is in the first column, and the owner of the lizard is in the third column.

From clue 1, we know the Australian is driving the helicopter.

From clue 4, we know the British is on the left of the Australian.

From clue 5, we know the Australian is on the left of the person driving the train. This means the train driver is not the Australian.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the sailing person is in the middle (clue 3), the lacrosse person must be on the left of the sailing person.

Lv1-3x3-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
2. The owner of the rat is in the middle.
From these two clues, we can conclude that the person who's sport is soccer is on the left, and the owner of the rat is in the middle.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the owner of the snake.
Since the owner of the rat is in the middle, the owner of the snake must be on the left. Therefore, the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the owner of the snake.

4. The person drinking coffee is in the middle.
We already know that the owner of the rat is in the middle, so the person drinking coffee must be the same person.

5. The owner of the goat is the person drinking 7up.
Since the owner of the goat is not the owner of the rat (who is in the middle), the owner of the goat must be on the left.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |   1    |    2     |    3    |
| Beverage   |        |          |         |
| Pet        |        |          |         |
| Sport      |        |          |         |
#############
| 7up        | Goat   |          |         |
| Coffee     | Rat    |          |         |
| Sprite     |        | Snake    | Lacrosse |
#############

The final solution is:

The person who drinks 7up is the owner of the goat, and their sport is unknown.
The person who drinks coffee is the owner of the rat, and their sport is unknown.
The person who drinks sprite is the owner of the snake, and their sport is lacrosse."
