| Sport         | badminton| basketball| biathlon | cycling  | rowing    | rugby     | tennis    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 3, we know the person eating corn is watching comedy movies. From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person eating corn, so the person eating corn is not the one watching basketball.
2. From statement 7, we know the person eating lime is on the left of the person eating garlic. From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person eating lime is on the left of the person eating garlic, the person eating lime cannot be the one watching fantasy movies.
3. From statement 7, we know the person eating lime is on the left of the person eating garlic. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person eating lime is on the left of the person eating garlic, the person eating lime cannot be the one watching tennis or cycling.
4. From statement 17, we know the person eating cranberry is on the far left. From statement 18, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person eating cranberry. Since the person eating cranberry is on the far left, the person watching superhero movies is on the second position from the left.
5. From statement 19, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the fan of indie. From statement 14, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the right of the person eating mango. Since the person eating apple is on the right of the fan of indie, the person eating apple cannot be the one watching scientific movies.
6. From statement 15, we know the fan of soul is the person watching fantasy movies. From statement 2, we know the fan of rock is on the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the fan of soul is the person watching fantasy movies, the fan of rock cannot be the one watching fantasy movies.
7. From statement 12, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing, the person watching superhero movies cannot be the one watching tennis or cycling.
8. From statement 11, we know the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of electronic. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of electronic, the person who's sport is badminton cannot be the one watching sports movies.
9. From statement 13, we know the fan of rock is on the far right. From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the fan of trance. Since the fan of rock is on the far right, the person who's sport is basketball cannot be the one watching trance.
10. From statement 9, we know the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby, the person who's sport is badminton cannot be the one watching rugby.
