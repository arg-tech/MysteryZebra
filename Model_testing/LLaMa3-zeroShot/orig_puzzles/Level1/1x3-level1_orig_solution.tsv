Lv1-1x3-2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From statement 2, we know the dancer is on the far left, so we can fill in the first column:

|       | Dancer |        |              |

From statement 1, we know the photographer is on the far right, so we can fill in the third column:

|       | Dancer |        | Photographer |

Now, we need to figure out who is in the middle. Since there are only three jobs left (doctor, dancer, and photographer), and we already know the dancer is on the left and the photographer is on the right, the doctor must be in the middle:

|       | Dancer | Doctor | Photographer |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

| Job   |        |        |              |
