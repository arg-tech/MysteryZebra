From the puzzle, we know:

1. The person watching family movies is on the far right.
2. The person prefers 2 different movie-genres.

We can start by placing the ""family"" genre on the right side, as given:

|               |      1      |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |             |        |
|               |             | Family |

Now, we need to place the ""documentary"" genre. Since the person prefers 2 different genres, and the ""family"" genre is already on the right, the ""documentary"" genre must be on the left side.

|               | Documentary | Family |
| Movie-Genre   |             |        |

This is the final solution:

From the given information, we know:

1. The fan of house is on the far right.
2. There are 2 different music-genres: house and R&B.

We can start by placing the fan of house on the far right, as instructed:

|               |  1  |   2   |
| Music-Genre   |     |       |

Since there are only 2 music-genres, we can assume that the fan of R&B is on the left. Let's place them:

|               |  1  |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | House |

Now, we need to determine which music-genre is in each column. Since the fan of house is on the far right, House must be in column 2. Therefore, R&B must be in column 1:

|               |  1  |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | House |

#############
|               |  1  |   2   |
| Music-Genre   | R&B | House |
