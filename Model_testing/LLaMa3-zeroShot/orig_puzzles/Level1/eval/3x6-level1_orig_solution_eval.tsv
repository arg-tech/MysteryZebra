Lv1-3x6-8	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest ones first.

From statement 1, we know the fan of trance is the person eating tomato.

From statement 3, we know the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.

From statement 4, we know the fan of gospel is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Music-Genre   |           |        |          |      |           |        |

From statement 2, we know the fan of trance is on the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the fan of trance is eating tomato, the person watching musical movies must be eating something else. Let's say they're eating pear.

From statement 5, we know the person eating blueberry is on the left of the fan of electronic. Since the person eating blueberry is not eating tomato (because the fan of trance is eating tomato), they must be eating something else. Let's say they're eating eggplant.

From statement 7, we know the person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating eggplant is already eating blueberry, they must be eating pineapple.

From statement 8, we know the fan of electronic is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the person eating blueberry is on the left of the fan of electronic, they must be eating blueberry.

From statement 9, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person eating pineapple. Since the person eating pineapple is already eating eggplant, they must be watching satire movies.

From statement 10, we know the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating eggplant is already eating pineapple, they must be watching horror movies.

From statement 12, we know the person eating cherry is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is watching adventure movies, the person eating cherry must be eating something else. Let's say they're eating tomato.

Now, let's fill in the table:
