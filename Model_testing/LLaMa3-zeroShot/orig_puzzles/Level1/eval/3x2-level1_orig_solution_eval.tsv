Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish.
This means that the Turkish person is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the hot-chocolate drinker is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The Turkish is the person who's sport is Golf.
This means that the Turkish person's sport is Golf, and the other person's sport is Biathlon.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |

| Sport         |         |               |

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is either in the 1st or 2nd position. From clue 2, we know the Turkish person's sport is Golf. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Nationality   | Turkish | Egyptian    |
| Sport         | Golf    | Biathlon    |

Now, let's determine the beverage preferences. From clue 1, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish. This means the hot-chocolate drinker is the Egyptian person.

|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | Tea     | Hot-Chocolate |

Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.

This means that the person who sings is either on the left of the person watching adventure movies or is the person watching adventure movies themselves. Let's call the person who sings ""S"" and the person watching adventure movies ""A"".

2. The owner of the fish is on the far right.

This means that the person who owns the fish is either on the far right or is the person watching martial-arts movies (since the person watching adventure movies is already accounted for).

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Pet           |              |              |

From statement 1, we know that S is on the left of A. From statement 2, we know that the fish owner is on the far right. Let's assume that the fish owner is on the right, and the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left.

| Pet           |              |              |

Singing (S) is on the left of Adventure (A), so S must be in position 1. Martial-arts (M) is on the right of S, so M must be in position 2.

| Pet           |              | Fish         |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* The person watching adventure movies (A) must be the one who owns the goat, since the fish owner is already accounted for.
* The person who sings (S) must own the goat, since the fish owner is on the far right.

Lv1-3x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse.
This means that the owner of the mouse is not driving the tram. Let's call the owner of the mouse ""M"".
2. The dressmaker is on the far left.
This means that the dressmaker is either in the first column or the second column. Let's call the dressmaker ""D"".

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations:

| Transport   |            |             |

Case 1: D is in column 1, M is in column 2

* D (dressmaker) is on the far left, so D is in column 1.
* M (mouse owner) is in column 2.
* The tram driver is on the left of M, so the tram driver is in column 1.
* The bus driver is in column 2.

Case 2: D is in column 1, M is in column 1

* D (dressmaker) is on the far left, so D is in column 1.
* M (mouse owner) is also in column 1.
* The tram driver is on the left of M, so the tram driver is in column 1.
* The bus driver is in column 2.

Case 3: D is in column 2, M is in column 1

* D (dressmaker) is not on the far left, so D is in column 2.
* M (mouse owner) is in column 1.
* The tram driver is on the left of M, so the tram driver is in column 1.
* The bus driver is in column 2.

After analyzing the cases, we can conclude that:

* The dressmaker (D) is in column 1.
* The mouse owner (M) is in column 1.
* The tram driver is in column 1.
* The bus driver is in column 2.

This means that the person who drives the helicopter has a hobby that is not gardening.

Lv1-3x2-5	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The owner of the guinea-pig is the person driving the quad-bike
This means that the person in the ""Pet"" column with ""guinea-pig"" and the person in the ""Transport"" column with ""quad-bike"" are the same person.

2. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games
This means that the person in the ""Pet"" column with ""frog"" is either the first or second person from the left. Since the person with the board-games hobby is on the left of the frog owner, the board-games hobby must be in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby       | board-games | traveling |
| Pet         | frog       | guinea-pig |

The first column has the board-games hobby, and the person with the frog as a pet is on the left of the board-games person. The second column has the traveling hobby, and the person with the guinea-pig as a pet is driving the quad-bike.

Lv1-3x2-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.

This means that the person who sings must be either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person who plays basketball must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The analyst is on the far right.

This means that the analyst must be in the 3rd position.

Now, let's combine the two clues:

|         |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Hobby   |           |           |           |

| Sport   |           |           |           |

Since the analyst is on the far right, we can fill in the job column for the 3rd position:

|         |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Hobby   |           |           |           |

| Sport   |           |           |           |

Now, let's focus on the hobby column. We know that the person who sings must be on the left of the person who plays basketball. This means that the singer must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since the analyst is on the far right, the singer cannot be in the 3rd position. Therefore, the singer must be in the 1st position.

Now, let's think about the sport column. We know that the person who plays basketball must be on the right of the person who sings. This means that the basketball player must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. Since the analyst is on the far right, the basketball player cannot be in the 3rd position. Therefore, the basketball player must be in the 2nd position.

Finally, let's think about the remaining hobby and job columns. We know that the person who hikes must be in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person who is a bartender must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Since the singer is already in the 1st position, the hiker must be in the 2nd position. This means that the bartender must be in the 1st position.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving the bike. This means the person driving the bike must be in the 2nd row.

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade  |            |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific|            |
| Transport     |            | Bike      |

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells. The person drinking juice must prefer adventure movies, and the person driving the airplane must prefer scientific movies (since the person drinking lemonade prefers scientific movies).

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade  | Juice    |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Adventure|
| Transport     | Airplane | Bike      |

The final solution is:

#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Lemonade  | Juice    |
| Movie-Genre   | Scientific| Adventure|
| Transport     | Airplane | Bike      |
