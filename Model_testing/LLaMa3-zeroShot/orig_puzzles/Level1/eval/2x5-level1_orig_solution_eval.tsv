* The person eating apricot is on the left of the person driving the ship, so it must be before the person driving the ship.

Lv1-2x5-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the fish is on the left of the Argentine.
This means the Argentine is not the first person, and the fish owner is to their left.

2. The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the British.
This means the British is not the first person, and the goldfish owner is to their left.

3. The owner of the frog is the American.
This means the American is the third person (since the frog is not mentioned in the first two clues).

4. The Italian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
This means the Italian is to the left of the goldfish owner, who is already known to be on the left of the British.

5. The owner of the goldfish is in the middle.
This means the goldfish owner is the third person, which we already know is the American.

6. The owner of the dog is on the left of the American.
This means the dog owner is the second person, and the American is the third person.

Now, let's fill in the table:
