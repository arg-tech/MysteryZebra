From clue 7, we know the scientist is on the right of the bartender. Since the scientist is already placed, the bartender must be on the left of the scientist. Let's put the bartender in the first column.

|               | bartender | engineer |           |             |

From clue 8, we know the australian is on the far right. Since the Turkish is already on the far right, the australian must be the fan of ambient.

|               | bartender | engineer |           | australian |

| Pet           |            |            |           | guinea-pig |

Now we can fill in the remaining jobs:

* The firefighter is on the right of the owner of the horse, so the firefighter must be on the right of the horse.
* The owner of the horse is not yet placed, so let's put the horse owner in the third column.
* The remaining job is the engineer, which is already placed.

Here is the final solution:

Lv1-4x4-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching spy movies is on the far left.
2. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the analyst.
3. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left.
4. The indian is on the left of the french.

7. The french is on the left of the person watching drama movies.
8. The social-worker is on the right of the person watching romance movies.
9. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the teacher.

From statement 1, we know the person watching spy movies is on the far left. From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is also on the far left. Since the person watching spy movies is on the far left, the person who's sport is biathlon must be the same person.

From statement 4, we know the indian is on the left of the french. This means the french cannot be on the far left, so the french must be on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon (which is also the person watching spy movies).

From statement 5, we know the turkish is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since the person who's sport is handball is the thai (from statement 6), the turkish must be on the right of the thai.

From statement 7, we know the french is on the left of the person watching drama movies. This means the french cannot be on the far right, so the french must be in the second position from the left.

From statement 9, we know the person watching drama movies is on the right of the teacher. This means the teacher must be in the third position from the left.

From statement 8, we know the social-worker is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is not specified, we can't determine their exact position yet.

Now, let's fill in the table:

We still need to determine the movie-genre, nationality, and sport for the remaining positions. Let's analyze the remaining statements:

* Statement 2: The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the analyst. Since the analyst is not specified, we can't determine their exact position yet.
* Statement 6: The person who's sport is handball is the thai. We already know the thai is in the fourth position.
* Statement 8: The social-worker is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is not specified, we can't determine their exact position yet.

From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the analyst. Since the analyst is not specified, we can't determine their exact position yet.

From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is handball is the thai. We already know the thai is in the fourth position.

From statement 8, we know the social-worker is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching romance movies is not specified, we can't determine their exact position yet.

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

Lv1-4x4-6	"Let's start by analyzing the given information and making some deductions.

From statement 1, we know that the person eating orange is the person watching fantasy movies.

From statement 3, we know that the accountant is the person watching fantasy movies. Since the person eating orange is the person watching fantasy movies, the accountant must be eating orange.

From statement 4, we know that the owner of the horse is the person eating banana. Since the person eating banana is the person watching mystery movies (from statement 2), the owner of the horse must be watching mystery movies.

From statement 5, we know that the person watching scientific movies is the writer. Since the writer is not watching fantasy or mystery movies, they must be watching scientific movies.

From statement 6, we know that the person eating orange is on the left of the person eating blueberry. Since the accountant is eating orange, the person eating blueberry must be on the right of the accountant.

From statement 7, we know that the doctor is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the doctor is on the far left (from statement 9), the owner of the mouse must be on the second position from the left.

From statement 10, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is on the right of the accountant, the owner of the fish must be on the left of the accountant.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Note that the only remaining food option is pomegranate, which must be eaten by the doctor (since they are not eating orange, banana, or blueberry). The only remaining movie genre option is thriller, which must be watched by the dancer (since they are not watching fantasy, mystery, or scientific movies). The only remaining pet option is frog, which must be kept by the dancer (since they are not keeping horse, fish, or mouse)."	{'food': ['orange', 'blueberry', 'banana', 'pomegranate'], 'job': ['accountant', 'dancer', 'writer', 'doctor'], 'movie-genre': ['fantasy', 'mystery', 'scientific', 'thriller'], 'pet': ['horse', 'fish', 'mouse', 'frog']}	True	3	False
Lv1-4x4-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is cooking.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the bird is the person driving the scooter.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking coffee is on the far left.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking fanta.

So, the person drinking coffee is on the far left, and the person drinking fanta is to their right. This means the person drinking iced-tea must be on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking coffee, the person driving the taxi must be on the far left, which contradicts statement 8. This means statement 2 is incorrect, and we can ignore it.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

So, the order from left to right is: owner of the frog, person who's hobby is sudoku, person who's hobby is woodworking.

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the owner of the pony.

Since the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is cooking, and the owner of the bird is driving the scooter, the owner of the pony must be driving the airplane (from statement 10).

The remaining person must be driving the quad-bike or taxi. Since the taxi is already taken, the remaining person must be driving the quad-bike.
