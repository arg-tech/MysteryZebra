Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right:
This means the traveling hobby is associated with the person in the 2nd column (since the person on the far right is already taken by the designer).

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               |           |
| Job         |               |           |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   |               |           |

2. The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski:
This means the person driving the jet-ski is in the 1st column, and the person who likes soccer is in the 2nd column.

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               |           |
| Job         |               |           |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   | jet-ski      |           |

3. The designer is on the far right:
This confirms that the designer is in the 2nd column, and the person with the traveling hobby is in the 1st column.

|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | traveling    |           |
| Job         |               | designer |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   | jet-ski      |           |

Now we can fill in the remaining columns:

* The person with the writing hobby must be in the 1st column, since the person with the traveling hobby is already in the 1st column.
* The social-worker job must be in the 1st column, since the designer is already in the 2nd column.
* The person who likes volleyball must be in the 1st column, since the person who likes soccer is already in the 2nd column.
* The person who drives a bike must be in the 1st column, since the person who drives a jet-ski is already in the 1st column.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.
This means that the person who watches action movies cannot be the one who surfs, since they would be on the left of the person who snowboards. Therefore, the person who watches action movies must be the one who snowboards.

2. The entrepreneur is on the far left.
This means that the entrepreneur must be the one who drinks almond-milk, since the person who drinks lemonade is on the right of the person who watches action movies (from statement 3).

3. The person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the person who watches action movies (and snowboards) must be the one who drinks lemonade.

Now we can start filling in the table:

1. The fan of country is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk
This means that the person drinking soy-milk is not on the far left. Let's call the person drinking soy-milk ""S"".
2. The person drinking iced-tea is the person driving the taxi
This means that the person driving the taxi is not the person eating apple (since the person eating apple is on the far left). Let's call the person driving the taxi ""T"".
3. The person eating apple is on the far left
This means that the person eating apple is in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 1 again, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the fan of country. Since the person drinking iced-tea is already in the second column, the person drinking soy-milk must be in the first column. Let's call the person drinking soy-milk ""S"".

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The fan of punk is on the far left.
This means the first column is:
|               | Punk Fan |
| Beverage      |          |
| Food          |          |
| Job           |          |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     |

2. The nurse is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means the nurse is in the third column, and the person drinking iced-tea is in the second column. We can fill in the table as follows:
|               | Iced-Tea | Nurse  |
| Beverage      |          |        |
| Food          |          |        |
| Job           |          |        |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     |        |

3. The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating lemon.
This means the person eating lemon is in the second column, and the person drinking soy-milk is also in the second column. We can fill in the table as follows:
|               | Soy-Milk | Nurse  |
| Beverage      | Iced-Tea |        |
| Food          | Lemon   |        |
| Job           |          |        |
| Music-Genre   | Punk     |        |

Now we have a complete table, but we still need to fill in the job and music-genre columns. We know the nurse is in the third column, so the job column for the nurse is ""Nurse"". We also know the fan of punk is in the first column, so the music-genre column for the fan of punk is ""Punk"".

The only remaining cell is the job column for the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person eating lemon is in the second column, and the person drinking soy-milk is also in the second column, the person drinking soy-milk must be the security-guard. Therefore, the job column for the person drinking soy-milk is ""Security-Guard"".

Lv1-4x2-6	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues first.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means that the person drinking mirinda cannot be on the left, so the person drinking mirinda must be on the right.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching animation movies. This means that the person watching animation movies must be on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Sport         |           |               |

Since the person drinking mirinda is on the right, we can put mirinda in the 2nd column:

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | Milk      | Mirinda     |

| Sport         |           |               |

Since the person watching animation movies is on the left, we can put animation in the 1st column:

|               |     1     |       2       |

| Sport         |           |               |

Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table. From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. This means that the fan of techno must be in the 1st column, and the person drinking mirinda must be in the 2nd column. This also means that the person drinking milk must be in the 1st column.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching animation movies. This means that the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in the 2nd column.

Finally, we can use the remaining possibilities to fill in the music-genre and sport columns:

This means that the person who likes hip-hop must be on the left side of the table, and the person who likes cycling must be on the right side.

2. The person driving the tram is on the far right.
This means that the person driving the tram must be in the last column.

3. The person driving the tram is on the right of the person eating nectarine.
This means that the person eating nectarine must be in the second column from the left, and the person driving the tram must be in the last column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

From clue 1, we know the person who likes hip-hop is on the left, so let's put hip-hop in column 1.

From clue 3, we know the person eating nectarine is in the second column, so let's put nectarine in column 2.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the tram is on the far right, so let's put tram in column 3.

Now, we have:

From the remaining options, we can fill in the sport and food columns:

* The person who likes hip-hop must like baseball (since the person who likes cycling is on the right).
* The person eating nectarine must like cycling (since the person who likes baseball is on the left).
* The person driving the tram must like banana (since the person who likes nectarine is already taken).

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-4x2-8	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games.
This means that the person who drives the jet-ski has a hobby that is not board-games. Let's call this person ""X"". X is on the left of the person who has board-games as their hobby, so X's hobby is reading.

2. The person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur.
This means that the entrepreneur's movie genre is zombie. Since there are only two movie genres, the other person's movie genre is thriller.

3. The person watching thriller movies is on the far left.
This means that the person who watches thriller movies is either the first or second person from the left. Since the entrepreneur watches zombie movies, the person who watches thriller movies cannot be the entrepreneur. Therefore, the person who watches thriller movies is the first person from the left.

Now, let's fill in the table:

1. The teacher is on the left of the person eating cucumber.
This means the teacher is not eating cucumber, so the teacher must be eating spinach.

2. The person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
This means the teacher (who is eating spinach) is on the left of the person drinking coffee.

3. The teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
This means the teacher is not the one who plays chess, so the teacher must be the scientist.
