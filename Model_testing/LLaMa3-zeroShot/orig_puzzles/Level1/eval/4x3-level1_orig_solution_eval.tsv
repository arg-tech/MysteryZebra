From statement 1, we know that the person eating cranberry is the person drinking mirinda. Let's call the person eating cranberry ""C"" and the person drinking mirinda ""M"".

From statement 2, we know that the fan of reggae is on the far left. Let's call this person ""R"".

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the fan of blues. Since R is on the far left, the person drinking water must be to the left of R. Let's call this person ""W"".

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is the person eating pepper. Let's call this person ""P"".

From statement 5, we know that the person eating cauliflower is in the middle. Since there are only 3 people, the person eating cauliflower must be one of the remaining two people. Let's call this person ""Ca"".

From statement 6, we know that the person drinking water is the person eating pepper. This means that W = P.

From statement 7, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle. Since Ca is in the middle, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be Ca.

Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating pear is on the left of the person eating potato.
This means that the order of food is:? (pear), potato,? (radish)

2. The person eating radish is on the right of the owner of the rat.
This means that the owner of the rat is eating potato.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the italian.
This means that the italian is not eating pear (since the person eating pear is on the left of the person eating potato), so the italian must be eating potato.

4. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.
This means that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person eating radish (since the owner of the rat is eating potato).

5. The owner of the snake is on the far left.
This means that the snake owner is eating pear.

6. The owner of the snake is the brazilian.

6. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right.

From clue 1, we know the software-developer drives the bus. From clue 3, we know the dancer is on the left of the bus driver, so the dancer is on the left of the software-developer.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the subway is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the dancer is on the left of the bus driver, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the right of the dancer.

From clue 4, we know the person watching zombie movies is in the middle. Since the dancer is on the left, the person watching zombie movies must be in the middle, and the person drinking almond-milk must be on the right of the zombie movie fan.

From clue 5, we know the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the software-developer. Since the software-developer drives the bus, the person watching adventure movies must be on the left of the bus driver, which is the same as the left of the dancer.

From clue 6, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the far right. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the zombie movie fan, the person drinking mirinda must be on the far right.

Lv1-4x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of punk. This means that the fan of rock cannot be the person eating pear (since the person eating pear is the fan of rock, according to statement 4), so the person eating pear must be the fan of punk.

From statement 2, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman. This means that the fisherman cannot be the person eating pear (since the person eating pear is on the right of the fan of punk, and the fisherman is on the left of the person eating tomato), so the fisherman must be the person eating pepper.

From statement 3, we know that the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. This means that the fan of classical cannot be the person eating tomato (since the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman, and the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies), so the fan of classical must be the person eating pear (who is also the fan of punk).

From statement 4, we know that the person eating pear is the fan of rock. This means that the fan of rock is also the fan of punk, which is not possible (since they are different music genres). This is a contradiction, so we need to revisit our previous conclusions.

Let's try again:

From statement 1, we know that the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of punk. This means that the fan of rock cannot be the person eating pear (since the person eating pear is the fan of punk), so the person eating pear must be the fan of classical.

From statement 2, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman. This means that the fisherman cannot be the person eating pear (since the person eating pear is on the left of the fan of punk, and the fisherman is on the left of the person eating tomato), so the fisherman must be the person eating pepper.

From statement 3, we know that the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. This means that the fan of classical is the person eating pear (since the person eating pear is the fan of classical), and the person watching horror movies is on the right of the fan of classical.

From statement 4, we know that the person eating pear is the fan of rock. This means that the fan of rock is the person eating pear, and the fan of punk is the person eating tomato.

From statement 5, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. This means that the analyst is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

7. The fisherman is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

From statement 1, we know the fisherman watches documentary movies.

From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is on the far left. Since the nurse is the person who's hobby is video-games (statement 3), the nurse must be on the far left.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the dog is the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is not on the far left (statement 4), the person who's hobby is cooking must be on the right of the nurse.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the nurse, the owner of the hedgehog must be on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.

From statement 7, we know the fisherman is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the fisherman is watching documentary movies (statement 1), the person who's hobby is singing must be watching superhero movies (since the coach is watching superhero movies, statement 6).

From statement 1, we know the car driver is on the far right. From statement 6, we know the car driver is also the owner of the fish.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the rabbit is driving the van. Since the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching family movies (statement 5), the person watching family movies must be driving the car (since the car driver is on the far right).

Now, let's look at the hobbies. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in the middle (statement 3). Since the person watching spy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (statement 4), the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be on the far left.

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* The person watching martial-arts movies is the owner of the goat (clue 1). Since the goat owner is in the middle, this person must be in position 2.
* The owner of the lizard is the chef (initial assumption). The chef's movie genre is unknown, but since they're on the far left, they might prefer epic movies.
* The French is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (clue 6). This person must be in position 3, watching mystery movies.
* The Russian is in the middle, next to the goat owner (clue 5). The Russian's movie genre is unknown, but since they're next to the goat owner, they might prefer martial-arts movies.
* The electrician is on the far right (clue 4). The electrician's movie genre is unknown, but since they're on the far right, they might prefer epic movies.
* The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the goat (clue 3). This person must be in position 3, watching epic movies.

Here's the final solution:
