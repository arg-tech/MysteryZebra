1. The Egyptian is in the middle.
2. The Egyptian is on the left of the French.
From these two clues, we can conclude that the Egyptian is in position 4.

3. The Mexican is on the right of the Italian.
This clue doesn't give us a specific position, but it tells us that the Mexican is to the right of the Italian.

4. The Dutch is on the right of the French.
Since the Egyptian is in position 4, the French must be in position 3 (since the Egyptian is on the left of the French). Therefore, the Dutch is in position 5.

5. The Thai is on the far left.
This clue tells us that the Thai is in position 1.

6. The Nigerian is on the right of the Dutch.
Since the Dutch is in position 5, the Nigerian is in position 6.
