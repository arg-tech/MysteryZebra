#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 16, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left. Let's place them there.
2. From statement 1, we know the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching epic movies is also watching epic movies (statement 8), they must be on the far right. This means the person watching comedy movies is on the second-to-right position.
3. From statement 2, we know the person watching spy movies is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is on the right of the person watching spy movies, they must be in the third position.
4. From statement 3, we know the owner of the goat is the person watching spy movies. Since the owner of the goat is also the person who's hobby is fishing (statement 15), they must be in the third position.
5. From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far right. Since the person watching epic movies is on the far right, they must be the one with the hobby of traveling.
6. From statement 5, we know the owner of the rat is the person who's hobby is photography. Since the owner of the rat is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks (statement 6), they must be in the second position.
7. From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is photography is the person watching adventure movies. Since the owner of the rat is the person who's hobby is photography, they must be watching adventure movies.
8. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is the person who's hobby is video-games, they must be in the sixth position.
9. From statement 10, we know the person watching documentary movies is in the middle. Since the person watching documentary movies is not in the first or last position, they must be in the fourth position.
10. From statement 11, we know the person watching epic movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching epic movies is already in the far right position, the person watching spy movies must be in the second position.
11. From statement 12, we know the person watching zombie movies is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person watching zombie movies is already in the sixth position, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in the sixth position.
12. From statement 13, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is also the owner of the goat, they must be in the third position.
13. From statement 14, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is the owner of the horse. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is already in the sixth position, the owner of the horse must be in the sixth position.
14. From statement 15, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is the owner of the goat. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is already in the third position, the owner of the goat must be in the third position.

Lv1-3x7-6	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the people's preferences and transport modes:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
|-------------|-------------|-----------|
| Crime       | German      | Airplane  |
| Disaster    | Mexican     | Roller    |
| Drama       | Polish      | Car       |

| Satire      | Turkish     | Skateboard|
| Western     | Canadian    | Train     |
| Zombie      | Indonesian  | Snowmobile|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 15, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left. Since there are 7 people, the far left person must be the first one.
2. From clue 1, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Turkish is not the far left person, the motorbike driver must be the second person.
3. From clue 7, we know the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the Indonesian. Since the snowmobile driver is in the middle (clue 10), the Indonesian must be the fourth person.
4. From clue 9, we know the person watching disaster movies is the Mexican. Since the Mexican is the fourth person, the disaster movie preference is assigned to the Mexican.
5. From clue 6, we know the person driving the roller is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since the Mexican is watching disaster movies, the roller driver must be the fifth person.
6. From clue 11, we know the Mexican is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the Mexican is the fourth person, the western movie preference is assigned to the fifth person (who is not the Mexican).
7. From clue 12, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the skateboard driver is not the far left person, the satire movie preference is assigned to the second person (who is not the motorbike driver).
8. From clue 14, we know the German is on the left of the Turkish. Since the German is not the far left person, the German must be the third person.
9. From clue 4, we know the German is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the German is the third person, the airplane driver must be the fourth person (which is already assigned to the Mexican).
10. From clue 13, we know the Canadian is on the right of the Turkish. Since the Canadian is not the far left person, the Canadian must be the sixth person.
11. From clue 2, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the snowmobile driver is in the middle, the zombie movie preference is assigned to the third person (who is not the German).
12. From clue 8, we know the person driving the train is on the right of the person watching crime movies. Since the train driver is not the far left person, the crime movie preference is assigned to the first person (who is not the martial-arts movie person).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |       Fisherman       |       Journalist      |    Social-worker    |    Analyst    |     Coach      |       Police-officer       |     Doctor      |
| Food    |               |                |         |         |            |               |            |
| Job     |               |                |         |         |            |               |            |
| Sport   |       Cricket      |       Skateboarding  |    Rugby    |    Cycling    |     Skiing     |       Tennis      |     Cricket      |
| Food    |               |                |         |         |            |               |            |
| Job     |               |                |         |         |            |               |            |
| Sport   |               |                |         |         |            |               |            |
#############

The final solution is:

Fisherman: Cricket
Journalist: Skateboarding
Social-worker: Rugby
Analyst: Cycling
Coach: Skiing
Police-officer: Tennis
Doctor: Cricket

Note that the person eating grapefruit is not explicitly mentioned in the solution, but it can be inferred that the person eating grapefruit is the doctor, since the doctor is in the middle and the person eating grapefruit is on the far right."	{'food': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'job': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'sport': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
