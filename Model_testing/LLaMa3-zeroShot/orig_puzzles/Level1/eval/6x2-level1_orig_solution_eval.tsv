| Transport     |            |            |

From clue 2, we know the accountant is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the goat owner is on the far left, the roller driver must be in the second column.

| Transport     | Roller     |            |

Finally, we know there are two different pets, and the goat owner is on the far left. Since the goat owner is already in the first column, the ferret must be in the second column.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |            | Mirinda   |

Lv1-6x2-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

This means that the person who owns the hamster cannot be the one who watches documentary movies (since they're on the far left). Let's call the person who owns the hamster ""H"". Then, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the right of H.

2. The person watching documentary movies is on the far left.

This means that the person who watches documentary movies is H.

3. The person eating pumpkin is the police-officer.

This means that the police-officer is on the right of H.

4. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.

This means that the person drinking almond-milk is H.

5. The police-officer is on the far right.

This means that the police-officer is on the rightmost position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |       2        |
| Beverage      | almond-milk | coffee        |
| Food          |             | pumpkin       |
| Hobby         |             | filmmaking   |
| Job           |             | police-officer|
| Movie-Genre   | documentary | animation    |
| Pet           | hamster     | chinchilla   |
#############

Here's the solution:

* H (hamster owner) is on the far left, drinking almond-milk and watching documentary movies.
* The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of H.
* The police-officer is on the far right, eating pumpkin.
* The person who drinks coffee is on the right of the police-officer.
* The person who owns the chinchilla is on the right of the person who drinks coffee.

From clue 1, we know the videographer is on the far right. This means the videographer's column is the last one.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the far right. This means the person drinking mirinda is in the same column as the videographer.

From clue 4, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is already given in the table, we can conclude that the person eating pomegranate is in the column to the right of the motorbike.

Now, let's look at the remaining clues:
