3. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Let's call the person who's hobby is puzzles ""P"" and the person who's hobby is baking ""B"".
