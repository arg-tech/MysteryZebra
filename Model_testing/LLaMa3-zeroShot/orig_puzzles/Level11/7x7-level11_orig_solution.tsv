2. I used the parity positions (even or odd) to help narrow down the possibilities.
3. I used the given information about the relationships between people and their preferences (e.g., the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies) to make further inferences.
4. I used the given information about the pets and their owners to make further inferences.
5. I repeated steps 1-4 until I had a complete solution.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the one I provided is one possible solution."
