#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog. From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd position. Since the owner of the dog is not in an odd position, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be the owner of the dog.
2. From statement 4, we know the fan salsa is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog. From statement 5, we know the fan soul is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the fan salsa is to the left of the owner of the dog, and the fan soul is to the left of the person who's sport is climbing, we can conclude that the fan soul is to the left of the fan salsa.
3. From statement 8, we know the owner of the chinchilla and the person eating eggplant have the same parity positions. From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is cricket and the person eating eggplant have different parity positions. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be the person who's sport is cricket.
4. From statement 16, we know the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog. Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be on the left of the owner of the dog.
5. From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is parkour is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. From statement 13, we know the person who's sport is parkour is the fan salsa or the person who's sport is parkour is the person who's hobby is reading or both. Since the fan salsa is to the left of the owner of the dog, and the owner of the dog is not in an odd position, the person who's sport is parkour must be the person who's hobby is reading.
6. From statement 20, we know the fan salsa is on the left of the fan gospel. From statement 21, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the fan salsa is to the left of the fan gospel, and the person who's hobby is fishing is to the left of the person who's sport is swimming, we can conclude that the fan gospel is to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
7. From statement 24, we know the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. From statement 25, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is not the person who's sport is rowing. Therefore, the person eating eggplant must be the person who's sport is rowing.
8. From statement 26, we know the person eating pear is the owner of the dog or the person eating pear is the fan gospel, but not both. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person eating pear must be the fan gospel.
9. From statement 28, we know the person eating pumpkin is the person who's hobby is woodworking or the person eating pumpkin is the person who's sport is climbing or both. From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person who's sport is parkour. Therefore, the person eating pumpkin must be the person who's hobby is woodworking.
10. From statement 30, we know the person eating radish is on the right of the fan house. From statement 31, we know the person eating cauliflower is in an odd position. Therefore, the person eating radish must be in an even position.
11. From statement 32, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the fan indie or the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog, but not both. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person who's sport is swimming must be the fan indie.
12. From statement 34, we know the person eating spinach is the fan soul or the fan soul is the owner of the mouse, but not both. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person eating spinach must be the fan soul.

By combining these conclusions, we can arrive at the final solution table."
