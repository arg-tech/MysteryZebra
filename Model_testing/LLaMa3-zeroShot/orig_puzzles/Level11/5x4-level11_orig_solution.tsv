Therefore, the person eating lemon must be the person drinking iced-tea.
3. From statement 4, we know the person watching mystery movies and the fan folk have the same parity positions.

From statement 10, we know the fan country is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the fan disco is not the person who's hobby is card-games, the fan disco must be the person watching adventure movies.

Lv1-5x4-6	"I'd be happy to help you solve the logic puzzle! After analyzing the clues, I've arrived at the following solution:

#############
|            |     1      |       2       |      3      |       4       |

| Sport      |  Biathlon  |  Parkour    |  Ice-hockey |  Badminton   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the pilot is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. From clue 9, we know the pilot is not to the right of the person eating apricot. Therefore, the pilot must be in position 4.
* From clue 2, we know the musician is to the right of the person drinking juice. From clue 14, we know the person drinking juice is either the person with the hobby puzzles or the person eating grapefruit. Since the musician is to the right of the person drinking juice, the musician must be in position 3.
* From clue 3, we know the person eating apricot and the person with the hobby traveling have the same parity positions. From clue 4, we know the person with the hobby board-games and the manager have the same parity positions. Since the manager is in an odd position (clue 17), the person eating apricot must be in an even position. Therefore, the person eating apricot must be in position 2.
* From clue 5, we know the person eating grapefruit is not the person who's sport is badminton. From clue 8, we know the person eating grapefruit is not the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 1.
* From clue 10, we know the person eating grapefruit is on the left or right of the musician. Since the musician is in position 3, the person eating grapefruit must be in position 1 or 3. However, we already know the person eating grapefruit is in position 1, so this clue is redundant.
* From clue 11, we know the person eating apricot is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person eating apricot is in position 2, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in position 3 or 4. However, we already know the musician is in position 3, so the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be in position 4.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is in position 2, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 3 or 4. However, we already know the musician is in position 3, so the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 4.
* From clue 13, we know the musician is to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 2, the musician must be in position 3.
* From clue 14, we know the person drinking juice is either the person with the hobby puzzles or the person eating grapefruit. Since the person eating grapefruit is in position 1, the person drinking juice must be in position 2.
* From clue 15, we know the scientist is not to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the scientist is in position 1, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 2 or 3. However, we already know the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 2, so the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in position 3.
* From clue 16, we know the person eating corn is not to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person eating corn is not mentioned in any other clues, it must be in position 4.
* From clue 18, we know the person eating potato is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking lemonade. Since the person eating potato is not mentioned in any other clues, it must be in position 2.
* From clue 20, we know the person drinking juice is to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 4.
* From clue 21, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person eating potato. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is not mentioned in any other clues, it must be in position 1.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the Australian drinks juice. From statement 14, we know the Australian is on the right of the Japanese, so the Australian must be in position 4.
2. From statement 3, we know the person who does parkour is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. From statement 1, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right, so the person doing parkour must be in position 1.
3. From statement 4, we know the person who does rowing is somewhere to the right of the fan of house music. From statement 17, we know the fan of house music is either the person driving the taxi or the person driving the taxi is the person who does rowing.

7. From statement 11, we know the fan of country music is not to the left of the person doing volleyball. From statement 15, we know the person doing volleyball is on the far left or far right, so the fan of country music must be in position 1, and the person doing volleyball must be in position 4.
8. From statement 12, we know the person driving the taxi is not to the left of the person doing rowing. From statement 17, we know the fan of house music is either the person driving the taxi or the person driving the taxi is the person who does rowing, so the fan of house music must be in position 2, and the person doing rowing must be in position 3.
9. From statement 13, we know the Spanish is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea. From statement 18, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking tea, so the Spanish must be in position 2.
10. From statement 19, we know the Japanese is somewhere to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. From statement 4, we know the person doing rowing is somewhere to the right of the fan of house music, so the Japanese must be in position 3.
