Lv1-5x3-3	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

| Sport         | Tennis   | Water-polo| Badminton   |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Taxi     | Car         |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person driving the car plays badminton. From statement 2, we know the coach is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the coach is not driving the car (badminton player is), the coach must be driving the taxi.
2. From statement 4, we know the mechanic is either watching musical movies or is German. Since the mechanic is not driving the car (statement 3), the mechanic must be watching musical movies.
3. From statement 5, we know the mechanic and Russian have different parity positions. Since the mechanic is watching musical movies, the Russian must be watching martial-arts movies (statement 6).
4. From statement 7, we know the person watching water-polo and the person driving the car have different parity positions. Since the person driving the car plays badminton, the person watching water-polo must be the German.
5. From statement 8, we know the person watching musical movies is between the person driving the taxi and the person watching horror movies. Since the coach is driving the taxi, the person watching musical movies must be the mechanic, and the person watching horror movies must be the lawyer.
6. From statement 9, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is not German. Since the Russian is watching martial-arts movies, the Spanish must be watching horror movies.
7. From statement 10, we know the mechanic is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the mechanic is watching musical movies, the lawyer must be on the right side of the mechanic.
8. From statement 11, we know the coach is the person who's sport is tennis or the person who's sport is tennis is the person driving the jet-ski, but not both. Since the coach is driving the taxi, the person driving the jet-ski must be the person playing tennis, which is the Russian.
9. From statement 12, we know the Spanish is on the far left or far right. Since the Spanish is watching horror movies, the Spanish must be on the far left.
10. From statement 14, we know the mechanic is the German or the mechanic is the person driving the car, but not both. Since the mechanic is watching musical movies, the mechanic must be the German.

The solution is unique, and all statements are satisfied."

Lv1-5x3-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 2, we know the fan of country music is on the far right.

From statement 4, we know the fan of country music is either the person who plays lacrosse or the person who drives a car, or both. Since the fan of country music is on the far right, and there are only three people, we can conclude that the fan of country music is the person who drives a car.

From statement 3, we know the person who drives a jet-ski is on the right of the person who eats spinach. Since the fan of country music is on the far right, the person who drives a jet-ski must be on the second-to-last position.

From statement 1, we know the person who plays tennis is between the person who eats pepper and the person who plays rugby. Since the person who drives a jet-ski is on the second-to-last position, the person who plays tennis must be on the third position.

From statement 5, we know the person who eats spinach and the person who watches musical movies have the same parity positions. Since the person who drives a jet-ski is on the second-to-last position, the person who eats spinach must be on the second position.

From statement 6, we know the person who drives a motorbike and the person who watches satire movies have the same parity positions. Since the person who drives a jet-ski is on the second-to-last position, the person who drives a motorbike must be on the last position.

From statement 7, we know the person who drives a motorbike is either the person who watches drama movies or the person who is a fan of rock music, but not both. Since the person who drives a motorbike is on the last position, and the fan of country music is on the far right, the person who drives a motorbike must be the fan of rock music.

From statement 8, we know the fan of disco is either the person who plays rugby or the person who drives a jet-ski, or both. Since the person who drives a jet-ski is on the second-to-last position, the fan of disco must be the person who plays rugby.

From statement 9, we know the person who watches satire movies and the fan of disco have different parity positions. Since the person who drives a motorbike is on the last position, and the fan of disco is on the second-to-last position, the person who watches satire movies must be on the first position.

From statement 10, we know the person who plays tennis is on the right of the person who watches satire movies. Since the person who plays tennis is on the third position, the person who watches satire movies must be on the first position.

From statement 11, we know the fan of country music is not the person who watches drama movies. Since the fan of country music is the person who drives a car, and the person who drives a car is not the person who watches drama movies, the person who watches drama movies must be the person who drives a motorbike.

From statement 12, we know the person who eats spinach is not the person who drives a jet-ski. Since the person who eats spinach is on the second position, and the person who drives a jet-ski is on the second-to-last position, the person who eats spinach must be the person who eats papaya.
