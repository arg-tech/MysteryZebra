Lv1-4x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 16, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is the person drinking cola.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.

From statement 11, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the owner of the frog and the owner of the bird.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog, the owner of the frog must be on the right of the person drinking cola.

From statement 1, we know the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is card-games (from statement 16), and the person drinking cola is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be on the right of the person drinking cola.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku, the person driving the bus must be to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla or the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is card-games or both. Since the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is card-games (from statement 16), the person drinking juice must be the owner of the chinchilla.

From statement 14, we know the person drinking juice is the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means the person drinking juice is also the owner of the chinchilla and has the hobby of sudoku.

From statement 12, we know the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the person driving the tram. Since the person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla and has the hobby of sudoku, the person driving the tram must be to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

From statement 15, we know the person driving the tram is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This means the person driving the tram must be to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking sprite is in an odd position. Since the person drinking juice is in an even position (to the right of the person drinking cola), the person drinking sprite must be in the first position.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is card-games, the person driving the boat must be the person who's hobby is collecting (from statement 9).

From statement 13, we know the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's hobby is sudoku or the owner of the chinchilla is the person driving the tram, but not both. Since the person drinking juice is the owner of the chinchilla and has the hobby of sudoku, the person driving the tram cannot be the owner of the chinchilla.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-4x4-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
|               |     1     |     2      |      3       |       4        |

| Music-Genre   |  Metal    |  Pop      |  Reggae     |  Salsa       |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 5, we know the doctor is either the person drinking mirinda or the person eating blueberry. Since the doctor is not the person drinking mirinda (from statement 5), the doctor must be the person eating blueberry.
2. From statement 7, we know the fan reggae is either the person eating avocado or the person drinking mirinda. Since the doctor is the person eating blueberry (from statement 1), the doctor cannot be the fan reggae. Therefore, the fan reggae must be the person eating avocado.
3. From statement 6, we know the fan reggae is on the left of the photographer. Since the fan reggae is the person eating avocado, the photographer must be on the right of the person eating avocado.
4. From statement 15, we know the dressmaker is between the person drinking 7up and the fan metal. Since the fan metal is on the right of the fan salsa (from statement 4), the dressmaker must be between the person drinking 7up and the fan salsa.
5. From statement 10, we know the person drinking coffee is either the person eating onion or the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa is on the right of the fan metal (from statement 4), the fan salsa cannot be the person drinking coffee. Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be the person eating onion.
6. From statement 12, we know the person eating potato is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is the doctor (from statement 5), the person eating potato must be on the left or right of the doctor.
7. From statement 13, we know the person eating blueberry is on the left of the person eating potato. Since the person eating blueberry is the doctor (from statement 1), the doctor must be on the left of the person eating potato.
8. From statement 14, we know the person eating blueberry is not the person drinking lemonade. Since the person eating blueberry is the doctor (from statement 1), the doctor cannot be the person drinking lemonade. Therefore, the person drinking lemonade must be someone else.
9. From statement 1, we know the person drinking lemonade and the dressmaker have different parity positions. Since the dressmaker is between the person drinking 7up and the fan metal (from statement 15), the person drinking lemonade must be on the other side of the dressmaker.
10. From statement 2, we know the fan pop and the person drinking mirinda have different parity positions. Since the person drinking mirinda is the doctor (from statement 5), the fan pop must be on the other side of the doctor.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
Lv1-4x4-3	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

| Pet           | Bird    | Dog    | Cat      | Horse     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is the fan pop or the owner of the dog. Since the fan pop is already taken by statement 14, the person who's hobby is dancing must be the owner of the dog.
2. From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is dancing (owner of the dog) is to the left of the owner of the cat. This means the owner of the cat is in position 3 or 4.
3. From statement 3, we know the fan rock and the owner of the cat have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the cat is in an odd position (3 or 4), the fan rock must be in an odd position as well.

10. From statement 12, we know the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This confirms the previous conclusion that the person drinking mirinda is in position 3.
11. From statement 14, we know the fan pop is to the right of the fan rock. This means the fan rock is in position 1.
12. From statement 15, we know the owner of the horse is not to the left of the fan pop. This confirms the previous conclusion that the owner of the horse is in position 2.
13. From statement 16, we know the person drinking 7up is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. This confirms the previous conclusion that the person drinking 7up is in position 2.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking Fanta is on the far right.

From clue 3, we know the architect is either the person who's sport is snowboarding or the person who's sport is snowboarding is the person drinking Fanta, but not both. Since the person drinking Fanta is on the far right, the architect cannot be the person drinking Fanta. Therefore, the architect must be the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking Fanta is on the left or right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is on the right of the person who's sport is handball, the person drinking Fanta must be on the right of the Brazilian.

Since the Brazilian is on the right of the person who's sport is handball, the person who's sport is handball cannot be the Brazilian. Therefore, the person who's sport is handball must be the person drinking Sprite.

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is rugby and the pilot have the same parity positions. This means the pilot and the person who's sport is rugby must be on the same side of the table.

#############
|             |     1     |    2     |       3       |     4     |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the ship is not the person who's hobby is reading (statement 13), the person who's hobby is skydiving must be on the far left.
2. From statement 6, we know the owner of the turtle is the person driving the subway or the owner of the turtle is the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the far left, the owner of the turtle must be the person driving the subway.
3. From statement 12, we know the person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the turtle is the person driving the subway, the owner of the ferret must be to the right of the person driving the subway.
4. From statement 5, we know the owner of the ferret is somewhere between the owner of the snake and the person driving the roller. Since the owner of the ferret is to the right of the person driving the subway, the owner of the snake must be to the left of the person driving the subway.
5. From statement 8, we know the fisherman is somewhere between the owner of the snake and the paramedic. Since the owner of the snake is to the left of the person driving the subway, the fisherman must be to the right of the person driving the subway.
6. From statement 10, we know the paramedic is the person driving the roller or the paramedic is the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the paramedic is not the person driving the subway (statement 1), the paramedic must be the person driving the roller.
7. From statement 14, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the lawyer (statement 4), the person who's hobby is cooking must be the musician.
8. From statement 15, we know the owner of the ferret is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing or the owner of the ferret is the person driving the roller. Since the paramedic is the person driving the roller, the owner of the ferret must be the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
9. From statement 3, we know the owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the owner of the fish must be the person who's hobby is reading.
10. From statement 13, we know the person driving the ship is the person who's hobby is reading or the person who's hobby is reading is the lawyer. Since the person who's hobby is reading is not the lawyer (statement 4), the person driving the ship must be the person who's hobby is reading.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
