#############
| Movie-Genre | Nationality | Pet           |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|
| Documentary | American    | Chinchilla    |
| Epic        | Italian     | Hedgehog     |
| Family      | German      | Rabbit       |
| Fantasy     | Argentine   | Frog         |

| Superhero   | Colombian   | Horse        |
| Time-Travel | Canadian    | Rat          |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1 and 17, we know the Colombian and the person watching fantasy movies have different parity positions. Since the Colombian is not to the right of the Colombian (clue 26), the Colombian must be on the left.
2. From clue 19, the American is on the far left. From clue 1, the Colombian is on the left, so the American must be in the first position.
3. From clue 4, the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the American. Since the American is in the first position, the owner of the hedgehog must be in the second or third position.
4. From clue 8, the owner of the frog is not to the left of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is not in the first position (clue 19), the owner of the frog must be in the fourth or fifth position.
5. From clue 10, the Argentine is in an odd position. Since the American is in the first position, the Argentine must be in the third position.
6. From clue 11, the person watching time-travel movies is the Canadian or the owner of the horse. Since the Canadian is not in the first position, the owner of the horse must be in the first position.
7. From clue 12, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the Colombian is on the left, the person watching documentary movies must be in the second position.
8. From clue 13, the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the Russian. Since the Russian is not in the first position (clue 19), the person watching superhero movies must be in the fifth or sixth position.
9. From clue 14, the owner of the pony is the person watching time-travel movies or the Italian is the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the horse is in the first position (clue 11), the owner of the pony must be the Italian.
10. From clue 15, the person watching superhero movies and the owner of the pony have different parity positions. Since the owner of the pony is the Italian, the person watching superhero movies must be in an even position.
11. From clue 16, the American is not the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in the first position, the American must be in the second position.
12. From clue 20, the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since the person watching documentary movies is in the second position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in an odd position.
13. From clue 21, the person watching epic movies is on the far right. Since the person watching epic movies is not in the first position, the person watching epic movies must be in the seventh position.
14. From clue 22, the owner of the frog is not to the left of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in the third position, the owner of the frog must be in the fourth or fifth position.
15. From clue 23, the Canadian is somewhere to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the fourth position, the Canadian must be in the fifth or sixth position.
16. From clue 24, the person watching family movies is the German or the German is the owner of the hedgehog, but not both. Since the German is not in the first position, the German must be in the third position.
17. From clue 25, the German is not to the left of the Italian. Since the German is in the third position, the Italian must be in the fourth position.
18. From clue 27, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is in the second position, the owner of the chinchilla must be in the first position.
19. From clue 28, the Italian and the owner of the pony have different parity positions. Since the owner of the pony is the Italian, the Italian must be in an even position.
20. From clue 29, the owner of the frog is not the person watching spy movies. Since the owner of the frog is in the fourth or fifth position, the person watching spy movies must be in the sixth or seventh position.
21. From clue 30, the Russian is on the far left or far right. Since the Russian is not in the first position, the Russian must be in the seventh position.
22. From clue 31, the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in the fifth or sixth position, the person watching fantasy movies must be in the sixth or seventh position.
23. From clue 32, the person watching time-travel movies and the owner of the frog have different parity positions. Since the owner of the frog is in the fourth or fifth position, the person watching time-travel movies must be in an odd position.

By combining these clues, we can arrive at the final solution table."
