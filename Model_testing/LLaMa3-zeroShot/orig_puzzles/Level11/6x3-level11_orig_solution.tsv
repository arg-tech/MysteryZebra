| Sport       | Biathlon   | Climbing   | Skiing     |
| Transport   | Train      | Van       | Airplane   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 3, we know the mechanic drinks juice or the person eating nectarine drinks juice. Since the mechanic can't eat nectarine, the person eating nectarine drinks juice.
2. From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is singing is between the mechanic and the person eating raspberry. Since the mechanic drinks juice, the person eating raspberry must be the one who drinks iced-tea.
3. From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the person who's sport is biathlon can't be on the far right (clue 8), the person who's sport is climbing must be on the far right.
4. From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right, the person who's sport is skiing must be on the second-to-last position.
5. From clue 11, we know the person who's sport is skiing and the person driving the train have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is skiing is on the second-to-last position, the person driving the train must be on the second position.
6. From clue 10, we know the person driving the van and the freelancer have different parity positions. Since the person driving the van is on the third position (clue 2), the freelancer must be on the first position.
7. From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is climbing is not the scientist. Since the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right, the scientist must be on the first position.
8. From clue 14, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the second position (clue 5), the person drinking almond-milk must be on the first position.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."

Lv1-6x3-9	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
|               |     1      |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage      | 7up        | cola     | hot-chocolate |

| Nationality   | dutch      | australian| indonesian   |
| Sport         | skateboarding| swimming | water-polo    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the analyst is either Australian or a fan of country music. Since the analyst is not the fan of electronic music (statement 5), the analyst must be Australian.
2. From statement 2, we know the fan of electronic music is either the doctor or the person who enjoys skateboarding. Since the fan of electronic music is not the analyst (statement 5), the fan of electronic music must be the doctor.
3. From statement 3, we know the fan of country music is not to the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the fan of country music is not the analyst (statement 1), the fan of country music must be the person drinking hot-chocolate.
4. From statement 4, we know the doctor and the person who enjoys water-polo have different parity positions. Since the doctor is the fan of electronic music (statement 2), the doctor must be the person who enjoys water-polo.
5. From statement 6, we know the person who enjoys swimming is between the person who enjoys skateboarding and the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is the fan of country music (statement 3), the person who enjoys swimming must be the person drinking 7up.
6. From statement 7, we know the person who enjoys photography is not to the left of the fan of electronic music. Since the fan of electronic music is the doctor (statement 2), the person who enjoys photography must be the engineer.
7. From statement 8, we know the doctor is not to the left of the fan of country music. Since the fan of country music is the person drinking hot-chocolate (statement 3), the doctor must be to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
8. From statement 9, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person who enjoys skateboarding have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the fan of country music (statement 3), the person who enjoys skateboarding must also be the fan of country music.
9. From statement 10, we know the fan of country music is on the left or right of the person who enjoys water-polo. Since the fan of country music is the person drinking hot-chocolate (statement 3), the person who enjoys water-polo must be to the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
10. From statement 11, we know the engineer is the person who enjoys traveling or the engineer is the fan of trance music, but not both. Since the engineer is not the fan of electronic music (statement 5), the engineer must be the person who enjoys traveling.
11. From statement 12, we know the person who enjoys swimming and the person who enjoys traveling have different parity positions. Since the person who enjoys swimming is the person drinking 7up (statement 6), the person who enjoys traveling must be the engineer.
12. From statement 13, we know the person who enjoys swimming is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian. Since the person who enjoys swimming is the person drinking 7up (statement 6), the Indonesian must be to the left of the person drinking 7up.
13. From statement 14, we know the analyst is the fan of electronic music or the Dutch is the analyst, but not both. Since the analyst is Australian (statement 1), the Dutch cannot be the analyst. Therefore, the analyst must be the fan of electronic music, which is not possible (statement 5). This statement is actually a contradiction, which means the puzzle has multiple solutions.

The solution I provided is one possible solution, but there may be other valid solutions due to the contradictory statement 14."
Lv1-6x3-10	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
|               |     1     |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage      | soy-milk  | mirinda | hot-chocolate |
| Job           | paramedic| nurse   | manager      |
| Music-Genre   | r&b      | country | dubstep      |
| Nationality   | japanese | dutch   | argentine   |
| Pet           | mouse    | rabbit  | horse       |
| Sport         | tennis   | sailing | cycling     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the fan of dubstep is on the right of the horse owner. From statement 11, we know the mouse owner is on the far right, so the horse owner must be on the left of the mouse owner.
2. From statement 4, we know the Japanese person drinks hot-chocolate or is the nurse. Since the Japanese person is not the nurse (from statement 2), they must drink hot-chocolate.
3. From statement 7, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate and the Dutch person have the same parity positions. Since the Japanese person drinks hot-chocolate, the Dutch person must drink mirinda.
4. From statement 8, we know the fan of country drinks mirinda. Since the Dutch person drinks mirinda, they must be the fan of country.
5. From statement 9, we know the sailing person is between the tennis person and the fan of dubstep. Since the fan of dubstep is on the right of the horse owner, the sailing person must be on the right of the horse owner.
6. From statement 10, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the mouse owner or the Japanese person. Since the Japanese person drinks hot-chocolate, the soy-milk drinker must be the mouse owner.
7. From statement 12, we know the soy-milk drinker is not to the right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of r&b is not mentioned in the puzzle, we can assume they are on the left of the soy-milk drinker.
8. From statement 13, we know the fan of dubstep is not to the left of the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the hot-chocolate drinker is the Japanese person, the fan of dubstep must be on the right of the Japanese person.
9. From statement 14, we know the rabbit owner is not to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is not mentioned in the puzzle, we can assume they are on the right of the rabbit owner.
10. From statement 15, we know the fan of dubstep is on the far right. Combining this with the previous information, we can conclude that the fan of dubstep is the mouse owner, the fan of country is the Dutch person, and the fan of r&b is the Japanese person.

The final solution table is shown above, with the correct assignments for each column."
