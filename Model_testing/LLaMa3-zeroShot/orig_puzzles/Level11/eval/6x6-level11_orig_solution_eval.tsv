Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the clues that mentioned specific positions (e.g. #2, #4, #5, etc.). This helped me to establish a rough outline of the table.
2. I then used the clues that mentioned specific pairs or groups of people (e.g. #5, #12, #15, etc.). This helped me to fill in more of the table.
3. I used the clues that mentioned specific beverages, jobs, nationalities, pets, sports, and transports (e.g. #1, #3, #6, etc.). This helped me to fill in the remaining gaps in the table.
4. I checked the solution to make sure it was consistent with all the clues. If it wasn't, I went back and re-solved the puzzle.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the one I provided is one possible solution."	{'beverage': ['sprite', 'almond-milk', 'juice', 'soy-milk', 'cola', '7up'], 'job': ['pilot', 'manager', 'fisherman', 'social-worker', 'bartender', 'firefighter'], 'nationality': ['japanese', 'dutch', 'argentine', 'indonesian', 'spanish', 'pakistani'], 'pet': ['bird', 'cat', 'lizard', 'mouse', 'horse', 'turtle'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'golf', 'soccer', 'basketball', 'snowboarding', 'tennis'], 'transport': ['helicopter', 'scooter', 'ship', 'subway', 'taxi', 'tram']}	True	8	False

4. From statement 25, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is the person driving the trike. From statement 28, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person who's hobby is card-games have different parity positions. Therefore, the person who's hobby is card-games is not the person driving the trike.
5. From statement 26, we know the person driving the motorbike is not the person who's sport is lacrosse. From statement 10, we know the person driving the motorbike is the person watching zombie movies or the person drinking mirinda, but not both. Therefore, the person driving the motorbike is the person drinking mirinda.
6. From statement 15, we know the fan gospel is not to the right of the person who's hobby is singing. From statement 33, we know the fan gospel is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the fan gospel is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
7. From statement 16, we know the person drinking sprite is not to the right of the person watching family movies.

Therefore, the person drinking sprite is between the person who's hobby is card-games and the person drinking tea.
8. From statement 19, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person drinking mirinda. From statement 38, we know the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Therefore, the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person drinking mirinda.
9. From statement 29, we know the fan trance is not the person who's hobby is camping.

10. From statement 30, we know the person drinking mirinda is between the person watching zombie movies and the person who's sport is tennis.
