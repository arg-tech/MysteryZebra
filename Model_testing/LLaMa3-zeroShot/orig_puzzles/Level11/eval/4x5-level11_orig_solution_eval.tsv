Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 8, we know the owner of the goat is the australian.
* From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is rowing is the australian or the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat is already identified, the person who's sport is rowing must be the australian.
* From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is the british.
* From clue 18, we know the british is somewhere to the right of the australian, so the british must be in position 3.
* From clue 2, we know the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the colombian. Since the colombian is not in position 1, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2.

* From clue 7, we know the fan funk is in the middle, so the fan funk must be in position 2.

* From clue 16, we know the colombian is the owner of the fish or the owner of the fish is the fan salsa, but not both. Since the colombian is not in position 1, the owner of the fish must be the fan salsa, and the colombian must be in position 4.
* From clue 22, we know the fan salsa and the pakistani have the same parity positions. Since the fan salsa is in position 3, the pakistani must be in position 5.
* From clue 23, we know the fan classical is the person who's sport is rowing or the pakistani is the fan classical or both. Since the fan classical is not already identified, the pakistani must be the fan classical, and the pakistani must be in position 5.

* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat is in position 2, the person who's sport is golf must be in position 4.
* From clue 11, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is not already identified, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 1, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 1.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 10, we know the owner of the chinchilla is the Argentine.
2. From statement 20, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the Argentine is the owner of the chinchilla, the owner of the pony must be on the other side of the Argentine.
3. From statement 27, we know the Italian is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the Italian is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (statement 2), the person who's hobby is traveling must be on the right of the Italian.
4. From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the left of the Italian.
5. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere between the owner of the horse and the owner of the fish. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the Italian, the owner of the horse must be on the left of the Italian, and the owner of the fish must be on the right of the Italian.

7. From statement 22, we know the owner of the fish is the Russian or the person driving the subway is the owner of the fish or both. Since the Russian is already driving the tram, the person driving the subway must be the owner of the fish.
8. From statement 19, we know the Russian and the owner of the cat have different parity positions. Since the Russian is driving the tram, the owner of the cat must be on the other side of the tram.
9. From statement 16, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person driving the scooter must be on the left of the Italian.

12. From statement 25, we know the owner of the fish is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the fish is already on the left of the Australian, the owner of the fish must be on the far left.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 10, we know the doctor drinks water or the person watching epic movies drinks water. Since the doctor is not watching epic movies (from clue 22), the doctor must drink water.
2. From clue 13, we know the librarian drinks milk.
