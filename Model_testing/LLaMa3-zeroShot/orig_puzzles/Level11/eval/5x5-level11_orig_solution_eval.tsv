#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is not the person eating corn (statement 22), the person who's sport is snowboarding must be on the right of the person eating corn.
8. From statement 16, we know that the fan d&b is not to the left of the manager. Since the fan d&b is the person who's sport is skateboarding (statement 17), the manager must be on the right of the fan d&b.
9. From statement 18, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is on the far left. Since the person eating lemon is on the far left (statement 12), the person eating lemon must be the person who's sport is tennis.
10. From statement 20, we know that the person eating corn is not to the right of the fan hip-hop. Since the person eating corn is in the middle (statement 15), the fan hip-hop must be on the right of the person eating corn.

16. From statement 28, we know that the person driving the bus is in an odd position. Since the person driving the bus is the fan salsa (statement 2), the fan salsa must be in the middle.
17. From statement 29, we know that the coach is on the right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic is on the left of the bus (statement 23), the coach must be on the right of the bus.

1. From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is reading is the owner of the horse. From clue 5, we know this person is on the far left or far right. Since the horse is not the first or last pet, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is reading is in position 2 or 4.

7. From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's sport is biathlon have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in an even position, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in an odd position. Therefore, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 3.
8. From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is not to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in an even position, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in an odd position to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Therefore, the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 1.
9. From clue 13, we know the turkish is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the turkish is in position 2, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 3 or 4.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know that the fan of folk music is either the person who eats avocado or the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the fan of folk music is in an even position (statement 8), and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position (statement 3), the fan of folk music must be the person who eats avocado.

Since the fan of punk music is on the far left (statement 14), and the person who's hobby is drawing is not on the far left (statement 1), the fan of punk music must be the person who eats pomegranate.
3. From statement 7, we know that the person who eats avocado is either the fan of jazz music or the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who eats avocado is already assigned to the fan of folk music, and the fan of jazz music is not the person who's hobby is photography (statement 1), the person who eats avocado must be the fan of jazz music.
4. From statement 12, we know that the fan of gospel music has the same parity position as the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the fan of gospel music is on the left of the person who eats pomegranate (statement 26), and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position, the fan of gospel music must be in an even position.
5. From statement 13, we know that the person who eats avocado (fan of jazz music) has the same parity position as the person who watches disaster movies. Since the person who watches disaster movies is in an odd position (statement 9), the person who eats avocado must be in an even position, which contradicts the previous conclusion. Therefore, the person who eats avocado must be the fan of jazz music, and the person who watches disaster movies must be the fan of gospel music.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 4, the Canadian is in the middle, so they must be in position 3.
2. From clue 5, the person watching family movies is the owner of the horse, so they must be in position 5.
3. From clue 10, the person driving the snowmobile is between the owner of the hedgehog and the Mexican, so the Mexican must be in position 2.
4. From clue 22, the Colombian is between the Brazilian and the Mexican, so the Colombian must be in position 1.
5. From clue 28, the Colombian and the owner of the horse have different parity positions, so the owner of the horse must be in an even position. Since the Canadian is in position 3, the owner of the horse must be in position 2.
6. From clue 14, the person who's sport is lacrosse is the person driving the bus or the owner of the hedgehog, so the person driving the bus must be the one who's sport is lacrosse.
7. From clue 12, the person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing, so the person who's sport is skiing must be in position 5.
8. From clue 21, the person who's sport is skiing is to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, so the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 4.
9. From clue 16, the person driving the helicopter is to the right of the person watching sports movies, so the person watching sports movies must be in position 1.
10. From clue 29, the person driving the helicopter is in an even position, so they must be in position 2.
11. From clue 6, the person driving the helicopter is the owner of the turtle or the person who's sport is skateboarding, but not both. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.
12. From clue 17, the person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the turtle have different parity positions, so the owner of the turtle must be in an odd position. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.
13. From clue 27, the person who's sport is badminton is to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, so the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 4.
14. From clue 18, the person who's sport is badminton is to the right of the person driving the car, so the person driving the car must be in position 1.
15. From clue 19, the person watching family movies is to the right of the owner of the frog, so the owner of the frog must be in position 2.
16. From clue 20, the person watching epic movies and the person driving the snowmobile have different parity positions, so the person driving the snowmobile must be in an odd position. Since the person driving the snowmobile is between the owner of the hedgehog and the Mexican, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 3.
17. From clue 25, the person who's sport is cricket and the person driving the helicopter have different parity positions, so the person driving the helicopter must be in an even position. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 2, the person who's sport is cricket must be in position 1.
18. From clue 26, the person driving the snowmobile is not to the left of the person who's sport is skiing, so the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 4.
19. From clue 30, the owner of the frog and the person who's sport is skateboarding have the same parity positions, so the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in an odd position. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is in position 4, the owner of the frog must be in position 3.
20. From clue 31, the Colombian is not to the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 1.
