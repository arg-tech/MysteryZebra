Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clues 1 and 3, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is cooking is either the person who's sport is weightlifting or the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the quad-bike is also the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 1), we can eliminate the weightlifting option.
* From clue 2, we know that the person watching documentary movies is the owner of the bird or the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 23), the fan of metal must be the person watching documentary movies.
* From clue 4, we know that the person who's hobby is writing and the person watching spy movies have different parity positions. Since the person watching spy movies is not the person who's hobby is writing (from clue 13), the person watching spy movies must be the person who's hobby is gardening.
* From clue 5, we know that the person driving the car and the owner of the bird have different parity positions. Since the owner of the bird is the person watching documentary movies (from clue 2), the person driving the car must be the person who's hobby is cooking.
* From clue 6, we know that the fan of rock is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person who's sport is parkour is in an odd position (from clue 7), the fan of rock must be in an even position.
* From clue 8, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 1), the person driving the ship must be the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
* From clue 9, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person driving the ship (from clue 8), the person driving the quad-bike must be the person who's hobby is cooking.
* From clue 10, we know that the person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person driving the ship (from clue 8), the person driving the airplane must be the person who's hobby is gardening.
* From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting and the fan of blues have different parity positions. Since the fan of blues is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 23), the fan of blues must be the person who's hobby is writing.
* From clue 12, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is the person watching spy movies (from clue 4), the person who's sport is biathlon must be the person who's hobby is writing.
* From clue 13, we know that the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person who's sport is rowing is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 1), the person watching spy movies must be the person who's hobby is gardening.

* From clue 15, we know that the owner of the rat is somewhere between the owner of the goat and the fan of blues. Since the fan of blues is the person who's hobby is writing (from clue 11), the owner of the rat must be between the owner of the goat and the person who's hobby is writing.
* From clue 16, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 1), the person who's sport is biathlon must be the person who's hobby is writing.
* From clue 17, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic is not the person who's hobby is cooking (from clue 23), the fan of electronic must be the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
* From clue 18, we know that the person driving the airplane is the person who's sport is biathlon or the person who's hobby is gardening is the person driving the airplane or both.
