Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Mexican is somewhere to the left of the engineer.
This means the Mexican cannot be the engineer, and the engineer must be to the right of the Mexican.

2. The Colombian is between the Japanese and the owner of the snake.
This means the Colombian is to the right of the Japanese and to the left of the owner of the snake.

3. The Japanese is the lawyer.
This means the Japanese has the job of lawyer.

4. The engineer is the Japanese or the engineer is the owner of the rat or both.
This means the engineer is either the Japanese (who is already known to be the lawyer) or the owner of the rat.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1    |     2     |    3     |
| Job           |         |           |          |
| Nationality   |         |           |          |
| Pet           |         |           |          |
#############

From clue 1, we know the Mexican is to the left of the engineer. Let's assume the Mexican is in position 1.

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is between the Japanese and the owner of the snake. Since the Japanese is the lawyer (clue 3), the Colombian must be in position 2. The owner of the snake must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the engineer is either the Japanese or the owner of the rat. Since the Japanese is already taken by the lawyer, the engineer must be the owner of the rat. Let's put the engineer in position 2.

Now we have:

#############

| Nationality   | Colombian| Japanese | Mexican  |
| Pet           |         | Rat      | Snake    |
#############

The solution is:

1. The Egyptian is somewhere between the teacher and the fan of metal.
This means the Egyptian is either to the left of the teacher or to the right of the fan of metal.

2. The security-guard is the fan of techno or the fan of techno is the Colombian or both.
This means the security-guard is either the fan of techno or the Colombian is the fan of techno.

3. The Egyptian is on the left of the fan of techno.
This means the Egyptian is to the left of the fan of techno, which is either the security-guard or the Colombian.

4. The accountant is on the left or right of the Indian.
This means the accountant is either to the left or to the right of the Indian.

5. The accountant is on the left or right of the security-guard.
This means the accountant is either to the left or to the right of the security-guard.

Now, let's combine the clues and try to find a possible solution:

| Nationality   |                |            |           |

From clue 1, we know the Egyptian is between the teacher and the fan of metal. Let's assume the Egyptian is to the left of the teacher.

From clue 3, we know the Egyptian is on the left of the fan of techno. Since the Egyptian is already to the left of the teacher, the fan of techno must be to the right of the teacher.

From clue 2, we know the security-guard is the fan of techno or the fan of techno is the Colombian. Since the fan of techno is already to the right of the teacher, the security-guard must be the fan of techno.

From clue 4, we know the accountant is on the left or right of the Indian. Let's assume the accountant is to the right of the Indian.

From clue 5, we know the accountant is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the accountant is already to the right of the Indian, the accountant must be to the left of the security-guard.

1. The person watching documentary movies and the scientist have the same parity positions##9
This means that the scientist and the person watching documentary movies are either both odd or both even.

2. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the scientist##5
This means that the scientist is to the left of the skateboard driver.

3. The nurse is in the middle
This means that the nurse is in the second position.

4. The person watching action movies is the person driving the train or the person driving the train is the scientist or both1
This means that the train driver is either the person watching action movies or the scientist.

5. The person driving the skateboard is on the right of the person watching spy movies
This means that the person watching spy movies is to the left of the skateboard driver.

6. The person driving the skateboard and the scientist have different parity positions##9
This means that the scientist is even and the skateboard driver is odd, or vice versa.

Now, let's combine the clues to get the final solution:

|               |     1     |     2      |       3        |
| Job           |           |            |                |

| Movie-Genre   | Spy      | Documentary | Action        |
| Transport     | Skateboard | Train      | Helicopter    |
#############

Here's the explanation:

* The nurse is in the middle (2nd position), so the scientist is to the left of the nurse.
* The person watching documentary movies is the scientist, and they have the same parity positions##9 as the scientist, so the scientist is even.
* The person driving the skateboard is odd, and they are to the right of the scientist.
* The person watching spy movies is to the left of the skateboard driver, so they are in the 1st position.
* The person watching action movies is the train driver, and they are either the scientist or the person watching action movies is the train driver.
* Since the scientist is even, the train driver is the person watching action movies.
* The helicopter driver is the security-guard, as they are the only one left.

The final solution is:

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching family movies and the person drinking water have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The Colombian is between the Indonesian and the person drinking water.
This means that the Colombian is either to the left of the Indonesian or to the right of the person drinking water.

3. The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the Indonesian.
This means that the person watching horror movies is either to the left of the Indonesian or in the same position as the Indonesian.

4. The person watching family movies is the Italian or the person watching family movies is the person drinking lemonade or both.
This means that the Italian is watching family movies, or the person drinking lemonade is watching family movies, or both.

5. The person watching epic movies is the Indonesian.
This means that the Indonesian is watching epic movies.

6. The Italian is not the person drinking almond-milk.
This means that the Italian is drinking either water or lemonade.

7. The Italian and the person watching horror movies have different parity positions.
This means that the Italian is even and the person watching horror movies is odd, or vice versa.

8. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the person drinking almond-milk is either to the left of the Italian or to the left of the person drinking lemonade.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      |         |             |            |

| Nationality   |         |             |            |

From statement 5, we know the Indonesian is watching epic movies. From statement 2, we know the Colombian is between the Indonesian and the person drinking water. Since the Colombian is not watching epic movies, they must be watching family movies (from statement 4). This means the Italian is watching family movies.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the Italian is not drinking almond-milk (from statement 6), the Italian must be drinking either water or lemonade. If the Italian is drinking water, then the person drinking lemonade must be the one watching horror movies (from statement 7). But this would mean the Italian is even and the person watching horror movies is odd, which contradicts statement 7. Therefore, the Italian must be drinking lemonade.

Now we have:

|               |    1    |      2      |     3      |

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is climbing is the person eating grapes.

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the taxi. Since the person eating grapes is the person who's sport is climbing, this means the person driving the taxi is either to the left or right of the person eating grapes.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means the person who's sport is lacrosse is either to the left of the person eating grapes or to the right of the person eating grapes.

From statement 8, we know the person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person eating grapes. This means the person eating pomegranate is either the person driving the ship or the person who's sport is badminton (from statement 6).

From statement 2, we know the person driving the ship and the person who's sport is badminton have the same parity positions. This means the person driving the ship is either the person eating pomegranate or the person who's sport is badminton.

From statement 1, we know the person driving the ship is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike. This means the person driving the bike is either to the left of the person eating grapes or to the left of the person eating pomegranate.

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person eating grapes is the person who's sport is climbing, this means the person driving the ship is either to the left or right of the person eating grapes.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating grapes is the person who's sport is climbing.
* The person driving the taxi is either to the left or right of the person eating grapes.
* The person who's sport is lacrosse is either to the left or right of the person eating grapes.
* The person eating pomegranate is either the person driving the ship or the person who's sport is badminton.

Lv1-3x3-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is either the person eating strawberry or the photographer, or both.

From statement 5, we know that the person eating strawberry is the person drinking soy-milk. This means that the person drinking soy-milk is the person eating strawberry.

From statement 2, we know that the person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the person eating strawberry, the person drinking juice must be on the left of the person eating strawberry.

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking juice is on the right of the coach. This means that the coach is on the left of the person drinking juice.

From statement 7, we know that the coach is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the coach is on the left of the person drinking juice, and the person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry, the coach must be on the left of the journalist.

From statement 8, we know that the journalist is on the left or right of the coach. Since the coach is on the left of the journalist, the journalist must be on the right of the coach.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From the above deductions, we can conclude that:

* The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry.
* The person drinking juice is on the right of the coach.
* The coach is on the left of the journalist.
* The journalist is on the right of the coach.
* The person eating strawberry is the person drinking soy-milk.

Now, let's try to fill in the remaining cells:

* The person drinking soy-milk is the person eating strawberry, so the person eating strawberry must be in position 2.
* The person drinking juice is on the left of the person eating strawberry, so the person drinking juice must be in position 1.
* The coach is on the left of the journalist, so the coach must be in position 1.
* The journalist is on the right of the coach, so the journalist must be in position 3.

From statement 1, we know the Mexican is on the left or right of the Argentine. Let's assume the Mexican is to the right of the Argentine for now.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person drinking cola. This means the order of the beverages is either: cola, 7up, milk or cola, milk, 7up.

From statement 3, we know the Mexican's hobby is card-games. This doesn't give us any new information about the beverage or nationality.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking 7up. This means the order of the beverages is: cola, 7up, milk.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking cola is either the person who's hobby is writing or the person who's hobby is writing is the Indian or both. Since the Mexican's hobby is card-games, the person drinking cola cannot be the Mexican. Therefore, the person drinking cola must be the Indian or the person who's hobby is writing.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking 7up is to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the Indian's hobby is not writing, the person drinking 7up must be the Mexican.

From statement 7, we know the Mexican is between the person who's hobby is puzzles and the Indian. This means the Mexican's hobby is puzzles, and the Indian's hobby is writing.

From statement 1, we know the Canadian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli. Let's assume the Canadian is on the right of the broccoli eater. We'll come back to this assumption later.

From statement 2, we know the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching sports movies. This means the person watching sports movies must be on the left of the animation movie watcher.

From statement 3, we know the person watching sports movies is in an odd position. Since there are only 3 positions (1, 2, and 3), the person watching sports movies must be in position 1 or 3.

From statement 4, we know the Canadian is the person watching sports movies or the Canadian is the person eating spinach or both. Since we already assumed the Canadian is on the right of the broccoli eater, and the Canadian is watching sports movies, we can conclude that the Canadian is in position 1, watching sports movies.

From statement 5, we know the Indian is not to the left of the Indian. This means the Indian must be in position 2 or 3.

From statement 6, we know the person eating peas is on the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 2 or 3, the person eating peas must be in position 3.

From statement 7, we know the person eating spinach is on the left of the Indian. Since the Indian is in position 2 or 3, the person eating spinach must be in position 1.

Now, let's summarize what we have:

* Canadian (position 1) watches sports movies
* Indian (position 2) eats? (we'll come back to this)
* Person eating peas (position 3)
* Person eating spinach (position 1)

From statement 1, we know the Canadian is on the right of the person eating broccoli. Since the Canadian is in position 1, the person eating broccoli must be in position 2.

1. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.

This means that the owner of the chinchilla must be on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

2. The person driving the bike is between the person driving the taxi and the person drinking milk.

This means that the person driving the bike is on the left of the person drinking milk, and the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person drinking milk.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person driving the bike.

This means that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person driving the bike, which is already known to be on the left of the person drinking milk. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking milk.

4. The person driving the taxi is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

This means that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person driving the taxi.

5. The owner of the horse and the person driving the van have the same parity positions.

This means that either both are on the left or both are on the right. Since the owner of the horse is not mentioned yet, we can't conclude anything yet.

6. The person drinking milk is the owner of the horse or the person drinking milk is the person driving the van or both.

This means that the person drinking milk is either the owner of the horse or the person driving the van, or both.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person driving the taxi.
* The person driving the bike is between the person driving the taxi and the person drinking milk.
* The person drinking milk is either the owner of the horse or the person driving the van, or both.

From the above, we can conclude that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking milk, which means the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk (since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person driving the taxi, and the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk).

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is either the person who's sport is soccer or the person who's hobby is camping is the person drinking milk, but not both. Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the card-games person, and the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games, the person who's hobby is camping must be the person who's sport is soccer.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. This means that the person who's hobby is writing must be on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (since the person who's hobby is camping is the person who's sport is soccer).

From statement 6, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is the person who's hobby is card-games, the person drinking soy-milk must be on the left of the card-games person.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Beverage   | soy-     | milk      | lemonade |
| Hobby      | writing | card-games| camping  |
| Sport      | badminton| biathlon  | soccer   |
#############

The final solution is:

* The person drinking soy-milk has writing as their hobby.
* The person drinking milk has card-games as their hobby.
* The person drinking lemonade has camping as their hobby.
* The person who's hobby is camping plays soccer.
* The person who's hobby is writing plays badminton.
* The person who's hobby is card-games plays biathlon."	{'beverage': ['soy-', 'milk', 'lemonade'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'card-games', 'camping'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'biathlon', 'soccer']}	True	3	False
