Lv1-3x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the Brazilian is in an even position, so they can't be in position 1 or 3.

From statement 2, we know the person watching family movies and the person drinking Fanta have the same parity positions. Since the Brazilian is in an even position, the person watching family movies must also be in an even position.

From statement 3, we know the Brazilian is the person watching martial-arts movies or the person watching martial-arts movies is the person drinking juice, but not both. Since the Brazilian is in an even position, they can't be the person drinking juice. Therefore, the person watching martial-arts movies must be the person drinking juice.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking juice and the person watching western movies have different parity positions. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is the person drinking juice, they must be in an odd position. Therefore, the person watching western movies must be in an even position.

From statement 5, we know the Indian is not to the left of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is in an even position, the Indian must be in an odd position.

From statement 6, we know the person watching family movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching family movies is in an even position, they must be in position 2.

From statement 7, we know the person watching family movies is the person drinking cola or the person drinking cola is the Nigerian or both. Since the person watching family movies is in position 2, the person drinking cola must be in position 1.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the Russian. Since the Russian can't be in position 1 (because the Nigerian is), the Russian must be in position 4.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking cola is in position 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3 or 4.

From statement 10, we know the person watching thriller movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching western movies is in an even position, the person watching thriller movies must be in an odd position.

From statement 11, we know the Indian is between the person watching western movies and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the Indian is in an odd position, the person watching western movies must be in position 4, and the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.

From statement 12, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 4.

From statement 13, we know the person watching martial-arts movies and the person drinking Fanta have different parity positions. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is the person drinking juice, they must be in an odd position. Therefore, the person drinking Fanta must be in an even position.

From statement 9, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the owner of the cat.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking 7up is the owner of the horse or the person who's sport is volleyball or both.

Since the person drinking 7up is volleyball, the person who's sport is climbing must be between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From statement 6, we know the owner of the fish is somewhere between the person who's sport is climbing and the owner of the horse. Since the person who's sport is climbing is between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is snowboarding, the owner of the fish must be between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the person drinking 7up is volleyball, the owner of the hedgehog must be on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

From statement 9, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the person who's sport is volleyball, the owner of the cat must be on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball.

Lv1-3x4-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From statement 2, we know that the fan of salsa is either the person who's hobby is fishing or the person drinking fanta, but not both. Let's assume the fan of salsa is the person who's hobby is fishing (we can come back to this assumption later).

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking mirinda is either the person who's hobby is traveling or the fan of dubstep is the person drinking mirinda or both. Since the fan of dubstep is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk (statement 7), the fan of dubstep cannot be the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, the person drinking mirinda must be the person who's hobby is traveling.

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is traveling, the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be the person who's hobby is reading.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the fan of salsa is the person who's hobby is fishing, the person who's hobby is board-games must be to the left of the fan of salsa.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is reading, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be between the fan of salsa and the person drinking mirinda.

From statement 7, we know that the fan of dubstep is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, the fan of dubstep must be to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From statement 8, we know that the fan of salsa is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is traveling, the fan of salsa must be to the right of the person drinking mirinda.

From statement 9, we know that the fan of funk and the person who's hobby is reading have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is reading, the fan of funk must also be the person who's hobby is reading.

From statement 10, we know that the fan of trance is on the left or right of the fan of funk. Since the fan of funk is the person who's hobby is reading, the fan of trance must be either the person who's hobby is reading or the person who's hobby is board-games.

From statement 11, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is reading, the person who's hobby is board-games must be to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From statement 12, we know that the fan of dubstep is somewhere to the right of the fan of trance. Since the fan of trance is either the person who's hobby is reading or the person who's hobby is board-games, the fan of dubstep must be to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.

Now, let's summarize the information:

* The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
* The fan of salsa is the person who's hobby is fishing.
* The person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is traveling.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate is the person who's hobby is reading.

Lv1-3x4-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 5, we know the person drinking cola is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Let's call this person R.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming. Let's call the person drinking fanta F.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is handball is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Let's call the person drinking sprite S.

From statement 1, we know the person drinking cola (R) is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball. This means S is to the left of R.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since R is rock-climbing, which is not fishing, the person drinking coffee must be to the right of R.

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is cricket is in an even position. Since there are only 4 positions, this means the person who's sport is cricket is either in position 2 or 4.

From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's sport is cricket have different parity positions. This means the person who's hobby is fishing is in an odd position.

From statement 10, we know the person who's hobby is writing and the person who's sport is cricket have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is writing is in an even position (due to statement 6), the person who's sport is cricket must also be in an even position.

From statement 12, we know the person drinking fanta is the person who's sport is cricket or the person who's sport is cricket is the person who's hobby is writing. Since the person who's sport is cricket is in an even position, and the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming, the person drinking fanta must be the person who's sport is cricket.

From statement 13, we know the person who's sport is handball and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions. Since the person who's sport is handball is in an odd position (due to statement 1), the person drinking coffee must also be in an odd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From the above analysis, we can fill in the table as follows:

* Position 1: S (sprite) - sport is handball
* Position 2: F (fanta) - sport is cricket
* Position 3: R (cola) - hobby is rock-climbing
* Position 4: C (coffee) - hobby is writing or fishing

Note that the person who's hobby is fishing is in an odd position (due to statement 8), so it must be the person drinking coffee. The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position (due to statement 10), so it must be the person drinking fanta.

Lv1-3x4-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 14, we know the fan reggae is the Canadian.

From statement 15, we know the fan jazz is either the Spanish or the person watching fantasy movies, but not both. Since the Canadian is already taken by the fan reggae, the fan jazz cannot be the Canadian. Therefore, the fan jazz must be the Spanish.

From statement 13, we know the person watching fantasy movies is either the Indian or the fan jazz (Spanish). Since the fan jazz is already taken, the person watching fantasy movies must be the Indian.

From statement 9, we know the person watching fantasy movies (Indian) is on the left of the fan jazz (Spanish).

From statement 12, we know the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies (Indian). Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be on the right of the Indian.

From statement 2, we know the person watching drama movies is not to the right of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is already taken by the fan reggae, the person watching drama movies cannot be to the right of the Canadian. Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be on the right of the Indian.

From statement 7, we know the person watching adventure movies is not to the right of the Pakistani. Since the Pakistani is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position of the person watching adventure movies yet.

From statement 5, we know the Pakistani and the fan d&b have the same parity positions. Since the fan d&b is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position of the Pakistani yet.

From statement 10, we know the fan d&b is not to the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is already placed, we can conclude that the fan d&b is either on the left of the Indian or on the same position as the Indian.

From statement 3, we know the person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching epic movies is the fan reggae (Canadian), and the Canadian is already placed, the person watching epic movies must be on the far left.

From statement 6, we know the fan reggae (Canadian) is the person watching epic movies. Therefore, the Canadian is on the far left.

From statement 11, we know the Spanish (fan jazz) is on the left or right of the fan reggae (Canadian). Since the Canadian is on the far left, the Spanish (fan jazz) must be on the second position from the left.

From statement 1, we know the Canadian is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies (Indian). Since the Canadian is on the far left, the person watching fantasy movies (Indian) must be on the third position from the left.

From statement 8, we know the person watching drama movies is on the left of the fan reggae (Canadian). Since the Canadian is on the far left, the person watching drama movies must be on the fourth position from the left.

Lv1-3x4-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Let's call the person watching animation movies ""A"" and the person driving the airplane ""P"".

From statement 2, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking 7up. This means that A is to the right of the person drinking 7up, and P is to the left of the person drinking 7up.

From statement 3, we know that the person driving the boat is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Let's call the person driving the boat ""B"" and the person watching adventure movies ""Ad"".

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking fanta and the person watching zombie movies have different parity positions. This means that either the person drinking fanta is even and the person watching zombie movies is odd, or vice versa.

From statement 5, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the snowmobile. Let's call the person drinking soy-milk ""Sm"" and the person driving the snowmobile ""Sn"".

From statement 6, we know that the person watching adventure movies is in an even position. This means that Ad is in an even position.

From statement 7, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the person drinking coffee. Let's call the person watching drama movies ""Dr"" and the person drinking coffee ""C"".

From statement 8, we know that the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. This means that Ad is to the left of Dr.

From statement 9, we know that the person watching adventure movies is the person drinking soy-milk or the person driving the snowmobile is the person watching adventure movies or both. This means that either Ad = Sm or Ad = Sn or both.

From statement 10, we know that the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the van have different parity positions. This means that Ad and the person driving the van have different parity positions.

Now, let's combine the information:

* A is to the right of the person drinking 7up
* P is to the left of the person drinking 7up
* Ad is in an even position
* Ad is to the left of Dr
* Ad is not the person driving the van
* Either Ad = Sm or Ad = Sn or both

Here's a possible solution:

Lv1-3x4-9	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've found the solution. Here it is:

#############

| Beverage      |  Tea    |  Juice |  Fanta |  Cola   |
| Food          |  Kale   |  Lettuce|  Radish|  Eggplant|
| Music-Genre   |  Rock   |  D&B   |  Disco |  Trance |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the fan of disco drinks fanta. From statement 5, we know the fan of disco and the person eating lettuce have the same parity positions. Since the fan of disco drinks fanta, the person eating lettuce must drink fanta as well.
2. From statement 6, we know the person eating radish is between the person eating lettuce and the person drinking juice. Since the person eating lettuce drinks fanta, the person eating radish must drink juice.
3. From statement 7, we know the person drinking tea is the fan trance or the person eating eggplant, but not both. Since the person drinking juice is not the person eating lettuce (statement 13), the person drinking juice must be the fan trance. This means the person drinking tea is the fan of rock (since the fan of rock is not the fan of disco or trance).
4. From statement 8, we know the person eating kale is the fan rock or the person drinking fanta is the person eating kale or both. Since the person drinking fanta is the fan of disco (statement 2), the person eating kale must be the fan of rock.
5. From statement 11, we know the fan of rock is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish drinks juice, the fan of rock must be in position 4.
6. From statement 3, we know the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is the fan trance, the person eating eggplant must be in position 3.
7. From statement 4, we know the fan of trance is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of rock. Since the fan of rock is in position 4, the fan of trance must be in position 2.
8. From statement 1, we know the person drinking juice and the fan of trance have different parity positions. Since the person drinking juice is the fan trance, the person drinking juice must be in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3). This means the person drinking tea (the fan of rock) must be in position 2.
9. Finally, we can fill in the remaining positions: the person eating kale (the fan of rock) is in position 1, and the person eating lettuce (who drinks fanta) is in position 4.

The resulting table is the one shown above, surrounded by the ############# markers."	{'beverage': ['tea', 'juice', 'fanta', 'cola'], 'food': ['kale', 'lettuce', 'radish', 'eggplant'], 'music-genre': ['rock', 'd&b', 'disco', 'trance']}	True	4	False

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* The owner of the ferret is to the left of the fan of funk, so the ferret is in position 1.
* The owner of the fish is to the right of the fan of funk, so the fish is in position 4.
* The owner of the turtle is between the fan of funk and the person who's sport is handball, so the turtle is in position 3.
* The fan of trance is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of d&b, so the fan of trance is in position 2.
* The person who's sport is sailing is to the left of the fan of electronic, so the person who's sport is sailing is in position 2.
* The owner of the lizard has the same parity position as the fan of funk, so the lizard is in position 2.
* The person who's sport is rugby is not in position 2, so the person who's sport is rugby is in position 4.
* The person who's sport is volleyball is not in position 2, so the person who's sport is volleyball is in position 3.
