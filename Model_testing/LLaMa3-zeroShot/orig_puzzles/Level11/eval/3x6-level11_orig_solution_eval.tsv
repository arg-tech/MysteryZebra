| Sport   | parkour   | surfing    | water-polo | cycling  | golf    | baseball  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 3, we know the owner of the goldfish and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the mouse (statement 4), the person who's sport is cycling must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
2. From statement 7, we know the person eating plum is the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the owner of the mouse, the person eating plum must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
3. From statement 9, we know the owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the mouse (statement 11), the owner of the turtle must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
4. From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is golf is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini. Since the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating carrot (statement 19), the person who's sport is golf must be on the left of the person eating carrot.
5. From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person eating strawberry (statement 20), the person who's sport is parkour must be on the left of the person eating strawberry.
6. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is parkour is not to the right of the person eating papaya. Since the person who's sport is parkour is on the left of the person eating strawberry, the person eating papaya must be on the right of the person eating strawberry.
7. From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is parkour is not to the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person eating carrot, the person who's sport is parkour must be on the left of the person eating carrot.
8. From statement 21, we know the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the mouse, the owner of the turtle must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
9. From statement 22, we know the owner of the dog is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the owner of the dog is on the right of the owner of the mouse, the owner of the dog must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
10. From statement 23, we know the person eating plum is the owner of the dog or the person eating plum is the person who's sport is cycling or both. Since the person eating plum is the person who's sport is cycling, the owner of the dog must be on the right of the owner of the mouse.
11. From statement 25, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is in an odd position. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person eating zucchini, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 5.

By combining these statements, we can deduce the final solution:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is parkour is to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since skateboarding is not mentioned in the solution, we can conclude that parkour is on the right.
* From statement 2, we know the project-manager is a fan of gospel or the fan of gospel is the person who's sport is parkour. Since parkour is on the right, the project-manager must be a fan of gospel.
* From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the software-developer. Since software-developer is on the right, biathlon must be on the left.
* From statement 5, we know the fan of ambient is to the right of the entrepreneur. Since entrepreneur is on the left, ambient must be on the right.
* From statement 6, we know the project-manager is not to the left of the software-developer. Since project-manager is already known to be on the left, software-developer must be on the right.
* From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is cycling is not to the left of the nurse. Since nurse is on the right, cycling must be on the left.
* From statement 8, we know the fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of country. Since country is not mentioned in the solution, we can conclude that rock is on the left.
* From statement 9, we know the fan of gospel is to the left of the fan of ambient. Since ambient is on the right, gospel must be on the left.
* From statement 10, we know the nurse and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions. Since nurse is on the right, cycling must be on the right as well.
* From statement 11, we know the fan of rock is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since ice-hockey is on the right, rock must be on the right as well.
* From statement 12, we know the engineer is not to the right of the fan of ambient. Since engineer is on the left, ambient must be on the right.
* From statement 13, we know the fan of rock is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since cycling is on the left and ice-hockey is on the right, rock must be in the middle.
* From statement 14, we know the software-developer and the fan of indie have the same parity positions. Since software-developer is on the right, indie must be on the right as well.
* From statement 15, we know the fan of country and the dancer have different parity positions. Since dancer is on the left, country must be on the right.
* From statement 16, we know the fan of ambient is between the fan of gospel and the person who's sport is cycling. Since gospel is on the left and cycling is on the left, ambient must be on the left as well.
* From statement 17, we know the dancer is the fan of techno. Since techno is on the right, dancer must be on the right.
* From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is to the right of the fan of techno. Since techno is on the right, ice-hockey must be on the right as well.
* From statement 19, we know the fan of indie is on the left or right of the fan of ambient. Since ambient is on the left, indie must be on the left as well.
* From statement 20, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left or right of the engineer. Since engineer is on the left, biathlon must be on the left as well.
* From statement 21, we know the dancer is not the person who's sport is biathlon. Since biathlon is on the left, dancer must be on the right.
* From statement 22, we know the engineer is not to the left of the entrepreneur. Since engineer is already known to be on the left, entrepreneur must be on the left as well.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1 and 2, we know the person who's sport is handball is not the person driving the ship, and the owner of the cat has a different parity position from the person who's sport is handball.
2. From clue 3, we know the owner of the dog is on the right of the person driving the ship. Since the ship is driven by someone who's not handball, it must be driven by someone who's sport is skiing or weightlifting.
3. From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the owner of the dog is on the right of the ship, the owner of the dog must be the person who's sport is soccer.
4. From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the owner of the dog is on the right of the ship, the owner of the guinea-pig must be the person who's sport is weightlifting.
5. From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is handball is not to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person who's sport is handball is not the person driving the ship, the person who's sport is handball must be the owner of the cat.
6. From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the owner of the dog is on the right of the ship, the owner of the dog must be the person who's sport is soccer.
7. From clue 8, we know the person driving the quad-bike and the owner of the guinea-pig have the same parity position. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is the person who's sport is weightlifting, the person driving the quad-bike must be the owner of the guinea-pig.
8. From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is rugby is on the far left. Since the owner of the goat is the person driving the subway or the person who's sport is rugby is the owner of the goat, the owner of the goat must be the person who's sport is rugby.
9. From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the car. Since the owner of the dog is on the right of the ship, the owner of the dog must be the person who's sport is soccer.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 21, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is either the person drinking coffee or the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right side (from clue 16), the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be on the left side.
2. From clue 12, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in an odd position. Since the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left side, it must be in position 1.
3. From clue 14, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is between the person drinking tea and the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's hobby is camping is not the person drinking tea (from clue 23), it must be in position 2.
4. From clue 24, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person drinking coffee. Since the person who's sport is tennis is not the person drinking coffee (from clue 26), it must be in position 4.
5. From clue 18, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person who's sport is cycling is not in position 1 (from clue 2), it must be in position 6.
6. From clue 15, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 6, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 5.
7. From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person who's sport is cycling is in position 6, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.
8. From clue 20, we know that the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's sport is cycling have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is baking is not in position 1 (from clue 17), it must be in position 3.
9. From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person who's hobby is baking is in position 3, the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 4.
10. From clue 25, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the far left. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is not in position 3 (from clue 3), it must be in position 1.
11. From clue 22, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling and the person who's sport is ice-hockey have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is not in position 1 (from clue 25), it must be in position 5.
12. From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is rugby and the person drinking tea have different parity positions. Since the person drinking tea is in position 2, the person who's sport is rugby must be in position 6.
13. From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is tennis and the person drinking 7up have different parity positions. Since the person drinking 7up is in position 1, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 4.
14. From clue 10, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is not the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 4.
15. From clue 19, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person who's sport is rugby is in position 6, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 5.
16. From clue 27, we know that the person who's hobby is camping and the person drinking lemonade have different parity positions. Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 3, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 2.
17. From clue 1, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 2, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 5, the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.
18. From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is traveling is not the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is in position 5, the person who's sport is cycling must be in position 6.
