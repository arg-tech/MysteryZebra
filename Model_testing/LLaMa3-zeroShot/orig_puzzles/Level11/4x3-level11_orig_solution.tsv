Lv1-4x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of disco and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions.
2. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far left.
3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk.
4. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
5. The fan of disco is the designer or the designer is the person drinking mirinda, but not both.
6. The fan of rock and the person drinking coffee have different parity positions.
7. The person drinking mirinda is the doctor or the person drinking mirinda is the fan disco or both.
8. The doctor and the fan disco have different parity positions.
9. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the designer.
10. The journalist is on the left of the fan rock.

From statement 2, we know the person with sudoku as their hobby is on the far left. Let's call this person P1.

From statement 3, we know the person with rock-climbing as their hobby is either on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since P1 is already on the far left, the person with rock-climbing as their hobby must be on the right of P1. Let's call this person P2.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since P2 is already on the right of P1, the person drinking coffee must be on the right of P2. Let's call this person P3.

From statement 5, we know the fan of disco is either the designer or the person drinking mirinda, but not both. Since the designer can't be the person drinking mirinda (statement 5), the fan of disco must be the person drinking mirinda. Let's call this person P4.

From statement 6, we know the fan of rock and the person drinking coffee have different parity positions. Since P3 is drinking coffee, the fan of rock must be someone else. Let's call this person P5.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking mirinda is the doctor or the person drinking mirinda is the fan disco or both. Since P4 is already the fan of disco, the person drinking mirinda must be the doctor. Let's call this person P6.

From statement 8, we know the doctor and the fan disco have different parity positions. Since P6 is the doctor and P4 is the fan of disco, they must have different parity positions.

From statement 9, we know the person with rock-climbing as their hobby is on the left of the designer. Since P2 is already on the right of P1, P2 must be the designer.

From statement 10, we know the journalist is on the left of the fan rock. Since P5 is the fan of rock, the journalist must be on the left of P5.

Now that we have all the information, we can fill in the table:

From statement 4, we know the architect and the person eating peas have the same parity positions. Since the architect is not mentioned yet, we can assume the architect is eating peas.

From statement 6, we know the person eating peas is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person eating peas is already placed, the person drinking lemonade must be on the far left.

From statement 7, we know the dancer is the person eating peas or the dancer is the owner of the fish or both. Since the person eating peas is already placed, the dancer must be the owner of the fish.

| Transport   |             | snowmobile | van      |

Now, let's place the person drinking coffee. From statement 5, we know the person drinking coffee is either the person who's hobby is traveling or the owner of the bird, or both. Since the singer's hobby is not traveling, the singer cannot be the coffee drinker. Therefore, the coffee drinker must be the owner of the bird. Let's place the bird owner on the left of the singer:

|             |      1      |       2       |     3     |
| Beverage    |             | hot-chocolate |           |
| Hobby       | singing    |               |           |
| Pet         | bird       | lizard       |           |
| Transport   |             | snowmobile | van      |

The only remaining spot is the person driving the snowmobile, who is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the goat owner is not the lizard owner, the goat owner must be the person driving the snowmobile. Let's place the goat owner on the right of the hot-chocolate drinker:

|             |      1      |       2       |     3     |
| Beverage    |             | hot-chocolate |           |
| Hobby       | singing    |               |           |
| Pet         | bird       | lizard       |           |
| Transport   |             | goat         | van      |

The final solution is:
