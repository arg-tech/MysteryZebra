Since the fan salsa is in position 2 or 5, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 3 or 6.
5. From clue 22, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person eating cauliflower. From clue 23, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person eating cauliflower is in position 5, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 1 or 3.

7. From clue 31, we know the person driving the ship and the person who's hobby is drawing have different parity positions. From clue 32, we know the musician is the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the ship and the person who's hobby is drawing have different parity positions, the person driving the ship must be in an odd position.
8. From clue 34, we know the pilot is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. From clue 36, we know the malaysian is the pilot. Since the pilot is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla, the malaysian must be in position 6.
9. From clue 38, we know the person driving the scooter and the electrician have different parity positions. From clue 39, we know the bartender and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since the person driving the scooter and the electrician have different parity positions, the person driving the scooter must be in an even position.
10. From clue 40, we know the entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel. From clue 46, we know the pilot and the fan gospel have the same parity positions. Since the entrepreneur is to the left of the fan gospel, the entrepreneur must be in an odd position.
