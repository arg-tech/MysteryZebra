#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the Russian is either the person who watches action movies or the person who skis. From clue 10, we know the Turkish is on the left of the Nigerian, so the Russian cannot be the Nigerian.
* From clue 14, we know the Nigerian is the person who plays golf, and from clue 20, we know the person who drinks iced-tea and eats corn has the same parity positions as the Nigerian. This means the Nigerian is the person who drinks iced-tea and eats corn.
* From clue 2, we know the Nigerian is either the person who drinks iced-tea or the person who watches western movies. Since the Nigerian is already the person who drinks iced-tea and eats corn, the Nigerian must be the person who watches western movies.
* From clue 11, we know the person who drinks tea is to the left of the fan trance. From clue 15, we know the fan punk is to the left of the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is already the person who watches western movies, the fan punk must be to the left of the person who drinks tea.
* From clue 16, we know the person who plays parkour is not to the left of the person who watches satire movies. From clue 22, we know the Turkish is not to the left of the Indonesian. Since the Turkish is already on the left of the Nigerian, the Turkish must be the person who plays parkour.
* From clue 17, we know the fan trance is not to the right of the person who eats cauliflower. From clue 12, we know the Indonesian is to the right of the person who eats corn. Since the fan trance is not to the right of the person who eats cauliflower, the fan trance must be the person who eats cauliflower.
* From clue 18, we know the person who plays parkour is not the person who eats broccoli. From clue 21, we know the person who eats broccoli is either the fan trance or the person who watches western movies. Since the fan trance is already the person who eats cauliflower, the person who eats broccoli must be the person who watches western movies.
* From clue 19, we know the person who watches western movies is not the fan punk. From clue 25, we know the fan punk is to the right of the person who watches action movies. Since the person who watches western movies is already the person who eats broccoli, the fan punk must be the person who watches action movies.
* From clue 23, we know the person who plays parkour is not to the left of the person who eats cherry. From clue 24, we know the person who watches western movies is not to the left of the Nigerian. Since the person who plays parkour is already the Turkish, the person who eats cherry must be the person who watches crime movies.
* From clue 1, we know the fan house is to the right of the Russian. From clue 4, we know the Indonesian is to the right of the person who watches satire movies. Since the fan house is to the right of the Russian, the fan house must be the person who watches satire movies.
* From clue 5, we know the Nigerian is not to the left of the person who eats broccoli. From clue 21, we know the person who eats broccoli is the person who watches western movies. Since the Nigerian is already the person who watches western movies, the Nigerian must be to the right of the person who eats broccoli.
* From clue 6, we know the person who eats cherry is not to the left of the fan trance. From clue 17, we know the fan trance is the person who eats cauliflower. Since the person who eats cherry is not to the left of the fan trance, the person who eats cherry must be to the right of the fan trance.
* From clue 7, we know the person who watches crime movies is to the left of the person who drinks coffee. From clue 9, we know the Turkish is not the person who watches satire movies. Since the Turkish is already the person who plays parkour, the Turkish must be the person who drinks coffee.
* From clue 13, we know the Nigerian is the person who plays golf. From clue 20, we know the person who drinks iced-tea and eats corn has the same parity positions as the Nigerian. This means the Nigerian is the person who drinks iced-tea and eats corn.

The final solution table is as follows:
