| Sport         |  Baseball  |  Weightlifting  |  Handball  |  Rowing  |  Cycling  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From statement 2, we know the person watching satire movies is on the far left. From statement 9, we know they're not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Therefore, the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 2 or 3.
* From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is baseball is either the person watching time-travel movies or the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person watching time-travel movies is already placed (statement 6), the person who's sport is baseball must be the person who's hobby is woodworking.
* From statement 13, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is already placed (statement 8), the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 3.
* From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is rowing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not yet placed, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 4 or 5.
* From statement 15, we know the person watching time-travel movies is the person watching time-travel movies. From statement 12, we know this person is either the person who's sport is baseball or the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is already placed, the person watching time-travel movies must be the person who's sport is baseball.
* From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the far right. From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is already placed, the person who's sport is rowing must be in position 4.
* From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is writing is in an even position. Since the person who's hobby is writing is not yet placed, it must be in position 2 or 4. However, position 2 is already occupied by woodworking, so the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 4.
* From statement 1, we know the person watching adventure movies and the person who's hobby is writing have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is writing is in position 4, the person watching adventure movies must be in an odd position. From statement 18, we know the person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person who's sport is rowing is in position 4, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 3.
* From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the person watching comedy movies is not yet placed, the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 2 or 3. However, position 2 is already occupied by rock-climbing, so the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 3.
* From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is handball is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is already placed, the person who's sport is handball must be in position 1 or 2. However, position 1 is already occupied by satire, so the person who's sport is handball must be in position 2.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is baseball is the person driving the van or the person eating spinach or both. Since the person driving the van is already taken by the person eating pumpkin (from statement 8), the person eating spinach must be the one who's sport is baseball.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the fan of blues is between the person who prefers rugby and the person who prefers weightlifting. From statement 11, we know the person who prefers weightlifting is to the left of the person who prefers rugby. Therefore, the fan of blues is to the left of the person who prefers weightlifting.
2. From statement 2, we know the person who prefers fishing is not to the left of the fan of D&B. From statement 8, we know the person who prefers fishing is either to the left or right of the person who prefers board-games. Since the fan of D&B is to the left of the fan of blues (from statement 3), the person who prefers fishing must be to the right of the fan of blues.
3. From statement 9, we know the person who prefers fishing is either the fan of funk or the person who prefers water-polo, but not both. Since the person who prefers fishing is to the right of the fan of blues, and the fan of funk is to the right of the fan of blues (from statement 4), the person who prefers fishing must be the fan of funk.
4. From statement 5, we know the person who prefers rugby is to the right of the person who prefers water-polo. From statement 14, we know the person who prefers traveling is between the person who prefers rugby and the person who prefers board-games. Therefore, the person who prefers traveling must be to the right of the person who prefers water-polo.
5. From statement 6, we know the person who prefers volleyball is in the middle. From statement 7, we know the person who prefers volleyball is to the right of the fan of funk. Therefore, the person who prefers volleyball must be to the right of the fan of funk.
6. From statement 12, we know the person who prefers weightlifting is to the left of the person who prefers volleyball. From statement 13, we know the person who prefers skydiving is to the left of the person who prefers weightlifting. Therefore, the person who prefers skydiving must be to the left of the person who prefers volleyball.
7. From statement 15, we know the person who prefers weightlifting is either the fan of funk or the person who prefers skydiving, or both. Since the person who prefers skydiving is to the left of the person who prefers volleyball, and the fan of funk is to the right of the fan of blues, the person who prefers weightlifting must be the fan of funk.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
Lv1-3x5-10	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

|               |      1       |     2     |     3     |     4     |       5       |
| Food          |  kiwi (C)   |  banana  |  asparagus|  watermelon|  cherry (B)  |

| Sport         |  swimming   |  baseball |  rugby     |  skateboarding|  snowboarding|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 5, we know the pakistani is on the far left.
2. From statement 6, we know the british is in an even position, so they can't be in position 1 or 5.
3. From statement 7, we know the colombian eats kiwi, so they must be in position 3.
4. From statement 8, we know the person eating banana is not to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, so the colombian (who eats kiwi) can't be in position 2.
5. From statement 9, we know the colombian or the person who's sport is baseball is the person eating banana, so the colombian must be in position 3 and the person eating banana must be in position 2.
6. From statement 10, we know the chinese and the person eating asparagus have different parity positions, so the chinese can't be in position 2 (since the person eating banana is in position 2).
7. From statement 11, we know the british is somewhere to the left of the chinese, so the british must be in position 4.
8. From statement 12, we know the person eating watermelon is on the right of the colombian, so they must be in position 5.
9. From statement 13, we know the person eating asparagus is not to the right of the person eating banana, so the person eating asparagus must be in position 1.
10. From statement 15, we know the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person eating banana, so they must be in position 5.
11. From statement 16, we know the argentine is somewhere to the left of the person eating watermelon, so they must be in position 3.
12. From statement 17, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the left of the person who's sport is swimming, so they must be in position 2.
13. From statement 18, we know the person eating kiwi is the person who's sport is swimming or the person who's sport is swimming is the british, but not both. Since the colombian eats kiwi, they must be in position 3, and the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 5.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
