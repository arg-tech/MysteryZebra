| Transport     | Trike      | Helicopter| Tram     | Bike      |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 4, we know the person watching fantasy movies is the Italian. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is between the Italian and the person driving the trike. Since the Italian is watching fantasy movies, the person driving the trike must be the one watching zombie movies.
2. From clue 3, we know the person driving the helicopter is the Japanese. From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the Thai. Since the Japanese is driving the helicopter, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be the Journalist ( Designer is already taken by the person who's hobby is skydiving).
3. From clue 2, we know the owner of the frog is the Thai. From clue 6, we know the owner of the ferret is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the Thai is the owner of the frog, the owner of the ferret must be the Nigerian.
4. From clue 9, we know the designer is the person who's hobby is skydiving. From clue 1, we know the person driving the tram is between the person driving the trike and the person watching fantasy movies. Since the designer is the person who's hobby is skydiving, the designer must be the Journalist.
5. From clue 11, we know the owner of the goat is on the right of the person watching zombie movies. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is between the Italian and the person driving the trike. Since the owner of the goat is on the right of the person watching zombie movies, the owner of the goat must be the Nigerian.
6. From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the owner of the snake. From clue 2, we know the owner of the frog is the Thai. Since the owner of the snake is not the Thai, the owner of the snake must be the Japanese.
7. From clue 12, we know the nigerian is on the right of the writer. From clue 5, we know the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the Nigerian is on the right of the writer, the writer must be the one watching horror movies.
