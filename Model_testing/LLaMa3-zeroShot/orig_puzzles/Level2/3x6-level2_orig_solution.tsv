* From clue 1, the fan of reggae is on the left of the bartender, so the paramedic (who is on the far left) must be the fan of reggae.
* From clue 2, the person driving the train is the fan of soul, so the nurse (who is between the fan of house and the person driving the train) must be the fan of house.
* From clue 4, the paramedic is on the left of the fan of soul, so the fan of soul must be the person driving the train.
* From clue 5, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the bartender, so the bartender must be the fan of blues.
* From clue 6, the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the fan of soul, so the firefighter (who is on the right of the fan of house) must be the fan of country.
* From clue 7, the fan of blues is on the far right, so the bartender must be on the far right.
* From clue 8, the person driving the bus is on the right of the fan of classical, so the coach must be the fan of classical.
* From clue 9, the paramedic is the paramedic, so no further information is needed.
* From clue 10, the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the subway, so the paramedic (who is on the far left) must be the person driving the trike.
* From clue 11, the nurse is between the fan of house and the person driving the train, so the nurse must be the fan of house.
* From clue 12, the person driving the bus is on the left of the fan of country, so the firefighter (who is the fan of country) must be on the right of the person driving the bus.
* From clue 13, the firefighter is on the right of the fan of house, so the firefighter must be on the right of the nurse.
* From clue 14, the firefighter is on the right of the entrepreneur, so the entrepreneur must be on the left of the firefighter.
