Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the information from clues 5, 11, and 19 to determine the order of the movie genres. This helped me to place the romance movie on the far left, followed by drama, zombie, disaster, action, and comedy.
2. I then used clues 2, 3, and 24 to determine the order of the hobbies. This helped me to place skydiving on the far left, followed by drawing, photography, card-games, filmmaking, and dancing.
3. I used clues 6, 12, and 18 to determine the nationalities of the police-officer, coffee drinker, and fisherman. This helped me to place the Indian as the police-officer, the egyptian as the card-games player, and the argentine as the fisherman.
4. I used clues 4, 7, 10, and 17 to determine the order of the beverages. This helped me to place milk on the right of the pakistani, followed by juice, mirinda, 7up, fanta, and coffee.
5. I used clues 8, 14, 15, and 22 to determine the order of the transports. This helped me to place the tram on the far right, followed by the train, motorbike, skateboard, roller, and airplane.
