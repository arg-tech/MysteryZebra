10. The Dutch is in the middle.

From statement 1, we know the Mexican is on the left of the Canadian. From statement 7, we know the Canadian is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Therefore, the Mexican is on the left of the owner of the hamster.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the Mexican is on the left of the owner of the hamster, the Mexican is also on the left of the owner of the pony.

From statement 6, we know the Indian is the owner of the pony. Therefore, the Mexican is on the left of the Indian.

From statement 4, we know the German is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the Mexican is on the left of the Indian, the German must be on the left of the Pakistani.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the fish is on the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the fish is between the owner of the turtle and the Indian (statement 8), the owner of the fish must be on the left of the Indian.

From statement 9, we know the Canadian is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the Canadian is on the left of the owner of the hamster (statement 7), the owner of the rat must be on the right of the owner of the hamster.

The final solution is:

Mexican - Fish - Indian - Pony - Dutch - German - Pakistani - Canadian

The Canadian is on the right of the owner of the rat, so the rat must be the last pet. The Polish owns the rabbit, so the rabbit must be the third pet. The turtle must be the second pet, and the hamster must be the fourth pet. The goat and the hamster are not mentioned in the statements, so we can place them anywhere. Let's place the goat as the first pet and the hamster as the fourth pet.

6. The Mexican is between the person drinking Juice and the Pakistani.
7. The person drinking Fanta is in the middle.
8. The Mexican is on the left of the person drinking Lemonade.
9. The person drinking Iced-Tea is the Chinese.
10. The Australian is the person drinking Water.

From statement 5, we know the Australian is on the right of the person drinking Fanta. Since the Australian is in the leftmost position, the person drinking Fanta must be in the middle.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking Fanta is in the middle. This means the person drinking Fanta is the 4th person from the left.

From statement 6, we know the Mexican is between the person drinking Juice and the Pakistani. Since the person drinking Fanta is in the middle, the Mexican must be on the left of the person drinking Fanta.

From statement 8, we know the Mexican is on the left of the person drinking Lemonade. This means the person drinking Lemonade must be on the right of the Mexican.

From statement 3, we know the Pakistani is on the right of the Mexican. This means the Pakistani is on the right of the person drinking Lemonade.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking Sprite is on the right of the Nigerian. Since the Pakistani is on the right of the Mexican, the Nigerian must be on the left of the Mexican.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking Iced-Tea is the Chinese. Since the Chinese is not mentioned in any other statement, we can place them anywhere. Let's place them on the right of the Pakistani.
