Note that we can't determine the movie genre for the person drinking coffee, so we leave it as ""Satire"" for now. However, we can try to figure it out based on the remaining statements.

From statement 3, we know the person eating apricot is the person watching drama movies. Since the person eating mango is the third person, the person eating apricot must be the second person. However, this contradicts statement 2, which says the person drinking soy-milk is the person watching family movies. This means we need to re-examine our assumptions.

Let's try again:

From statement 1, we know the person drinking tea is on the far left. From statement 5, we know the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person drinking tea. So, the order from left to right is:

Tea -> Animation ->? ->? ->?

From statement 2, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the person watching family movies. Since the person drinking tea is on the far left, the person drinking soy-milk must be the second person.

From statement 4, we know the person watching spy movies is in the middle. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the second person and the person eating apricot is the third person, the person watching spy movies must be the fourth person.

From statement 6, we know the person eating mango is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the second person, the person eating mango must be the third person.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking 7up is the person eating cherry. Since the person eating mango is the third person, the person drinking 7up must be the fourth person.

From statement 8, we know the person eating raspberry is between the person drinking coffee and the person watching family movies. Since the person drinking soy-milk is the second person and the person watching family movies is the person drinking soy-milk, the person eating raspberry must be the fifth person.

From statement 9, we know the person watching spy movies is the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry is the fifth person, the person watching spy movies is the fifth person.

Lv1-3x5-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the car is in the middle.
2. The software-developer is between the person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter.
3. The person driving the van is the person who's sport is sailing.

From statement 1, we know the car driver is in the middle. From statement 4, we know the chef is the sailing person. From statement 8, we know the chef is on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the software-developer is between the basketball person and the scooter driver. Since the chef is on the far right, the software-developer must be on the left of the chef.

From statement 5, we know the rugby person is between the basketball person and the scooter driver. Since the software-developer is already on the left of the chef, the rugby person must be on the left of the software-developer.

From statement 9, we know the entrepreneur is on the left of the engineer. Since the chef is on the far right, the entrepreneur and engineer must be on the left side of the table.

From statement 7, we know the bike driver is on the right of the scooter driver. Since the software-developer is on the left of the chef, the bike driver must be on the right of the software-developer.

From statement 10, we know the rugby person is the software-developer. Therefore, the software-developer is on the left of the chef, and the rugby person is on the left of the software-developer.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x5-10	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Let's assume the person with the magic-tricks hobby is on the left. Then, the person with the reading hobby must be on the right.

From clue 2, we know that the Italian is on the right of the German. This means the Italian cannot be on the left of the person with the magic-tricks hobby, as that would put the German on the left of the Italian, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the Italian must be on the right of the person with the magic-tricks hobby.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the Egyptian. This means the person with the cooking hobby must be on the left of the person with the skydiving hobby, and the Egyptian must be on the right of the person with the skydiving hobby.

From clue 4, we know that the Italian is on the right of the German. This is already consistent with our previous deductions.

From clue 5, we know that the owner of the horse is on the far right. This means the horse owner cannot be on the left of the Italian, as that would put the horse owner on the left of the German, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the horse owner must be on the right of the Italian.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is between the Colombian and the Italian. This means the Colombian must be on the left of the person with the cooking hobby, and the Italian must be on the right of the person with the cooking hobby.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is on the right of the German. This means the German must be on the left of the person with the photography hobby.

From clue 8, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the dog. This means the guinea-pig owner cannot be on the right of the dog owner, as that would put the dog owner on the left of the guinea-pig owner, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the guinea-pig owner must be on the left of the dog owner.

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the fish is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the horse. This means the goldfish owner must be on the left of the fish owner, and the horse owner must be on the right of the fish owner.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1       |    2     |     3     |    4    |      5      |

3. Egyptian -? -? -? -?
4. Dog -? -? -? -?
