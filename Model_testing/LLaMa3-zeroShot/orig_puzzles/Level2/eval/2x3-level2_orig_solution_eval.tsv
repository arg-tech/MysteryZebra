Lv1-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of folk is the person drinking lemonade.
This means we can fill in the top-left corner: Folk | Lemonade

2. The person drinking soy-milk is between the fan of pop and the person drinking lemonade.
This means the person drinking soy-milk is either between Folk and Lemonade or between Lemonade and Pop. Since the person drinking lemonade is already identified as the fan of folk, the person drinking soy-milk must be between Lemonade and Pop. We can fill in the top-center: Folk | Lemonade | Soy-milk

3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the fan of disco.
This means the person drinking juice is either on the right of Disco or on the right of the entire table. Since there are only three columns, the person drinking juice must be on the right of the entire table. We can fill in the top-right: Folk | Lemonade | Soy-milk | Juice

Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku

This means that the drawing hobby must be in the leftmost column, and the sudoku hobby must be in the rightmost column.

2. The social-worker is between the coach and the person who's hobby is drawing

This means that the social-worker must be in the middle column, and the coach must be either to the left or right of the social-worker. Since the drawing hobby is already in the leftmost column, the coach must be to the right of the social-worker.

Here's the initial table:

Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person drinking cola.

This means that the dog's owner cannot be the first person, so the first person must be drinking either mirinda or tea.

2. The person drinking cola is between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking tea.

This means that the owner of the ferret must be on the left of the person drinking cola, and the person drinking tea must be on the right of the person drinking cola.

Now, let's combine the information:

|            |    1    |    2     |  3  |

| Pet        |         |          |     |

From clue 1, we know the dog's owner is on the right of the person drinking cola. From clue 2, we know the owner of the ferret is on the left of the person drinking cola. Therefore, the order of the pets is:

|            |    1    |    2     |  3  |
| Pet        | ferret | dog    | goldfish |

Now, let's determine the beverages. From clue 1, we know the first person is not the dog's owner, so the first person must be drinking either mirinda or tea. From clue 2, we know the person drinking cola is between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking tea. Therefore, the order of the beverages is:

|            |    1    |    2     |  3  |
| Beverage   | mirinda | cola    | tea |

The final solution is:

1. The fan of funk is the owner of the bird.
This means the bird's owner prefers funk.

2. The fan of soul is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the bird.
This means the owner of the fish prefers soul, and the owner of the bird prefers funk. The owner of the goldfish is not mentioned yet, but we'll get to that later.

3. The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the bird.
This means the owner of the goldfish prefers r&b (since funk is already taken by the bird's owner).

Lv1-2x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking.

This means that the person who likes sudoku is either on the left of the person who likes cooking, or they are in the same column. We can't determine the exact position yet, but we know that sudoku is not on the right of cooking.

2. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the owner of the goat.

This means that the owner of the goat is on the left of the person who likes sudoku. Since we already know that sudoku is not on the right of cooking, the owner of the goat must be on the left of cooking.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the fish.

This means that the owner of the chinchilla is in the middle, between the owner of the goat and the owner of the fish.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the goat is on the left of cooking. From clue 3, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the fish. This means that the owner of the goat is in column 1, the owner of the chinchilla is in column 2, and the owner of the fish is in column 3.

From clue 1, we know that sudoku is on the left of cooking. Since the owner of the goat is in column 1, sudoku must be in column 2. This means that cooking is in column 3.

Lv1-2x3-7	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating broccoli.
This means that the order of food is either: broccoli,?, pineapple or?, broccoli, pineapple

2. The Brazilian is between the person eating pineapple and the Chinese.
This means that the Brazilian cannot be next to the person eating broccoli, since the pineapple-eater is on the right of the broccoli-eater. Therefore, the Brazilian must be next to the Chinese.

Now, let's combine the two clues:

* The Brazilian is between the person eating pineapple and the Chinese, so the order is:?, Brazilian, Chinese, pineapple
* The person eating pineapple is on the right of the person eating broccoli, so the order is: broccoli,?, Brazilian, Chinese, pineapple

2. The British is between the person watching satire movies and the person watching Western movies.
3. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.

From clue 1, we know the Mexican watches satire movies.

From clue 3, we know the person watching satire movies (Mexican) is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the Mexican.

From clue 2, we know the British is between the person watching satire movies (Mexican) and the person watching Western movies. Since the Mexican is already placed, the British must be on the left of the Mexican, and the person watching Western movies must be on the right of the British.

Lv1-2x3-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

This means that the person who drives the bus is either the first or second person in the table.

2. The person driving the bus is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike.
This means that the person who drives the bus is not the last person in the table, and the person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the person who drives the bus.

Now, let's combine the two clues:

* The person driving the bus is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming.
* The person driving the bus is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike.

This means that the person driving the bus is the second person, and the person who's sport is swimming is the third person. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the first person, and the person driving the quad-bike is the last person.

Lv1-2x3-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the car is on the right of the social-worker:

This means the social-worker is on the left of the car driver. Let's represent this as:

|             |       1       |   2    |     3     |
| Job         |  Social-worker |       |           |
| Transport   |               |        |           |

2. The lawyer is between the person driving the quad-bike and the fisherman:

This means the lawyer is on the left of the quad-bike driver and on the right of the fisherman. Let's represent this as:

|             |       1       |   2    |     3     |
| Job         |  Social-worker | Lawyer | Fisherman |
| Transport   |               |        |           |

Now, we need to figure out who is driving the car, motorbike, and quad-bike. Since the car driver is on the right of the social-worker, the social-worker cannot be driving the car. The lawyer is between the quad-bike driver and the fisherman, so the fisherman cannot be driving the quad-bike. This means the fisherman must be driving the motorbike.

The remaining options are:

* The social-worker can drive the car or the quad-bike.
* The lawyer can drive the car or the quad-bike.

Let's analyze the possibilities:

* If the social-worker drives the car, the lawyer would drive the quad-bike, and the fisherman would drive the motorbike. This satisfies all the clues.
* If the social-worker drives the quad-bike, the lawyer would drive the car, and the fisherman would drive the motorbike. This also satisfies all the clues.

However, we can eliminate the second possibility because the lawyer is between the quad-bike driver and the fisherman, which means the lawyer cannot drive the car.

Therefore, the final solution is:

#############
|             |       1       |   2    |     3     |
| Job         |  Social-worker | Lawyer | Fisherman |
