Lv1-2x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
This means that the person drinking cola is either next to the person who's sport is soccer or on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.

2. The person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left.
This means that the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the first column.

3. The person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking juice.
This means that the person who's sport is soccer is in the middle, with the person who's sport is ice-hockey to their left and the person drinking juice to their right.

4. The person drinking water is on the far left.
This means that the person drinking water is in the same column as the person who's sport is weightlifting.

5. The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola.
This means that the person drinking lemonade is in the middle, with the person drinking juice to their left and the person drinking cola to their right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Sport      |               |         |          |            |

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is in column 1. From clue 4, we know the person drinking water is in column 1, so the person who's sport is weightlifting is drinking water.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is soccer is in the middle. Since the person drinking juice is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer, the person drinking juice must be in column 3.

From clue 5, we know the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking juice is in column 3, the person drinking lemonade must be in column 2, and the person drinking cola must be in column 4.

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-2x4-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating plum.
This means that plum is on the left of ice-hockey.

2. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person eating peach.
This means that peach is on the left of swimming.

3. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person eating garlic.
This means that garlic is on the left of avocado.

4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
This means that swimming is on the right of ice-hockey.

5. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person eating garlic and the person who's sport is tennis.
This means that ice-hockey is between garlic and tennis.

Now, let's combine the information:

|         |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4     |
| Food    |        |            |          |          |
| Sport   |        |            |          |          |

From clue 1, plum is on the left of ice-hockey. From clue 3, garlic is on the left of avocado. From clue 2, peach is on the left of swimming. From clue 5, ice-hockey is between garlic and tennis.

So, the possible arrangement is:

|         |   1    |     2      |    3     |    4     |
| Food    | Garlic | Avocado | Plum    | Peach   |
| Sport   |        |          |          |          |

Now, let's fill in the sports:

* From clue 4, swimming is on the right of ice-hockey. Since ice-hockey is between garlic and tennis, swimming must be on the right of tennis.
* From clue 1, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person eating plum. This means that ice-hockey is on the right of plum.
* From clue 5, the person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person eating garlic and the person who's sport is tennis. This means that ice-hockey is on the right of garlic and on the left of tennis.

So, the final solution is:
