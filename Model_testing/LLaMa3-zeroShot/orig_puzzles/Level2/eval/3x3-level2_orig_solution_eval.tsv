Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating raspberry is the person driving the train.
2. The owner of the cat is between the person eating raspberry and the person eating apple.
3. The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
4. The owner of the cat is on the left of the person eating apple.

From statement 1, we know that the person eating raspberry is driving the train. Let's call this person R.

From statement 2, we know that the owner of the cat is between R and the person eating apple. Let's call this person C.

From statement 4, we know that C is on the left of the person eating apple. Let's call this person A.

Now, let's look at statement 3. The person driving the car is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since C is between R and A, C cannot be the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the owner of the lizard must be on the right of C.

We can now start filling in the table:

|             |     1     |    2    |   3   |
| Food        |           |         |       |

| Transport   |           |         |       |

R (raspberry) - Train
C (cat) -? - A (apple)
L (lizard) -? - Car

From statement 3, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the right of C. Since C is between R and A, the owner of the lizard must be on the right of A. Therefore, the owner of the lizard must be eating cabbage.

| Transport   |           |         |       |

R (raspberry) - Train
C (cat) -? - A (apple)
L (lizard) - Cabbage - Car

From statement 2, we know that C is between R and A. Since C is eating fish, C must be on the right of R and on the left of A.

|             |     1     |    2    |   3   |
| Food        | apple    | raspberry | cabbage |
| Pet         | cat      | fish     | lizard |
| Transport   |           |         |       |

R (raspberry) - Train
C (cat) - Fish - A (apple)
L (lizard) - Cabbage - Car

The final solution is:

* The person who's hobby is chess is the lawyer (1)
* The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (2)
* The person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up (3)

From clue 1, we know the lawyer's hobby is chess. From clue 2, we know the person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means the person who's hobby is woodworking is either in position 1 or 2. Let's assume they're in position 1 for now.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up. This means the person drinking 7up is either in position 2 or 3. Let's assume they're in position 2 for now.

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

* The person drinking tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (2). Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 1, the person drinking tea is in position 3.
* The person drinking fanta is between the project-manager and the person drinking 7up (3). Since the person drinking 7up is in position 2, the project-manager is in position 1, and the person drinking fanta is in position 3.

1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter.
2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
3. The person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is sailing.

From clue 1, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the firefighter. Let's assume the person watching disaster movies is in the first column.

From clue 2, we know the person watching disaster movies is also on the left of the person watching spy movies. This means the person watching spy movies must be in the third column.

From clue 3, we know the person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Since the person watching disaster movies is in the first column, this person's sport must be ice-hockey.

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the mechanic and the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person watching disaster movies (and ice-hockey) is in the first column, the mechanic must be in the second column, and the person who's sport is sailing must be in the third column.

Now we can fill in the table:

* The person watching disaster movies (ice-hockey) is the designer.
* The person watching documentary movies is the firefighter.
* The person watching spy movies is the mechanic.

So, the final solution table is:

3. The person driving the train is between the fan of funk and the person watching drama movies.
4. The fan of pop is on the right of the person watching epic movies.
5. The fan of pop is on the far right.

From statement 1, we know the motorbike driver is on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the funk fan is on the left of the train driver.

From statement 3, we know the train driver is between the funk fan and the drama movie fan. This means the drama movie fan is on the right of the train driver.

From statement 4, we know the pop fan is on the right of the epic movie fan.

From statement 5, we know the pop fan is on the far right. This means the epic movie fan is on the second-to-last position.

Lv1-3x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of soul is the owner of the ferret.
2. The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike.
3. The fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski.
4. The owner of the ferret is between the owner of the frog and the fan of salsa.

From statement 1, we know the fan of soul is the owner of the ferret. Let's call this person S.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the ferret is on the right of the person driving the bike. This means the bike driver is to the left of S.

From statement 3, we know the fan of salsa is the person driving the jet-ski. Let's call this person Sa.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the ferret (S) is between the owner of the frog and Sa. This means the owner of the frog is to the left of S, and Sa is to the right of S.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     |        |        |         |
#############

* S (fan of soul) owns the ferret and is on the right of the bike driver.
* Sa (fan of salsa) drives the jet-ski and is to the right of S.
* The owner of the frog is to the left of S.

We can't determine the music genre of the frog owner or the bike driver yet, but we can fill in the table with the information we have:

| Pet           |  Ferret |  Frog  | ?    |
| Transport     |  Bike  | ?    |  Jet-ski |
#############

Now, let's analyze the remaining possibilities:

* The bike driver can't be the fan of soul (S) because S owns the ferret and is on the right of the bike driver. The bike driver must be someone who doesn't own a pet.
* The jet-ski driver (Sa) is the fan of salsa, so the bike driver can't be the fan of salsa.
* The owner of the frog is to the left of S, so the bike driver can't be the owner of the frog.

The only remaining possibility is that the bike driver is the fan of trance. This means the music genres are:

* Soul: S (fan of soul)
* Trance: Bike driver
* Salsa: Sa (fan of salsa)

The pets are:

* Ferret: S (fan of soul)
* Frog: Owner of the frog
*? (unknown pet): Sa (fan of salsa)

The transport is:

* Bike: Trance fan
*? (unknown transport): Owner of the frog
* Jet-ski: Sa (fan of salsa)

Lv1-3x3-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst.
This means the order is:? (owner of pony) - bartender - analyst

2. The person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst.
This means the order is:? (driver of bike) -? (driver of ship) - analyst

3. The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.
This means the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the pony and the bartender.

4. The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
This means the order is: owner of pony - owner of chinchilla - bartender

Now, let's combine the clues:

|             |    1    |     2      |    3     |
| Job         |         |            |          |

| Transport   |         |            |          |

From clue 4, we know the order is: owner of pony - owner of chinchilla - bartender

From clue 1, we know the bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst, so the order is: owner of pony - owner of chinchilla - bartender - analyst

From clue 2, we know the person driving the ship is between the person driving the bike and the analyst, so the order is:? (driver of bike) -? (driver of ship) - owner of chinchilla - owner of pony - bartender - analyst

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so the owner of the pony must be driving the bike.
* The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle, so the owner of the chinchilla must be driving the ship.
* The bartender is between the owner of the pony and the analyst, so the bartender must be driving the scooter.
