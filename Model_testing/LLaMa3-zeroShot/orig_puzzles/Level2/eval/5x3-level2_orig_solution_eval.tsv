Lv1-5x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The photographer is between the owner of the bird and the person driving the van.
2. The person driving the van is on the far left.
3. The person eating pear is in the middle.
4. The person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of salsa.

6. The fan of rock is on the left of the fan of electronic.
7. The fan of salsa is the person eating peas.
8. The fan of salsa is the person driving the van.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the van is on the far left. From statement 1, we know the photographer is between the owner of the bird and the person driving the van. This means the photographer is second from the left.

From statement 3, we know the person eating pear is in the middle. Since the person driving the van is on the far left, the person eating pear must be in the second position.

From statement 4, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of salsa is the person driving the van (statement 8), the person driving the trike must be on the right of the person driving the van.

From statement 5, we know the videographer is on the right of the owner of the horse. Since the person driving the trike is on the right of the fan of salsa, the owner of the horse must be in the position before the videographer.

From statement 6, we know the fan of rock is on the left of the fan of electronic. Since the person eating pear is in the middle, the fan of rock must be on the left of the person eating pear, and the fan of electronic must be on the right of the person eating pear.

From statement 7, we know the fan of salsa is the person eating peas. Since the fan of salsa is the person driving the van, the person eating peas must be the person driving the van.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     | boat    | van        | trike       |
#############

The final solution is:

Lv1-5x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the accountant.

2. The owner of the goat is between the owner of the turtle and the journalist.
This means the order is: turtle, goat, journalist.

3. The person watching spy movies is in the middle.

This means the order is: mango, lemonade, sprite.

6. The person eating radish is on the left of the person eating mango.

Now, let's fill in the table:

7. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
8. The person who's sport is cricket is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the fan of folk.

From statement 2, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left. Let's call this person A.

From statement 4, we know the Malaysian is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since A is on the far left, the Malaysian must be to the left of A.

From statement 5, we know the dressmaker is on the far right. Let's call this person E.

From statement 6, we know the freelancer is on the right of the dancer. Since E is on the far right, the freelancer and dancer must be to the left of E.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Let's call the person who's hobby is singing S and the person who's hobby is card-games C. Since S is on the left of C, S must be to the left of A.

From statement 8, we know the person who's sport is cricket is between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the fan of folk. Let's call the person who's sport is lacrosse L and the fan of folk F. Since the person who's sport is cricket is between L and F, the order must be L-Cricket-F.

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Sport         |        |            |            |

From the above analysis, we know:

* A (hiking) is on the far left

* C (card-games) is to the right of S
* Malaysian is to the left of L (lacrosse)
* Freelancer and Dancer are to the left of E (dressmaker)
