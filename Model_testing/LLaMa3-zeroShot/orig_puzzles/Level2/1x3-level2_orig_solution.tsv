2. The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of folk is to the left of the fan of ambient. This means that the fan of folk must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal. This means that the fan of metal must be in position 3.

1. The owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
2. The owner of the snake is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the ferret.

From clue 1, we know the snake owner is to the left of the guinea-pig owner. From clue 2, we know the snake owner is between the guinea-pig owner and the ferret owner. This means the snake owner is to the left of the guinea-pig owner and to the right of the ferret owner.

Here's the possible arrangement:

|       |   1    |   2   |     3      |

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking milk is on the far right.

From clue 2, we know that milk is on the far right. Let's assume the order is:?,?, milk.

From clue 1, we know that cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice. This means that cola is to the left of milk, and juice is to the right of milk.

So, the possible order is:?, cola, milk, juice.

Now, let's try to figure out the remaining two options. Since there are only three options (cola, juice, and milk), we can try to eliminate possibilities.

If we assume that the first option is cola, then the second option would be juice (since cola is between milk and juice). But this would mean that the person drinking juice is on the far left, which contradicts clue 1.

So, the first option cannot be cola. Let's try the second option instead. If the second option is cola, then the first option would be juice (since cola is between milk and juice). This would mean that the person drinking juice is on the far left, which again contradicts clue 1.

Therefore, the first option cannot be juice either. This means that the first option must be milk.

So, the final order is: milk, cola, juice.

Here is the solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|            |   1   |  2   |  3   |
| Beverage   |  milk | cola | juice |

2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 1, we know that the order is: juice,?, mirinda,? (where? is the person drinking almond-milk).

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, so the order is: juice, mirinda, almond-milk.

1. The fan of techno is between the fan of country and the fan of rock.
2. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of rock.

1. The owner of the rabbit is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the ferret.
2. The owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the rabbit.

From clue 1, we know the order is:? (bird) - rabbit -? (ferret)

From clue 2, we know the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the rabbit, so the order is:? (bird) -? (rabbit) -? (ferret)

Now, let's fill in the table:
