Lv1-2x6-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the roller is the person driving the roller (no new information)
2. The person driving the van is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess (van -> chess)
3. The person who's hobby is chess is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is hiking (reading -> chess -> hiking)
4. The person who's hobby is hiking is the person driving the van (hiking -> van)
5. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking (skydiving -> hiking)
6. The person who's hobby is reading is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram (roller -> reading -> tram)
7. The person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the bike (roller -> bike)
8. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the roller (cooking -> roller)
9. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening (boat -> gardening)

From statement 2, we know the van is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is driving the van. Therefore, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is reading is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the bike (statement 7), the person who's hobby is reading must be on the right of the person driving the bike.

From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person driving the bike, the person who's hobby is cooking must be on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.

From statement 9, we know the person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the roller, the person who's hobby is gardening must be on the left of the person driving the boat.

Now, let's fill in the table:
