Lv1-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is in the middle.
This means that soccer is in position 3.

2. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
This means that cricket is in position 4 or 5, and weightlifting is in position 2 or 3.

3. The person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer.
This means that cricket is in position 2 or 3, and soccer is in position 3.

Combining clues 2 and 3, we can conclude that cricket is in position 2, and soccer is in position 3.

4. The person who's sport is skiing is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's sport is badminton.
This means that skiing is in position 2 or 4, and badminton is in position 1 or 5.

Since cricket is already in position 2, skiing must be in position 4, and badminton must be in position 1.

Now we can fill in the table:

3. The person driving the skateboard is on the far left.

This confirms what we already deduced from clue 2: the skateboard is on the far left.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking fanta is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking sprite.
This means that fanta is not on the leftmost or rightmost position. Let's denote the positions as:
A (leftmost) ->? -> fanta ->? ->? -> E (rightmost)

2. The person drinking sprite is between the person drinking fanta and the person drinking mirinda.
This means that sprite is not on the leftmost or rightmost position. Since we already know fanta is not on the leftmost or rightmost, sprite must be on the right side of fanta. Let's update the positions:
A ->? -> fanta -> sprite ->? -> E

3. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking sprite.
This means that mirinda is on the left side of sprite. Let's update the positions:
A ->? -> fanta -> mirinda -> sprite -> E

4. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
This means that iced-tea is on the left side of 7up. Since we don't know the exact positions yet, let's just note that iced-tea is on the left side of 7up.

Now, let's combine the information:

A ->? -> fanta -> mirinda -> sprite -> E
A ->? -> iced-tea ->? -> 7up -> E

We can deduce that iced-tea is on the leftmost position, and 7up is on the rightmost position. The remaining positions are:
A ->? -> fanta -> mirinda -> sprite -> E

The only possibility is:
A -> 7up -> fanta -> mirinda -> sprite -> E

So, the final solution is:

#############
| Beverage   | 7up | fanta | mirinda | sprite | iced-tea |
#############

The correct order is: 7up, fanta, mirinda, sprite, iced-tea."
