Lv1-3x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
2. The person driving the van is the owner of the cat.
3. The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
4. The person eating artichoke is on the far right.
5. The owner of the ferret is between the person driving the trike and the person eating asparagus.
6. The person driving the snowmobile is the owner of the lizard.
7. The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the ferret.

From clue 3, we know the person eating blueberry is on the far left. From clue 4, we know the person eating artichoke is on the far right.

From clue 2, we know the person driving the van is the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the ferret (clue 7), the owner of the ferret cannot be driving the van. Therefore, the owner of the ferret must be driving either the trike or the snowmobile.

From clue 5, we know the owner of the ferret is between the person driving the trike and the person eating asparagus. This means the owner of the ferret cannot be driving the snowmobile, as the snowmobile owner is the lizard owner (clue 6). Therefore, the owner of the ferret must be driving the trike.

Now we have:

* The person driving the trike is the owner of the ferret.
* The person driving the van is the owner of the cat.
* The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
* The person eating artichoke is on the far right.

From clue 1, we know the person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is driving the trike, the owner of the ferret must be on the right of the person driving the trike. This means the person eating asparagus must be on the left of the owner of the ferret.

Now we have:

* The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
* The person eating asparagus is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
* The owner of the ferret is driving the trike.
* The person eating artichoke is on the far right.

From clue 6, we know the person driving the snowmobile is the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the lizard is driving the snowmobile, the lizard must be on the right of the owner of the ferret.

Now we have:

* The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
* The person eating asparagus is on the left of the owner of the ferret.
* The owner of the ferret is driving the trike.
* The lizard is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
* The person eating artichoke is on the far right.

4. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating pomegranate.
Since the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person watching comedy movies, and the person who's hobby is gardening is eating pepper (from statement 2), we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies is not the person who's hobby is gardening.

5. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right.
This statement doesn't give us much information, but it's a good starting point.

6. The person watching comedy movies is on the right of the person eating pomegranate.
This statement is redundant, as we already know this from statement 4.

7. The person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is gardening.
Since the person who's hobby is gardening is eating pepper (from statement 2), and the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is gardening, we can conclude that the person watching time-travel movies is eating pepper.

8. The person watching adventure movies is the person eating pomegranate.
Since the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person watching comedy movies (from statement 4), and the person watching adventure movies is the person eating pomegranate, we can conclude that the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |      2      |   3    |    4    |
| Food          |  Pepper    |  Lettuce   |  Orange | Pomegranate |
| Hobby         |  Gardening |  Collecting |  Dancing |  Baking   |
| Movie-Genre   |  Time-travel|  Comedy    |  Adventure|  Fantasy  |
#############

Here's the solution:

* The person who's hobby is gardening is eating pepper and watching time-travel movies.
* The person eating lettuce is between the person eating orange and the person who's hobby is collecting.
* The person who's hobby is collecting is eating orange.
* The person who's hobby is dancing is eating pomegranate and watching fantasy movies.
* The person who's hobby is baking is watching comedy movies.

Note that statement 3 doesn't give us enough information to determine the exact order of the people, but we can still fill in the table based on the other statements."
