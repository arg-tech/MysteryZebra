Lv1-4x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the fan of trance.
2. The fan of blues is on the left of the person driving the motorbike.
3. The person who's hobby is baking is between the person watching spy movies and the person watching superhero movies.
4. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
5. The fan of trance is the person watching spy movies.

From statement 1, we know the bus driver is on the right of the trance fan. From statement 2, we know the blues fan is on the left of the motorbike driver. We can combine these two statements to get:

Bus Driver -> Trance Fan -> Blues Fan -> Motorbike Driver

From statement 4, we know the bus driver is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the bus driver is already placed, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the bus driver.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is baking is between the person watching spy movies and the person watching superhero movies. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is already placed, we can conclude that the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking, and the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

Now we have:

Bus Driver -> Dancing -> Baking -> Spy Movies -> Superhero Movies

From statement 5, we know the fan of trance is the person watching spy movies. We can place the trance fan on the right of the bus driver, as stated in statement 1.

Finally, we can place the blues fan on the left of the motorbike driver, as stated in statement 2.

2. The Pakistani is on the left of the fan of soul.
3. The person eating raspberry is the Pakistani.
4. The person eating kale is the Japanese.
5. The owner of the frog is between the fan of gospel and the person eating tomato.

Lv1-4x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
This means the person watching thriller movies is either in the middle or on the right.

2. The owner of the chinchilla is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies.
This means the paramedic is on the left of the chinchilla owner, and the chinchilla owner is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.

3. The person eating eggplant is on the far left.
This means the person eating eggplant is in the first column.

4. The owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale.
This means the person eating kale is in the second column.

5. The owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies.
This means the person watching mystery movies is in the second column (since the chinchilla owner is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

From clue 4, the owner of the goldfish is the person eating kale, so:

| Food          | Eggplant | Kale      |          |
| Job           |           |           |          |

From clue 5, the owner of the chinchilla is the person watching mystery movies, and the chinchilla owner is between the paramedic and the person watching thriller movies. This means the paramedic is on the left of the chinchilla owner, and the chinchilla owner is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the chinchilla owner is in the second column, the paramedic must be in the first column.

| Food          | Eggplant | Kale      |          |
| Job           | Doctor   |           | Paramedic |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Mystery  | Thriller  |
| Pet           |           | Goldfish | Chinchilla |

From clue 1, the bartender is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Since the paramedic is in the first column, the bartender must be in the third column.

| Food          | Eggplant | Kale      |          |
| Job           | Doctor   |           | Paramedic |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Mystery  | Thriller  |

The remaining food options are cherry and raspberry. Since the paramedic and cat owner are on the left side, the paramedic must eat cherry (since the cat owner already has the raspberry). This means the scientist eats cucumber.

6. The person driving the bike is the Nigerian.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking 7up is on the far left. From statement 4, we know the person eating papaya is also on the far left. Since there can only be one person on the far left, we can conclude that the person drinking 7up is also eating papaya.

From statement 6, we know the Nigerian is driving the bike. Since the Nigerian is between the person driving the taxi and the Russian (statement 1), the Nigerian cannot be on the far left. Therefore, the Nigerian must be on the right of the person driving the taxi.

From statement 2, we know the person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the Nigerian is on the right of the person driving the taxi, the person eating peas must be on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

This means that the social-worker's hobby is not traveling (since traveling's sport is sailing), so it must be either chess or drawing.

5. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the engineer.
This means that the engineer is not driving the taxi, so the taxi driver must be either the project-manager or the social-worker.

6. The person driving the roller is the person who's sport is lacrosse.
