Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the hamster.
2. The owner of the hamster is on the far right.
3. The owner of the cat is on the left of the owner of the pony.
4. The owner of the horse is between the owner of the ferret and the owner of the rabbit.
5. The owner of the horse is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.

From statement 2, we know the hamster is on the far right. From statement 1, we know the pony is on the left of the hamster, so the pony is second from the right.

From statement 3, we know the cat is on the left of the pony, so the cat is first.

From statement 5, we know the horse is on the left of the rabbit. Since the pony is second from the right, the horse must be third from the right.

From statement 4, we know the horse is between the ferret and the rabbit. Since the horse is third from the right, the ferret must be first or second from the left, and the rabbit must be fourth from the left.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|       |   1    |   2   |   3    |  4  |  5   |    6    |
| Pet   |  Cat  | ?   |  Horse | ?  |  Pony | Hamster |

From the above analysis, we know the cat is first, the pony is second from the right, and the horse is third from the right. The ferret and rabbit must be in the remaining two positions, with the ferret on the left of the horse and the rabbit on the right of the horse.

So, the final solution is:
