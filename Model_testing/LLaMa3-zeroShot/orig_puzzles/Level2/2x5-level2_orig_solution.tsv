4. The person drinking mirinda is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of funk.
5. The fan of hip-hop is on the far right.
6. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of salsa. Let's call the fan of salsa ""S"".

From statement 2, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking milk. Let's call the person drinking milk ""M"". This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of M.

From statement 3, we know that the fan of rock is on the left of the fan of salsa. Let's call the fan of rock ""R"". This means that R is to the left of S.

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking mirinda is between the fan of hip-hop and the fan of funk. Let's call the fan of hip-hop ""H"" and the fan of funk ""F"". This means that the person drinking mirinda is between H and F.

From statement 5, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the far right. This means that H is on the far right.

From statement 6, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means that the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

Now, let's combine the information:

* R is to the left of S
* M is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate
* The person drinking sprite is to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate
* The person drinking mirinda is between H and F
* H is on the far right

Here's the final solution table with the correct order:

Note that the person drinking soy-milk is not mentioned in the puzzle, so we can't determine its position."
Lv1-2x5-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the middle.
2. The person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
3. The person who's sport is cricket is the engineer.
4. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the project-manager.
5. The person who's sport is rowing is between the nurse and the coach.
6. The nurse is on the left of the engineer.

From clue 3, we know the engineer's sport is cricket. From clue 2, we know the engineer is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means the engineer is in the middle, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the engineer.

From clue 6, we know the nurse is on the left of the engineer. This means the nurse is on the left of the engineer, who is in the middle. The nurse is therefore on the leftmost position.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is rowing is between the nurse and the coach. Since the nurse is on the leftmost position, the coach must be on the right of the nurse.

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the project-manager. Since the nurse is on the leftmost position, the project-manager must be on the right of the nurse.

Now we have a rough idea of the layout:

|         |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4     |   5    |
| Job     |          |                 |            |          |        |
| Sport   |          |                 |            |          |        |

Nurse (swimming) |? | Engineer (cricket) |? | Project-manager |? | Coach (rowing)

The only remaining positions are the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the writer. From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the middle. Since the engineer is already in the middle, the person who's sport is ice-hockey must be the writer.

The final solution is:

#############
|         |    1     |        2        |     3      |    4     |   5    |
| Job     |          |                 |            |          |        |
| Sport   |          |                 |            |          |        |
| Nurse   | swimming |                 | engineer | project-manager | coach | rowing |
| Writer  | ice-hockey |                 |          |          |          |
#############

Note that the writer's job is not specified, but we can deduce that the writer is not the coach, engineer, nurse, or project-manager, as those jobs are already assigned. The writer could be the coach, but we can't determine the writer's job with certainty based on the given clues."
