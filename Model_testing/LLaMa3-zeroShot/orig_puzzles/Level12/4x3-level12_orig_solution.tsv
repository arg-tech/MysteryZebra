Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is the photographer.

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is swimming is not the photographer, so the photographer is not the person who's sport is swimming.

From statement 6, we know the scientist and the person who's sport is swimming have the same parity positions. Since the photographer is not the person who's sport is swimming, the scientist must be the person who's sport is swimming.

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is swimming and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions. Since the scientist is the person who's sport is swimming, the scientist must also be the person eating tomato.

From statement 7, we know the person eating plum is on the left of the person eating tomato. Since the scientist is the person eating tomato, the scientist must also be the person eating plum.

From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the scientist is already placed, the person who's sport is baseball must be to the left of the scientist.

From statement 10, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the scientist is already placed, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be to the right of the scientist.

Now we can start filling in the table:

9. The Spanish is not the person driving the subway or the Spanish is not the person who's sport is rugby or both.
10. The person watching thriller movies is not to the right of the Spanish.

From statement 1, we know the bike driver is between the Japanese and the Spanish. Let's assume the Japanese is to the left of the bike driver. Then, the Spanish must be to the right of the bike driver.

From statement 4, we know the Japanese is not to the right of the ship driver. Since the Japanese is already assumed to be to the left of the bike driver, the ship driver must be to the right of the bike driver.

From statement 2, we know the golf player is not to the right of the subway driver. Since the bike driver is between the Japanese and the Spanish, the subway driver must be to the left of the bike driver. This means the golf player is to the left of the bike driver.

From statement 7, we know the badminton player is to the left of the golf player. This means the badminton player is to the left of the bike driver.

From statement 3, we know the mystery movie watcher is on the left or right of the golf player. Since the golf player is to the left of the bike driver, the mystery movie watcher must be either to the left of the golf player or to the right of the bike driver.

From statement 5, we know the adventure movie watcher is not to the right of the rugby player. Since the bike driver is between the Japanese and the Spanish, the rugby player must be to the right of the bike driver. This means the adventure movie watcher is to the left of the bike driver.

From statement 6, we know the adventure movie watcher is not the rugby player. This means the adventure movie watcher is to the left of the bike driver, and the rugby player is to the right of the bike driver.

From statement 9, we know the Spanish is not the subway driver or the rugby player, or both. Since the Spanish is already assumed to be to the right of the bike driver, the Spanish must be the thriller movie watcher.

From statement 10, we know the thriller movie watcher (Spanish) is not to the right of the Spanish. This means the Spanish is the first person in the table.

2. The person eating peas is not to the left of the person who's hobby is reading.

This means that the person eating peas is either in position 2 or 3. We can't determine which one yet, but we'll come back to this later.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is not the person eating nectarine or the owner of the rabbit or both.

This means that the traveling person is not eating nectarine, and they're not the owner of the rabbit. We can't determine their food or pet yet, but we'll come back to this later.

4. The owner of the goat is on the left of the fan soul.

This means that the goat owner is in position 1 or 2, and the soul fan is in position 2 or 3. We can't determine the exact position yet, but we'll come back to this later.

5. The person who's hobby is reading and the person eating radish have the same parity positions.

This means that the reading person (who eats nectarine) and the radish-eater have the same parity (i.e., they're either both odd or both even). We can't determine the exact position yet, but we'll come back to this later.

6. The person who's hobby is card-games and the person eating peas have the same parity positions.

This means that the card-games person and the peas-eater have the same parity. We can't determine the exact position yet, but we'll come back to this later.

7. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.

This means that the nectarine-eater (who is also the reading person) is in position 1, and the rabbit owner is in position 2 or 3.

8. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the left of the fan pop.

This means that the rabbit owner is in position 1 or 2, and the pop fan is in position 2 or 3.

* The reading person eats nectarine and is in position 1.
* The rabbit owner is in position 2 or 3.
* The goat owner is in position 1 or 2, and the soul fan is in position 2 or 3.
* The card-games person and the peas-eater have the same parity.
* The radish-eater has the same parity as the reading person.

From the above, we can deduce the following:

* The peas-eater is in position 2 or 3, since the card-games person and the peas-eater have the same parity.
* The radish-eater is in position 3, since the reading person and the radish-eater have the same parity, and the reading person is in position 1.
* The goat owner is in position 1, since the goat owner is on the left of the soul fan, and the soul fan is in position 2 or 3.
* The rabbit owner is in position 2, since the reading person is in position 1 and the rabbit owner is to the right of the reading person.
* The pop fan is in position 3, since the rabbit owner is in position 2 and the pop fan is to the right of the rabbit owner.

Here's the final solution table:

This means that either the person drinking water is the fan salsa or the person with the hobby magic-tricks is the fan salsa.

3. The fan hip-hop is somewhere to the left of the fan salsa.
This means that if the fan salsa is the person drinking water, then the fan hip-hop is the person drinking mirinda. If the fan salsa is the person with the hobby magic-tricks, then the fan hip-hop is the person drinking water.

4. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
This means that the person watching sports movies is either the first or second row.

5. The person drinking mirinda is the person who's hobby is writing.
This means that the person drinking mirinda is either the first or second row.

6. The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan dubstep or the fan dubstep is not the person drinking mirinda or both.
This means that the person drinking mirinda (who has the hobby writing) cannot be the fan dubstep.

7. The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person watching action movies.
This means that if the person drinking water is the fan salsa, then the person watching action movies is either the second or third row. If the person drinking water is not the fan salsa, then the person watching action movies is either the first or second row.

8. The person watching sports movies is on the far left.
This means that the person watching sports movies is in the first row.

Now, let's fill in the table:

The person watching sports movies is in the first row, drinking water. The person drinking mirinda has the hobby writing, so they are in the second row. The person drinking iced-tea watches comedy movies, so they are in the third row. The fan dubstep is not yet determined, but we know they are not the person drinking mirinda. The fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa, so they are either in the first or second row. The fan salsa is either the person drinking water or the person with the hobby magic-tricks, but we don't have enough information to determine which one yet.

Let's try to determine the fan dubstep:

* If the fan dubstep is in the first row, then they cannot be the fan hip-hop (since the fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa). But then the fan salsa would be the person drinking water, and the person with the hobby magic-tricks would be the fan hip-hop. This would mean that the person with the hobby magic-tricks is the fan salsa, which contradicts the information in statement 2. So the fan dubstep cannot be in the first row.
* If the fan dubstep is in the second row, then they cannot be the fan hip-hop (since the fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa). But then the fan salsa would be the person with the hobby magic-tricks, and the person drinking water would be the fan hip-hop. This would mean that the person drinking water is the fan hip-hop, which contradicts the information in statement 3. So the fan dubstep cannot be in the second row.
* If the fan dubstep is in the third row, then they can be the fan hip-hop (since the fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa). But then the fan salsa would be the person drinking water, and the person with the hobby magic-tricks would be the fan dubstep. This would mean that the person with the hobby magic-tricks is the fan dubstep, which is consistent with the information in statement 2.

So the fan dubstep is in the third row. The fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa, so they are in the second row. The fan salsa is either the person drinking water or the person with the hobby magic-tricks, but we don't have enough information to determine which one yet.
