#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 7 and 22, we know the owner of the chinchilla is not to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 3 or 4.
2. From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. From clue 16, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the person driving the motorbike is not the person who's sport is badminton (from clue 39), the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2.
3. From clue 14, we know the person drinking milk is between the person who's hobby is writing and the person who's hobby is sudoku. From clue 47, we know the person who's hobby is writing is in the middle, so the person drinking milk must be in position 4.
4. From clue 25, we know the person who's sport is swimming is not the owner of the snake or the person driving the jet-ski is not the person who's sport is swimming. From clue 56, we know the person who's sport is swimming is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Therefore, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 6.
5. From clue 28, we know the person driving the quad-bike is the person watching crime movies or the person driving the quad-bike is the person drinking tea. From clue 57, we know the owner of the frog is between the person watching crime movies and the person drinking cola. Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3.
6. From clue 31, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. From clue 59, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving and the owner of the horse have the same parity positions. Therefore, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 7.
7. From clue 42, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person who's hobby is collecting or the person who's hobby is collecting is not the person drinking mirinda. From clue 40, we know the person driving the motorbike and the person who's hobby is collecting have the same parity positions. Therefore, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 2.
8. From clue 45, we know the person watching scientific movies and the owner of the mouse have the same parity positions. From clue 51, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is not the person who's sport is cricket. Therefore, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 5.
9. From clue 46, we know the person driving the quad-bike and the person who's sport is water-polo have different parity positions. From clue 27, we know the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Therefore, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3.
10. From clue 48, we know the owner of the frog is the person who's sport is basketball or the owner of the frog is the person drinking tea, but not both. From clue 58, we know the person who's hobby is singing is not to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Therefore, the owner of the frog must be in position 2.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."
