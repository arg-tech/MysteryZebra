Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the coach.
2. From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the coach is the person who's sport is swimming, the person who's sport is climbing must be on the left of the coach.
3. From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the coach is already placed, the scientist must be on the right of the coach.
4. From statement 14, we know the fan r&b is between the scientist and the fan rock. Since the scientist is on the right of the coach, the fan r&b must be on the right of the coach.
5. From statement 16, we know the coach is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the coach is already placed, the person who's sport is tennis must be on the right of the coach.
6. From statement 19, we know the coach is not the person who's sport is climbing or the person who's sport is climbing is not the fan r&b or both. Since the coach is already placed, the person who's sport is climbing must be the fan r&b.
7. From statement 21, we know the fan dubstep and the freelancer have the same parity positions. Since the fan dubstep is not yet placed, the freelancer must be on the left of the fan dubstep.
8. From statement 22, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is somewhere between the scientist and the fan electronic. Since the scientist is already placed, the person who's sport is water-polo must be on the right of the scientist.
9. From statement 15, we know the paramedic and the person who's sport is tennis have different parity positions. Since the paramedic is not yet placed, the paramedic must be on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.
10. From statement 20, we know the fan rock is somewhere to the left of the fan gospel. Since the fan rock is already placed, the fan gospel must be on the right of the fan rock.
11. From statement 4, we know the fan electronic is not to the right of the fan dubstep. Since the fan dubstep is not yet placed, the fan electronic must be on the left of the fan dubstep.
12. From statement 18, we know the fan r&b is not to the left of the fan dubstep. Since the fan r&b is already placed, the fan dubstep must be on the right of the fan r&b.
13. From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the fan rock or the person who's sport is swimming is the coach, but not both. Since the person who's sport is swimming is already placed, the fan rock must be the person who's sport is swimming.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 15, we know the owner of the pony is the dancer.
2. From statement 27, we know the photographer is on the far left, and since the photographer is not the person watching musical movies (statement 9), the photographer must be watching western movies.
3. From statement 19, we know the person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies, so the person watching musical movies must be on the far right.

5. From statement 22, we know the person watching epic movies is not the writer or the owner of the bird, so the person watching epic movies must be the designer.
6. From statement 24, we know the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the designer, so the owner of the rat must be the paramedic.
7. From statement 12, we know the writer is between the person watching action movies and the paramedic, so the writer must be watching crime movies.
8. From statement 1, we know the person watching action movies is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig, and since the owner of the guinea-pig is not to the right of the owner of the bird (statement 16), the owner of the guinea-pig must be the photographer.
9. From statement 25, we know the owner of the ferret is not to the left of the person watching action movies, so the owner of the ferret must be the person watching family movies.

|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 12, we know the musician is either the person driving the van or the person who's sport is skateboarding. From clue 2, we know the musician is on the left of the project-manager, so the musician must be the person driving the van.
2. From clue 15, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is the person driving the bus. From clue 19, we know this person is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bike, so the bike driver must be the social-worker.
3. From clue 16, we know the person who's sport is swimming is between the musician and the social-worker. Since the musician is driving the van, the swimming person must be the paramedic.
4. From clue 17, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far right, so it must be the writer.
5. From clue 10, we know the photographer is somewhere to the right of the project-manager. From clue 1, we know the photographer is between the person who's sport is tennis and the person driving the bike. Since the bike driver is the social-worker, the photographer must be the person who's sport is tennis.
6. From clue 14, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the skateboard driver is the musician, the skateboarding person must be the project-manager.
7. From clue 20, we know the person driving the snowmobile is in an even position. Since the writer is on the far right, the snowmobile driver must be the photographer.
8. From clue 21, we know the paramedic is somewhere to the left of the project-manager. Since the paramedic is already placed, this clue doesn't add any new information.

The final solution table shows the correct placement of jobs, sports, and transports."
