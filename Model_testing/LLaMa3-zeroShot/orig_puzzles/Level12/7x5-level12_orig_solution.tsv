4. From clues 8, 10, and 26, we can deduce that the person eating grapes is either the musician or the person watching disaster movies, but not both, the person driving the subway is between the person driving the trike and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, and the person watching action movies is not the person driving the subway or the owner of the chinchilla.

9. From clues 20, 23, and 40, we can deduce that the person watching disaster movies is not the person eating radish, the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's hobby is cooking have the same parity positions, and the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's sport is skiing have the same parity positions.
10. From clues 24, 27, and 30, we can deduce that the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball, the person who's sport is baseball is not the owner of the rat or the person who's sport is baseball is not the person driving the bike, and the person driving the helicopter is either the person eating raspberry or the person eating raspberry is the owner of the mouse.

12. From clues 37, 39, and 42, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is hiking is the person driving the trike or the person who's hobby is hiking is the person eating grapes, the person watching family movies is to the right of the videographer, and the person watching family movies is to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
13. From clues 44 and 45, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is cooking is to the left of the person who's sport is cycling, and the person eating pumpkin is not the owner of the cat.
14. From clues 46 and the above deductions, we can fill in the remaining cells to get the final solution.
