Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the given information to create a rough outline of the table.
2. I then used the constraints to fill in the table, starting from the top and working my way down.
3. I used a combination of logical deductions and process of elimination to figure out the correct values for each cell.
4. I also used the given information to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options for each cell.
5. Finally, I checked the solution to make sure it satisfied all the given constraints.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the one I provided is one possible solution that satisfies all the given constraints."
