#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the owner of the ferret has the same parity position as the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person driving the airplane (statement 12), the owner of the ferret must be on the right side of the table.
2. From statement 3, we know the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Since the person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the train (statement 3), the person driving the trike must be on the right side of the table, but not the far right.
3. From statement 4, we know the owner of the bird is either the person who's sport is biathlon or the owner of the bird is the person driving the train, or both.

13. From statement 14, we know the person driving the train is not the person who's sport is water-polo or the person who's sport is water-polo is not the owner of the frog or both. Since the owner of the frog is on the right side of the table (from statement 15), the person who's sport is water-polo must be on the right side of the table, but not the far right.
14. From statement 15, we know the owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat is on the left side of the table (from statement 7), the owner of the frog must be on the right side of the table.
15. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is swimming is not to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

| Movie-Genre   | action     | drama    | fantasy  | zombie     | western   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the nurse is between the analyst and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the nurse is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles (statement 4), the nurse must be in position 3.
2. From statement 2, we know the lawyer is on the far right. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is also on the far right (statement 3), the lawyer must be the person who's hobby is fishing.
3. From statement 5, we know the nurse is not to the left of the teacher. Since the nurse is in position 3, the teacher must be in position 1.
4. From statement 6, we know the person watching zombie movies is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person watching zombie movies is not in position 1 (from statement 14), they must be in position 5.

6. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person watching western movies or the person watching western movies is not the accountant or both. Since the person watching western movies is the person who's hobby is fishing (statement 15), the person who's hobby is puzzles cannot be the person watching western movies. Therefore, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in an even position (statement 13), which means they are in position 2 or 4. However, the person who's hobby is cooking is already in position 2, so the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in position 4.
7. From statement 10, we know the person who's hobby is collecting and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the accountant is in position 5, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in an odd position. Therefore, they are in position 1.
8. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere between the teacher and the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the teacher is in position 1, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 2. However, we already know the person who's hobby is cooking is in position 2, so the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in position 3.
9. From statement 12, we know the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4, the person watching western movies must be in position 3 or 5. However, we already know the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 5, so the person watching western movies must be in position 3.
10. From statement 14, we know the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching action movies is in position 5, the person watching drama movies must be in position 4.

Lv1-3x5-9	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the people's food, hobby, and sport preferences:

#############
|         |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |     5      |

| Hobby   | Puzzles  | Reading   | Board-games | Chess    | Rock-climbing |
| Sport   | Cycling  | Swimming  | Handball  | Volleyball | Snowboarding |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position, so they must be in position 3 or 5.
* From clue 4, the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is chess, so they must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 3, the person who's sport is swimming is between the person who's hobby is chess and the person eating grapefruit, so they must be in position 2.
* From clue 5, the person who's hobby is reading is not the person eating grapefruit, so they must be in position 4 or 5.
* From clue 6, the person who's sport is handball is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so they must be in position 5.
* From clue 7, the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing have the same parity positions, so they must both be in odd positions. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in position 5, the person who's sport is volleyball must be in position 1.
* From clue 8, the person who's sport is cycling is in the middle, so they must be in position 3.
* From clue 9, the person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is reading, so they must be in position 1.
* From clue 10, the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person eating tomato, so they must be in position 3 or 5.
* From clue 11, the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles, so they must be in position 3.

* From clue 13, the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person eating garlic, so they must be in position 3.
* From clue 14, the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person eating tomato have the same parity positions, so they must both be in even positions. Since the person eating tomato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, they must be in position 5.
* From clue 15, the person eating tomato is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, so they must be in position 5.
* From clue 16, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is board-games, so they must be in position 4.
* From clue 17, the person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position, so they must be in position 1 or 3.
* From clue 18, the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person eating grapefruit, so they must be in position 4 or 5.
