#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 15 and 29, we know the brazilian is the person drinking almond-milk or the owner of the chinchilla. Since the brazilian can't be the owner of the chinchilla (from clue 28), they must be the person drinking almond-milk.
2. From clue 51, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the colombian is not the owner of the chinchilla (from clue 52), the colombian must be the person who's sport is surfing.
3. From clue 50, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the colombian. Since the colombian is the person who's sport is surfing, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be on the right of the colombian.
4. From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person watching superhero movies and the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the colombian is the person who's sport is surfing, the person watching superhero movies must be on the left of the colombian.
