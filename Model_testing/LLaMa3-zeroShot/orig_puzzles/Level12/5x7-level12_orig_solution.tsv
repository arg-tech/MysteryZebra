Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the clues to eliminate possibilities for each job, movie genre, music genre, nationality, and sport.
2. I used the clues to establish relationships between the different jobs, movie genres, music genres, nationalities, and sports.
3. I used the clues to determine the parity positions of each person (i.e., whether they are on the left or right of another person).
4. I used the clues to determine the final positions of each person in the table.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the above solution is one possible solution that satisfies all the given clues."

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clues 10 and 18, we know the person eating eggplant is the Italian and is either drinking water or has sport sailing.
2. From clue 16, we know the person who's sport is cricket is not the Italian, so the Italian must be drinking water.
3. From clue 38, we know the person watching drama movies is either the Italian or the person eating eggplant, but not both. Since the Italian is already eating eggplant, the person watching drama movies must be the Italian.
4. From clue 39, we know the person eating banana is on the left of the person drinking milk. Since the Italian is eating eggplant and drinking water, the person eating banana must be the Spanish.
5. From clue 41, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the Malaysian or the Malaysian is not eating kiwi, but both. Since the Malaysian is not eating kiwi, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be the British.
6. From clue 47, we know the Colombian is either the person who's sport is cricket or the person watching thriller movies. Since the Colombian is not the person who's sport is cricket (from clue 16), the Colombian must be the person watching thriller movies.
7. From clue 49, we know the person eating garlic is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the Colombian is watching thriller movies, the person eating garlic must be the Brazilian.
8. From clue 50, we know the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the Italian is drinking water, the person drinking soy-milk must be the American.
9. From clue 52, we know the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since the Spanish is eating banana, the person watching family movies must be the Malaysian.
10. From clue 54, we know the person eating spinach is the person watching horror movies or the Spanish is the person eating spinach, but not both. Since the Spanish is already eating banana, the person eating spinach must be the British.
11. From clue 55, we know the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the Colombian is watching thriller movies, the person drinking cola must be the Brazilian.
12. From clue 56, we know the person drinking cola is between the person who's sport is sailing and the British. Since the British is drinking hot-chocolate, the person drinking cola must be the Colombian.
13. From clue 57, we know the Malaysian is somewhere to the right of the person eating garlic. Since the Brazilian is eating garlic, the Malaysian must be on the right of the Brazilian.
14. From clue 58, we know the Italian is not the person eating spinach or the person who's sport is sailing is not the Italian, but both. Since the Italian is already eating eggplant, the person who's sport is sailing must be the American.
15. From clue 59, we know the person who's sport is cricket and the person drinking hot-chocolate have different parity positions. Since the Colombian is watching thriller movies, the person who's sport is cricket must be the Brazilian.

The rest of the solution follows from these deductions."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clues 8 and 43, we know the malaysian is in an even position and is either the person eating strawberry or the person drinking hot-chocolate. From clue 2, we know the egyptian and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions, so the malaysian cannot be the person drinking coffee. Therefore, the malaysian is the person eating strawberry.
2. From clue 25, we know the fan r&b is on the right of the entrepreneur. From clue 46, we know the fan r&b is not to the left of the person eating strawberry. Therefore, the fan r&b is on the right of the entrepreneur and to the left of the person eating strawberry.
3. From clue 21, we know the lawyer is between the analyst and the person drinking milk. From clue 32, we know the person drinking milk is on the left of the russian. Therefore, the lawyer is between the analyst and the russian.
4. From clue 27, we know the fan country is on the left of the russian. From clue 34, we know the fan salsa is on the left of the fan ambient. Therefore, the fan country is on the left of the fan salsa, which is on the left of the russian.
5. From clue 30, we know the person eating pomegranate is between the person eating grapes and the person eating carrot. From clue 55, we know the person eating grapes is not the entrepreneur. Therefore, the person eating pomegranate is between the entrepreneur and the person eating carrot.
6. From clue 45, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the brazilian. From clue 53, we know the fan folk is the person drinking soy-milk. Therefore, the brazilian is the fan folk.
7. From clue 50, we know the person eating grapefruit is somewhere between the fan reggae and the police-officer. From clue 56, we know the fan salsa is not the person drinking soy-milk or the fan salsa is not the photographer. Therefore, the fan salsa is the police-officer, and the person eating grapefruit is between the fan reggae and the fan salsa.
8. From clue 51, we know the person eating pear is not to the right of the musician. From clue 58, we know the person eating grapes is not the fan folk or the fan folk is not the photographer. Therefore, the person eating pear is to the left of the musician.
9. From clue 52, we know the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person eating grapefruit. From clue 57, we know the person drinking milk is not to the right of the french. Therefore, the person drinking milk is to the left of the person eating grapefruit and to the right of the french.
10. From clue 49, we know the russian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. From clue 54, we know the person eating strawberry is in an even position. Therefore, the russian is to the right of the person eating strawberry and drinking water.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the constraints to eliminate possibilities for each person's hobby, job, pet, sport, and transport.
2. I then used the parity constraints (e.g. #9, #17, #22, etc.) to determine the relative positions of the people.
3. I used the constraints involving the firefighter, nurse, and photographer to determine their positions.
4. I used the constraints involving the owner of the horse, guinea-pig, and ferret to determine their positions.
5. I used the constraints involving the person driving the trike, roller, and taxi to determine their positions.
6. I used the constraints involving the person who's hobby is traveling to determine their position.
7. I used the constraints involving the person who's sport is golf to determine their position.
8. I used the constraints involving the person who's hobby is puzzles to determine their position.
9. I used the constraints involving the person who's hobby is reading to determine their position.
10. I used the constraints involving the person who's hobby is singing to determine their position.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions to this puzzle, but the above solution is one possible solution that satisfies all the constraints."
