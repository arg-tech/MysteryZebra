Lv1-6x3-1	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know the Dutch is to the left of the person driving the trike. Let's call the Dutch person D.

From clue 5, we know the Dutch is not the person drinking sprite or the Dutch is not the fan indie or both. Since the Dutch is already placed, we can conclude that the Dutch is not the fan indie.

From clue 2, we know the fan reggae is between the person drinking juice and the writer. Let's call the person drinking juice J. Since the fan reggae is between J and the writer, the writer must be to the right of J.

From clue 11, we know the person drinking fanta is not the person who's hobby is sudoku or the person drinking fanta is not the musician or both. Since the person drinking fanta is not the musician (from clue 14), the person drinking fanta must be the person who's hobby is sudoku.

From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is sudoku, the person who's hobby is collecting must be to the left of the person drinking fanta.

From clue 8, we know the Indian is on the left or right of the scientist. Since the Indian is not the Dutch (from clue 5), the Indian must be the person who's hobby is collecting (from clue 14).

From clue 6, we know the person driving the trike and the fan indie have different parity positions. Since the Dutch is not the fan indie (from clue 5), the person driving the trike must be the fan indie.

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is chess is not the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa is to the right of the person driving the van (from clue 7), the person who's hobby is chess must be to the left of the person driving the van.

From clue 9, we know the person drinking fanta is not the person driving the trike. Since the person drinking fanta is the person who's hobby is sudoku, the person driving the trike must be the fan indie (from clue 6).

From clue 4, we know the person driving the ship and the writer have the same parity positions. Since the writer is to the right of J (from clue 2), the person driving the ship must also be to the right of J.

From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku and the Indonesian have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person drinking fanta, the Indonesian must be the person driving the van.

From clue 12, we know the Indonesian is to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the Indonesian is the person driving the van, the person drinking juice must be to the left of the person driving the van.

From clue 13, we know the musician and the Indonesian have different parity positions. Since the Indonesian is the person driving the van, the musician must be the person driving the ship.

| Transport     |  jet-ski  |  quad-bike|  bike     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person drinking lemonade and eating cherry have the same parity positions. From statement 3, we know the person watching adventure movies is eating cherry, so the person drinking lemonade is also watching adventure movies.
2. From statement 5, we know the person watching family movies is between the paramedic and the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is eating cherry, the person watching family movies must be eating radish.
3. From statement 11, we know the person eating watermelon is in the middle. Since the person eating watermelon is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike (statement 14), the person eating watermelon must be in position 2.
4. From statement 15, we know the fan disco is in the middle, which means the person eating watermelon (in position 2) is also the fan disco.
5. From statement 10, we know the person drinking milk is not the person driving the quad-bike or the accountant is not the person drinking milk. Since the person driving the quad-bike is not the person drinking milk (statement 10), the accountant must be the person drinking milk.

7. From statement 13, we know the person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the fan country. Since the fan country is not in the solution (we've already assigned the music-genres), this statement is irrelevant.
8. From statement 6, we know the person watching family movies is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is the accountant (statement 10), the person watching family movies must be to the left of the accountant.
9. From statement 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since the person watching family movies is to the left of the accountant (statement 6), the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 3.

4. From statement 8, we know the person driving the quad-bike is not a fan of classical music. From statement 1, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Combining these, we can conclude that the person driving the quad-bike is the fan pop (since the fan pop is not a fan of classical music).
5. From statement 9, we know the owner of the goldfish is not a fan of R&B. From statement 14, we know the fan pop and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions. Since the fan pop is the owner of the bird, the owner of the goldfish must be the fan pop's opposite (i.e., the fan of classical music).
6. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person driving the car. From statement 11, we know the person drinking water is to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Combining these, we can conclude that the person drinking water is the person driving the car.
7. From statement 15, we know the person drinking iced-tea is between the fan pop and the person who's sport is tennis. Since the fan pop is the owner of the bird, and the person drinking iced-tea is between the fan pop and the person who's sport is tennis, the person drinking iced-tea must be the owner of the chinchilla.
8. Finally, we can fill in the remaining positions based on the above conclusions:

* The person driving the car is the fan of R&B (from statement 5).
* The person watching musical movies is to the right of the person driving the car (from statement 3).
* The person drinking water is the person driving the car (from statement 11).
* The person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the chinchilla (from statement 15).
* The person watching documentary movies is the person who's sport is golf (from statement 7).
* The person driving the quad-bike is the fan pop (from statement 8).
* The owner of the goldfish is the fan of classical music (from statement 9).
* The owner of the bird is the fan pop (from statement 1).

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the person watching crime movies is not the person driving the roller, and the person who's hobby is hiking is not the person watching crime movies. This means the person watching crime movies is either the person driving the van or the person driving the snowmobile.
2. From clue 2, we know the person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position. Since there are only 3 positions, this means the person driving the snowmobile is in position 2.
3. From clue 3, we know the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is not in position 2 (from clue 2), the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.
4. From clue 4, we know the fan of R&B is somewhere to the right of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic is not in position 1 (from clue 9), the fan of R&B must be in position 3.
5. From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is not to the right of the fan of R&B. Since the fan of R&B is in position 3, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 1.
6. From clue 6, we know the person drinking cola is not the person watching epic movies. Since the person watching epic movies is not in position 1 (from clue 14), the person drinking cola must be in position 3.
7. From clue 7, we know the person driving the roller is in an odd position. Since the person driving the roller is not in position 2 (from clue 2), the person driving the roller must be in position 3.
8. From clue 8, we know the person drinking juice is not the fan of electronic. Since the fan of electronic is not in position 1 (from clue 9), the person drinking juice must be in position 2.
9. From clue 9, we know the fan of electronic is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 1, the fan of electronic must be in position 2.
10. From clue 10, we know the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the person driving the snowmobile must be in position 3.
11. From clue 11, we know the fan of salsa and the person watching zombie movies have the same parity positions. Since the fan of salsa is not in position 1 (from clue 4), the person watching zombie movies must be in position 1.
12. From clue 12, we know the owner of the horse is not to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person who's hobby is baking is not in position 1 (from clue 5), the owner of the horse must be in position 3.
13. From clue 13, we know the fan of electronic is the person drinking lemonade or the person drinking lemonade is the person driving the van, but not both. Since the fan of electronic is in position 2, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1.
14. From clue 14, we know the person watching epic movies is the owner of the horse or the fan of R&B is the person watching epic movies, but not both. Since the owner of the horse is in position 3, the person watching epic movies must be in position 3.
15. From clue 15, we know the person watching crime movies is the person drinking lemonade or the person watching crime movies is the person driving the roller or both. Since the person drinking lemonade is in position 1, the person watching crime movies must be in position 1.
16. From clue 16, we know the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not in position 1 (from clue 5), the owner of the cat must be in position 1.

By combining these clues, we arrive at the final solution table."
