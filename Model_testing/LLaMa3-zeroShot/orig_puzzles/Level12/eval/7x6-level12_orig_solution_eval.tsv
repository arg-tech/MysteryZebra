#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clues 2 and 20, we know the fan d&b is the person drinking milk or the person driving the airplane, so the fan d&b is the person drinking milk.
2. From clues 3 and 25, we know the person drinking milk is between the person who's hobby is cooking and the person drinking coffee, and the person drinking milk is the person who's sport is swimming or the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the mouse. Since the person drinking milk is the fan d&b, the person who's sport is swimming is the owner of the mouse.
3. From clues 4 and 11, we know the person who's sport is rugby is not to the right of the fan d&b and the person who's sport is tennis is not to the right of the fan salsa. Since the fan d&b is the person drinking milk, the person who's sport is rugby is to the left of the person drinking milk.
4. From clues 5 and 38, we know the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person driving the van, and the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee. Since the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person drinking coffee, the person driving the quad-bike is the person who's sport is biathlon.
5. From clues 6 and 16, we know the fan reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing and the fan d&b is somewhere between the fan reggae and the spanish. Since the fan reggae is to the left of the person who's sport is climbing, the fan reggae is the person who's hobby is drawing.
6. From clues 7 and 23, we know the person who's hobby is card-games and the fan salsa have different parity positions and the person who's hobby is card-games and the fan techno have the same parity positions. Since the fan salsa is to the right of the fan reggae, the fan salsa is the person who's hobby is singing.
7. From clues 8 and 32, we know the owner of the cat is the person drinking milk or the pakistani is the owner of the cat, but not both. Since the owner of the cat is not the person drinking milk, the owner of the cat is the pakistani.
8. From clues 9 and 14, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the hedgehog or the person who's sport is tennis is the person who's hobby is drawing, but not both. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is not the person who's sport is tennis, the person who's hobby is drawing is the owner of the hedgehog.
9. From clues 10 and 15, we know the person driving the airplane is not the person drinking fanta and the person driving the tram is not to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the airplane is not the person drinking fanta, the person driving the airplane is the fan d&b.
