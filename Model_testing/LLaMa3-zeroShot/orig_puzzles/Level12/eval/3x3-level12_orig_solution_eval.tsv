From statement 1, we know the Pakistani is on the right of the owner of the bird.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the bird is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. This means the owner of the bird must be either in the middle or on the right.

From statement 3, we know the person driving the bus is in an odd position. This means the bus driver must be either in the first or third position.

From statement 4, we know the French is not the owner of the bird or the French is not the person driving the bus or both. This means the French cannot be in the first or second position.

From statement 5, we know the Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the Argentine. This means the Argentine must be in the first or second position.

From statement 6, we know the owner of the dog is not to the left of the French. This means the French must be in the third position.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bus. This means the bus driver must be in the first position, and the owner of the snake must be in the third position.

1. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person driving the bike.
This means the bike driver's sport is not ice-hockey.

2. The person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby.
This means the quad-bike driver's sport is not rugby, or the quad-bike driver is to the right of the rugby player.

3. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
This means the chinchilla owner's sport is not ice-hockey.

4. The person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the chinchilla or the person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or both.
This means the quad-bike driver is not the chinchilla owner, and the quad-bike driver's sport is not ice-hockey.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey or the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the rat or both.
This means the quad-bike driver is not the ice-hockey player, and the quad-bike driver is not the rat owner.

6. The owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the bike.
This means the bike driver is not the rat owner.

7. The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
This means the quad-bike driver is in the first column.

From statement 7, the quad-bike driver is in the first column. From statement 5, the quad-bike driver is not the rat owner. So, the rat owner must be in the second column.

From statement 6, the bike driver is not the rat owner. So, the bike driver must be in the third column.

From statement 3, the ice-hockey player is on the left of the chinchilla owner. Since the quad-bike driver is in the first column, the chinchilla owner must be in the second column. This means the ice-hockey player is in the first column.

From statement 3, we know the Indonesian is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn. Since the person eating orange is on the third position, the Indonesian must be on the first position.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the bird is not the person eating orange or the owner of the bird is not the Australian or both. Since the Indonesian is on the first position, the owner of the bird cannot be the Indonesian. Therefore, the owner of the bird must be the Australian.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the person eating pumpkin is on the second position, the owner of the turtle must be on the fourth position.

From statement 6, we know the Australian is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the Australian is on the second position, the owner of the goldfish must be on the third position.

2. The person driving the bike is not the fan trance or the person driving the bike is not the person who's sport is skiing or both.

This means that the bike driver is not a fan of trance, and they are not the person who plays skiing. Let's assume they are not the fan of trance.

3. The fan trance and the person driving the boat have different parity positions.

This means that the fan of trance is either an odd-numbered person or an even-numbered person, while the boat driver is the other parity. Let's assume the fan of trance is an odd-numbered person.

4. The fan reggae is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.

This means that the fan of reggae is either 1st or 2nd, while the person who plays skiing is 3rd.

5. The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

This means that the person who plays golf is either 1st or 2nd, while the person driving the quad-bike is 3rd.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The boat driver is between golf and skateboarding, so they are either 2nd or 3rd.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |    1     |     2      |     3     |
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |           |
| Nationality   |          |            |           |
| Sport         |          |            |           |

From statement 1, we know the Indian is not the one who plays water-polo, so the Indian is either the first or second person. From statement 4, we know the person who plays baseball is on the far left or far right, so they are either the first or third person. Since the Indian is not the one who plays baseball, the Indian is the second person.

From statement 3, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who plays baseball. Since the person who plays baseball is either the first or third person, the person watching scientific movies is either the first or second person. But we already know the Indian is the second person, so the person watching scientific movies is the first person.

From statement 2, we know the person watching romance movies is to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching scientific movies is the first person, the person watching romance movies is the second person.

From statement 5, we know the Russian is either the person watching scientific movies or the person who plays climbing. Since the person watching scientific movies is the first person, the Russian is the first person.

From statement 1, we know the person who plays water-polo is on the right of the Indian. Since the Indian is the second person, the person who plays water-polo is the third person.

From statement 4, we know the person who plays baseball is on the far left or far right. Since the person who plays baseball is not the first person, they are the third person.

Now we can fill in the table:

The final solution is:

The person who plays climbing is the Russian, the person who plays water-polo is the Indian, and the person who plays baseball is the Malaysian."	{'movie-genre': ['sci', 'romance', 'mystery'], 'nationality': ['russian', 'indian', 'malaysian'], 'sport': ['climbing', 'water-polo', 'baseball']}	True	4	False
Lv1-3x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the Turkish person.
2. The journalist is the person who's hobby is card-games or the person who's hobby is card-games is the Thai person.
3. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
4. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
5. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.
6. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Thai person.
7. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the Turkish person or the chef is not the person who's hobby is filmmaking or both.
8. The German person is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

From statement 1, we know the Turkish person is adjacent to the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. From statement 3 and 4, we know the social-worker is to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is to the right of the social-worker.

From statement 2, we know the journalist is either the person who's hobby is card-games or the Thai person. Since the person who's hobby is card-games is already known to be to the right of the social-worker, the journalist must be the Thai person.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the Thai person. This means the journalist (Thai person) is the person who's hobby is card-games.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is not the Turkish person. Since the Turkish person is adjacent to the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be the German person.

From statement 8, we know the German person is not to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the German person is already known to be the person who's hobby is filmmaking, this statement is satisfied.

Now we can fill in the table:
