Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the owner of the frog is either the person eating cauliflower or the American, but not both. Since the American is not to the right of the person watching family movies (statement 6), the American cannot be the owner of the frog. Therefore, the owner of the frog is the person eating cauliflower.

Therefore, the person watching disaster movies must be the fan electronic.
9. From statement 16, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is the person watching disaster movies, the person watching disaster movies is on the right of themselves, which is not possible.
