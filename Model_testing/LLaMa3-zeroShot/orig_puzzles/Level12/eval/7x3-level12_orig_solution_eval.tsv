Since the person driving the boat is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (statement 16), and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is the fan of ambient (statement 12), we can conclude that the fan of ambient is the person driving the boat.
7. From statement 11, we know the person eating kale and the owner of the turtle have different parity positions. Since the person eating kale is Polish, and the owner of the turtle is the person who's hobby is filmmaking (from statement 10), we can conclude that the owner of the turtle is not Polish.
8. From statement 13, we know the mexican is the person eating peas or the person eating peas is the person who's hobby is baking, but not both. Since the person eating peas is on the far right (statement 17), and the mexican is not the person eating kale (from statement 1), we can conclude that the mexican is the person eating peas.
9. From statement 15, we know the person driving the car is the person who's hobby is filmmaking or the person driving the car is the fan of trance, but not both.

9. From clue 18, we know the person driving the van is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the person driving the van is the lawyer, the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 2.
10. From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is baking and the owner of the chinchilla have different parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is baking is in position 2, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1.

| Pet           |  Hamster |  Hedgehog    |  Lizard  |
| Sport         |  Rowing  |  Skateboarding|  Skiing  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the person watching epic movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the owner of the hamster (clue 7), the person watching epic movies must be to the right of the owner of the hamster.
* From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Combining this with clue 7, we can place the owner of the hamster on the far left.
* From clue 3, we know the nigerian is not the owner of the hamster or the nigerian is not the person watching action movies or both. Since the nigerian is on the right of the fan gospel (clue 8) and the fan gospel is in the middle (clue 17), the nigerian must be on the right.
* From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is on the right (clue 1), the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on the left.
* From clue 5, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating kale is on the left (clue 2), the person drinking iced-tea must be on the right.
* From clue 6, we know the person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is between the person eating zucchini and the person watching action movies (clue 15), the person watching action movies must be on the far right.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is not to the left of the person drinking milk. This is already satisfied by clue 4.
* From clue 11, we know the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the hamster is on the far left, the person drinking coffee must be on the left.
* From clue 12, we know the owner of the hamster is not to the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the owner of the hamster is on the far left, the owner of the lizard must be on the right.
* From clue 13, we know the chinese is not the person drinking coffee or the person drinking coffee is not the person who's sport is skateboarding or both. Since the person drinking coffee is on the left, the chinese must be on the right.
* From clue 14, we know the chinese is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left, the chinese must be on the far right.
* From clue 16, we know the japanese is the person eating zucchini or the person eating zucchini is the fan gospel or both. Since the fan gospel is in the middle, the japanese must be eating zucchini.
* From clue 18, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the far right. Since the chinese is on the far right, the person who's sport is skiing must be the chinese.
