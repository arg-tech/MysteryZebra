| Transport   |  Subway |  Roller  |  Scooter |  Boat    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person eating onion is not to the left of the person driving the subway. This means the person eating onion must be in position 3 or 4.
2. From statement 3, we know the owner of the rat is either the person eating onion or the mechanic. Since the person eating onion is in position 3 or 4, the owner of the rat must be in position 1 or 2.
3. From statement 4, we know the owner of the snake is on the left of the person driving the boat. This means the owner of the snake must be in position 1 or 2.
4. From statement 5, we know the fisherman is the person eating artichoke. This means the fisherman must be in position 2.
5. From statement 6, we know the person driving the subway and the nurse have the same parity positions. This means the nurse must be in position 1.
6. From statement 7, we know the person eating apple is not the owner of the rat or the owner of the rat is not the person driving the boat or both. Since the owner of the rat is in position 1 or 2, the person eating apple must be in position 4.
7. From statement 8, we know the person eating zucchini is not to the right of the owner of the horse. This means the person eating zucchini must be in position 1 or 2.
8. From statement 9, we know the fisherman is not to the right of the mechanic. This means the fisherman must be in position 2.
9. From statement 10, we know the person driving the subway is on the right of the person eating zucchini. This means the person eating zucchini must be in position 1.
10. From statement 11, we know the dressmaker is not to the right of the mechanic. This means the dressmaker must be in position 1 or 2.
11. From statement 12, we know the fisherman is not the person driving the roller. This means the person driving the roller must be in position 3 or 4.
12. From statement 13, we know the person driving the boat is not the person eating apple. This means the person driving the boat must be in position 2 or 3.
13. From statement 14, we know the person driving the scooter is between the person eating artichoke and the person driving the roller. This means the person driving the scooter must be in position 2.
14. From statement 15, we know the person eating onion and the dressmaker have the same parity positions. This means the dressmaker must be in position 3.
15. From statement 16, we know the person eating onion is not to the left of the person eating zucchini. This means the person eating onion must be in position 3.
16. From statement 17, we know the owner of the rat is not to the left of the person eating onion. This means the owner of the rat must be in position 2.

By combining these statements, we can deduce the final solution. The dressmaker is in position 3, the nurse is in position 1, the fisherman is in position 2, and the person eating apple is in position 4. The owner of the rat is in position 2, the owner of the snake is in position 1, and the person eating zucchini is in position 1. The person driving the boat is in position 2, the person driving the scooter is in position 2, and the person driving the roller is in position 3.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person driving the train is on the far left. From statement 20, we know the mechanic is not to the left of the person driving the train, so the mechanic must be in position 2.
2. From statement 4, we know the fan punk is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the fan punk is the person who's hobby is sudoku (statement 7), they must be in position 2 or 4.

3. From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not the person driving the train or the teacher is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or both. Since the teacher is in position 2, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be in position 4.

From clue 8, we know the Thai is on the far left. From clue 7, we know the Spanish is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the Thai is on the far left, the Spanish must be the second person from the left.

From clue 15, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is not the Thai. Since the Thai is on the far left, the person who's hobby is board-games must be the second person from the right.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the Spanish is on the left of the person drinking lemonade, the person who's hobby is board-games must be the person to the left of the Spanish.

From clue 11, we know the Indian is not the person drinking mirinda or the person drinking mirinda is not the person who's hobby is board-games or both. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is not the Thai, the Indian must be the person drinking mirinda.

From clue 14, we know the Australian is on the left or right of the Indian. Since the Indian is drinking mirinda, the Australian must be the person to the right of the Indian.

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is the fan of blues. From clue 13, we know the fan blues is on the right of the fan soul. Therefore, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be on the right of the fan soul.

From clue 10, we know the fan d&b is on the left of the fan soul. Since the fan blues is on the right of the fan soul, the fan d&b must be on the left of the fan blues.

From clue 6, we know the fan d&b is in an odd position. Since the fan d&b is on the left of the fan blues, it must be in the third position.

From clue 1, we know the fan metal and the person drinking fanta have the same parity positions. Since the fan d&b is in an odd position, the fan metal must also be in an odd position.

From clue 3, we know the fan metal is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the fan metal is in an odd position, it must be in the first or third position. However, if it were in the first position, the person drinking fanta would be in an even position, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the fan metal must be in the third position.

From clue 9, we know the person drinking lemonade is not the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the Spanish, the person drinking lemonade must be on the right of the Spanish.

From clue 16, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the Spanish, the person who's hobby is singing must be on the right of the Spanish.
