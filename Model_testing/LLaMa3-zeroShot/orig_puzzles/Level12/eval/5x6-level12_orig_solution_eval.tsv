#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 11 and 15, we know that the fan techno is on the far left and the person driving the train is not to the left of the person driving the taxi. This means that the fan techno is in position 1, and the person driving the train is in position 6.
2. From clues 16 and 48, we know that the person eating zucchini is between the person eating blueberry and the fan country, and is somewhere to the right of the person watching spy movies. This means that the person eating zucchini is in position 5, and the person eating blueberry is in position 2.
3. From clues 6 and 22, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is the person eating zucchini or the person eating zucchini is the person watching family movies, but not both. Since the person eating zucchini is in position 5, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 5 as well. This means that the person watching family movies is in position 4.
4. From clues 4 and 29, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching western movies, and the person eating zucchini and the fan indie have different parity positions. This means that the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, and the fan indie is in position 2.
5. From clues 9 and 32, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is not the person who's sport is climbing or the person who's sport is climbing is not the person eating cabbage or both. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 6.
6. From clues 38 and 47, we know that the person driving the bike is the person eating lettuce or the person who's sport is tennis is the person driving the bike or both. Since the person driving the bike is in position 2, the person eating lettuce must be in position 2 as well. This means that the person who's sport is tennis is in position 1.
7. From clues 20 and 36, we know that the person driving the train is not the fan country or the person driving the train is not the person watching horror movies or both. Since the person driving the train is in position 6, the fan country must be in position 4, and the person watching horror movies must be in position 3.
8. From clues 25 and 43, we know that the fan indie and the person who's sport is tennis have different parity positions, and the person driving the taxi and the fan soul have different parity positions. This means that the fan indie is in position 2, and the fan soul is in position 5.
9. From clues 26 and 45, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the person watching spy movies, and the person driving the quad-bike is somewhere between the fan soul and the person who's sport is tennis. This means that the person driving the quad-bike is in position 5.
10. From clues 27 and 49, we know that the person watching western movies is on the right of the person eating peas, and the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere between the person watching disaster movies and the person eating zucchini. This means that the person watching western movies is in position 6, and the person who's sport is soccer is in position 4.
