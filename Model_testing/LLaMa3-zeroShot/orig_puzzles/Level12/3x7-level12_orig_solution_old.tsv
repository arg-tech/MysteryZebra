Lv1-3x7-6	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

#############
| Nationality   |     Sport      | Transport     |
|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| Australian    | Ice-Hockey     | Bus           |
| Canadian      | Basketball     | Bike          |
| Dutch         | Snowboarding  | Roller        |

| Indonesian    | Rowing         | Airplane      |
| Russian       | Skiing         | Ship          |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 10, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is either the australian or the person driving the motorbike, but not both. Since the australian is not driving the motorbike (from statement 25), the person driving the motorbike must be the one who's sport is ice-hockey.
2. From statement 17, we know that the australian is on the right of the german. Since the german is in an odd position (from statement 29), the australian must be in an even position.
3. From statement 12, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is either the person driving the bike or the canadian, but not both. Since the canadian is not driving the bike (from statement 15), the person driving the bike must be the one who's sport is basketball.
4. From statement 13, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is not to the right of the russian. Since the russian is in an even position (from statement 29), the person who's sport is basketball must be in an odd position.
5. From statement 21, we know that the person driving the ship is not the person who's sport is baseball or the german is not the person driving the ship or both. Since the german is not driving the ship (from statement 21), the person driving the ship must be the one who's sport is baseball.
6. From statement 31, we know that the person driving the ship is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person driving the ship is the one who's sport is baseball, the person who's sport is baseball must be in an even position.
7. From statement 23, we know that the dutch is either the person who's sport is snowboarding or the person driving the roller or both. Since the dutch is not driving the ship (from statement 21), the dutch must be driving the roller.
8. From statement 28, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the dutch is driving the roller, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in an even position.
9. From statement 30, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is not the person driving the airplane or the dutch is not the person who's sport is snowboarding or both. Since the dutch is not driving the airplane (from statement 18), the person who's sport is snowboarding must be the dutch.
10. From statement 32, we know that the person driving the motorbike is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person driving the motorbike is the one who's sport is ice-hockey (from statement 1), the person who's sport is baseball must be the egyptian.

By combining these deductions, we can arrive at the final solution table."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 11, we know the person drinking juice is the person eating artichoke. From statement 15, we know the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot. Therefore, the person eating artichoke (and drinking juice) must be in position 4.
2. From statement 2, we know the person eating avocado is somewhere to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person eating artichoke is in position 4, the person eating avocado must be in position 2.
3. From statement 4, we know the owner of the rabbit is the person eating avocado or the person drinking iced-tea, but not both. Since the person eating avocado is in position 2, the owner of the rabbit must be the person drinking iced-tea. From statement 9, we know the person eating broccoli is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea, so the person eating broccoli must be in position 1.
4. From statement 8, we know the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the owner of the cat. Since the person eating artichoke is in position 4, the owner of the ferret must be in position 3.
5. From statement 13, we know the owner of the ferret is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the owner of the ferret is in position 3, the person drinking 7up must be in position 5.
6. From statement 15, we know the person drinking juice is somewhere to the left of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating artichoke is in position 4, the person eating carrot must be in position 6.
7. From statement 16, we know the person drinking water and the person eating broccoli have different parity positions. Since the person eating broccoli is in position 1, the person drinking water must be in an odd position (statement 24). Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 7.
8. From statement 17, we know the person drinking tea is not to the right of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating carrot is in position 6, the person drinking tea must be in position 2 or 4. However, statement 25 says the person drinking iced-tea and the owner of the chinchilla have the same parity positions, and statement 20 says the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit. Therefore, the person drinking tea must be in position 2, and the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 6.
9. From statement 22, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person drinking iced-tea is in position 6, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 1.
10. From statement 27, we know the person eating carrot is not the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the person eating carrot is in position 6, the person eating carrot must be the owner of the dog.
11. From statement 29, we know the person eating broccoli is the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person eating broccoli (and owner of the dog) is in position 1.
12. From statement 30, we know the person eating tomato is not to the right of the person eating garlic. Since the person eating garlic is in position 1, the person eating tomato must be in position 3.
13. From statement 31, we know the person drinking juice is not to the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 4, the person drinking juice must be in position 4.
