#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 5, we know the owner of the dog is either the Egyptian or the person eating cherry. Since the Egyptian is on the far left (statement 6), the owner of the dog must be the Egyptian.
2. From statement 4, we know the person eating cherry is on the right of the Egyptian. Therefore, the person eating cherry is the Chinese.
3. From statement 2, we know the person eating mango is not the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is not eating cherry (statement 2), the Nigerian must be eating mango.
4. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is cricket is either the person eating onion or the owner of the fish. Since the person eating onion is on the left of the Russian (statement 14), the owner of the fish must be the person who's sport is cricket.
5. From statement 8, we know the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the owner of the fish is the person who's sport is cricket, the owner of the hamster must be the Russian.

8. From statement 12, we know the person eating pear and the person who's sport is basketball have different parity positions. Since the person eating pear is not the fan punk, the person eating pear must be the Chinese (from statement 4).
9. From statement 13, we know the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is baseball. Since the fan house is the person who's sport is baseball, the person who's sport is cricket must be the Russian.
10. From statement 18, we know the person who's sport is cricket and the owner of the fish have different parity positions. Since the owner of the fish is the person who's sport is cricket, the Russian must be the owner of the fish.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From statement 7, we know the person drinking tea is the person watching thriller movies.
* From statement 2, we know the British is on the left or right of the Polish. Since the Polish is not the person watching drama movies (statement 3), the British must be on the left or right of the Polish.
* From statement 4, we know the person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chinchilla is not the pet of the person drinking tea (statement 15), the owner of the chinchilla must be on the right of the person drinking sprite.
* From statement 10, we know the owner of the pony is the person who's sport is basketball or the Polish is the owner of the pony, but not both. Since the Polish is not the owner of the pony (statement 26), the owner of the pony must be the person who's sport is basketball.
* From statement 11, we know the person watching thriller movies is not the owner of the mouse or the person who's sport is biathlon is not the person watching thriller movies or both. Since the person watching thriller movies is the person drinking tea (statement 7), the owner of the mouse must be the person who's sport is biathlon.
* From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is not the Chinese. Since the Chinese is not the person watching thriller movies (statement 7), the Chinese must be the person who's sport is badminton.
* From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is not the person drinking tea (statement 7), the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on the left of the Japanese.
* From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is badminton is not the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla (statement 4), the owner of the chinchilla must be the person who's sport is badminton.
* From statement 18, we know the British is not the person who's sport is skateboarding or the British is not the person drinking sprite or both. Since the British is not the person who's sport is skateboarding (statement 19), the British must be the person drinking sprite.
* From statement 20, we know the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not the person watching thriller movies (statement 24), the person drinking cola must be on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
* From statement 21, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person watching drama movies have different parity positions. Since the person watching drama movies is not the person who's sport is biathlon (statement 3), the person watching drama movies must be the person who's sport is basketball.
* From statement 22, we know the person watching thriller movies is in an even position. Since the person watching thriller movies is the person drinking tea (statement 7), the person drinking tea must be in an even position.
* From statement 23, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's sport is badminton (statement 16), the person who's sport is biathlon must be somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
* From statement 25, we know the person who's sport is basketball is not the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is the person who's sport is badminton (statement 16), the person who's sport is basketball must be the owner of the pony (statement 10).
