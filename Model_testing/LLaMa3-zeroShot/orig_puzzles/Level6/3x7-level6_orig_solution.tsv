Lv1-3x7-5	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

#############
|         |     1      |      2       |    3     |   4    |    5    |    6    |     7     |
| Food    | apricot   | cherry      | mango    | peach  | carrot  | cranberry| tomato   |
| Pet     | snake     | cat        | lizard   | hedgehog| fish    | chinchilla| hamster  |
| Sport   | surfing  | biathlon   | skiing   | climbing| volleyball| cricket  | snowboarding|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person who's sport is cricket. From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating tomato. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person eating tomato.
2. From statement 2, we know the person eating peach is to the left of the owner of the cat. From statement 13, we know the person who's sport is cricket is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person eating tomato, and the person eating peach is to the left of the owner of the cat, we can conclude that the person eating peach is to the left of the person eating tomato.
3. From statement 3, we know the person eating peach is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. From statement 10, we know the owner of the fish is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Therefore, the person eating peach is to the right of the owner of the fish.
4. From statement 7, we know the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the person eating carrot. From statement 15, we know the person eating carrot is to the left of the owner of the fish. Therefore, the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the owner of the fish.
5. From statement 25, we know the owner of the lizard is the person who's sport is skiing. From statement 26, we know the person eating peach is to the left of the owner of the lizard. Therefore, the person eating peach is to the left of the person who's sport is skiing.
6. From statement 28, we know the owner of the snake is not the person eating tomato. From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating tomato. Therefore, the owner of the snake is not the person who's sport is cricket.
7. From statement 29, we know the owner of the fish is to the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. From statement 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is to the left of the person who's sport is cricket. Therefore, the owner of the fish is to the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket.
8. From statement 30, we know the person who's sport is climbing is to the left of the person who's sport is surfing. From statement 22, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Therefore, the person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
9. From statement 31, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is in an odd position. Since the person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's sport is surfing, and the person who's sport is surfing is in position 1, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 3 or 5. However, since the person who's sport is biathlon is to the right of the person who's sport is climbing, and the person who's sport is climbing is to the left of the person who's sport is surfing, the person who's sport is biathlon cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in position 5.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the rest of the table:

* The person eating apricot is in position 1, since the person eating peach is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the owner of the fish.
* The owner of the cat is in position 2, since the person eating peach is to the left of the owner of the cat.
* The person eating cherry is in position 2, since the person eating peach is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the owner of the fish.
* The owner of the lizard is in position 3, since the person eating peach is to the left of the owner of the lizard.
* The person eating mango is in position 4, since the person eating peach is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the owner of the fish.
* The person eating carrot is in position 5, since the person eating peach is to the left of the person eating carrot.
* The person eating cranberry is in position 6, since the person eating peach is to the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, and the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the owner of the fish.
* The person eating tomato is in position 7, since the person who's sport is cricket is the person eating tomato.
