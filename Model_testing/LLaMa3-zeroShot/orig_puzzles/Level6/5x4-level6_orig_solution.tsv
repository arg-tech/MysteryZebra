Lv1-5x4-8	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking water is on the far left or far right. Since the analyst is the person drinking water (clue 11), they must be on the far left.

From clue 7, we know that the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking coffee. Since the brazilian is in an even position (clue 6), they must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume they are in position 2 for now.

From clue 9, we know that the french person eats corn. Since the french person is not the police-officer (clue 8), they must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know that the police-officer drinks sprite. Since the police-officer is not the person eating pear (clue 8), they must be in position 1.

From clue 12, we know that the german is somewhere to the left of the person watching musical movies. Since the german is not in position 1 (because the police-officer is there), they must be in position 2. However, this would mean that the brazilian is in position 1, which contradicts clue 6. Therefore, the german must be in position 4.

From clue 13, we know that the security-guard is somewhere to the right of the person eating corn. Since the person eating corn is the french (clue 9), the security-guard must be in position 5.

From clue 14, we know that the indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the indonesian is not in position 1 (because the police-officer is there), they must be in position 3.
