Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 12, we know the person driving the scooter is the person watching action movies. From statement 2, we know the fan techno is the person driving the tram. From statement 14, we know the fan techno is on the left or right of the fan r&b. Since the fan techno is driving the tram, the fan r&b must be driving the car.
2. From statement 15, we know the fan r&b is the person watching drama movies. From statement 16, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies. Since the fan r&b is watching drama movies, the person watching superhero movies must be watching satire movies.
3. From statement 17, we know the fan salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. From statement 19, we know the person driving the ship is somewhere to the left of the fan salsa. Since the fan salsa is on the left or right of the person driving the ship, the fan salsa must be driving the ship.
4. From statement 20, we know the person watching adventure movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. From statement 21, we know the fan r&b is not the person driving the helicopter. Since the fan r&b is watching drama movies, the person watching adventure movies must be watching crime movies.
5. From statement 22, we know the fan classical is not the person watching drama movies. From statement 23, we know the person watching crime movies is in an even position. Since the fan classical is not watching drama movies, the fan classical must be watching satire movies.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the rest of the table to arrive at the final solution."
