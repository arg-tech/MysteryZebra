Lv1-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram.
This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in the last column (Transport: Tram), as they would be to the right of the person driving the tram.

2. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the person driving the scooter.
This means that the person drinking sprite cannot be in the last column (Transport: Scooter), as they would be to the right of the person driving the scooter.

3. The person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite.
This means that the person driving the train must be in a different column than the person drinking sprite.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be in the last column (Transport: Tram).
* The person drinking sprite cannot be in the last column (Transport: Scooter).
* The person driving the train is not the person drinking sprite, so the person driving the train must be in the middle column (Transport:?).

Here's the possible solution:

#############
|             |       1       |   2    |    3    |
| Beverage    | hot-chocolate | juice  | sprite  |
| Transport   | scooter      | train  | tram    |
#############

In this solution:

* The person drinking hot-chocolate is in the first column (Beverage: hot-chocolate).
* The person drinking juice is in the second column (Beverage: juice).
* The person drinking sprite is in the third column (Beverage: sprite).
* The person driving the scooter is in the first column (Transport: scooter).
* The person driving the train is in the second column (Transport: train).
* The person driving the tram is in the third column (Transport: tram).

This solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching family movies

This means that the order of movie genres is either: fantasy, family or family, fantasy

2. The person eating corn is not the person watching thriller movies

This means that the person eating corn is either watching fantasy or family movies

3. The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango

This means that the person eating mango is watching either fantasy or family movies, and the person watching thriller movies is on the right of them

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating corn is not watching thriller movies, so they must be watching either fantasy or family movies
* The person eating mango is watching either fantasy or family movies, and the person watching thriller movies is on the right of them
* The person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching family movies

From the above, we can conclude that the order of movie genres is: fantasy, family, thriller

Now, let's assign the food to the movie genres:

* The person eating corn is not watching thriller movies, so they must be watching fantasy or family movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person watching family movies, the person eating corn must be watching fantasy movies
* The person eating mango is watching either fantasy or family movies, and the person watching thriller movies is on the right of them. Since the person eating corn is watching fantasy movies, the person eating mango must be watching family movies
* The person watching thriller movies is on the right of the person eating mango, so they must be eating lime

1. The person watching epic movies is not the fan of blues.
This means the person watching epic movies is either the fan of hip-hop or soul.

2. The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching epic movies and the fan of soul.
This means the person watching mystery movies is either the fan of blues or hip-hop.

3. The fan of soul is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies.
This means the fan of soul is either the second or third person from the left.

4. The fan of soul is on the far left or far right.
This means the fan of soul cannot be the second person from the left, so they must be the far left or far right.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person watching epic movies is not the fan of blues, so they must be the fan of hip-hop or soul.
* The fan of soul is on the far left or far right, and they are to the right of the person watching epic movies. This means the fan of soul must be the far right.

1. The fan of reggae is not Polish.
This means the Polish person prefers either dubstep or rock.

This means the order of music genres for the person who prefers reggae is either: reggae, rock, dubstep or rock, dubstep, reggae.

This means the Argentine person prefers either rock or dubstep.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Therefore, the Polish person prefers rock.
* The Argentine is to the right of the fan of dubstep, so the Argentine person prefers dubstep.
* The fan of reggae is not Polish, so the fan of reggae is either Argentine or Mexican.
