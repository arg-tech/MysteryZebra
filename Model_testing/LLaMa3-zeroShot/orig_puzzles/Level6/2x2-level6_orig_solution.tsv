Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is soccer is on the far left.
This means that the person who eats nectarine must be the soccer player, since the soccer player is on the far left.

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is not the person eating pear.
This means that the person who eats pear must be the volleyball player.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    |        |            |
| Sport   |        |            |
|         | Nectarine | Pear      |
| Sport   | Soccer   | Volleyball|
#############

The final solution is:

#############
|         |   1    |     2      |
| Food    | Nectarine | Pear      |
| Sport   | Soccer   | Volleyball|
#############

Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.

This means that the goat's owner is either in the ""Food"" column and the guinea-pig's owner is in the ""Pet"" column, or vice versa.

2. The owner of the goat is not the person eating lemon.

This means that the person eating lemon is either the owner of the guinea-pig or the person eating apple.

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations:

**Case 1:** Goat's owner eats apple, Guinea-pig's owner eats lemon

* Food: Apple (Goat's owner) | Lemon (Guinea-pig's owner)
* Pet: Goat (Goat's owner) | Guinea-pig (Guinea-pig's owner)

This combination satisfies both clues. The goat's owner is on the left of the guinea-pig's owner, and the goat's owner is not eating lemon.

**Case 2:** Guinea-pig's owner eats apple, Goat's owner eats lemon

* Food: Apple (Guinea-pig's owner) | Lemon (Goat's owner)
* Pet: Goat (Goat's owner) | Guinea-pig (Guinea-pig's owner)

This combination also satisfies both clues. The goat's owner is on the left of the guinea-pig's owner, and the goat's owner is eating lemon.

Since both cases satisfy the clues, we can conclude that the solution is:

#############
|        |   Apple   |   Lemon   |
| Food   |  Goat     |  Guinea-pig |
| Pet    |  Guinea-pig |  Goat     |
#############

The owner of the goat eats lemon, and the owner of the guinea-pig eats apple."
Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating plum.

This means that the order of the food preferences is either:

* Pumpkin, plum
* Plum, pumpkin

We'll come back to this later.

2. The person who's sport is handball is not the person eating plum.

This means that the person eating plum must be the one who prefers sailing.

Now, let's combine the two clues:

* The person eating pumpkin is on the left of the person eating plum.
* The person eating plum prefers sailing.

This means that the person eating pumpkin must prefer handball.

Now, we can fill in the table:

#############
|         |    1     |    2    |
| Food    |  Pumpkin |  Plum   |
| Sport   |  Handball |  Sailing|
#############

The final solution is:

The person eating pumpkin prefers handball, and the person eating plum prefers sailing."
Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating grapefruit is not the owner of the goldfish.
This means that the owner of the goldfish is eating apricot.

2. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.
This means that the person eating grapefruit is either the owner of the hamster or the owner of the goldfish (since the owner of the goldfish is eating apricot).

Now, let's fill in the table:

|        |    1     |     2      |
| Food   |          |            |
| Pet    |          |            |

From clue 1, we know the owner of the goldfish is eating apricot. Let's put the goldfish with apricot:

|        |    1     |     2      |
| Food   | Apricot  | Grapefruit |
| Pet    | Goldfish | Hamster    |

From clue 2, we know the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot. This means the person eating grapefruit is the owner of the hamster.

So, the final solution is:

#############
|        |    1     |     2      |
| Food   | Apricot  | Grapefruit |
| Pet    | Goldfish | Hamster    |

Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching superhero movies is not the person who's sport is lacrosse.
This means that the person who watches superhero movies either plays golf or is not playing any sport.

2. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
This means that the person who plays lacrosse is to the left of the person who watches superhero movies.

From these two clues, we can start building the table:

|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |
| Sport         |          |           |

Let's assume the person who plays lacrosse is in position 1. Then, the person who watches superhero movies must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   |          |           |
| Sport         | Lacrosse |          |

Now, we know that the person who watches superhero movies is not playing lacrosse, so they must be playing golf.

|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   |          | Superhero |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Golf      |

Finally, we need to determine the movie genre for position 1. Since the person prefers two different movie genres, and they already watch superhero movies, they must watch musical movies.

|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Superhero |
| Sport         | Lacrosse | Golf      |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Superhero |

Lv1-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of d&b is on the far right.
2. The fan of indie is not Japanese.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of d&b is in the second column (since it's on the far right).

From clue 2, we know that the fan of indie is not Japanese. This means that the Japanese person must be the fan of the other music genre, which is indie.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |   d&b    |    indie    |
| Music-Genre   |        |          |

We can place the Japanese person in the indie column:

#############

| Music-Genre   |        |          |
| Nationality   |        |  Japanese  |
#############

The Polish person must be the fan of d&b, since the Japanese person is already taken:

#############
|               |   d&b    |    indie    |
| Music-Genre   |  d&b    |  indie     |

#############

The final solution is:

Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The accountant is in an odd position.
This means the accountant is either in the first or third position.

2. The accountant is not the owner of the hamster.
This means the hamster's owner must be the social worker.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   |            |               |

From clue 1, the accountant is in an odd position, so they must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume they're in position 1 for now.

| Pet   |            |               |

From clue 2, the hamster's owner is the social worker. Since the accountant is not the hamster's owner, the social worker must be in position 2.

|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant | Social Worker |               |
| Pet   |            | Hamster       |

Now, let's consider the goat. Since the accountant is not the hamster's owner, they must be the goat's owner. This means the accountant is in position 1, and the goat is in position 2.

|       |     1      |       2       |
| Job   | Accountant | Social Worker |               |
