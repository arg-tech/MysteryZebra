| Sport         |  Water-Polo  | Climbing  | Lacrosse  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 6, we know the owner of the mouse is the person eating artichoke.
* From clue 2, we know the pakistani is between the australian and the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the pakistani is not the owner of the mouse, the australian must be the owner of the mouse.
* From clue 1, we know the owner of the bird is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the australian is the owner of the mouse, the bird must be owned by the person who's hobby is fishing.
* From clue 8, we know the coach is somewhere to the left of the scientist. Since the coach is not the owner of the mouse, the coach must be the person eating zucchini.
* From clue 7, we know the person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the nigerian. Since the coach is the person eating zucchini, the nigerian must be the person eating nectarine.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is not the owner of the mouse, the software-developer must be the person drinking iced-tea.
* From clue 10, we know the person drinking milk is in an even position. Since the software-developer is the person drinking iced-tea, the person drinking milk must be the person eating artichoke (the owner of the mouse).
* From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is not the owner of the mouse, the person drinking mirinda must be the person eating nectarine.
* From clue 12, we know the person eating nectarine is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person eating nectarine is the nigerian, the person who's sport is climbing must be the pakistani.

By combining these deductions, we can arrive at the final solution table."
