7. The owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the goat owner is the van driver, the mouse owner must be to the left of the van driver.
8. The person driving the train is the owner of the guinea-pig. This constraint is already satisfied.
9. The owner of the mouse is not the person driving the motorbike. This constraint is already satisfied.
10. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the van driver is the goat owner, the hedgehog owner must be on the left or right of the goat owner.
11. The owner of the goat is the person driving the van. This constraint is already satisfied.
12. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van. Since the van driver is the goat owner, the helicopter driver must be to the left of the goat owner.
13. The person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike driver is to the left of the goat owner, the helicopter driver must be to the right of the quad-bike driver.
14. The owner of the mouse is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since the helicopter driver is to the right of the quad-bike driver, the mouse owner must be to the right of the quad-bike driver.
15. The owner of the hedgehog is not the person driving the train. This constraint is already satisfied.
16. The person driving the van is on the far left or far right. Since the van driver is the goat owner, the hedgehog owner must be on the far left or far right.
17. The person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the motorbike. Since the train driver is the guinea-pig owner, the motorbike driver must be to the right of the guinea-pig owner.

By combining these constraints, we can deduce the final solution:

* Bird: scooter
* Frog: helicopter
* Goat: van
* Guinea-pig: train
* Hamster: airplane
* Hedgehog: motorbike
* Mouse: quad-bike"
