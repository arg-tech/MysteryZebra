Lv1-2x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is handball.

This means that baseball cannot be in the last column, and handball cannot be in the first column.

2. The person drinking lemonade is not the person who's sport is baseball.

This means that lemonade cannot be paired with baseball.

3. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

This means that baseball must be in the third or fourth column, and volleyball must be in the first or second column.

4. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.

This means that mirinda cannot be paired with handball, and must be paired with either baseball or volleyball.

5. The person drinking juice is on the right of the person who's sport is baseball.

This means that juice must be paired with baseball, and cannot be paired with handball or volleyball.

6. The person who's sport is baseball is not the person drinking mirinda.

This means that baseball cannot be paired with mirinda, which we already knew from clue 4.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Baseball is in the third or fourth column, and is not paired with mirinda.
* Handball is not in the first column, and is not paired with mirinda.
* Volleyball is in the first or second column, and is not paired with juice.
* Lemonade is not paired with baseball.
* Mirinda is paired with either baseball or volleyball, but not with handball.
* Juice is paired with baseball.

With these constraints, we can fill in the table:

Lv1-2x4-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking water is not the coach.
This means the coach is not drinking water.

2. The doctor is not the person drinking sprite.
This means the doctor is drinking either fanta or hot-chocolate.

3. The electrician is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
This means the electrician is either on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

4. The doctor is the person drinking fanta.
This means the doctor is drinking fanta.

5. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor.
This means the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor.

6. The person drinking fanta is in an odd position.

This means the coach is either on the leftmost or rightmost position.

8. The electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer.
This means the electrician is either on the left of the police-officer or in the same position as the police-officer.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Job        |             |                |        |        |

From statement 4, we know the doctor is drinking fanta. From statement 5, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor. From statement 6, we know the doctor is in an odd position, so the doctor must be in position 2 or 4.

Let's try to place the doctor in position 2:

| Job        |             |                |        |        |

From statement 5, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the doctor. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1.

|            |  Hot-Choc |  Doctor (Fanta) |   3    |   4    |
| Beverage   |             |                |        |        |
| Job        |             |                |        |        |

From statement 7, we know the coach is on the far left or far right. Since the hot-chocolate person is in position 1, the coach must be in position 4.

|            |  Hot-Choc |  Doctor (Fanta) |   3    | Coach  |
| Beverage   |             |                |        |        |
| Job        |             |                |        |        |

From statement 8, we know the electrician is somewhere to the left of the police-officer. Since the coach is in position 4, the police-officer must be in position 3.

|            |  Hot-Choc |  Doctor (Fanta) | Police | Coach  |

| Job        |             |                |        |        |

Now, we need to figure out the jobs for the remaining people. From statement 1, we know the person drinking water is not the coach. This means the person drinking water must be the electrician.

|            |  Hot-Choc |  Doctor (Fanta) | Police | Coach  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |                |        |        |

2. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person driving the quad-bike.

This means the guinea-pig's owner is to the left of the quad-bike driver.

3. The person driving the trike is not the owner of the guinea-pig.

This means the trike driver is either the owner of the hedgehog, snake, or goldfish.

4. The person driving the trike is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

This means the trike driver is to the right of the quad-bike driver.

5. The person driving the train is on the right of the person driving the subway.

* The snake's owner is to the left of the trike driver (6).
* The trike driver is to the right of the quad-bike driver (4).

9. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the Polish ( duplicate information).

From clue 1, we know the Australian is on the right of the person watching disaster movies. From clue 3, we know the Australian is on the far right, so the person watching disaster movies must be on the second-to-last position.

From clue 4, we know the Colombian is to the right of the Polish. Since the Australian is on the far right, the Colombian must be on the third position.

From clue 6, we know the person watching spy movies is to the left of the Australian. Since the Australian is on the far right, the person watching spy movies must be on the second position.

From clue 7, we know the person watching spy movies is to the left of the person watching disaster movies. Since the person watching spy movies is on the second position, the person watching disaster movies must be on the third position.

From clue 8, we know the person watching mystery movies is to the left of the Polish. Since the Colombian is on the third position, the Polish must be on the fourth position. Therefore, the person watching mystery movies must be on the second position.

This means the order of the pets is either: rabbit, fish, hedgehog, ferret or fish, rabbit, hedgehog, ferret.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is the person who's sport is weightlifting.
This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.

4. The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
This means the owner of the rabbit is either the person who's sport is surfing or swimming.

5. The owner of the hedgehog is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.
This means the owner of the hedgehog is either the person who's sport is golf, surfing, or swimming.

6. The person who's sport is surfing is not the owner of the fish.
This means the owner of the fish is either the person who's sport is golf, weightlifting, or swimming.

7. The person who's sport is weightlifting is in an even position.
This means the person who's sport is weightlifting is either in position 1 or 3.

8. The owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf.
This means the owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The owner of the hedgehog is the person who's sport is golf (8).
* The owner of the hedgehog is not the person who's sport is weightlifting (5).
* The person who's sport is weightlifting is in an even position (7).
* The person who's sport is weightlifting is not the owner of the ferret (1).

This means the owner of the hedgehog (golf) is in an odd position, and the owner of the ferret is in an even position.

* The owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the fish (2).
* The owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting (4).
* The owner of the fish is not the person who's sport is surfing (6).

This means the order of the pets is: rabbit, weightlifting, fish, ferret.
