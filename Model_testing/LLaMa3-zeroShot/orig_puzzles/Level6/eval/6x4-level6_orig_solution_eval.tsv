Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 7, we know the person eating eggplant is the person who's hobby is singing. Since singing is in an even position (statement 1), the person eating eggplant must be in position 2.

3. From statement 12, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is not the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is not the fan disco (statement 19), the ferret owner must be the person who's hobby is traveling. This means the traveling person is in position 3.
4. From statement 15, we know the person watching crime movies is the person who's hobby is hiking. Since hiking is in an odd position (statement 1), the person watching crime movies must be in position 4.

10. From statement 14, we know the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching musical movies. Since the person watching crime movies is in position 4, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3.
11. From statement 5, we know the person eating grapes is on the left or right of the fan R&B. Since the fan R&B is in position 2, the person eating grapes must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the person eating orange is in position 1, the person eating grapes must be in position 3.
12. From statement 21, we know the fan indie is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking. Since the fan indie is in position 2, the person who's hobby is baking must be in position 1.
