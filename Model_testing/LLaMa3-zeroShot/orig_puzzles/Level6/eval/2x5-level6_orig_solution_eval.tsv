Lv1-2x5-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The security-guard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the dog.
2. The owner of the frog is in the middle.
3. The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.
4. The security-guard is in an odd position.
5. The videographer is somewhere to the left of the manager.
6. The videographer is not the owner of the turtle.
7. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony.
8. The videographer is on the far left.
9. The security-guard is somewhere to the left of the designer.
10. The manager is on the left of the owner of the rabbit.
11. The owner of the pony is somewhere to the left of the manager.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the frog is in the middle. Let's assume the middle position is the 3rd position.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the pony is to the left of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the frog is in the middle, the owner of the pony must be in the 1st position.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the turtle is to the right of the owner of the pony. Since the owner of the pony is in the 1st position, the owner of the turtle must be in the 5th position.

From statement 8, we know the videographer is on the far left. Since the owner of the pony is in the 1st position, the videographer must be in the 1st position.

From statement 9, we know the security-guard is to the left of the designer. Since the videographer is in the 1st position, the security-guard must be in the 2nd position.

From statement 10, we know the manager is to the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the pony is in the 1st position, the manager must be in the 4th position.

From statement 11, we know the owner of the pony is to the left of the manager. Since the manager is in the 4th position, the owner of the pony must be in the 3rd position.

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-2x5-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking milk.

From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since tennis is already paired with milk, lacrosse must be paired with the remaining beverage.

From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is between the person who's sport is rugby and the person who's sport is tennis. Since lacrosse is already paired with the remaining beverage, rugby must be paired with the remaining beverage.

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is rugby is not the person drinking 7up. Since rugby is already paired with a beverage, 7up must be paired with the remaining beverage.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking 7up is not the person who's sport is rugby. This means 7up must be paired with the person who's sport is rowing.

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is rowing is not the person drinking fanta. Since rowing is already paired with 7up, fanta must be paired with the remaining beverage.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking milk. Since milk is already paired with tennis, hot-chocolate must be paired with the remaining beverage.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking cola is in an odd position. Since there are only 5 positions, cola must be in position 1 or 3.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since 7up is already paired with rowing, cola must be in position 1.

From statement 8, we know the person who's sport is tennis is not the person drinking cola. Since tennis is already paired with milk, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 5.

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-2x5-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan soul is between the fan rock and the fan reggae.
2. The fan rock is on the left or right of the fan classical.
3. The fan disco is the analyst.
4. The project-manager is in an even position.
5. The manager is on the left of the chef.
6. The manager is on the left of the fan soul.
7. The chef is on the right of the manager.
8. The project-manager is not the fan rock.
9. The analyst is on the left or right of the fan reggae.
10. The fan rock is the manager.
11. The fan classical is in an odd position.

From statement 3, we know the analyst is the fan disco. From statement 10, we know the fan rock is the manager. From statement 6, we know the manager is on the left of the fan soul.

Now, let's analyze the positions:

* The manager is on the left of the fan soul, and the fan soul is between the fan rock and the fan reggae. This means the fan soul is in position 2 or 3.
* The project-manager is in an even position, so it's either in position 2 or 4.
* The fan classical is in an odd position, so it's either in position 1 or 3.

Considering the above, we can create a possible arrangement:

|               |       1        |    2    |  3   |        4        |    5    |

* 1. Fan classical (odd position)
* 2. Project-manager (even position)
* 3. Fan soul (between fan rock and fan reggae)
* 4. Manager (fan rock)
* 5. Chef (right of manager)

Now, let's check the remaining statements:

Lv1-2x5-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Italian is on the left or right of the Argentine, so the Italian is not in the middle.
2. The Argentine is between the person who's sport is handball and the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so the Argentine is not in the first or last position.
3. The Italian is on the far left, so the Italian is in the first position.
4. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing, so the Pakistani (who's sport is parkour) is in the last position.
5. The Italian is in an odd position, so the Italian is in the 1st or 3rd position.
6. The person who's sport is handball is not the Italian, so the person who's sport is handball is in the 2nd or 4th position.
7. The Mexican is in the middle, so the Mexican is in the 3rd position.
8. The person who's sport is parkour is the Pakistani, so the Pakistani is in the last position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

From the remaining clues, we can deduce the following:

* The Argentine is between the person who's sport is handball and the person who's sport is ice-hockey, so the Argentine is in the 2nd or 4th position.
* The person who's sport is handball is not the Italian, so the person who's sport is handball is in the 2nd position.
* The person who's sport is ice-hockey is in the 3rd position (since the Argentine is between them and the person who's sport is handball).
* The person who's sport is sailing is in the 4th position (since the Pakistani is in the last position and the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing).

From statement 6, we know the owner of the bird is between the owner of the rabbit and the owner of the pony.

From statement 12, we know the owner of the pony is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird. This means the owner of the pony is to the right of the person watching spy movies.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the pony is to the right of the person watching spy movies, the owner of the bird must be on the left of the owner of the pony.
