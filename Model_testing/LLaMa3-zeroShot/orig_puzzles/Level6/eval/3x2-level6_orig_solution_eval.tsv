Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The project-manager is not the person watching musical movies.
This means the project-manager watches either crime movies or doesn't watch movies at all.

2. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the owner of the ferret.
This means the owner of the ferret is either the teacher or the person watching crime movies.

Now, let's create a possible solution table:

|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           |                 |         |
| Movie-Genre   |                 |         |
| Pet           |                 |         |

Initially, we can fill in the jobs:

|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   |                 |         |
| Pet           |                 |         |

From clue 1, we know the project-manager doesn't watch musical movies, so the teacher must watch musical movies.

|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime          | Musical |
| Pet           |                 |         |

Now, let's consider the pet clue. We know the owner of the ferret is either the teacher or the person watching crime movies. Since the teacher watches musical movies, the owner of the ferret must be the project-manager.

|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime          | Musical |
| Pet           | Ferret         | Bird     |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks:

#############
|               |        1        |    2    |
| Job           | Project-Manager | Teacher |
| Movie-Genre   | Crime          | Musical |
| Pet           | Ferret         | Bird     |
#############

The final solution table shows that the project-manager watches crime movies, has a ferret as a pet, and is not the person watching musical movies. The teacher watches musical movies, has a bird as a pet, and is on the right of the owner of the ferret."	{'job': ['project-manager', 'teacher'], 'movie-genre': ['crime', 'musical'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'bird']}	True	6	True
Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is not the person eating pumpkin.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies.

Let's start by filling in the table with the given information:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         |            |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |

Since there are only two types of food, we can start by placing the pumpkin eater. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is not the pumpkin eater. So, the pumpkin eater must be the person on the right (column 2).

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         | pumpkin  |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         |            |

Now, let's focus on the movie genre. From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is somewhere to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means that the person watching disaster movies must be in column 2.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Food          |         | pumpkin  |
| Hobby         |         |            |
| Movie-Genre   |         | disaster |

Now, we can fill in the remaining cells. The person who's hobby is baking must be in column 1, and the person who's hobby is card-games must be in column 2.

|               | baking | pumpkin  |
| Food          |         |         |
| Hobby         | baking | card-games |
| Movie-Genre   |         | disaster |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining food type, pepper, and the musical movie genre.

|               | baking | pumpkin  |
| Food          | pepper |         |
| Hobby         | baking | card-games |

Lv1-3x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person driving the van is not the person drinking water.
This means that the person drinking water is not driving the van. Let's assume the person drinking water is in the first column (Beverage).

2. The social-worker is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola.
This means that the social-worker is either in the first column (Beverage) or in the second column (Job). Since the person drinking water is already in the first column, the social-worker must be in the second column.

Here's the updated table:

|             |       1       |     2      |
| Beverage    |  Water       |            |

| Transport   |               |            |

Now, let's think about the person driving the van. Since the person drinking water is not driving the van, the person driving the van must be in the third column (Transport). The only remaining option is the motorbike, so the person driving the van must be using a motorbike.

Here's the updated table:

|             |       1       |     2      |

| Job         |               |  Social-worker |
| Transport   |  Motorbike  |            |

Finally, let's think about the person drinking cola. Since the social-worker is in the second column, the person drinking cola must be in the first column. The only remaining option is the journalist, so the person drinking cola must be a journalist.

Here's the final solution table:

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is gardening is not the owner of the hamster.
This means that the person who has gardening as their hobby cannot be the one who owns the hamster. Let's call this person ""Gardening Hobbyist"".

2. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the scientist.
This means that the scientist is to the left of the hamster owner. Let's call the scientist ""Scientist"".

Now, let's fill in the table:

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   |           |             |

| Pet     |           |             |

From clue 1, we know that the Gardening Hobbyist is not the hamster owner. So, the Gardening Hobbyist must be either the person with Job 1 or Job 2.

From clue 2, we know that the scientist is to the left of the hamster owner. This means that the hamster owner must be either Job 2 or the person with the Dressmaker job.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|         |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby   | Board-games | Gardening |
| Job     | Dressmaker | Scientist |
| Pet     | Mouse      | Hamster    |

The Dressmaker job is not the scientist, so it must be Job 1. The scientist is Job 2. The hamster owner is to the right of the scientist, so it must be Job 2. The mouse owner is the only one left, so it must be Job 1.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching horror movies is to the left of the person who's sport is rowing. This means that the rowing sport cannot be in the first column.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating pomegranate is not the person who's sport is rowing. This means that the pomegranate food cannot be in the same column as the rowing sport.

Now, let's fill in the table with the given information:

| Movie-Genre   |             |           |
| Sport         |             | rowing   |

We can place the horror movie genre in the first column, since it's not specified to be in a particular column. We can also place the superhero movie genre in the second column, since it's not specified to be in a particular column.

Now, we can place the basketball sport in the first column, since it's not specified to be in a particular column. This leaves the second column for the rowing sport.

Lv1-3x2-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: funk, indie
This means we have two people, each preferring one of the two music genres.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: brazilian, nigerian
This means we have two people, each with one of the two nationalities.

3. The people use 2 different means of transport: ship, trike
This means we have two people, each using one of the two means of transport.

4. The brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship
This means the brazilian is not driving the ship, but is sitting next to the person who is driving the ship.

5. The fan of funk is not the person driving the trike
This means the person driving the trike is not a fan of funk.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

From statement 4, we know the brazilian is not driving the ship, so the person driving the ship must be the nigerian. The brazilian is on the right of the person driving the ship, so the brazilian must be sitting next to the nigerian.

From statement 5, we know the person driving the trike is not a fan of funk. Since there are only two music genres, the person driving the trike must be a fan of indie.

2. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the Australian.
This means that the Australian is not driving the scooter. Since the scooter driver is not eating broccoli, the Australian must be eating broccoli.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of rock music is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means that the fan of rock music cannot be the person who drinks iced-tea (since they are not a fan of rock music) and cannot be the person who drinks cola (since they are not the fan of lacrosse).

1. The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person drinking water.

This means that the person drinking water is on the left, and the person eating zucchini is on the right.

2. The person eating zucchini is not the person driving the roller.

This means that the person driving the roller is eating either avocado or water.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Now, let's check our assumption about the person drinking water eating avocado. We assumed this because we didn't have any other information, but now we can see that the person driving the roller is eating avocado. This means the person drinking water must be eating zucchini.

This means the rabbit owner's music genre is either Rock or unknown (since we don't know the owner's music genre yet).

2. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit.
This means the cricket player's column is either 2 or 3 (since the rabbit owner's column is either 1 or 2).
