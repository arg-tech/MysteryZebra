Lv1-5x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The nurse is the person driving the bike.
This means the nurse is in the Transport column, and the bike is in the Transport row.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is not the Chinese.
This means the person drinking soy-milk is either Pakistani or the person with an unknown nationality. We'll come back to this later.

3. The nurse is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
This means the nurse is adjacent to the person with the hobby of skydiving. Since the nurse is driving the bike, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in the same row as the nurse.

4. The photographer is on the right of the Chinese.
This means the photographer is in the same column as the Chinese, and the Chinese is on the left of the photographer.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      |          |              |
| Hobby         |          |              |
| Job           |          |              |
| Nationality   |          |              |
| Transport     |          |              |

From clue 1, we know the nurse is driving the bike, so we can fill in the Transport row:

|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      |          |              |
| Hobby         |          |              |
| Job           |          |              |
| Nationality   |          |              |
| Transport     | Bike     |              |

From clue 4, we know the photographer is on the right of the Chinese, so we can fill in the Job and Nationality columns:

|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      |          |              |
| Hobby         |          |              |
| Job           | Nurse    | Photographer |
| Nationality   | Chinese  | Pakistani    |
| Transport     | Bike     |              |

Now, let's focus on the person drinking soy-milk. From clue 2, we know it's not the Chinese. Since the Chinese is already filled in, the person drinking soy-milk must be the Pakistani. We can fill in the Beverage row:

|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-milk    |
| Hobby         |          |              |
| Job           | Nurse    | Photographer |
| Nationality   | Chinese  | Pakistani    |
| Transport     | Bike     |              |

The only remaining clue is clue 3, which states the nurse is on the left or right of the person with the hobby of skydiving. Since the nurse is already filled in, the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in the same row as the nurse. Let's assume the nurse is on the left of the person with the hobby of skydiving. This means the person with the hobby of skydiving is in the Job column, and the nurse is in the Job column as well.

|               |    1     |      2       |
| Beverage      | Lemonade | Soy-milk    |
| Hobby         | Puzzles  | Skydiving  |
| Job           | Nurse    | Nurse      |
| Nationality   | Chinese  | Pakistani    |
| Transport     | Bike     |              |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's start by analyzing the given information and using it to make deductions.

From statement 1, we know that the fan of soul music is to the left of the person driving the bike. This means that the person driving the bike cannot be the fan of soul music.

From statement 2, we know that the owner of the fish is not the person who's sport is biathlon. This means that the owner of the fish must be the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

From statement 3, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means that the person who's hobby is skydiving must be to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.

This means that the person eating carrot cannot be the entrepreneur (who is on the far right) and cannot have card-games as their hobby. Let's assume the person eating carrot is on the leftmost side.

2. The entrepreneur is on the far right.
This means that the entrepreneur's food, hobby, job, movie genre, and nationality must be on the rightmost side.

3. The argentine is not the firefighter.
This means that the firefighter must be either the indonesian or the person eating carrot (since the entrepreneur is already taken).

4. The person watching animation movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
This means that the person watching animation movies cannot be the entrepreneur (who is on the far right) and cannot have card-games as their hobby. Let's assume the person watching animation movies is on the leftmost side, next to the person eating carrot.

2. The fan of electronic music is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person drinking fanta is not the person eating plum.
4. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person driving the train.

Lv1-5x2-6	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The person drinking sprite is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
2. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating lettuce.
3. The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of d&b.
4. The person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking sprite is either to the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Let's assume the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. We'll come back to this assumption later.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating lettuce. This means that the fan of d&b cannot be the person drinking almond-milk (from clue 3), as they would be on the right of the person eating lettuce, which is not possible.

Now, let's look at the possible combinations:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      |           |             |

| Music-Genre   |           |             |

Assuming the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening:

* Fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating lettuce.
* Person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of d&b.
* Person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies.

Here's one possible solution:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | Almond-milk | Sprite     |
| Food          | Lettuce     | Spinach    |
| Hobby         | Gardening  | Traveling  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror     | Scientific |

In this solution:

* The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of d&b (clue 3).
* The fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating lettuce (clue 2).
* The person watching horror movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies (clue 4).
* The person who's hobby is gardening is to the right of the person drinking sprite (from assumption 1).

If we assume the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening, we can still find a solution:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | Sprite     | Almond-milk |

In this solution:

* The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of d&b (clue 3).
* The fan of d&b is on the left of the person eating lettuce (clue 2).
* The person watching horror movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies (clue 4).

3. The person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.
This means that the person who drinks almond-milk (driving the train) is to the right of the person who plays water-polo.

Lv1-5x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.
This means that the person who drives the bus cannot be the one who plays volleyball.

2. The Thai is not the person who's hobby is camping.
This means that the Thai person must have the hobby of gardening.

3. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the freelancer.
This means that the freelancer must be on the right of the person who has the hobby of gardening.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         |            |            |
| Job           |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |
| Sport         |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

From statement 2, we know the Thai person has the hobby of gardening. Let's put the Thai person in the left column:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Gardening |            |
| Job           |            |            |
| Nationality   | Thai      |            |
| Sport         |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

From statement 3, we know the freelancer is on the right of the person who has the hobby of gardening. Let's put the freelancer in the right column:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Gardening |            |
| Job           |            | Freelancer |
| Nationality   | Thai      |            |
| Sport         |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |

Now, let's fill in the remaining columns:

* The person who drives the bus is on the right of the person who plays volleyball. Since the freelancer is on the right, the bus driver must be the person who plays volleyball.
* The person who plays water-polo must be the one who has the hobby of camping (since the Thai person has the hobby of gardening).
* The person who has the hobby of camping must be the one who is British (since the Thai person is not the one who has the hobby of camping).

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby         | Gardening | Camping   |
| Job           |            | Freelancer |
| Nationality   | Thai      | British   |
| Sport         | Water-polo | Volleyball |
| Transport     |            | Bus      |
#############

Note that this solution satisfies all the given conditions."	{'hobby': ['gardening', 'camping'], 'job': ['', 'freelancer'], 'nationality': ['thai', 'british'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'volleyball'], 'transport': ['', 'bus']}	True	6	False
Lv1-5x2-10	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the far left:
This means the first column is occupied by the card-games person.

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         | Card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Transport     |            |               |

2. The person driving the car is not the owner of the fish:
This means the car driver is not the fish owner. Since there are only two transport options (car and tram), the car driver must be the person on the right.

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         | Card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            |               |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Transport     | Tram       | Car          |

3. The American is in an even position:
This means the American is either in the first or second column. Since the card-games person is already in the first column, the American must be in the second column.

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          |            |               |
| Hobby         | Card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            | American    |
| Pet           |            |               |
| Transport     | Tram       | Car          |

4. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish:
This means the fish owner is in the first column, and the carrot eater is in the second column.

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          | Fish      | Carrot      |
| Hobby         | Card-games |               |
| Nationality   |            | American    |
| Pet           |            | Hedgehog   |
| Transport     | Tram       | Car          |

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:

|               |     1      |       2       |
| Food          | Fish      | Carrot      |
| Hobby         | Card-games | Rock-climbing|
| Nationality   |            | American    |
| Pet           | Hedgehog  |            |
| Transport     | Tram       | Car          |

The final solution table is:
