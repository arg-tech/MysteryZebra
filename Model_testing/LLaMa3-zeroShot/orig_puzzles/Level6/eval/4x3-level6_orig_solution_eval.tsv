| Transport   |           |               |            |

From statement 1, we know the person eating asparagus is driving the car. Let's put the person eating asparagus in column 1, row 2, and the car in column 4, row 1.

| Transport   | Car       | Jet-ski      | Roller     |

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is not the person eating asparagus. Let's put the person who's sport is volleyball in column 3, row 1.

|             |     1     |       2       |     3      |

| Sport       | Volleyball| Cricket      |               |
| Transport   | Car       | Jet-ski      | Roller     |

From statement 6, we know the person drinking 7up is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is already in column 2, let's put the person drinking 7up in column 1, row 3.

|             |     1     |       2       |     3      |

| Transport   | Car       | Jet-ski      | Roller     |

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person who's sport is volleyball is already in column 3, row 1, let's put the person who's sport is cricket in column 2, row 1.

Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the Spanish person.
2. The person eating onion is somewhere to the left of the person eating cauliflower.
3. The doctor is not the American.
4. The doctor is somewhere to the right of the dressmaker.
5. The Japanese is the person eating cauliflower.
6. The doctor is not the person driving the skateboard.
7. The Japanese is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish person.
8. The American is not the person eating onion.

From statement 5, we know the Japanese is eating cauliflower. From statement 7, we know the Japanese is between the person driving the skateboard and the Spanish person. This means the Japanese is not driving the skateboard, so the Japanese must be eating cauliflower and driving the car (since they're not on the skateboard or motorbike).

From statement 2, we know the person eating onion is to the left of the person eating cauliflower. Since the Japanese is eating cauliflower, the person eating onion must be to the left of the Japanese.

From statement 8, we know the American is not eating onion. Since the person eating onion is to the left of the Japanese, the American must be eating nectarine (since they're not eating onion).

From statement 3, we know the doctor is not the American. Since the American is eating nectarine, the doctor must be eating onion.

From statement 4, we know the doctor is to the right of the dressmaker. Since the doctor is eating onion, the dressmaker must be eating nectarine.

Now we can fill in the table:

This means the owner of the frog is to the left of the fan country, and the fan electronic is to the right of the fan country.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the security-guard.
This means the security-guard has a different hobby.

4. The fan country is somewhere to the left of the security-guard.
This means the fan country is to the left of the security-guard, and the fan punk is to the right of the scientist.

5. The person who's hobby is writing is not the fan country.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |     1      |       2       |       3        |

| Pet           |            |               |                |

From step 1, we know the scientist is not the fan punk. Let's assume the scientist is the fan electronic (we'll come back to this later).

| Pet           |            |               |                |

From step 2, we know the fan country is between the owner of the frog and the fan electronic. Since the scientist is the fan electronic, the fan country must be between the owner of the frog and the scientist.

From step 3, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not the security-guard. Let's assume the security-guard has the hobby of writing (we'll come back to this later).

| Pet           | frog        |               |                |

From step 4, we know the fan country is to the left of the security-guard. Since the security-guard has the hobby of writing, the fan country must be to the left of the security-guard.

| Pet           | frog        |               |                |

From step 5, we know the person who's hobby is writing is not the fan country. Since the security-guard has the hobby of writing, the fan country cannot be the security-guard.

From step 6, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the security-guard has the hobby of writing, the person who's hobby is fishing must be to the left of the security-guard.

| Pet           | frog        |               |                |

From step 7, we know the mechanic is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard has the hobby of writing, the mechanic must be adjacent to the security-guard.

| Pet           | frog        |               |                |

From step 8, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the security-guard. Since the security-guard has the hobby of writing, the owner of the chinchilla must be adjacent to the security-guard.

| Pet           | frog        | chinchilla | snake         |

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps:

From statement 2, we know the French is on the left of the Mexican, so the French must be in position 1. From statement 3, we know the fan of House is the French, so the French's music genre is House.

2. The fan country is the person driving the motorbike.
This means the country row must be paired with the motorbike column.

3. The person driving the van is not the person who's sport is baseball.
This means the van column cannot be paired with the baseball row.

4. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van.
This means the rugby row must be paired with a column to the left of the van column.

5. The person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.
This means the baseball row must be paired with the far right column.

6. The fan soul is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is rugby.

8. The person eating corn is somewhere to the left of the person driving the van.
This means the corn row must be paired with a column to the left of the van column.

From step 1, we know the biathlon row must be paired with the garlic column. From step 5, we know the baseball row must be paired with the far right column. From step 8, we know the corn row must be paired with a column to the left of the van column.

From step 4, we know the rugby row must be paired with a column to the left of the van column. From step 3, we know the van column cannot be paired with the baseball row. Therefore, the van column must be paired with the pomegranate row.
