Lv1-7x2-1	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues first.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking water is on the far left. Let's assume the person drinking water is in the first column.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony. Since there are only two pets, the pony must be in the second column.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not a fan of hip-hop. This means that the person who's hobby is writing must be in the third column.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake. Since the pony is in the second column, the snake must be in the fourth column. This means that the person driving the scooter is in the third column.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since there are only two sports, cricket must be in the fifth column. This means that the person driving the trike is in the sixth column.

From clue 3, we know that the Italian is in an odd position. Since there are only two nationalities, the Italian must be in the third or fifth column. However, the person driving the scooter is already in the third column, so the Italian must be in the fifth column.

Here's the current state of the table:

|               |    1    |       2       |    3    |    4    |    5    |    6    |

| Transport     |         |               | scooter |         |         | trike    |

Now we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not a fan of hip-hop. This means that the person in the third column must be a fan of dubstep.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of dubstep is the owner of the pony. This means that the person in the second column is the fan of dubstep.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the left of the owner of the snake. This means that the person in the third column is driving the scooter.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket. This means that the person in the sixth column is driving the trike.
