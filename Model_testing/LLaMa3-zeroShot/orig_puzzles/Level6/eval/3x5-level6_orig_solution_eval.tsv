| Videographer | disco     |            | hedgehog    | snake     |         |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 15, we know the fan rock is the doctor.
2. From statement 3, we know the fan disco is on the left or right of the fan hip-hop. Since the doctor is the fan rock, and the fan rock is not mentioned in statement 3, we can conclude that the fan disco is not the doctor. Therefore, the fan disco must be the videographer.
3. From statement 5, we know the fan metal is on the left of the videographer. Since the videographer is the fan disco, the fan metal must be the analyst.
4. From statement 6, we know the owner of the ferret is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the analyst is the fan metal, and the fan metal is on the left of the videographer, the owner of the ferret must be the analyst.
5. From statement 2, we know the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the fan disco. Since the owner of the ferret is the analyst, and the fan disco is the videographer, the analyst must be on the right of the videographer.
6. From statement 12, we know the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the freelancer. Since the freelancer is not the doctor (from statement 15), and the doctor is the fan rock, the freelancer must be the paramedic.
7. From statement 10, we know the paramedic is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog. Since the paramedic is the freelancer, and the freelancer is on the left of the goldfish, the owner of the hedgehog must be the videographer.
8. From statement 9, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the freelancer. Since the owner of the hedgehog is the videographer, the freelancer must be on the left of the videographer.
9. From statement 1, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. Since the owner of the ferret is the analyst, and the owner of the frog is not the analyst (from statement 4), the owner of the frog must be the paramedic.
10. From statement 11, we know the fan pop is on the left or right of the fan hip-hop. Since the fan hip-hop is the paramedic, and the fan pop is not the paramedic (from statement 2), the fan pop must be the freelancer.

The remaining pet, snake, must be owned by the doctor, as there is no other available spot."	{'doctor': ['rock', '', '', '', ''], 'freelancer': ['pop', '', '', 'goldfish', ''], 'paramedic': ['hip-hop', '', '', '', 'videographer'], 'analyst': ['metal', 'ferret', '', '', ''], 'videographer': ['disco', '', 'hedgehog', 'snake', '']}	False	0	False
Lv1-3x5-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Let's assume they are on the right of the person eating blueberry (we can come back to this assumption later).

From statement 3, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person eating blueberry. This confirms our assumption.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Let's assume the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person eating blueberry (again, we can come back to this assumption later).

From statement 7, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading. This means that the person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person eating blueberry.

From statement 2, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Let's assume the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.

From statement 8, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling, the person who's hobby is photography must be on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

From statement 9, we know that the person eating cucumber is in an even position. This means that the person eating cucumber is either in the first or third position.

From statement 10, we know that the person eating lemon is not the person who's sport is soccer. This means that the person eating lemon must be the person who's sport is cricket (since the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating mango, and the person eating lemon is not the person who's sport is soccer).

From statement 11, we know that the person eating mango is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person eating lemon is the person who's sport is cricket, the person eating mango must be on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.

From statement 12, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating mango. This confirms our previous assumption.

From statement 13, we know that the person eating zucchini is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person eating zucchini must be on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

From statement 14, we know that the person eating mango is not the person who's sport is cricket. This means that the person eating mango must be the person who's sport is soccer.

From statement 15, we know that the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the person eating cucumber is in an even position, the person eating cucumber must be on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

* The person eating blueberry is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
* The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who's sport is lacrosse.
* The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person eating blueberry.
* The person eating lemon is the person who's sport is cricket.
* The person eating mango is the person who's sport is soccer.
* The person eating zucchini is on the right of the person eating blueberry.
* The person eating cucumber is in an even position and on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

With this information, we can construct the final solution table:

2. From clue 6, we know the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the rat is eating blueberry, the owner of the bird must be eating peach (from clue 12).
3. From clue 3, we know the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the left of the paramedic. Since the paramedic is not the owner of the bird (from clue 17), the owner of the ferret must be the person eating artichoke.
4. From clue 5, we know the person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is the owner of the rat, the person eating grapefruit must be the architect.
5. From clue 8, we know the person eating grapefruit is between the person eating orange and the architect. This confirms that the architect is eating grapefruit.
6. From clue 9, we know the person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the architect. This confirms that the person eating orange is the security-guard.
7. From clue 11, we know the architect is somewhere to the right of the dancer. This confirms that the dancer is eating peach.
8. From clue 15, we know the person eating orange is somewhere to the right of the lawyer. This confirms that the lawyer is eating artichoke.
9. From clue 16, we know the owner of the bird is on the left of the person eating blueberry. This confirms that the owner of the bird is the person eating peach.
10. From clue 17, we know the paramedic is not the owner of the bird. This confirms that the paramedic is eating hamster.

The remaining assignments are straightforward:

* The person eating blueberry is the owner of the rat.
* The person eating grapefruit is the architect.
* The person eating orange is the security-guard.
* The person eating peach is the owner of the bird.
* The person eating artichoke is the lawyer.
* The person eating hamster is the paramedic.
* The person eating ferret is the person eating artichoke (from clue 3).
* The person eating snake is the dancer (from clue 11)."	{'food': ['peach', 'blueberry', 'grapefruit', 'orange', 'artichoke'], 'job': ['lawyer', 'paramedic', 'architect', 'security-guard', 'dancer'], 'pet': ['hamster', 'rat', 'ferret', 'bird', 'snake']}	True	4	False

Lv1-3x5-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is swimming is the person drinking cola.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking cola is between the person who's sport is cricket and the person drinking iced-tea. This means the order is: cricket -> cola -> iced-tea.

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since cola is between cricket and iced-tea, badminton must be to the left of cricket.

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is badminton is somewhere to the right of the fan funk. Since badminton is to the left of cricket, funk must be to the left of badminton.

From statement 13, we know the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking coffee. This means milk and coffee are adjacent.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking milk is on the far left or far right. Since milk and coffee are adjacent, milk must be on the far left.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee. Since iced-tea is between cricket and cola, and cola is between cricket and iced-tea, iced-tea must be to the left of cricket.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is the fan hip-hop. Since biathlon is on the far right (statement 12), hip-hop must be on the far right.

From statement 9, we know the fan rock is in an odd position. Since rock is not adjacent to milk or coffee, it must be in the middle.

From statement 11, we know the person drinking cola is on the right of the fan folk. Since cola is between cricket and iced-tea, folk must be to the left of cricket.

* From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the owner of the rabbit.
* From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the owner of the fish is watching musical movies, the person who's hobby is traveling must be either on the left or right of the fish owner.
* From clue 7, we know the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the fish owner, the person watching romance movies must be on the left of the fish owner.
* From clue 2, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is not the person watching horror movies (clue 3), the owner of the guinea-pig must be on the left of the person watching romance movies.
* From clue 8, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is already on the left of the person watching romance movies, the person watching satire movies must be on the left of the person watching romance movies.
* From clue 11, we know the owner of the hamster is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is not the person who's hobby is traveling (clue 12), the owner of the hamster must be on the right of the person watching animation movies.
* From clue 13, we know the owner of the cat is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is already on the left of the person watching satire movies, the owner of the cat must be between the person watching satire movies and the person watching animation movies.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is already on the far right (clue 4), the person who's hobby is gardening must be on the far right.
