Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 8, the freelancer is on the far left, and from clue 7, the freelancer is the German. So, the German is on the far left.
2. From clue 2, the librarian is in the middle. Since the German is on the far left, the librarian must be in position 2.

4. From clue 10, the teacher is in an odd position (not 2). From clue 11, the teacher is not the person eating broccoli. So, the teacher must be in position 1.
5. From clue 15, the person eating zucchini is the musician. From clue 16, the person eating zucchini is somewhere to the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the teacher is in position 1, the musician must be in position 4.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 5, the person drinking water is in the middle. Since there are 5 beverages, water must be in position 3.
2. From statement 20, the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the fan classical. Since almond-milk is in position 2, the fan classical must be in position 4 or 5.
3. From statement 15, the fan classical is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the fan classical is in position 4 or 5, almond-milk must be in position 2.

5. From statement 3, the person drinking 7up is the owner of the cat. Since the cat is not in position 1 (due to statement 1), it must be in position 5.
6. From statement 11, the fan pop is on the far left. Since pop is in position 1, the other music genres can be placed accordingly.
7. From statement 8, the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the fan d&b. Since the fan d&b is in position 3, the goldfish must be in position 2.

Lv1-4x5-10	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the people's hobbies, movie genres, pets, and sports:

|               |     1     |      2       |     3      |       4       |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   | animation | crime       | epic        | horror       | scientific|
| Pet           | chinchilla| fish        | pony        | snake        | rabbit    |
| Sport         | biathlon  | handball    | lacrosse    | tennis       | skateboarding|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left. From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since biathlon is on the far left, skydiving must be the second person from the left.
* From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since skydiving is the second person from the left, skateboarding must be the third person from the left.
* From clue 15, we know the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony. From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Therefore, the owner of the rabbit must be the person who's hobby is gardening.
* From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since gardening is already assigned to the owner of the rabbit, magic-tricks must be the person who's hobby is hiking.
* From clue 14, we know the owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. From clue 16, we know the owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony. Therefore, the owner of the snake must be the person who's sport is lacrosse.
* From clue 17, we know the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the right of the person watching animation movies. From clue 6, we know the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Therefore, the owner of the chinchilla must be the person who's hobby is chess.
* From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since chess is already assigned to the owner of the chinchilla, skateboarding must be the person who's sport is tennis.
* From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is not the person watching crime movies. From clue 2, we know the owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Therefore, the person watching crime movies must be the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
* From clue 7, we know the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies. From clue 11, we know the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Therefore, the person watching epic movies must be the person who's hobby is gardening.
* From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is not the person who's sport is biathlon. From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Therefore, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be the person who's hobby is hiking.
