Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating pepper is in an even position.
This means the person eating pepper is either in the 2nd or 4th position.

2. The person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the British.
This means the person eating kale is either in the 3rd or 4th position.

Combining clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person eating kale is in the 4th position.

3. The Russian is the fan of D&B.
This means the Russian is in the 1st position.

4. The fan of Disco is on the far left.
This means the fan of Disco is in the 1st position, but we already know the Russian is in the 1st position, so the fan of Disco must be the British.

5. The French is not the fan of Techno.
This means the French must be the fan of either D&B or Disco. Since the Russian is the fan of D&B, the French must be the fan of Disco.

6. The fan of D&B is on the right of the fan of Techno.
This means the Russian (fan of D&B) is in the 3rd position, and the fan of Techno is in the 2nd position.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |   1    |    2    |    3    |
| Food          |  Plum  |  Techno |  Kale   |
| Music-Genre   |  Disco |  French |  D&B    |
| Nationality   |  British |  Russian |  French  |
#############

The final solution is:

* The person eating plum is the British fan of Disco.
* The person eating techno is the Russian fan of D&B.
* The person eating kale is the French fan of Disco."
Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the rat is not Dutch.
2. The person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball.
3. The person who's sport is basketball is not British.
4. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog.
5. The owner of the goldfish is on the far left.
6. The British is on the right of the Polish.
7. The owner of the frog is in an even position.

From clue 5, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the far left. Let's assume the goldfish owner is British (we'll come back to this later).

From clue 6, we know the British is on the right of the Polish. This means the Polish is on the left of the British.

From clue 7, we know the owner of the frog is in an even position. Since the Polish is on the left, the frog owner must be in the middle.

Now, let's look at clue 4. The person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the frog. Since the frog owner is in the middle, baseball must be on the right side.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since baseball is on the right, basketball must be on the left.

Now, let's look at clue 1. The owner of the rat is not Dutch. This means the rat owner must be either British or Polish.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is basketball is not British. This means the basketball player must be either Dutch or Polish.

Since the Polish is already taken by the goldfish owner, the basketball player must be Dutch. This means the rat owner is British.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|               |    1     |     2      |    3     |
| Nationality   |  Dutch   |  Polish   |  British  |
| Pet           |  Goldfish|    Frog   |    Rat    |
| Sport         |  Basketball|  Swimming |  Baseball |
#############

Note that we assumed the goldfish owner is British initially, but it turned out to be the Polish. This is a common technique in logic puzzles, where we make an educated guess and then adjust our solution based on the clues."

1. The videographer is on the right of the fan of blues.
This means the videographer is either the fan of blues or is to the right of the fan of blues.

2. The fan of dubstep is not the videographer.
This means the fan of dubstep is either the videographer or is to the left of the videographer.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the firefighter and the bartender.
This means the firefighter and the bartender are on either side of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

4. The bartender is somewhere to the left of the firefighter.
This means the bartender is either to the left of the firefighter or is the same person as the firefighter.

5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the videographer.
This means the videographer is either the person who's sport is snowboarding or is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The videographer is on the right of the fan of blues, so the fan of blues is either the videographer or is to the left of the videographer.
* The fan of dubstep is not the videographer, so the fan of dubstep is either the videographer or is to the left of the videographer.
* The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the firefighter and the bartender, and the bartender is to the left of the firefighter. This means the person who's sport is weightlifting is either the firefighter or the bartender.
* The person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the videographer, so the videographer is either the person who's sport is snowboarding or is to the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Sport         |           |               |              |

From clue 1, we know the videographer is on the right of the fan of blues. Let's assume the fan of blues is 1. Then, the videographer is 3.

From clue 2, we know the fan of dubstep is not the videographer. Let's assume the fan of dubstep is 2. Then, the videographer is 3.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is between the firefighter and the bartender. Let's assume the firefighter is 1. Then, the bartender is 2, and the person who's sport is weightlifting is 3.

From clue 4, we know the bartender is to the left of the firefighter. This is already satisfied by our assumption.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is to the right of the videographer. Let's assume the person who's sport is snowboarding is 2. Then, the videographer is 3.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage.
2. The lawyer is somewhere to the right of the librarian.
3. The person eating cabbage is the fan of R&B.
4. The fan of blues is on the left or right of the librarian.
5. The lawyer is not the person eating cauliflower.
6. The librarian is somewhere to the right of the social-worker.
7. The lawyer is not the fan of blues.

From statement 3, we know the person eating cabbage is the fan of R&B. From statement 1, we know the fan of blues is on the left or right of this person. Since the fan of blues is not the lawyer (statement 7), the fan of blues must be the social-worker.

From statement 2, we know the lawyer is to the right of the librarian. From statement 6, we know the librarian is to the right of the social-worker. Therefore, the order is: social-worker, librarian, lawyer.

Now, let's determine the food preferences:

* The person eating cabbage is the fan of R&B (statement 3). Since the fan of blues is the social-worker, the person eating cabbage must be the social-worker.
* The lawyer is not the person eating cauliflower (statement 5). Therefore, the lawyer must be eating watermelon.
* The librarian is left with cauliflower.

Lv1-3x3-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the fan of folk music is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position (statement 7), the fan of folk music must be in an even position.

From statement 3, we know that the fan of gospel music is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the fan of gospel music is not the project-manager (statement 2), the project-manager must be the fan of either folk or rock music.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the person who's hobby is reading is not the project-manager (statement 6), the videographer must be the project-manager.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the videographer, the person who's hobby is reading must be in the second position.

From statement 1, we know that the person eating onion is on the left of the person eating grapefruit.

From statement 2, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person eating onion. This means that the person eating onion is not driving the jet-ski.

From statement 3, we know that the person driving the ship is not the person eating lime. This doesn't give us any new information, but it's a useful fact to keep in mind.

From statement 4, we know that the owner of the pony is in the middle. This means that the pony owner is not eating onion (since onion is on the left) and not driving the jet-ski (since jet-ski is on the left of onion).

From statement 5, we know that the person driving the ship is not the owner of the pony. This means that the ship driver is eating either grapefruit or lime.

From statement 6, we know that the owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. This means that the pony owner is not eating chinchilla food (since chinchilla food would be on the right of pony owner).

1. The person who's sport is swimming is in an odd position.
This means the person who likes swimming is either in the first or third position.

2. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the librarian.
This means the librarian is either in the first or second position, and the goldfish owner is in the second or third position.

3. The coach is on the right of the pilot.
This means the pilot is either in the first or second position, and the coach is in the second or third position.

4. The owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
This means the rat owner is either in the first or third position, and the goldfish owner is in the second position.

5. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
This means the skateboarding person is either in the first or second position, and the rabbit owner is in the second or third position.

6. The owner of the rabbit is not the person who's sport is swimming.
This means the rabbit owner is not in the first or third position (since the swimming person is in one of those positions).

Now, let's combine the information:

* The pilot is either in the first or second position (from 3).

* The goldfish owner is in the second position (from 2 and 4).
* The rat owner is either in the first or third position (from 4).
* The skateboarding person is either in the first or second position (from 5).
* The rabbit owner is not in the first or third position (from 6).

From statement 1, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the far left or far right. This means the motorbike driver cannot be in the middle position.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike. This means the cola drinker cannot be in the far right position.

From statement 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking water. This means the water drinker cannot be in the far right position.

From statement 5, we know the person eating onion is not the person drinking cola. This means the onion eater cannot be in the same row as the cola drinker.

From statement 6, we know the person eating onion is not the person drinking fanta. This means the onion eater cannot be in the same row as the fanta drinker.

From statement 7, we know the person eating onion is the person eating onion (a tautology, but it doesn't provide any new information).

* The motorbike driver is either in position 1 or 3.
* The cola drinker is in position 1 or 2.
* The water drinker is in position 2 or 3.
* The onion eater is not in the same row as the cola drinker, so they must be in position 3.

|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |
| Food          | Zucchini   | Watermelon  | Cucumber |
| Job           | Doctor    | Architect  | Videographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Crime       | Mystery   |

The final solution table is:

#############
|               |     1      |      2       |     3     |
| Food          | Zucchini   | Watermelon  | Cucumber |
| Job           | Doctor    | Architect  | Videographer |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Crime       | Mystery   |
