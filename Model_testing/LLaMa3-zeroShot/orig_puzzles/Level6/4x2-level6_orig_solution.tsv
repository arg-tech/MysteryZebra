Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means that the mango-eater cannot be the person drinking soy-milk, and the mango-eater must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker.

2. The manager is not the person eating mango.
This means that the manager cannot be the mango-eater. Since there are only two jobs, the manager must be the electrician.

3. The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means that the writer must be to the left of the soy-milk drinker.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   |             |             |

| Hobby      |             |             |
| Job        |             |             |
#############

From clue 1, we know the mango-eater is to the left of the soy-milk drinker. From clue 2, we know the manager (electrician) is not the mango-eater. Therefore, the mango-eater must be the person with the job.

From clue 3, we know the writer is to the left of the soy-milk drinker. Since the mango-eater is already to the left of the soy-milk drinker, the writer must be to the left of the mango-eater.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |      1      |      2      |
| Beverage   | Sprite     | Soy-milk   |
| Food       | Mango      | Broccoli  |
| Hobby      | Writing    | Board-games|
| Job        | Manager    | Electrician|
#############

The final solution is:

* Person 1: Manager (electrician), eats broccoli, enjoys board-games, drinks sprite
* Person 2: Electrician, eats mango, enjoys writing, drinks soy-milk"
Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person watching comedy movies is in an odd position (4).
This means the person watching comedy movies is in either the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
This means the person drinking 7up is in an even position (2nd or 4th), and the person who's sport is skiing is in the 1st position.

3. The person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk.
This means the person driving the airplane is drinking 7up, and the person drinking almond-milk is driving the boat.

#############

From clue 3, we know the person driving the airplane is not the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking 7up is in the 2nd position, the person driving the airplane must be in the 1st position. This means the person drinking almond-milk is in the 3rd position.

P1: Zombie movies

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not the person drinking 7up.

P1: Zombie movies
P2: 7up, Filmmaking

3. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
This means the person driving the airplane is either P1 or P2. Since P1 is watching zombie movies, P1 is not driving the airplane. Therefore, P2 is driving the airplane.

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: electronic, punk
2. There are 2 different nationalities: brazilian, dutch
3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: swimming, tennis
4. The people use 2 different means of transport: airplane, roller

From clue 3, we know the brazilian is a fan of punk music.

From clue 1, we know the brazilian is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller. This means the brazilian cannot be the one driving the roller.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is tennis is not a fan of punk music. Since the brazilian is a fan of punk music, the person who's sport is tennis cannot be the brazilian.

Now, let's fill in the table:

The brazilian is a fan of punk music, so they must be in the second column. The person driving the roller is in the first column, and the brazilian is to the right of them, so the person driving the roller must be Dutch. The person who's sport is tennis is not the brazilian, so they must be in the first column. The person who's sport is swimming is not the brazilian, so they must be in the second column.

1. The person who's hobby is singing is somewhere to the right of the journalist.
This means that the singer's column (Hobby) is to the right of the journalist's column (Job).

2. The person watching fantasy movies is not the owner of the rabbit.
This means that the fantasy movie genre is not paired with the rabbit pet.

3. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the owner of the rabbit.
This means that the singer's column (Hobby) is either to the left or right of the rabbit's column (Pet).

From clue 1, we know the singer's column is to the right of the journalist's column. From clue 3, we know the singer's column is either to the left or right of the rabbit's column. Since the singer's column is already to the right of the journalist's column, it must be to the right of the rabbit's column as well.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Pet           |            |         |

From clue 2, we know the fantasy movie genre is not paired with the rabbit pet. Let's assume the fantasy movie genre is paired with the cat pet. This means the scientific movie genre must be paired with the rabbit pet.

Now, let's fill in the job and hobby columns. From clue 1, we know the singer's column is to the right of the journalist's column. Let's assume the journalist's job is in column 1 and the singer's hobby is in column 2.

| Pet           |            |         |

The only remaining space is for the movie-genre column. Since the fantasy movie genre is paired with the cat pet, it must be in column 1. The scientific movie genre is paired with the rabbit pet, so it must be in column 2.

This means the person doing magic-tricks is eating lemon.
