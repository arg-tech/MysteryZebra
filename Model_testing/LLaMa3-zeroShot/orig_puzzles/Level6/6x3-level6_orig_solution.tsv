Lv1-6x3-10	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the fish. Let's assume the owner of the fish is on the left. We can't determine the exact position yet, but we'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the rat is not a fan of classical music. This doesn't give us much information yet, but we'll keep it in mind.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the Polish person. This means the Polish person is on the left of the rat owner.

From clue 4, we know that the Polish person is driving the helicopter. This doesn't give us much information yet, but we'll keep it in mind.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. This means the jet-ski driver is on the right of the almond-milk drinker.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of trance music is somewhere to the right of the French person. This means the French person is on the left of the trance fan.

From clue 7, we know that the Polish person is on the right of the fisherman. This means the fisherman is on the left of the Polish person.

From clue 8, we know that the lawyer is on the right of the musician. This means the musician is on the left of the lawyer.

From clue 9, we know that the person drinking tea is on the right of the owner of the ferret. This means the ferret owner is on the left of the tea drinker.

From clue 10, we know that the fan of rock music is the French person.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |           |             |          |
| Job           |           |             |          |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |          |
| Nationality   |           |             |          |
| Pet           |           |             |          |
| Transport     |           |             |          |

We can start by placing the French person, who is a fan of rock music, somewhere in the table. Since the French person is on the left of the trance fan (clue 6), the trance fan must be on the right of the French person.

We can also place the Polish person, who is driving the helicopter (clue 4), on the right of the fisherman (clue 7). This means the fisherman is on the left of the Polish person.

Now, let's try to place the person drinking almond-milk. From clue 1, we know they are on the right of the owner of the fish. From clue 5, we know they are on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski driver is on the right of the almond-milk drinker, the jet-ski driver must be on the right of the fish owner.

We can also place the person drinking tea. From clue 9, we know they are on the right of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is on the left of the tea drinker, the ferret owner must be on the left of the fish owner.

Now, let's try to place the owner of the rat. From clue 2, we know they are not a fan of classical music. From clue 3, we know they are on the right of the Polish person. Since the Polish person is on the right of the fisherman, the rat owner must be on the right of the fisherman.

Here's the final solution table:
