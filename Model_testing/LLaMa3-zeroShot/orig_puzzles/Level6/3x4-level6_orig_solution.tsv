Lv1-3x4-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 3, we know the social-worker is the person eating lime.

From statement 10, we know the architect is on the right of the social-worker.

From statement 11, we know the social-worker is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goldfish. This means the social-worker is not the owner of the goldfish.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the cat and the social-worker. Since the social-worker is eating lime, the owner of the hedgehog must be to the left of the social-worker.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the cat and the social-worker, the owner of the hedgehog must be to the left of the owner of the cat.

From statement 6, we know the person eating radish is the fisherman. This means the fisherman is not eating lime, corn, or asparagus.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person eating asparagus. Since the fisherman is eating radish, the owner of the rat must be to the left of the fisherman.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the rat is not the architect. Since the architect is on the right of the social-worker, the owner of the rat must be to the left of the social-worker.

From statement 8, we know the person eating corn is not the owner of the rat. This means the person eating corn is either the social-worker (eating lime) or the architect.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the cat is somewhere to the left of the person eating lime. Since the social-worker is eating lime, the owner of the cat must be to the left of the social-worker.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|        |     1     |     2      |       3       |     4     |
| Food   |           |            |               |           |
| Job    |           |            |               |           |
| Pet    |           |            |               |           |
#############
| Food   | Radish    | Lime      | Asparagus   | Corn     |
| Job    | Fisherman | Social-worker | Architect  | Freelancer |
| Pet    |          | Cat        | Hedgehog   | Goldfish  |
#############

Here's the solution:

* The fisherman eats radish.
* The social-worker eats lime.
* The architect eats asparagus.
* The freelancer eats corn.
* The owner of the cat is to the left of the social-worker.
* The owner of the hedgehog is between the owner of the cat and the social-worker.
* The owner of the rat is to the left of the fisherman.
* The owner of the goldfish is to the right of the social-worker."
Lv1-3x4-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking water is between the dressmaker and the person drinking 7up.
2. The social-worker is on the left of the person drinking 7up.
3. The fan of techno is on the left or right of the dressmaker.
4. The entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
5. The person drinking 7up is in an even position.
6. The fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
7. The person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of salsa.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking water is between the dressmaker and the person drinking 7up. Let's assume the dressmaker is on the left. Then, the person drinking water is in the middle, and the person drinking 7up is on the right.

From clue 2, we know the social-worker is on the left of the person drinking 7up. Since the dressmaker is on the left, the social-worker must be on the far left.

From clue 3, we know the fan of techno is on the left or right of the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is on the left, the fan of techno must be on the far left, next to the social-worker.

From clue 4, we know the entrepreneur is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking 7up is on the right, the entrepreneur must be on the far right.

From clue 5, we know the person drinking 7up is in an even position. Since the person drinking 7up is on the right, it must be in the 2nd or 4th position.

From clue 6, we know the fan of r&b is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking 7up is on the right, the person drinking sprite must be on the left of the person drinking 7up.

From clue 7, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not the fan of salsa. This doesn't give us any new information, but it helps to rule out some possibilities.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |       1       |        2        |      3       |      4      |

| Job           |               |                 |              |             |
| Music-Genre   |               |                 |              |             |

| Social-worker |  Punk         |  Techno        |  Water       |  R&B        |
| Dressmaker    |  Almond-milk  |  Salsa        |  7up         |  Entrepreneur |
| Project-manager|  Sprite       |  R&B          |  Almond-milk  |  Techno      |
|                |              |              |              |             |
#############

The solution is:

* Social-worker: Punk
* Dressmaker: Almond-milk
* Project-manager: Sprite
* Entrepreneur: Techno

Note that the fan of salsa is not explicitly mentioned, but we can infer that the person drinking water is the fan of salsa, since they are between the dressmaker and the person drinking 7up."
Lv1-3x4-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading. This means that the cooking person cannot be in the first column.

From statement 3, we know that the person driving the roller is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. This means that the woodworking person cannot be in the first column.

From statement 5, we know that the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram. This means that the tram driver cannot be in the first column.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person eating artichoke. This means that the artichoke eater cannot be in the first column.

From statement 7, we know that the person driving the train is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. This means that the writing person cannot be in the first column.

From statement 8, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not the person driving the train. This means that the train driver cannot be the writing person.

From statement 9, we know that the person eating cherry is on the right of the person eating artichoke. This means that the artichoke eater cannot be in the last column.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|             |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |

| Transport   |            |             |           |         |

From the above analysis, we know that the first column cannot have the cooking, woodworking, tram driver, or writing person. Therefore, the first column must be the person eating cherry.

|             |     1      |      2      |     3     |    4    |

From statement 5, we know that the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person driving the tram. Therefore, the radish eater must be in the second column.

| Transport   | Train     |             |           |         |

From statement 8, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is not the person driving the train. Therefore, the writing person must be in the last column.
