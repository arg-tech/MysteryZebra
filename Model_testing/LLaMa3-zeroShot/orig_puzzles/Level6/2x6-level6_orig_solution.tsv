From statement 12, we know the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is on the right of the person drinking sprite, the person drinking coffee must be on the right of the person drinking sprite.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the bird is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the owner of the snake is between the person drinking sprite and the person drinking hot-chocolate, the owner of the bird must be on the right of the snake.

From statement 11, we know the owner of the ferret is not the person drinking juice. Since the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the turtle, and the owner of the ferret is not the person drinking juice, the owner of the ferret must be on the left of the turtle.

From statement 13, we know the owner of the frog is in an odd position. Since the owner of the frog is not the person drinking hot-chocolate (statement 4), and the owner of the bird is the person drinking hot-chocolate (statement 10), the owner of the frog must be in an odd position.
