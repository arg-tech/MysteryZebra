| Job           | architect| coach   |  teacher| entrepreneur| writer | photographer |
| Nationality   | british  | chinese |  german | colombian | japanese | russian  |
#############

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. The german is on the left of the chinese, so the order is: british, german, chinese,...
2. The coach is on the left of the entrepreneur, so the order is: british, german, chinese, coach, entrepreneur,...
3. The writer is on the left or right of the photographer, so the writer can't be on the far left or far right. The photographer must be on the far right, so the writer is on the second-to-last position.
4. The person eating pineapple is on the left or right of the person eating peach, so the pineapple-eater can't be on the far left or far right. The peach-eater must be on the third position, so the pineapple-eater is on the second or fourth position.
5. The british is on the right of the architect, so the order is: architect, british, german, chinese,...
6. The person eating pineapple is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear, so the pineapple-eater is on the second or fourth position, and the pear-eater is on the fifth position.
7. The chinese is on the left or right of the german, so the chinese is on the third or fourth position.
8. The entrepreneur is the colombian, so the entrepreneur is on the fourth position.
9. The person eating peach is somewhere to the left of the colombian, so the peach-eater is on the third position.
10. The japanese is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear, so the japanese is on the second or third position.
11. The entrepreneur is somewhere to the right of the person eating pineapple, so the entrepreneur is on the fourth position.
12. The person eating peach is between the colombian and the writer, so the order is: architect, british, german, chinese, peach, colombian, writer,...
13. The person eating radish is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot, so the radish-eater is on the last position.
14. The chinese is on the left or right of the japanese, so the chinese is on the third or fourth position.
15. The architect is on the far left, so the order is: architect, british, german, chinese,...
16. The entrepreneur is on the far right, so the order is: architect, british, german, chinese, colombian, writer, photographer, entrepreneur.
17. The person eating peach is on the left or right of the person eating pear, so the peach-eater is on the third position.
18. The person eating apricot is on the left or right of the german, so the apricot-eater is on the second or fourth position.

By combining these constraints, we get the final solution:
