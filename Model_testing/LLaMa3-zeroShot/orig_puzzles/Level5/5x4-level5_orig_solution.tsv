| Pet           |             |             |           |           |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. The person watching animation movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the fan of gospel, so animation is in position 1 or 3.
2. The person watching scientific movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching fantasy movies, so scientific is in position 3 or 4.
3. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical, so hamster is in position 1 or 2.
4. The person watching animation movies is in an odd position, so animation is in position 1.
5. The owner of the horse is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical, so horse is in position 3 or 4.
6. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon, so tennis is in position 1 or 4.
7. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee, so tea is in position 1 or 2.
8. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far left or far right, so fantasy is in position 1 or 4.
9. The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person who's sport is tennis, so biathlon is in position 2 or 3.
10. The person who's sport is tennis is the person drinking soy-milk, so tennis is in position 1 and soy-milk is in position 1.

12. The owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right, so mouse is in position 1 or 4.
13. The owner of the goat is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, so goat is in position 3.
14. The fan of metal is between the person drinking almond-milk and the person who's sport is handball, so metal is in position 2 and almond-milk is in position 1 or 3.

By combining these constraints, we arrive at the final solution."
