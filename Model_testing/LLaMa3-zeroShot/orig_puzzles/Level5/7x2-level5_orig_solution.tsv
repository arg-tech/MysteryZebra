Lv1-7x2-1	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Let's assume the person who's sport is surfing is on the left. We'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul is somewhere to the left of the fan of punk. This doesn't give us a specific position, but it helps us to keep in mind that the fan of soul is likely to be on the left.

From clue 3, we know that the manager is somewhere to the right of the person eating broccoli. This means that the person eating broccoli cannot be the manager.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship. This means that the person driving the ship cannot be the one drinking milk.

Now, let's try to fill in the table. We'll start with the person who's sport is surfing. Since they're on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving, they must be in the first column.

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              |            |
| Food          |              |            |
| Hobby         |              |            |
| Job           |              |            |

| Sport         | surfing     |            |
| Transport     |              |            |

Next, let's try to place the person eating broccoli. Since the manager is to the right of the person eating broccoli, the person eating broccoli cannot be the manager. The only other job is entrepreneur, so the person eating broccoli must be the entrepreneur.

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              |            |
| Food          | broccoli    |            |

| Transport     |              |            |

Now, let's try to place the person drinking milk. Since they're to the right of the person driving the ship, the person driving the ship cannot be the one drinking milk. The only other transport option is roller, so the person driving the ship must be the one driving the roller.

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              | milk      |
| Food          | broccoli    |            |

| Sport         | surfing     |            |
| Transport     | ship        | roller     |

Next, let's try to place the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since they're to the right of the person who's sport is surfing, they must be in the second column.

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      |              | milk      |
| Food          | broccoli    |            |
| Hobby         |              | skydiving |
| Job           | entrepreneur| manager    |
| Music-Genre   |              |            |
| Sport         | surfing     |            |
| Transport     | ship        | roller     |

Finally, let's try to place the fan of soul and the fan of punk. Since the fan of soul is to the left of the fan of punk, the fan of soul must be in the first column.

|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | cola        | milk      |
| Food          | broccoli    | cabbage   |
| Hobby         |              | skydiving |
| Job           | entrepreneur| manager    |

| Sport         | surfing     | water-polo |
| Transport     | ship        | roller     |

And that's the final solution!

Lv1-7x2-2	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the French person is to the left of the person who likes basketball. Let's assume the French person is in the first column.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating raspberry is to the left of the person watching family movies. Since the French person is already in the first column, the person eating raspberry must be in the second column.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the van is in an odd position. Since there are only 2 columns, the person driving the van must be in the third column.

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the cat is to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person eating raspberry is already in the second column, the owner of the cat must be in the first column.

From clue 5, we know that the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the cat is already in the first column, the owner of the snake must be in the third column.

Lv1-7x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching superhero movies is on the right of the Nigerian.
2. The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
3. The person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
4. The owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry.
5. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person watching superhero movies.

From statement 1, we know the Nigerian is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. From statement 5, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Therefore, the Nigerian is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the airplane is on the far right. This means the Nigerian cannot be on the far right, as they are on the left of the person watching superhero movies. Therefore, the Nigerian is in the second or third position from the left.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is basketball. Since the Nigerian is not on the far right, the person who's sport is basketball must be on the far left. This means the person who's sport is cricket is in the second or third position from the left.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating cherry. Since the Nigerian is not on the far right, the person eating cherry must be on the left of the Nigerian. This means the owner of the dog is in the third or fourth position from the left.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |

| Transport     |            |           |

From the above analysis, we can deduce the following:

* The Nigerian is in the second or third position from the left.
* The person who's sport is basketball is on the far left.
* The person who's sport is cricket is in the second or third position from the left.
* The owner of the dog is in the third or fourth position from the left.
* The person eating cherry is on the left of the Nigerian.

Let's try to fill in the table:

Lv1-7x2-5	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the lawyer is to the right of the person who watches action movies. Let's assume the lawyer is in position 3 or 4. If the lawyer is in position 3, the person who watches action movies must be in position 1 or 2. But then, the person who watches action movies would be to the left of the lawyer, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the lawyer must be in position 4.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the turtle is in an even position. Since the lawyer is in position 4, the owner of the turtle must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know that the fan of reggae is the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is in position 2, the fan of reggae must be in position 2.

From clue 3, we know that the Polish person is to the right of the person who does weightlifting. Since the owner of the turtle (fan of reggae) is in position 2, the Polish person must be in position 4 or 5. If the Polish person is in position 4, the person who does weightlifting would be in position 3, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the Polish person must be in position 5.

From clue 4, we know that the person who does parkour is on the left or right of the person who does sudoku. Since the Polish person is in position 5, the person who does parkour must be in position 1 or 2. If the person who does parkour is in position 1, the person who does sudoku would be in position 2. If the person who does parkour is in position 2, the person who does sudoku would be in position 1. In both cases, the person who does sudoku is to the left of the person who does parkour, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the person who does parkour must be in position 3.

| Transport     |                    |           |

Since the fan of ambient is the person driving the van, we can start by placing the van in one of the two far-left or far-right positions.

Let's assume the van is in position 1. Then, the fan of ambient is in position 1, and the person driving the van is also the fan of ambient.

|               |         1          |     2     |

| Transport     |  Van (Ambient)  |           |

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the fan of jazz. Since the fan of ambient is in position 1, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 1.

From statement 1, we know the police-officer is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since the entrepreneur is already in the first position, the police-officer must be in the second position. Let's assume the person watching musical movies is in the second position.

From statement 2, we know the Indian is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the police-officer is already in the second position, the Indian must be in the third position. Let's assume the person watching scientific movies is in the third position.
