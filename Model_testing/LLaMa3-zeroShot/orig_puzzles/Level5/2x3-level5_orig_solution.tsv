From clue 1, the baseball person is either in column 1 or 3. Let's assume they're in column 1 for now.

From clue 2, the badminton person is in column 1 or 2, and the dog owner is in column 2 or 3. Since the dog owner is on the right of the badminton person, the dog owner must be in column 3.

From clue 3, the turtle owner is in column 3, which is consistent with our assumption.
