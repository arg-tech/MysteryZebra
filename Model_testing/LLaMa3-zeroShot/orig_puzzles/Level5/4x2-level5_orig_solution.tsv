Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin.
This means the Pakistani cannot be in the top-left corner (Food: Blueberry, Hobby:?). Let's assume the Pakistani is in the top-right corner (Food:?, Hobby:?).

2. The person watching satire movies is the Pakistani.
This means the Pakistani is watching satire movies. Since there are only two movie-genres, the other person must be watching musical movies.

3. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
This means the person with filmmaking as their hobby is in the top-left corner, and the person with skydiving as their hobby is in the top-right corner.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          |            |           |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | musical   | satire    |
| Nationality   | argentine | pakistani |
#############

Since the Pakistani is watching satire movies, they must be in the top-right corner. The Argentine must be in the top-left corner, watching musical movies.

Now, let's determine the food preferences:

* The Pakistani is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin, so the Argentine must be eating pumpkin.
* The Argentine is watching musical movies, so they must be eating blueberry (since pumpkin is already taken).

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Food          | blueberry | pumpkin   |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | skydiving |
| Movie-Genre   | musical   | satire    |
| Nationality   | argentine | pakistani |

Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
This means that the person eating pomegranate is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person driving the snowmobile is in the 2nd or 3rd column.

2. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit.
This means that the owner of the rabbit is either in the 2nd or 3rd column, and the person watching epic movies is in the 1st or 2nd column.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

* The person eating pomegranate is not the owner of the rabbit (because the owner of the rabbit is to the right of the person watching epic movies, and the person eating pomegranate is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile).
* The person driving the snowmobile is not watching epic movies (because the person watching epic movies is to the left of the owner of the rabbit, and the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person eating pomegranate).

With these deductions, we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Food          | pomegranate | zucchini  |

Lv1-4x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means that the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" is to the left of the person with the hobby ""chess"".

2. The entrepreneur is somewhere to the left of the fan of house.
This means that the entrepreneur is to the left of the person who likes the music genre ""house"".

3. The mechanic is the person driving the ship.
This means that the mechanic uses the transport ""ship"".

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |      1       |    2     |

| Transport     |              |          |

From clue 1, we know that the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" is to the left of the person with the hobby ""chess"". Let's assume the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" is in position 1.

| Transport     |              |          |

From clue 2, we know that the entrepreneur is to the left of the fan of house. Since the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" is already in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 1. This means the fan of house is in position 2.

|               |      1       |    2     |

| Transport     |              |          |

From clue 3, we know that the mechanic is the person driving the ship. Since the mechanic is not the entrepreneur, they must be in position 2. This means the person in position 2 has the job ""mechanic"" and uses the transport ""ship"".

| Music-Genre   |              | House    |
| Transport     |              | Ship     |

Finally, we need to determine the music genre for the person in position 1. Since the person in position 2 likes the music genre ""house"", the person in position 1 must like the other music genre, which is ""trance"".

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
This means that the person drinking 7up cannot be in the first column (Transport). Let's assume the person driving the jet-ski is in the first column. Then, the person drinking 7up must be in the second or third column.

2. The person who's hobby is collecting is on the far right.
This means that the person's hobby is collecting must be in the third column (Hobby).

3. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
This means that the person drinking 7up must be in the same row as the person watching epic movies. Since the person drinking 7up is not in the first column, the person watching epic movies must be in the first column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

From clue 1, we know the person drinking 7up is not in the first column, so they must be in the second or third column. From clue 3, we know the person drinking 7up is in the same row as the person watching epic movies, so the person drinking 7up must be in the second column.

Now, we can fill in the beverage column:

2. The person who's sport is surfing is in an odd position.
This means the person who surfs is either in position 1 or 3. Since the firefighter is on the right of the person eating asparagus, the person who surfs cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the person who surfs is in position 3.

Lv1-4x2-7	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the owner of the fish.
This means that the coffee drinker is either in the Job or Hobby column, and the fish owner is in the Pet column.

2. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the coach.
This means that the coach is either in the Job or Hobby column, and the fish owner is in the Pet column.

3. The person drinking coffee is the person who's hobby is camping.
This means that the coffee drinker is in the Hobby column, and their hobby is camping.

From clue 3, we know that the coffee drinker's hobby is camping, so they must be in the Hobby column. From clue 1, we know that the coffee drinker is to the left of the fish owner, so the fish owner must be in the Pet column.

From clue 2, we know that the coach is to the left of the fish owner, so the coach must be in the Job column.

Now we can start filling in the table:

#############
|            |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage   |         |             |

| Job        | Coach   | Paramedic   |
| Pet        |         | Fish        |
#############

We still have some unknowns, but we can make some educated guesses:

* The person drinking coffee is the one with the camping hobby, so they must drink coffee.
* The owner of the fish is in the Pet column, so they must drink sprite.
* The coach is in the Job column, so they must not drink coffee (since the coffee drinker is in the Hobby column).
* The paramedic is in the Job column, so they must not drink coffee (since the coffee drinker is in the Hobby column).

With these guesses, we can fill in the Beverage column:

#############
|            |    1    |      2      |
| Beverage   | Coffee  | Sprite     |
| Hobby      | Camping | Photography |
| Job        | Coach   | Paramedic   |
| Pet        |         | Fish        |
#############

Finally, we can fill in the remaining unknowns:

* The person with the photography hobby must drink sprite (since the coffee drinker is already accounted for).
* The person with the paramedic job must keep a horse as a pet (since the fish owner is already accounted for).

Here's the final solution:
