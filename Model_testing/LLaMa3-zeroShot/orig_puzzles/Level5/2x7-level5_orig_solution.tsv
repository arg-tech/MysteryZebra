Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is baking is the person eating asparagus. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is somewhere to the right of the person eating asparagus. Since there's only one person eating asparagus, the person who's hobby is board-games must be the one eating kale.
2. From statement 10, we know the person eating lemon is the person who's hobby is hiking. From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since there's only one person eating lemon, the person who's hobby is gardening must be the one eating potato.
3. From statement 9, we know the person eating artichoke is on the left of the person eating cranberry. From statement 4, we know the person eating cranberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since there's only one person eating artichoke, the person who's hobby is writing must be the one eating artichoke.
4. From statement 2, we know the person eating plum is on the right of the person eating lemon. From statement 8, we know the person eating kale is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since there's only one person eating plum, the person who's hobby is cooking must be the one eating plum.
5. From statement 17, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking. From statement 13, we know the person who's hobby is baking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since there's only one person eating cranberry, the person who's hobby is card-games must be the one eating cranberry.

By combining these deductions, we can fill in the entire table."

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 15, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person eating broccoli. From statement 16, we know the person eating broccoli is the person drinking hot-chocolate, so they are the same person.
2. From statement 4, we know the person drinking water is on the right of the person eating broccoli. Since the person eating broccoli is also drinking hot-chocolate, the person drinking water must be in position 7.
3. From statement 7, we know the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. From statement 8, we know the person eating zucchini is on the far left or far right, so they must be in position 1.
4. From statement 11, we know the person eating zucchini is on the left of the person eating radish. Since the person eating zucchini is in position 1, the person eating radish must be in position 2.
5. From statement 10, we know the person eating radish is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person eating radish is in position 2, the person drinking tea must be in position 3.
6. From statement 13, we know the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 3, the person eating pepper must be in position 4.
7. From statement 6, we know the person eating carrot is in an odd position. Since the person eating pepper is in position 4, the person eating carrot must be in position 6.
8. From statement 5, we know the person eating asparagus is somewhere to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2, the person eating asparagus must be in position 5.
9. From statement 2, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person eating cabbage. Since the person eating cabbage is in an odd position (statement 3), they must be in position 5. The person drinking mirinda must be in position 3 or 6. However, from statement 12, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, so the person drinking mirinda must be in position 6.
10. The only remaining position is fanta, which must be in position 2.

Here's the breakdown of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 4 and 16, we know the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position and watches Western movies. Since the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies (clue 11), the person watching time-travel movies must be in an odd position.
2. From clue 10, we know the owner of the rabbit is between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching drama movies. Since the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the owner of the mouse (clue 9), the owner of the mouse must be on the far right.
3. From clue 15, we know the owner of the mouse is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the mouse is on the far right, the owner of the rabbit must be in the middle.
4. From clue 7, we know the owner of the fish is in the middle. Since the owner of the fish is on the left of the owner of the rat (clue 3), the owner of the rat must be on the right.
5. From clue 1, we know the person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is on the right, the person watching mystery movies must be in the second position.
6. From clue 12, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching mystery movies is in the second position, the person watching satire movies must be in the first position.
7. From clue 8, we know the person watching drama movies is on the far right. Since the owner of the rabbit is in the middle, the person watching comedy movies must be in the third position.
8. From clue 14, we know the person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is on the right, the person watching mystery movies must be in the second position.
9. From clue 13, we know the owner of the rat is somewhere to the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching mystery movies is in the second position, the person watching spy movies must be in the fourth position.
10. From clue 5, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position, the person watching time-travel movies must be in an odd position, which is the third position.
11. From clue 2, we know the owner of the bird is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in the middle, the owner of the bird must be in the first position.
12. From clue 6, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person watching mystery movies is in the second position, the person watching satire movies must be in the first position.

The final solution is:

Comedy: Bird
Drama: Mouse
Mystery: Snake
Satire: Fish
Spy: Rat
Time-Travel: Chinchilla
Western: Rabbit"

12. The fan of soul is on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the Brazilian is on the far left. From statement 7, we know the fan of classical is on the far left, so the Brazilian must be the fan of classical.

From statement 3, we know the Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the Dutch. Since the Brazilian is already on the far left, the Dutch must be the second person from the left.

From statement 4, we know the Chinese is on the left of the Mexican. Since the Dutch is already second from the left, the Chinese must be the third person from the left, and the Mexican must be the fourth person from the left.

From statement 5, we know the French is in an odd position. Since the French is not on the far left or far right, it must be the fifth person from the left.

From statement 8, we know the fan of country is the French. Since the French is the fifth person from the left, the fan of country must be the fifth person from the left.

From statement 9, we know the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the Japanese. Since the Japanese is on the right of the fan of gospel (statement 1), the fan of salsa must be on the right of the Japanese.

From statement 10, we know the fan of indie is on the right of the Dutch. Since the Dutch is the second person from the left, the fan of indie must be the sixth person from the left.

From statement 11, we know the fan of gospel is on the left or right of the Brazilian. Since the Brazilian is already on the far left, the fan of gospel must be the second person from the left.
