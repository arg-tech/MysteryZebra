Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.
2. The person driving the boat is in an even position.
3. The person driving the airplane is on the far right.
4. The person driving the subway is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is in an even position.
6. The person driving the boat is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
7. The person driving the bus is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

From clue 2, we know the boat driver is in an even position, which means they can be in positions 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 1, we know the boat driver is to the left of the snowmobile driver. Since the boat driver is in an even position, the snowmobile driver must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From clue 5, we know the snowmobile driver is in an even position. This means they must be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 4, we know the subway driver is to the left of the bus driver. Since the bus driver is to the left of the snowmobile driver (clue 7), the subway driver must be to the left of the bus driver, which means they must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know the airplane driver is on the far right, which means they must be in position 6.

From clue 6, we know the boat driver is to the left of the motorbike driver. Since the boat driver is in an even position, the motorbike driver must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

Now we can start filling in the table:

|             |   1    |  2   |  3  |     4      |     5     |    6     |

Subway (1)
Bus (2)
Boat (4)
Motorbike (3)
Snowmobile (4)

Lv1-1x6-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
This means that hiking and drawing are adjacent to each other.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means that gardening is to the left of puzzles.

3. The person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position.
This means that puzzles is in position 2 or 4.

4. The person who's hobby is video-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking.
This means that video-games is to the left of hiking.

5. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
This means that gardening is to the right of drawing.

6. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
This means that video-games is to the right of writing.

7. The person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means that gardening is to the left of puzzles.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* Hiking and drawing are adjacent (1).
* Gardening is to the left of puzzles (2).
* Puzzles is in an even position (3).
* Video-games is to the left of hiking (4).
* Gardening is to the right of drawing (5).
* Video-games is to the right of writing (6).
* Gardening is to the left of puzzles (7).

From clue 3, we know that puzzles is in an even position. Since gardening is to the left of puzzles (2 and 7), gardening must be in position 1 or 3. But if gardening is in position 1, then drawing would be in position 2, and hiking would be in position 3, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, gardening must be in position 3.

Now, we can fill in the table:

|         |    1    |      2      |   3    |    4    |     5     |    6    |

Lv1-1x6-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person driving the subway.
This means the boat and subway drivers are adjacent to each other.

2. The person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the train.
This means the trike and train drivers are adjacent to each other, and the trike is to the left of the train.

3. The person driving the helicopter is on the far left or far right.
This means the helicopter driver is either the first or last person in the line.

4. The person driving the subway is on the far left or far right.
This means the subway driver is either the first or last person in the line, which is consistent with clue 1.

5. The person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person driving the boat.
This means the boat driver is to the left of the subway driver.

6. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the left of the person driving the trike.
This means the snowmobile driver is to the left of the trike driver.

Now, let's combine the clues and create a possible solution:

Lv1-1x6-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the frog.
This means the horse and frog cannot be at the extreme ends, so they must be in positions 2, 3, or 4.

2. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat.
This means the rat cannot be in positions 5 or 6, so it must be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

3. The owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the snake.
This means the lizard and snake cannot be in the same position, so the lizard must be in positions 1, 2, or 3, and the snake must be in positions 4, 5, or 6.

4. The owner of the fish is on the far left.
This means the fish is in position 1.

5. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat.
This is already implied by statement 2.

6. The owner of the frog is in an odd position.
This means the frog is in positions 1, 3, or 5.

7. The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse.
This means the lizard cannot be in positions 1 or 2, so it must be in positions 3, 4, or 5.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The fish is in position 1.
* The rat is in positions 1, 2, or 3.
* The frog is in positions 1, 3, or 5.
* The lizard is in positions 3, 4, or 5.
