1. The person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position##4
This means the reading person is in either position 1 or 3.

2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour
This means the snowboarding person is in position 1 or 2, and the parkour person is in position 2 or 3.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position##4
This means the chess person is in either position 1 or 3.

4. The person who's hobby is sudoku is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games##5
This means the sudoku person is in position 4 or 5, and the video-games person is in position 3 or 4.

5. The person who's hobby is singing is on the far right
This means the singing person is in position 5.

6. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting
This means the snowboarding person is in position 2 or 3, and the weightlifting person is in position 1 or 2.

7. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is handball##5
This means the volleyball person is in position 4 or 5, and the handball person is in position 3 or 4.

8. The person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading
This means the reading person is in position 1 or 3, and the parkour person is in position 2 or 3.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Reading person is in an odd position##4, so they're in position 1 or 3.
* Chess person is in an odd position##4, so they're in position 1 or 3. Since reading is in an odd position, chess can't be in position 1, so chess is in position 3.
* Snowboarding person is on the left of parkour, so they're in position 1 or 2. Since snowboarding is on the right of weightlifting, snowboarding is in position 2.
* Parkour person is on the right of reading, so they're in position 2 or 3. Since snowboarding is in position 2, parkour is in position 3.
* Video-games person is to the left of sudoku, so they're in position 3 or 4. Since sudoku is in position 4 or 5, video-games is in position 3.
* Singing person is on the far right, so they're in position 5.
* Handball person is to the left of volleyball, so they're in position 3 or 4. Since volleyball is in position 4 or 5, handball is in position 3.

7. The person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
8. The person who's hobby is board-games is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 1, we know the person drinking tea is in the middle. Let's assume the middle position is 3.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking tea is in the middle, the person drinking almond-milk must be on the left of the middle position.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the left, the person who's hobby is reading must be on the right of the middle position.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the left, the person drinking mirinda must be on the right of the middle position.

From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is board-games is between the person drinking cola and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the left, the person drinking cola must be on the left of the middle position.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

* Person drinking tea: 3 (middle)

* Person who's hobby is card-games:? (not yet determined)

From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is already on the left, the person who's hobby is dancing must be on the right of the middle position.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is card-games. Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the right, the person drinking fanta must be on the left of the middle position.

Now, let's determine the remaining positions:

* Person drinking fanta: 1 (left)
* Person who's hobby is dancing: 4 (right)
* Person who's hobby is card-games: 2 (left or right of dancing)

Since the person who's hobby is card-games is already on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing, it must be on the right of dancing. Therefore, the final positions are:

Lv1-2x5-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Spanish is between the person drinking Fanta and the Turkish.
2. The person drinking Almond-milk is on the far left or far right.
3. The Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian.
4. The Spanish is in an odd position.
5. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Juice.
6. The Australian is on the far left.
7. The person drinking Water is the Spanish.
8. The person drinking Cola is on the left or right of the person drinking Almond-milk.

From clue 6, we know the Australian is on the far left. From clue 2, we know the person drinking Almond-milk is on the far left or far right. Since the Australian is already on the far left, the person drinking Almond-milk must be on the far right.

From clue 7, we know the person drinking Water is the Spanish. Since the Spanish is in an odd position (clue 4), it must be in the middle position.

From clue 1, we know the Spanish is between the person drinking Fanta and the Turkish. Since the Spanish is in the middle position, the person drinking Fanta must be to the left of the Spanish, and the Turkish must be to the right of the Spanish.

From clue 5, we know the Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking Juice. Since the Spanish is in the middle position, the Indonesian must be to the right of the Spanish.

From clue 3, we know the Spanish is somewhere to the right of the Indonesian. This is already satisfied since the Spanish is in the middle position and the Indonesian is to the right of the Spanish.

From clue 8, we know the person drinking Cola is on the left or right of the person drinking Almond-milk. Since the person drinking Almond-milk is on the far right, the person drinking Cola must be on the far right as well.

Here is the final solution table with the correct order:
