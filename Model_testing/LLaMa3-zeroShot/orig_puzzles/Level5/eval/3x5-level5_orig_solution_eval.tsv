From clue 10, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the person driving the subway. We already know the person drinking soy-milk is the fan of gospel, so the subway driver is the fan of gospel.

From clue 11, we know the person driving the boat is the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is on the right of the fan of d&b (clue 8), the fan of d&b must be on the left of the boat driver.

From clue 12, we know the fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the fan of techno is on the right of the fan of d&b (clue 8), the person drinking sprite must be on the right of the fan of d&b.

Now that we have all the clues, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x5-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the French is between the German and the person drinking juice.

From statement 2, we know the Canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking 7up is the person who's sport is golf.

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.

From statement 5, we know the American is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the Turkish.

From statement 7, we know the French is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.

From statement 11, we know the French is somewhere to the left of the American.

From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is golf is in the middle.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         |             |            |        |         |          |

From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is golf is in the middle. Since the person who's sport is golf drinks 7up (statement 3), we can place the 7up and golf in the middle:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         |             |            | Golf   |         |          |

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the person who's sport is golf is in the middle, the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 1:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         | Basketball |            | Golf   |         |          |

From statement 1, we know the French is between the German and the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 1, the French must be in position 2:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         | Basketball |            | Golf   |         |          |

From statement 2, we know the Canadian is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is not yet placed, we'll assume it's in position 4 for now:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         | Basketball |          | Golf   |         |          |

From statement 5, we know the American is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's sport is golf is in the middle, the person who's sport is cricket must be in position 5:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         | Basketball |          | Golf   |         | Cricket  |

From statement 6, we know the person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the Turkish. Since the person drinking juice is already in position 1, the Turkish must be in position 1:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Sport         | Basketball |          | Golf   |         | Cricket  |

From statement 7, we know the French is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since the French is already in position 2, the person drinking water must be in position 1:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |

| Nationality   | Turkish    | German    | French  | Canadian| American |
| Sport         | Basketball |          | Golf   |         | Cricket  |

From statement 8, we know the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the Turkish. Since the person drinking sprite is already in position 1, the Turkish must be in position 1:

|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |
| Beverage      | Sprite     | Tennis    | 7up    | Almond  |          |
| Nationality   | Turkish    | German    | French  | Canadian| American |
| Sport         | Basketball |          | Golf   |         | Cricket  |

Now, let's check the remaining statements:

* Statement 9: The person who's sport is golf is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cricket. This is already satisfied.
* Statement 11: The French is somewhere to the left of the American. This is already satisfied.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since water is in column 1, card-games must be in column 2 or 3. But we already have chess in column 2, so card-games must be in column 3.

|             | Water        | Card-games  | Woodworking | Ship  | Jet-ski |
| Beverage    |  Water       |  Milk        |  Iced-tea    |       |           |
