Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1 and 4, we know the French is in an odd position and the fisherman is the person who's sport is skiing. From clue 51, we know the fisherman is between the person eating grapes and the bartender. Since the fisherman is skiing, the person eating grapes must be the person who's sport is rowing (from clue 14).
2. From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the chef. From clue 18, we know the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the Australian. Therefore, the chef must be on the right of the Australian.
3. From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the dressmaker. From clue 51, we know the fisherman is between the person eating grapes and the bartender. Since the fisherman is skiing, the dressmaker must be on the right of the fisherman.
4. From clue 5, we know the fan of r&b is the person drinking iced-tea. From clue 7, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. From clue 22, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person drinking sprite. Therefore, the fan of r&b must be on the left of the person drinking sprite.
