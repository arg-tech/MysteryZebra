4. The person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
This means that the person eating blueberry is either on the right of the person watching time-travel movies or in the same position.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

From statement 1, we know that the person who prefers swimming is driving the snowmobile. Let's assume this person is in position 1.

From statement 2, we know that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the jet-ski is not yet assigned, let's assume the person drinking sprite is in position 2.

From statement 3, we know that the person driving the snowmobile (position 1) is either on the left or right of the person who owns the goldfish. Let's assume the person owning the goldfish is in position 1 (since the person driving the snowmobile is already in position 1).

| Sport         | swimming    |             |
| Transport     | snowmobile  | jet-ski      |

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions:

* The person who prefers action movies is not yet assigned. Let's assume they are in position 2.
* The person who prefers zucchini is not yet assigned. Let's assume they are in position 2.
* The person who owns the mouse is not yet assigned. Let's assume they are in position 2.

Lv1-6x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is video-games is the engineer.
This means the engineer's hobby is video-games.

2. The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee.
This means the person who drinks coffee has a hobby that is not video-games (since the engineer has video-games as their hobby). Let's call this person ""P"".

3. The fan of d&b is somewhere to the right of the owner of the turtle.
This means the owner of the turtle is not a fan of d&b. Let's call this person ""T"".

4. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle.
This means the owner of the turtle's hobby is either filmmaking or not filmmaking. Since the owner of the turtle is not a fan of d&b, they might be a fan of folk (since there are only two music-genres). Let's assume the owner of the turtle is a fan of folk.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

#############

From clue 1, we know the engineer's hobby is video-games. From clue 2, we know P's hobby is not video-games. Since there are only two hobbies, P's hobby must be filmmaking.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the turtle is not a fan of d&b. From clue 4, we know the owner of the turtle is a fan of folk. This means the owner of the turtle's hobby is not filmmaking (since the owner of the turtle is a fan of folk). Let's assume the owner of the turtle's hobby is not filmmaking.

#############

From clue 1, we know the engineer's job is engineer. From clue 2, we know P's hobby is filmmaking. This means P's job is dancer.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the turtle is not a fan of d&b. From clue 4, we know the owner of the turtle is a fan of folk. This means the owner of the turtle's music-genre is folk.

| Sport         | parkour    |      -polo |
#############

From clue 2, we know the person who drinks coffee has a hobby that is not video-games. This means the person who drinks coffee is P, who has filmmaking as their hobby. This means the person who drinks coffee is the dancer.

3. The person eating watermelon is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli.
4. The person watching adventure movies is in an even position.
5. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching thriller movies.

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is driving the bus. From clue 2, we know the engineer is to the right of the Argentine. This means the engineer is not driving the bus.

From clue 3, we know the person eating watermelon is to the left of the person eating broccoli. This means the person eating watermelon is not the Argentine (since they're driving the bus).

From clue 4, we know the person watching adventure movies is in an even position. This means they're either in the 1st or 3rd position.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person watching thriller movies. This means the person watching thriller movies is also the person eating broccoli (since they're not eating watermelon).

This means that the Malaysian is on the left of the person who camps.

2. The lawyer is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
This means that the person who sails is on the right of the lawyer.

3. The person drinking juice is somewhere to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
This means that the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person who drinks juice.

From these clues, we can start building the table:

| Sport         |            |          |

Let's start by placing the Malaysian on the left side, since the person who camps is on the right of the Malaysian.

Now, let's place the person who drinks juice. Since the person who drinks juice is to the right of the owner of the goldfish, and the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person who drinks juice, the owner of the goldfish must be on the left of the person who drinks juice.

|               |     1      |    2     |

Now, let's try to fill in the rest of the table. We know that W is to the left of T, so W must be O. This means that O is eating orange.

We also know that W is the person who's hobby is writing, so W must be the person who's hobby is writing.

We know that I is the person who's sport is ice-hockey, and W is the person who's hobby is writing. This means that I must be the person who's hobby is hiking.

We know that J is driving the jet-ski, and C is the owner of the cat. This means that J is to the left of C.

We know that T is the teacher, and W is to the left of T. This means that W is the person who's job is teacher.

We know that L is the person who's job is lawyer, and W is the person who's job is teacher. This means that L is the person who's job is lawyer.

Lv1-6x2-9	"Let's start by analyzing the given information and making some deductions.

From statement 1, we know that the dressmaker is on the right of the photographer.

From statement 2, we know that the person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies. This means that the person eating apple cannot be the dressmaker (since the dressmaker is on the right of the photographer) and cannot be the photographer (since the photographer is on the right of the dressmaker). Therefore, the person eating apple must be someone else.

From statement 3, we know that the photographer is on the left or right of the Thai person. This means that the Thai person cannot be the dressmaker (since the dressmaker is on the right of the photographer) and cannot be the person eating apple (since the person eating apple is on the left of the person watching drama movies). Therefore, the Thai person must be someone else.

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. This means that the person drinking milk cannot be the dressmaker (since the dressmaker is on the right of the photographer) and cannot be the photographer (since the photographer is on the right of the dressmaker). Therefore, the person drinking milk must be someone else.
