Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means that the airplane driver is either in the 3rd or 4th position.

2. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the left of the person driving the ship.
This means that the airplane driver is either in the 1st or 2nd position.

3. The person driving the airplane is between the person driving the taxi and the person driving the helicopter.
This means that the airplane driver is in the 2nd position, as it is between the taxi and the helicopter.

Now, let's combine the information:

| Transport   |  1   |    2     |     3      |  4   |
|             |      |          |            |      |

From clue 1, the airplane driver is in the 2nd position. From clue 3, the taxi driver is to the left of the airplane driver, so the taxi driver is in the 1st position. From clue 2, the ship driver is to the right of the airplane driver, so the ship driver is in the 4th position. The helicopter driver is to the right of the taxi driver, so the helicopter driver is in the 3rd position.

Here is the final solution:

#############
| Transport   |  Taxi | Airplane | Helicopter | Ship |
|             |  1    |  2      |     3      |  4   |

1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
This means that writing cannot be on the far right, as rock-climbing would be on the far right instead.

2. The person who's hobby is writing is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
This means that writing cannot be on the far left, as filmmaking would be on the far left instead.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the far left or far right.
This means that rock-climbing cannot be in the middle, as it would not be on the far left or far right.

4. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
This means that reading cannot be on the far right, as rock-climbing would be on the far right instead.

* Rock-climbing is to the right of writing (clue 1).
* Rock-climbing is on the far left or far right (clue 3).

Lv1-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The dressmaker is on the right of the librarian.
This means the librarian is to the left of the dressmaker.

2. The dressmaker is on the far left or far right.
This means the dressmaker is either on the leftmost or rightmost position.

3. The architect is the architect.
This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.
