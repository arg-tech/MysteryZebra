From statement 2, we know the person who has woodworking as their hobby is either to the left or right of the person who has chess as their hobby. Since the freelancer is to the right of the person who has chess as their hobby, the person who has woodworking as their hobby must be to the left of the person who has chess as their hobby.

From statement 2, we know the person who has woodworking as their hobby is to the left of the person who has chess as their hobby. Since the freelancer is to the right of the person who has chess as their hobby, the person who has woodworking as their hobby must be to the left of the freelancer. This means the person who has woodworking as their hobby must be in the bottom-left corner:
