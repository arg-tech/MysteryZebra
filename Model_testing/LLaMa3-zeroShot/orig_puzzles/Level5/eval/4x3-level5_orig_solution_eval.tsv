Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Nationality   |            |             |           |

From statement 5, we know the australian is to the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. From statement 3, we know the thai is to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. So, the order is:

Australian -> Video-Games -> Thai

From statement 4, we know the thai is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. So, the order is:

Australian -> Video-Games -> Skydiving -> Thai

From statement 1, we know the fan of house is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating raspberry is not next to the fan of house, they must be across from each other. Let's assume the fan of house is on the left of the person eating raspberry. Then, the order is:

House -> Raspberry ->? -> Australian -> Video-Games -> Skydiving -> Thai

From statement 2, we know the fan of jazz is to the left of the fan of house. So, the order is:

Jazz -> House -> Raspberry ->? -> Australian -> Video-Games -> Skydiving -> Thai

From statement 6, we know the person eating pear is between the person who's hobby is writing and the person eating lettuce. Since the person eating lettuce is to the left of the person eating pear, the order is:

Lettuce -> Pear -> Writing
