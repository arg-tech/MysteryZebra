Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the pony.

This means that the goldfish owner is either in the 2nd or 3rd column, and the pony owner is in the 1st or 2nd column.

2. The person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the right of the person eating peas.

This means that the person eating peas is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the motorbike driver is in the 2nd or 3rd column.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The goldfish owner is on the right of the pony owner, so the pony owner is in the 1st column.
* The person eating peas is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the motorbike driver is in the 2nd or 3rd column. Since the motorbike driver is to the right of the pea eater, the pea eater must be in the 1st column.
* The goldfish owner is on the right of the pony owner, so the goldfish owner is in the 2nd column.
* The motorbike driver is in the 2nd or 3rd column, and the pea eater is in the 1st column. Therefore, the motorbike driver is in the 3rd column.

Here's the final solution:

The solution is:

1. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person eating plum.
This means that the person eating plum is on the right side of the table, and the person watching family movies is on the left side.

2. The Indonesian is somewhere to the right of the Japanese.
This means that the Japanese is on the left side of the table, and the Indonesian is on the right side.

Now, let's combine the information:

From clue 1, the person eating plum is on the right side, so it must be the second person.

From clue 2, the Japanese is on the left side, so it must be the first person.

Now, we can fill in the table:

This means the software-developer is in the ""Movie-Genre"" column, and the movie genre is ""Family"".

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person watching thriller movies
This means the person who prefers skateboarding is to the right of the person who prefers thriller movies.

This means that the person who likes electronic music is either in the rightmost or second-rightmost column.

3. The person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking cola.

This means that the person drinking cola is either in the middle or on the right side of the table.

1. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person watching epic movies.
2. The person eating grapefruit is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating grapefruit is to the left of the person watching epic movies. This means that the person eating grapefruit cannot be the one watching epic movies.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating grapefruit is to the left of the person who's hobby is singing. This means that the person eating grapefruit cannot be the one with the hobby of singing.

Now, let's analyze the possible combinations:

| Food          | Hobby         | Movie-Genre   |
| ---          | ---          | ---          |

We can eliminate the combinations where the person eating grapefruit is the one watching epic movies (clue 1) or the one with the hobby of singing (clue 2).

Lv1-3x2-6	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.

This means that the mouse owner cannot be in the last column (Transport), as the guinea-pig owner would be to the right of them. So, the mouse owner must be in the first column (Hobby) or the second column (Pet).

2. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person driving the scooter.

This means that the cooking hobby cannot be in the first column (Hobby), as the scooter driver would be to the left of them. So, the cooking hobby must be in the second column (Pet) or the third column (Transport).

Now, let's combine the information:

|             |    1    |     2      |
| Hobby       |         |            |
| Pet         |         |            |
| Transport   |         |            |

From clue 1, the mouse owner is to the left of the guinea-pig owner. Since the mouse owner cannot be in the last column, they must be in the first column (Hobby). This means the guinea-pig owner is in the second column (Pet).

From clue 2, the cooking hobby is to the right of the scooter driver. Since the cooking hobby cannot be in the first column, it must be in the second column (Pet) or the third column (Transport). But if it were in the second column (Pet), the scooter driver would be to the left of the cooking hobby, which contradicts the clue. Therefore, the cooking hobby must be in the third column (Transport).

Lv1-3x2-7	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person watching comedy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is baking.
This means that the person who watches comedy movies cannot be the one who has baking as their hobby. Let's call the person who watches comedy movies ""C"" and the person who has baking as their hobby ""B"". We can write this as:

|               |    1     |    2    |
| Hobby         |          |         |

C (comedy) | B (baking) |? |? |
| Movie-Genre | comedy |? |? |
| Nationality |? |? |? |

2. The egyptian is somewhere to the left of the polish.
This means that the egyptian cannot be the one who watches comedy movies (since the polish is to the right of the egyptian). Let's call the egyptian ""E"" and the polish ""P"". We can write this as:

|               |    1     |    2    |

C (comedy) | E (egyptian) | P (polish) |? |
| Movie-Genre | comedy |? |? |
| Nationality | egyptian | polish |? |

Now, let's combine the two clues. Since the egyptian is to the left of the polish, and the person who watches comedy movies is to the left of the person who has baking as their hobby, we can conclude that the egyptian watches comedy movies and the polish has baking as their hobby.

C (comedy) | E (egyptian) | P (polish) |? |
| Movie-Genre | comedy | western |? |
| Nationality | egyptian | polish |? |

The only remaining cell is the movie genre for the person who has baking as their hobby. Since they are to the right of the person who watches comedy movies, they must watch western movies.

C (comedy) | E (egyptian) | P (polish) |? |
| Movie-Genre | comedy | western | western |
| Nationality | egyptian | polish |? |

Finally, let's fill in the nationality for the person who has baking as their hobby. Since the egyptian is already accounted for, the polish must have baking as their hobby.
