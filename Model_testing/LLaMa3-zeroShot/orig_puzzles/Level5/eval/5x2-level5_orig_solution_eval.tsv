Lv1-5x2-1	"Let's start by analyzing the given information and making some deductions.

From statement 1, we know that the software-developer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. This means that the person drinking lemonade cannot be the software-developer.

From statement 2, we know that the software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means that the person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be the software-developer.

From statement 3, we know that the owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. This means that the person who's sport is skateboarding cannot be the owner of the dog.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|            |       1       |         2          |
| Beverage   |               |                    |
| Hobby      |               |                    |
| Job        |               |                    |
| Pet        |               |                    |
| Sport      |               |                    |

Since the person drinking lemonade cannot be the software-developer, and the software-developer is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade, we can conclude that the person drinking lemonade is the analyst.

The person who's hobby is skydiving cannot be the software-developer, so it must be the person on the left of the software-developer. This means that the person who's hobby is hiking is the software-developer.

The owner of the dog is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding, so the owner of the dog must be the person who's job is analyst (since the person who's hobby is hiking is the software-developer).

The person who's sport is skateboarding must be the person who's job is software-developer (since the owner of the dog is the person who's job is analyst).

The person who's hobby is skydiving must be the person who's job is analyst (since the software-developer is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving).

The person who's beverage is water must be the person who's hobby is hiking (since the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's job is analyst).

The person who's pet is a hedgehog must be the person who's job is software-developer (since the owner of the dog is the person who's job is analyst).

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is cycling is in an odd position##4
This means the person who likes cycling is in positions 1 or 3.

2. The person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the owner of the hedgehog##5
This means the person drinking lemonade is in positions 2 or 4, and the owner of the hedgehog is in positions 1 or 3.

3. The fisherman is on the right of the scientist
This means the fisherman is in position 2 or 4, and the scientist is in position 1 or 3.

4. The person eating potato is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade##5
This means the person eating potato is in positions 1 or 2, and the person drinking lemonade is in positions 2 or 4.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The fisherman is on the right of the scientist, so the scientist is in position 1, and the fisherman is in position 2.
* The person eating potato is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade, so the person eating potato is in position 1, and the person drinking lemonade is in position 2.
* The owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the person drinking lemonade, so the owner of the hedgehog is in position 1.

Here's the final solution:

1. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the Chinese.
This means the Chinese person is on the right of the person drinking sprite.

2. The person driving the quad-bike is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
This means the person driving the quad-bike is either next to the person who's sport is skiing or on the right of them.

3. The person driving the quad-bike is the person watching mystery movies.
This means the person driving the quad-bike is also the person who prefers mystery movies.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |      1      |       2        |
| Food        | Cherry     |                |

| Transport   |             |                |

2. The person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the left of the security-guard.
This means that the security-guard cannot be in the first column, so we can place the person driving the skateboard in the first column.

|             |      1      |       2        |
| Food        | Cherry     |                |

| Transport   | Skateboard |                |

3. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.
This means that the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be in the first column, so we can place the person who's sport is biathlon in the first column.

|             |      1      |       2        |
| Food        | Cherry     |                |

| Sport       | Biathlon   |                |
| Transport   | Skateboard |                |

Now we can start filling in the remaining columns:

* The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating cherry, so the person eating carrot must be in the second column.
* The person driving the quad-bike is not mentioned yet, so we can place them in the second column.
* The person who's job is firefighter is not mentioned yet, so we can place them in the second column.
* The person who's hobby is drawing is not mentioned yet, so we can place them in the second column.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-5x2-8	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
This means that the train driver is either the person who prefers snowboarding or the person who is a police-officer (since the designer is driving the boat).

2. The designer is the person driving the boat.
This means that the designer is not driving the train, so the train driver must be either the person who prefers snowboarding or the person who is a police-officer.

3. The indian is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk.
This means that the indian cannot be the fan of funk, so the fan of funk must be either the german or the person who is a police-officer.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |       2        |
| Job           |          |                |

| Nationality   |          |                |
| Sport         |          |                |
| Transport     |          |                |

|               | Designer | Police-Officer |
| Job           |          |                |
| Music-Genre   |          |                |

| Sport         |          |                |
| Transport     | Boat     | Train         |

Since the designer is driving the boat, the designer must prefer funk (since the indian is to the right of the fan of funk). The police-officer must prefer soul.

The german must be the fan of funk, and the indian must be the fan of soul.

The person who prefers snowboarding must be the police-officer, since the train driver is to the right of the person who prefers tennis.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-5x2-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Egyptian is somewhere to the left of the software-developer.
This means the Egyptian cannot be the software-developer, and the software-developer must be to the right of the Egyptian.

2. The person watching spy movies is on the left of the person eating pepper.
This means the person eating pepper must be watching spy movies, and the person watching spy movies must be to the left of the person eating pepper.

3. The Egyptian is the fan of house.
This means the Egyptian prefers the music genre ""house"".

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |         2          |
| Food          |             |                    |

| Nationality   |             |                    |
#############

From clue 1, we know the Egyptian is to the left of the software-developer. Let's assume the Egyptian is in position 1.

From clue 2, we know the person eating pepper is watching spy movies. Let's assume the person eating pepper is in position 2.

From clue 3, we know the Egyptian prefers house music. Since there are only two music genres, the other person must prefer country music.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |         2          |

| Music-Genre   | House      | Country         |
| Nationality   | Egyptian   |?               |
#############

The only remaining clue is the nationality of the person in position 2. Since the Egyptian is in position 1, the person in position 2 must be Polish.

The final solution table is:

Similarly, the movie genre of the person in position 1 is not specified, but it could be either Mystery or Spy."	{'food': ['eggplant', 'pepper'], 'job': ['firefighter', 'software-developer'], 'movie-genre': ['mystery', 'spy'], 'music-genre': ['house', 'country'], 'nationality': ['egyptian', 'polish']}	True	8	False
Lv1-5x2-10	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the person driving the motorbike.
2. The person eating peas is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
3. The person watching zombie movies is somewhere to the left of the person eating potato.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking tea is to the left of the motorbike driver. This means that the tea drinker cannot be the motorbike driver.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating peas is on the left or right of the hamster owner. This means that the hamster owner cannot be the motorbike driver (since the tea drinker is to the left of the motorbike driver).

From clue 3, we know that the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the person eating potato. This means that the zombie movie fan cannot be the motorbike driver (since the tea drinker is to the left of the motorbike driver).

Now, let's try to place the people in the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      |            |           |

| Transport     |            |           |

From the above analysis, we know that the motorbike driver is not the tea drinker, hamster owner, or zombie movie fan. Therefore, the motorbike driver must be the person eating potato.

Now, let's place the people in the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage      | Milk      | Tea      |
