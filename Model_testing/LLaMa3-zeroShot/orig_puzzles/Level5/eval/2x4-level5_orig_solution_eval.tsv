4. The owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the hamster is the fan of salsa.

From statement 2, we know the fan of ambient is between the fan of hip-hop and the owner of the snake. Since the fan of ambient is in an even position (statement 5), it must be in position 2 or 4. If it were in position 2, the fan of hip-hop would be in position 1, and the owner of the snake would be in position 3. But then, the owner of the turtle would be in position 4, which is not possible since the owner of the turtle is to the left of the fan of ambient (statement 4). Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 4.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the goldfish is in an even position. Since the fan of ambient is in position 4, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the turtle is to the left of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is in position 4, the owner of the turtle must be in position 1.

From statement 6, we know the fan of jazz is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the hamster is in position 3, the fan of jazz must be in position 2 or 4.

This means soccer can't be on the right of tea, so soccer must be on the left of tea.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means weightlifting can't be on the left of iced-tea, so weightlifting must be on the right of iced-tea.

4. The person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.
