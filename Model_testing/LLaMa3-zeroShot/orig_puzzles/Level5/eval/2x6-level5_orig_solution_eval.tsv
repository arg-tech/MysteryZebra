Lv1-2x6-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
2. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta.
3. The person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking fanta.
4. The person watching crime movies is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person watching disaster movies.
5. The person watching western movies is the person drinking iced-tea.
6. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking coffee.
7. The person watching disaster movies is the person drinking fanta.

10. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
11. The person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

From statement 1, we know coffee is to the right of soy-milk. From statement 2, we know coffee is to the left of fanta. Combining these, we can conclude that soy-milk is to the left of coffee, and fanta is to the right of coffee.

From statement 3, we know tea is to the right of fanta. Since fanta is to the right of coffee, tea is also to the right of coffee.

From statement 4, we know crime movies are between soy-milk and disaster movies. Since soy-milk is to the left of coffee, and coffee is to the left of fanta, disaster movies must be to the right of fanta.

From statement 5, we know iced-tea is the person watching western movies. From statement 8, we know iced-tea is to the left of mirinda. Combining these, we can conclude that mirinda is to the right of iced-tea.

From statement 7, we know fanta is the person watching disaster movies. From statement 9, we know disaster movies are to the right of crime movies. Combining these, we can conclude that fanta is to the right of crime movies.

From statement 10, we know epic movies are to the right of soy-milk. Since soy-milk is to the left of coffee, epic movies are also to the right of coffee.

From statement 11, we know superhero movies are to the left of zombie movies. Since zombie movies are not mentioned elsewhere, we can conclude that zombie movies are to the right of all other movies.

Here's the solution:

1. The person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is biathlon (13).
2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting (2).
3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (3). Since the person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is biathlon, and biathlon is not skateboarding, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
4. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is tennis (4). Since the person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is biathlon, and biathlon is not tennis, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.
5. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse (6).
6. The person who's hobby is collecting is in an odd position (8). Since the person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, and the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 3 or 5.
7. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is rugby (7, 9). Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, and the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is rugby, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
8. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (16). Since the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 1 or 2.
9. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games (1). Since the person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is biathlon, and biathlon is not tennis, the person who's sport is tennis must be in position 5 or 6.

Lv1-2x6-3	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. This means that soy-milk cannot be in position 2 or 4, as it would be sandwiched between two other beverages.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is in an odd position. This means that soy-milk must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that iced-tea must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. This means that dubstep must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From clue 7, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the fan of metal. This means that metal must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 8, we know that the fan of trance is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. This means that lemonade must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

From clue 9, we know that the fan of r&b is between the person drinking soy-milk and the fan of trance. This means that r&b must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know that the fan of soul is on the right of the person drinking milk. This means that milk must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 11, we know that the fan of metal is on the far left or far right. This means that metal must be in position 1 or 6.

Now, let's combine the information we've gathered so far. We know that soy-milk is in an odd position, and it's not in position 2 or 4. We also know that iced-tea is to the right of soy-milk, and it's not in position 1 or 3. This means that iced-tea must be in position 5.

We also know that metal is in position 1 or 6, and it's not in position 2 or 4. We know that the fan of soul is on the right of milk, and milk is in position 1 or 3. This means that milk must be in position 3, and soul must be in position 4.

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions. We know that soy-milk is in an odd position, and it's not in position 2 or 4. We also know that it's to the left of iced-tea, which is in position 5. This means that soy-milk must be in position 1.

We know that r&b is in position 3, and it's between soy-milk and trance. This means that trance must be in position 2.

We know that lemonade is in position 2, 4, or 6. We also know that the fan of trance is on the left or right of lemonade, and trance is in position 2. This means that lemonade must be in position 4.

Finally, we know that dubstep is in position 1, 3, or 5. We know that the fan of dubstep is to the right of lemonade, which is in position 4. This means that dubstep must be in position 5.

Here is the final solution table:

| Music-Genre   | dubstep |  soul     |  metal  |  rock    |  r&b    |  soul    |
#############

Note that the fan of rock is not mentioned in the clues, so we can't determine its position. However, we can conclude that the fan of rock is not in position 1, 3, or 5, as those positions are already occupied by other music genres."	{'beverage': ['soy-', 'trance', 'r&b', 'lemonade', 'iced-tea', 'milk'], 'music-genre': ['dubstep', 'soul', 'metal', 'rock', 'r&b', 'soul']}	True	1	False
Lv1-2x6-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From statement 8, we know the person drinking 7up is on the far left. Since the person eating avocado is the person drinking 7up (statement 4), the person eating avocado is also on the far left.

From statement 1, we know the person eating pear is somewhere to the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea (statement 6), the person eating pear must be to the right of the person drinking tea.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person eating pear. Since the person eating pear is to the right of the person drinking tea, the person drinking iced-tea must be to the right of the person drinking tea.

From statement 12, we know the person eating apricot is on the right of the person eating garlic. Since the person eating garlic is on the left or right of the person eating zucchini (statement 9), the person eating apricot must be to the right of the person eating zucchini.

From statement 10, we know the person eating zucchini is somewhere to the left of the person eating garlic. Combining this with the previous statement, we can conclude that the person eating apricot is to the right of the person eating zucchini.

From statement 11, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position. Since there are only 6 positions, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From statement 13, we know the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking tea (statement 6), the person drinking fanta must be to the right of the person drinking tea.

Here's the breakdown of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person watching crime movies is to the left of the person watching thriller movies. From statement 14, we know the person watching crime movies is to the left of the person watching western movies. Combining these, we can conclude that the person watching crime movies is to the left of both the person watching thriller movies and the person watching western movies.
2. From statement 2, we know the person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the tram. From statement 12, we know the person driving the tram is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. Combining these, we can conclude that the person driving the bike is on the right of the person watching adventure movies.
3. From statement 3, we know the person driving the bike is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since we already know the person watching thriller movies is to the right of the person watching crime movies (from statement 1), we can conclude that the person driving the bike is on the left of the person watching thriller movies.
4. From statement 4, we know the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the van. Since we don't have any other information about the van, we'll come back to this later.
5. From statement 5, we know the person watching action movies is the same person. We'll place them in position 1.
6. From statement 6, we know the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person driving the subway. Since we already know the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the van (from statement 4), we can conclude that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person driving the van.
7. From statement 7, we know the person driving the subway is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since we already know the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person driving the subway (from statement 6), we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person watching thriller movies.
8. From statement 8, we know the person watching western movies is to the right of the person watching thriller movies. Combining this with the fact that the person watching thriller movies is to the left of the person driving the van (from statement 6), we can conclude that the person watching western movies is to the right of the person driving the van.
9. From statement 9, we know the person watching action movies is to the right of the person driving the bike. Since we already know the person driving the bike is on the left of the person watching thriller movies (from statement 3), we can conclude that the person watching action movies is to the right of the person watching thriller movies.
10. From statement 10, we know the person watching western movies is between the person watching comedy movies and the person driving the van. Combining this with the fact that the person watching western movies is to the right of the person driving the van (from statement 8), we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person driving the van.
11. From statement 11, we know the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since we already know the person watching western movies is to the right of the person driving the van (from statement 8), we can conclude that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van.
12. From statement 15, we know the person driving the bus is in an odd position. Since we already know the person driving the bike is in an even position (from statement 16), we can conclude that the person driving the bus is in position 3.
13. From statement 13, we know the person watching western movies is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. Combining this with the fact that the person watching comedy movies is to the left of the person driving the van (from statement 10), we can conclude that the person watching western movies is to the right of the person driving the van.
14. From statement 4, we know the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the van. Since we already know the person driving the subway is on the right of the person watching comedy movies (from statement 7) and the person watching western movies is to the right of the person driving the van (from statement 8), we can conclude that the person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the van.

With all the information combined, we can fill in the final solution table:

Lv1-2x6-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the German is to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.

From statement 4, we know the Brazilian is to the left of the Argentine.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking Coffee is to the left of the person drinking Water.

From statement 6, we know the Argentine is to the left of the Egyptian.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking Mirinda is to the left of the Argentine.

From statement 8, we know the Colombian is in an even position.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking Mirinda is to the left of the Argentine.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking Mirinda is to the right of the Colombian.

From statement 11, we know the Canadian is to the left of the person drinking Iced-Tea.

From statement 12, we know the German is to the left of the Colombian.

From statement 13, we know the Colombian drinks Juice.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |     2     |     3     |     4     |    5     |    6     |

From statement 8, we know the Colombian is in an even position, so they must be in position 2 or 4. Since the Colombian drinks Juice (statement 13), they must be in position 4.

From statement 12, we know the German is to the left of the Colombian, so the German must be in position 1.

From statement 11, we know the Canadian is to the left of the person drinking Iced-Tea, so the Canadian must be in position 3.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking Coffee is to the left of the person drinking Water, so the person drinking Coffee must be in position 1 or 3. Since the Canadian is already in position 3, the person drinking Coffee must be in position 1.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking Coffee is to the right of the Brazilian, so the Brazilian must be in position 2.

From statement 6, we know the Argentine is to the left of the Egyptian, so the Argentine must be in position 5 or 6. Since the Colombian is already in position 4, the Argentine must be in position 5.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking Mirinda is to the left of the Argentine, so the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 4.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking Mirinda is to the right of the Colombian, so the person drinking Mirinda must be in position 4.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking Water is to the left of the Egyptian, so the person drinking Water must be in position 6.

Now, we can fill in the table:
