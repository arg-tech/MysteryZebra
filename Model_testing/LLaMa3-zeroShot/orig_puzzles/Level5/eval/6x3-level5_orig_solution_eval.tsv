From statement 11, we know the architect is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the architect is on the second position from the left, the person driving the jet-ski must be on the far left.

From statement 2, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position. Since the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be on the third position from the left.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the rat is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. This means that the rat owner cannot be on the left of the badminton player, so we need to swap their positions.

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | fanta        |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                |            |
| Job         |               |                |            |
| Pet         |                | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   |               |                |            |
```

From clue 3, we know that the security-guard is between the person driving the roller and the person driving the tram. Let's place the security-guard between them.

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | fanta        |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                |            |
| Job         | security    |                | journalist  |
| Pet         |                | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   | roller      | security    | tram        |
```

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the mouse is in an odd position. Since the rat owner is in an even position, the mouse owner must be in an odd position. Let's place the mouse owner in position 1.

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | fanta        |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                |            |
| Job         | security    |                | journalist  |
| Pet         | mouse       | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   | roller      | security    | tram        |
```

From clue 7, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since the mouse owner is already in position 1, the garlic eater must be in position 3.

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | fanta        |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                | garlic      |
| Job         | security    |                | journalist  |
| Pet         | mouse       | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   | roller      | security    | tram        |
```

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the tram driver is already in position 3, the motorbike driver must be in position 2.

```
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | motorbike   |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                | garlic      |
| Job         | security    |                | journalist  |
| Pet         | mouse       | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   | roller      | security    | tram        |
```

The final solution is:

```
#############
|             |       1       |       2        |     3      |
| Beverage    | hot-choc    cola | motorbike   |            |
| Food        | carrot      |                | garlic      |
| Job         | security    |                | journalist  |
| Pet         | mouse       | rat          |            |
| Sport       |                | volleyball  | badminton   |
| Transport   | roller      | security    | tram        |
#############
```
