Lv1-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of funk is somewhere to the right of the fan of d&b.
This means that d&b cannot be in the last position, as funk is on the far right.

2. The fan of pop is in an odd position.
This means that pop cannot be in the first or last position. It must be in an odd-numbered position (1, 3, or 5).

3. The fan of funk is on the far right.
This confirms that funk is in the last position.

4. The fan of r&b is between the fan of pop and the fan of techno.
This means that r&b cannot be in the first or last position. It must be in an even-numbered position (2 or 4).

5. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of pop.
This means that pop cannot be in the first position, as r&b would be to the left of pop.

Now, let's combine the information:

* d&b cannot be in the last position (funk is on the far right).
* pop is in an odd position, but not the first or last.
* r&b is in an even position, between pop and techno.
* r&b is to the left of pop.

The only possible arrangement is:

#############
| Music-Genre | d&b | r&b | pop | funk | techno |

This means collecting must be on the left of fishing.

This means photography can be either on the left or right of board-games.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is board-games.
This means traveling is between fishing and board-games.

The possible arrangement is:

Lv1-1x5-7	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of classical is between the fan of ambient and the fan of r&b.
This means that the order is: ambient, classical, r&b.

2. The fan of r&b is somewhere to the left of the fan of classical.
This doesn't add new information, but it confirms the order we already have: ambient, classical, r&b.

3. The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues.
This means that the order is: house, blues,... (we'll come back to this later).

4. The fan of ambient is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical.
This confirms the order we already have: ambient, classical, r&b.

5. The fan of ambient is between the fan of classical and the fan of house.
This means that the order is: classical, ambient, house,... (we'll come back to this later).

Now, let's combine the information:

* The fan of classical is between the fan of ambient and the fan of r&b, so the order is: ambient, classical, r&b.
* The fan of house is somewhere to the left of the fan of blues, so the order is: house, blues,... (we know that house is to the left of blues, but we don't know the exact position of blues yet).
* The fan of ambient is between the fan of classical and the fan of house, so the order is: classical, ambient, house,... (we know that ambient is between classical and house, but we don't know the exact position of blues yet).

Now, let's try to figure out the position of blues. We know that house is to the left of blues, and ambient is between classical and house. This means that blues must be to the right of house and to the left of r&b. The only possible order is: house, blues, r&b.
