From clue 1, we know the person watching epic movies is in column 3.

From clue 2, we know the person watching superhero movies is in column 1 or 2, and the person watching romance movies is in column 2 or 3.

Let's try to fill in the table:

| Movie-Genre   |           |         |      |

Since the person watching epic movies is on the far right, we can start by placing ""Epic"" in column 3:

| Movie-Genre   |           |         | Epic |

Now, we know the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching romance movies. Since the person watching epic movies is already in column 3, the person watching superhero movies must be in column 1. We can place ""Superhero"" in column 1:

|               | Superhero |    2    |  3   |
| Movie-Genre   |           |         | Epic |
