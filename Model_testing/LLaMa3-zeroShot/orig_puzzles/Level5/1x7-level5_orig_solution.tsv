From statement 1, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is to the right of the owner of the cat.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the cat is to the right of the owner of the pony.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is in an odd position. This means the guinea-pig is either in position 1, 3, or 5.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left of the owner of the bird. This means the bird is either in position 2, 4, or 6.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the dog. This means the dog is either in position 3, 5, or 7.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the hamster. This means the hamster is either in position 4 or 6.

From statement 9, we know the owner of the hamster is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the goldfish. This means the guinea-pig is in position 1 or 3, and the goldfish is in position 5 or 7.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. This means the pony is either in position 2 or 6.

From statement 11, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. This means the guinea-pig is in position 1 or 3, and the hamster is in position 4 or 6.

7. The fan of hip-hop is in an odd position
This means that the fan of hip-hop is either in the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* From clue 7, we know that the fan of hip-hop is in an odd position, so the fan of hip-hop is in the 1st or 5th position.

Now, let's try to fit the remaining genres:

* From clue 2, we know that the fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of funk, so the fan of funk is in an even position (2nd or 4th).
* From clue 6, we know that the fan of reggae is somewhere to the right of the fan of funk, so the fan of reggae is in an odd position (1st, 3rd, or 5th).

The only possible solution is:
