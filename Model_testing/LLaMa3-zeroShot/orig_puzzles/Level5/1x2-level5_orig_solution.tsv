From the given information, we know:

1. The Dutch is somewhere to the right of the British.

This means that the Dutch cannot be in the first column (1), because then the British would be to the right of the Dutch, which is not allowed.

So, the Dutch must be in the second column (2).

Here's the solution table with the final answer:

#############
|               |    1    |   2   |
| Nationality   | British | Dutch |
#############

The British is in the first column (1), and the Dutch is in the second column (2), as required by the puzzle."

Lv1-1x2-3	"Let's break down the information we have:

1. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies.

This means that the person who prefers time-travel movies must be in either the 1st or 2nd position, and the person who prefers adventure movies must be in either the 2nd or 3rd position.

Here's a possible solution:

#############
|               |      1      |     2     |

Lv1-1x2-4	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From the given information, we know:

1. The British is somewhere to the right of the Malaysian.

This means we can't place the British in the leftmost column (1). So, the possible arrangements are:

|               |     2     |     1     |
| Nationality   |           |           |

Now, let's try to place the Malaysian. Since it's not to the right of the British, it must be in the leftmost column (1). This is the only possible placement:

|               |     2     |     1     |
| Nationality   |           | Malaysian |

Now, we can place the British. Since it's to the right of the Malaysian, it must be in the rightmost column (2):

|               |     2     |     1     |
| Nationality   | British | Malaysian |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|               |     2     |     1     |
| Nationality   | British | Malaysian |
#############

The British is indeed somewhere to the right of the Malaysian, as stated in the puzzle!"
Lv1-1x2-5	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From the given information, we know:

1. The person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.

This means we can't place the person with the puzzle hobby directly to the left of the person with the video-games hobby. Let's represent this as:

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | ?  | ?  |

We'll fill in the table as we go along.

Since the person with the puzzle hobby is to the right of the person with the video-games hobby, we can place the video-games hobby in position 1:

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Video-Games | ?  |

Now, we know the person with the puzzle hobby is in position 2. We can fill in the table:

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Video-Games | Puzzles |

From the statement ""the writer is somewhere to the right of the firefighter"", we can conclude that the writer cannot be in the first position. Therefore, the firefighter must be in the first position.

Lv1-1x2-7	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From the given information, we know:

1. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.

This means we can't place the person with the magic-tricks hobby on the left side of the table. Let's start by placing the person with the gardening hobby on the left side:

|         |     1     |      2       |
| Hobby   |  Gardening |              |

Now, we know the person with the magic-tricks hobby is to the right of the person with the gardening hobby. We can place them on the right side:

Lv1-1x2-8	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step!

From the given information, we know:

1. The person eating pepper is somewhere to the right of the person eating raspberry.

This means that the order of the foods cannot be:

* Raspberry, Pepper (because the person eating pepper is not to the right of the person eating raspberry)
* Pepper, Raspberry (because the person eating pepper is to the right of the person eating raspberry)

So, the correct order must be:

* Raspberry,? (the question mark represents the unknown food)

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   |           |        |

Lv1-1x2-9	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From the statement ""the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking"", we can conclude that the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the leftmost column, and the person who's hobby is hiking must be in the rightmost column.

So, the table looks like this:

|         |     1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | filmmaking | hiking |

Now, we can fill in the rest of the table. Since there are only two hobbies, and two people, each person must have one of the two hobbies. Let's assume the person in column 1 has the hobby in row 1, and the person in column 2 has the hobby in row 2.

|         |     1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | filmmaking | hiking |

This is the final solution:

#############
|         |     1      |   2    |
| Hobby   | filmmaking | hiking |
