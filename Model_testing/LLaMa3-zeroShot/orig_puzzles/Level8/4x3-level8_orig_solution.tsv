This means the person driving the bus cannot be in the same column as the person driving the airplane.

6. The person eating mango is the person driving the airplane.

| Food    | Papaya   | Lemon    |               |
| Hobby   |           |            |               |
| Job     |           |            |               |
| Sport   |           |            |               |

From statement 2, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person who's sport is rowing and the accountant. Let's place the person who's hobby is card-games between them:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Papaya   | Lemon    |               |
| Hobby   |           | Card-games |               |
| Job     |           |            |               |
| Sport   |           |            |               |

From statement 5, we know that the person who's sport is rowing is not to the left of the fisherman. Let's place the fisherman on the right of the person who's sport is rowing:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Papaya   | Lemon    |               |
| Hobby   |           | Card-games |               |
| Job     |           | Fisherman | Paramedic    |
| Sport   | Rowing   |            | Skateboarding |

From statement 4, we know that the person who's sport is cricket is not the person eating lemon. Let's place the person who's sport is cricket on the right of the person eating lemon:

|         |     1     |     2      |       3       |
| Food    | Papaya   | Lemon    | Cricket     |
| Hobby   |           | Card-games |               |
| Job     |           | Fisherman | Paramedic    |
| Sport   | Rowing   |            | Skateboarding |

Now, let's check the remaining statements:

* Statement 1 is satisfied: the person eating corn is not to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.
* Statement 6 is satisfied: the paramedic is not to the left of the person eating papaya.
* Statement 7 is satisfied: the person eating corn is not to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding (this is the same as statement 1).

The final solution table is:

Lv1-4x3-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the ferret is not to the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
This means the ferret owner is either to the left of the skiing person or in the same position.

2. The person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
This means the bike driver is either to the right of the chinchilla owner or in the same position.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
This means the chinchilla owner is either to the left of the cycling person or in the same position.

4. The person driving the bike is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the person driving the tram.
This means the bike driver is between the chinchilla owner and the tram driver.

5. The person driving the bike is the person who's sport is cycling.
This means the cycling person is also the bike driver.

6. The person watching horror movies is not to the right of the owner of the chinchilla.
This means the horror movie watcher is either to the left of the chinchilla owner or in the same position.

7. The person driving the car is the person watching horror movies.
This means the horror movie watcher is also the car driver.

8. The person watching western movies is the person who's sport is skiing.
This means the skiing person is also the western movie watcher.

9. The person who's sport is skiing is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
This means the skiing person (also the western movie watcher) is either to the left of the goldfish owner or in the same position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The bike driver is the cycling person (5).
* The bike driver is between the chinchilla owner and the tram driver (4).
* The chinchilla owner is to the left of the cycling person (3).
* The cycling person is the bike driver, so the chinchilla owner is to the left of the bike driver.
* The bike driver is to the right of the chinchilla owner (2).
* This means the chinchilla owner is to the left of the bike driver, which is a contradiction. This means the chinchilla owner and the bike driver are in the same position.

* The horror movie watcher is not to the right of the chinchilla owner (6).
* The horror movie watcher is the car driver (7).
* The car driver is not mentioned in the other clues, so we can place the car driver anywhere.

* The skiing person is the western movie watcher (8).
* The skiing person is not to the right of the goldfish owner (9).
* The goldfish owner is not mentioned in the other clues, so we can place the goldfish owner anywhere.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-4x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is water-polo is on the far right.
2. The Turkish person is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
3. The person driving the taxi is not the person eating garlic.
4. The person driving the trike is the person eating garlic.
5. The person driving the airplane is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
6. The person who's sport is tennis is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person who's sport is water-polo.
7. The Canadian is on the right of the Turkish person.
8. The Canadian is not to the right of the person who's sport is tennis.
9. The person driving the airplane is not to the left of the person who's sport is cricket.

From statement 1, we know the water-polo player is on the far right. From statement 7, we know the Canadian is on the right of the Turkish person. Since the Canadian is not to the right of the tennis player (statement 8), the Turkish person must be on the left of the Canadian.

From statement 4, we know the garlic-eater drives the trike. From statement 3, we know the taxi driver is not the garlic-eater. Therefore, the taxi driver must be eating radish or spinach.

From statement 2, we know the Turkish person is on the left or right of the spinach-eater. Since the Turkish person is already placed, the spinach-eater must be the taxi driver.

From statement 5, we know the airplane driver is to the right of the tennis player. From statement 6, we know the tennis player is between the trike driver (garlic-eater) and the water-polo player. Therefore, the airplane driver must be on the far right, next to the water-polo player.

From statement 9, we know the airplane driver is not to the left of the cricket player. Since the airplane driver is already placed, the cricket player must be on the left of the trike driver (garlic-eater).

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:
