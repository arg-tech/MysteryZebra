| Transport     | train       | skateboard | motorbike | bike        |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 10, we know the person drinking almond-milk is driving the skateboard.
* From clue 11, we know the person drinking 7up is not to the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the hamster is not mentioned in the transport column, we can conclude that the person drinking 7up is not driving the skateboard (which is already taken by the person drinking almond-milk). Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be driving the bike.
* From clue 15, we know the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person eating papaya. Since the person eating papaya is already placed in the food column, we can conclude that the person driving the train is eating papaya.
* From clue 16, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach is already placed in the food column, we can conclude that the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person eating peach.
* From clue 17, we know the owner of the goat is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling is already placed in the sport column, we can conclude that the owner of the goat is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
* From clue 18, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is not mentioned in the pet or sport columns, we can conclude that the person drinking juice is eating pomegranate.
* From clue 20, we know the owner of the lizard is somewhere between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already placed in the beverage column, we can conclude that the owner of the lizard is between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking almond-milk.
* From clue 21, we know the person eating peach is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already placed in the beverage column, we can conclude that the person eating peach is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the rest of the table to arrive at the final solution."
