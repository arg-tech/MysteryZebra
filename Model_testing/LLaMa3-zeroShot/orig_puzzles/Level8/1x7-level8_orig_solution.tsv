Lv1-1x7-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is in an even position. Since there are 7 people, the even positions are 2, 4, and 6. Let's assume lacrosse is in position 4.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since lacrosse is in position 4, swimming must be in position 5 or 6. But statement 8 says the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, so swimming must be in position 5.

From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since climbing is not in position 1 (statement 7), skateboarding must be in position 1.

From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since lacrosse is in position 4, skiing must be in position 2 or 3. But statement 1 says the person who's sport is swimming is the person who's sport is swimming, so swimming is already in position 5. Therefore, skiing must be in position 2.

From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is in an even position. Since lacrosse is already in position 4, water-polo must be in position 2.

From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since climbing is not in position 1, it must be in position 3. Snowboarding must be in position 7.

From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is not to the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since climbing is in position 3, snowboarding must be in position 7.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-1x7-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The French is not to the left of the Spanish.
2. The Brazilian is somewhere to the left of the French.
3. The Spanish is not to the left of the Nigerian.
4. The Nigerian is on the far left.
5. The French is somewhere to the left of the British.
6. The British is on the left of the Chinese.
7. The Brazilian is somewhere between the British and the Spanish.
8. The Dutch is somewhere between the French and the British.

From clue 4, we know the Nigerian is on the far left. From clue 3, we know the Spanish is not to the left of the Nigerian, so the Spanish must be in the second position.

From clue 2, we know the Brazilian is to the left of the French. Since the French is not to the left of the Spanish (clue 1), the Brazilian must be in the third position.

From clue 5, we know the French is to the left of the British. Since the Brazilian is to the left of the French, the British must be in the fifth position.

From clue 6, we know the British is to the left of the Chinese. The Chinese must be in the sixth position.

From clue 8, we know the Dutch is between the French and the British. Since the French is to the left of the British, the Dutch must be in the fourth position.

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-1x7-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 2, we know the owner of the turtle is on the far right.

From statement 5, we know the owner of the horse is in an even position. This means the horse is either in position 2, 4, or 6.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is in an even position, the rat must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From statement 1, we know the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. This means the hedgehog cannot be in position 1.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse. Since the horse is in an even position, the hedgehog must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

From statement 9, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the frog. This means the hedgehog cannot be in position 5 (since the frog would be to the right of the hedgehog).

From statement 7, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the frog. Since the hedgehog is not in position 5, it must be in position 1 or 3.

From statement 6, we know the owner of the lizard is not to the left of the owner of the frog. This means the lizard cannot be in position 1.

From statement 8, we know the owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the turtle is on the far right, the lizard must be in position 2, 4, or 6.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the turtle. This means the lizard must be in position 2 or 4.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   |     |       |            |          |      |        |        |

From the above deductions, we can conclude:

* Hedgehog is in position 1 or 3
* Rat is in position 1 or 3
* Horse is in position 2, 4, or 6
* Lizard is in position 2 or 4
* Turtle is in position 7
* Frog is in position 5 (since it's not in position 1, 2, 4, or 7)

Let's try to fill in the table:

|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | Hedgehog | Lizard | Rat | Horse | Frog |        | Turtle |

Since the hedgehog is not in position 5, it must be in position 1. The rat is in an odd position, so it must be in position 3. The horse is in an even position, so it must be in position 4. The lizard is in position 2 or 4, so it must be in position 2. The frog is in position 5. The turtle is in position 7.

Here is the final solution table:

|       |  1  |   2   |     3      |    4     |  5   |   6    |   7    |
| Pet   | Hedgehog | Lizard | Rat | Horse | Frog |        | Turtle |

Lv1-1x7-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since statement 9 says that the person drinking almond-milk is between the person drinking lemonade and the person drinking milk, we can conclude that the person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking lemonade. From statement 8, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Combining these two statements, we can conclude that the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, and the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 4, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 5, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far right. From statement 6, we know that the person drinking milk is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Therefore, the person drinking milk must be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

From statement 7, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere between the person drinking iced-tea and the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk, the person drinking almond-milk must be to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.

From statement 10, we know that the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking mirinda. From statement 11, we know that the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Therefore, the person drinking juice must be to the left of the person drinking mirinda.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|            |   1   |    2    |       3       |    4     |      5      |  6   |    7     |

From the above deductions, we can conclude that the order is:

1. Juice
2. Mirinda
3. Almond-milk
4. Lemonade
5. Milk
6. Hot-chocolate
7. Iced-tea
