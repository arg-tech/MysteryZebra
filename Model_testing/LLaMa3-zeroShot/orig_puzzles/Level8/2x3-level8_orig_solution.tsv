Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking cola is somewhere between the person drinking tea and the owner of the chinchilla.

This means that the cola drinker is either to the left of the tea drinker or to the right of the tea drinker, but not directly next to the tea drinker. The chinchilla owner is either to the left or right of the cola drinker.

2. The owner of the turtle is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.

This means that the turtle owner is either to the left of the tea drinker or to the right of the tea drinker.

3. The owner of the rat is not to the right of the person drinking cola.

This means that the rat owner is either to the left of the cola drinker or directly next to the cola drinker.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   |     |        |            |
| Pet        |     |        |            |

From clue 1, we know the cola drinker is between the tea drinker and the chinchilla owner. Let's assume the cola drinker is to the left of the tea drinker. Then, the chinchilla owner must be to the right of the cola drinker.

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | cola | tea    |            |
| Pet        |     |        |            |

From clue 2, we know the turtle owner is on the left or right of the tea drinker. Since the tea drinker is already in position 2, the turtle owner must be in position 1.

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | cola | tea    |            |
| Pet        | turtle |        |            |

From clue 3, we know the rat owner is not to the right of the cola drinker. Since the cola drinker is already in position 1, the rat owner must be in position 3.

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | cola | tea    |            |
| Pet        | turtle |        | rat      |

Now, let's summarize the remaining possibilities:

* The person drinking soy-milk is not yet assigned.
* The person drinking tea is already assigned.
* The chinchilla owner is already assigned.

The only remaining possibility is that the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the chinchilla.

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | cola | tea    | soy-milk  |
| Pet        | turtle | chinchilla | rat      |

#############
Final solution:

|            |  1  |   2    |     3      |
| Beverage   | cola | tea    | soy-milk  |
| Pet        | turtle | chinchilla | rat      |

Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the person driving the car.
This means that the person eating cauliflower is either driving the car or is to the right of the person driving the car.

3. The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the subway.
This means that the person eating strawberry is either driving the subway or is to the right of the person driving the subway.

4. The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person driving the bus.
This means that the person eating strawberry is either driving the bus or is to the right of the person driving the bus.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating cauliflower is not to the left of the person driving the car, so they are either driving the car or are to the right of the person driving the car.
* The person eating strawberry is somewhere between the person eating cauliflower and the person driving the bus, so they are either eating cauliflower or eating nectarine, and are between the person eating cauliflower and the person driving the bus.
* The person eating strawberry is not to the left of the person driving the subway, so they are either driving the subway or are to the right of the person driving the subway.
* The person eating strawberry is on the right of the person driving the bus, so they are either driving the bus or are to the right of the person driving the bus.

From these statements, we can deduce the following:

* The person eating cauliflower is not driving the car, so they are to the right of the person driving the car.
* The person eating strawberry is eating nectarine, since they are not eating cauliflower.
* The person eating strawberry is driving the bus, since they are on the right of the person driving the bus.
