Now, let's combine the information:

* The doctor eats lettuce (from statement 3).
* The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person who's hobby is writing (from statement 1).
* The person driving the car is not to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (from statement 4).
* The person eating lettuce is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile (from statement 5).

Here's the final solution table with the correct information:

#############
|             |    1    |         2          |
| Food        | Cabbage | Lettuce           |
| Hobby       | Chess   | Writing          |
| Job         | Doctor  | Software-Developer |
| Transport   | Car     | Snowmobile       |
#############

Note that the person eating cabbage has the hobby of chess, and the person eating lettuce has the job of doctor."
