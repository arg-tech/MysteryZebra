From clue 2, we know the person watching musical movies is the one drinking soy-milk. Let's call this person M.

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is between the person drinking cola and the person watching musical movies. Since M is already placed, we can deduce that the person drinking cola is on the left of M, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of M.

From clue 4, we know the scientist is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking cola is already placed, the scientist must be on the left of cola.

From clue 3, we know the mexican is somewhere to the right of the social-worker. Let's call the social-worker S. Since M is already placed, the mexican must be on the right of M.

From clue 5, we know the chef is on the left or right of the social-worker. Since S is already placed, the chef must be on the right of S.

* S (social-worker) is on the left of M
* Mexican is on the right of M
