From clue 1, we know that the fan of funk is to the left of the fan of d&b. From clue 2, we know that the fan of funk is not to the right of the fan of funk, so they must be the same person.

Lv1-1x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the hedgehog.
This means that the goldfish owner is either on the left or in the same position as the hedgehog owner.

2. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the goldfish.
This means that the hedgehog owner is either on the left or on the right of the goldfish owner.

3. The owner of the goldfish is not to the right of the owner of the goldfish.
This means that the goldfish owner is either on the left or in the same position as the goldfish owner.

From clue 1, we know the goldfish owner is to the left of the hedgehog owner. From clue 2, we know the hedgehog owner is either on the left or right of the goldfish owner. Since the goldfish owner is already to the left of the hedgehog owner, the hedgehog owner must be on the right of the goldfish owner.

From clue 3, we know the goldfish owner is not to the right of the goldfish owner. This means that the goldfish owner is either on the left or in the same position as the goldfish owner.

Now, let's combine the information:

|       |    1     |    2     |
| Pet   |          |          |

The goldfish owner is to the left of the hedgehog owner, so the order is:
Goldfish | Hedgehog

The goldfish owner is not to the right of the goldfish owner, so the goldfish owner is either on the left or in the same position as the goldfish owner. Since the hedgehog owner is on the right, the goldfish owner must be on the left.

Lv1-1x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is hiking.
This means that the person who likes video-games must be on the left or in the middle.

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right.
This means that the person who likes hiking must be on the rightmost column.

From clue 1, we know the video-games person is not on the right, so they must be in column 1 or 2. From clue 2, we know the hiking person is on the right, so they must be in column 2.

Here's the solution table with the final answer:

Lv1-1x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the goldfish is in an odd position.
This means the goldfish owner is either in position 1 or 3.

2. The owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the rat.
This means the rat owner is not in position 1, because if they were, the owner of the rat would be to the left of themselves, which is not allowed.

Considering both clues, we can conclude:

* The goldfish owner is in an odd position, so they are either in position 1 or 3.
* The rat owner is not in position 1, so they must be in position 2 or 3.
* Since the rat owner is not to the left of the rat owner, they cannot be in position 2, so they must be in position 3.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|       |    1     |  2  |
| Pet   |          |     |

Lv1-1x2-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating asparagus is on the right of the person eating plum.
This means that if we represent the people eating asparagus and plum as A and P, respectively, we can write:

A → P

2. The person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating asparagus.
This means that A cannot be to the left of A, so we can conclude that:

A ≠ A

Now, let's combine the two clues. Since A → P, we know that A is to the right of P. But we also know that A ≠ A, which means that A cannot be to the left of itself. Therefore, A must be to the right of P, and P must be to the left of A.

So, the final solution is:

#############
|        |  2   |     1     |
| Food   |  Plum | Asparagus |
#############

In this solution, the person eating plum is to the left of the person eating asparagus, which satisfies both clues."

| Transport   |  Left |  Right     |
#############

In this solution, the car driver is on the left, and the skateboard driver is on the right."
