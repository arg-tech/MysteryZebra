4. The person eating radish is somewhere to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching crime movies.

From clue 1, we know that the person who bakes is not to the left of the goat owner. From clue 2, we know that the goat owner is to the left of the radish eater. Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the person who bakes is to the right of the goat owner.

From clue 3, we know that the soul fan is to the left of the baker. Since the baker is to the right of the goat owner, the soul fan must be to the left of the goat owner.

From clue 4, we know that the radish eater is to the right of the hot-chocolate drinker. Since the goat owner is to the left of the radish eater, the hot-chocolate drinker must be to the left of the goat owner.

From clue 5, we know that the adventure movie fan is to the right of the crime movie fan. Since we don't have any information about the movie fans' positions relative to each other, we'll come back to this clue later.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      |               |             |

| Pet           |               |             |

From the above analysis, we can conclude that:

* The person who bakes is to the right of the goat owner.
* The soul fan is to the left of the goat owner.
* The hot-chocolate drinker is to the left of the goat owner.
* The radish eater is to the right of the hot-chocolate drinker.

We can start filling in the table:

|               |       1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | almond-milk |

| Music-Genre   | soul         | funk       |
| Pet           | goat         | rabbit     |

Now, let's come back to clue 5. We know that the adventure movie fan is to the right of the crime movie fan. Since the crime movie fan is in position 1, the adventure movie fan must be in position 2.

The final solution table is:

Lv1-6x2-8	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is chess is not to the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means the chess player is either in the leftmost or second position.

2. The fan of pop is the person driving the bike.
This means the pop fan is in the leftmost position, as they are driving the bike.

3. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means the spy movie fan is either in the third or fourth position.

4. The spanish is on the left of the musician.
This means the musician is either in the second or third position.

Now, let's combine the information:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Hobby         |            |           |
| Job           |            |           |
| Movie-Genre   |            |           |
| Music-Genre   |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

From clue 2, the pop fan is in the leftmost position, so they drive the bike. From clue 4, the musician is either in the second or third position. Since the pop fan is in the leftmost position, the musician cannot be in the second position, so they must be in the third position.

From clue 1, the chess player is not to the right of the taxi driver, so they must be in the leftmost or second position. Since the pop fan is already in the leftmost position, the chess player must be in the second position.

From clue 3, the spy movie fan is to the right of the taxi driver. Since the taxi driver is not the leftmost position (the pop fan is), the taxi driver must be in the third position. This means the spy movie fan is in the fourth position.

From clue 4, the spanish person is on the left of the musician. Since the musician is in the third position, the spanish person must be in the second position.

Now we can fill in the remaining information:
