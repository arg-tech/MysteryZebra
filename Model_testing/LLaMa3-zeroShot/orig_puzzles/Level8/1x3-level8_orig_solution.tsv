Lv1-1x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.
This means the climbing sport must be in column 3.

2. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
This means the sailing sport cannot be in column 1, because if it were, the climbing person would be to the left of the sailing person. Therefore, the sailing sport must be in column 2.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
This means the weightlifting sport must be in column 1.

Now that we have the positions of the sports, we can fill in the table:

#############
|         | Weightlifting | Sailing | Climbing |
| Sport   |               |         |          |
#############

The final solution is:

#############
|         | Weightlifting | Sailing | Climbing |
| Sport   | 1            | 2       | 3        |

Lv1-1x3-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the left of the person who's hobby is chess.
This means that the person who loves sudoku cannot be in the leftmost position.

2. The person who's hobby is sudoku is in the middle.
This means that the person who loves sudoku is in either the 1st or 2nd position.

Combining the two clues, we can conclude that the person who loves sudoku is in the 2nd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   |       |        |           |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|
|         | ?   | Sudoku | ?        |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|
|         | ?   |        | ?        |
#############

Since the person who loves sudoku is in the 2nd position, the person who loves chess cannot be in the 1st position (otherwise, the sudoku lover would be to the left of the chess lover, violating clue 1). Therefore, the person who loves chess must be in the 3rd position.

The only hobby left is skydiving, which must be the hobby of the person in the 1st position.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|         |   1   |   2    |     3     |
| Hobby   | Skydiving | Sudoku | Chess    |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------|
|         |        |        |          |

The puzzle is solved!"
Lv1-1x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.
This means that the order of soy-milk and juice is fixed, and the person drinking tea can be anywhere.

2. The person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
This means that the person drinking tea cannot be on the right of the person drinking juice. Therefore, the person drinking tea must be on the left of the person drinking juice.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking juice.
* The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking juice.

So, the order is: tea, soy-milk, juice.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|            |    1     |   2   |  3  |

Lv1-1x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the cola drinker is either to the right of the lemonade drinker or in the same position.

2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola.
This means that the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the cola drinker.

From clue 1, we know that the cola drinker is not to the left of the lemonade drinker. This means that the cola drinker is either in the middle or on the right.

From clue 2, we know that the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the cola drinker. This means that the almond-milk drinker is on the right.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|            |    1     |  2   |      3      |
| Beverage   |          |      |             |

Since the almond-milk drinker is on the right, we can place it in position 3:

|            |    1     |  2   |      3      |
| Beverage   |          |      | Almond-milk |

Now, we know that the cola drinker is not to the left of the lemonade drinker. This means that the cola drinker is either in position 1 or 2. Let's try to place it in position 1:

|            | Cola    |  2   |      3      |
| Beverage   |          |      | Almond-milk |

This doesn't work, because the cola drinker is to the left of the lemonade drinker. Let's try placing it in position 2 instead:

|            |    1     | Cola |      3      |
| Beverage   |          |      | Almond-milk |

This works! The cola drinker is not to the left of the lemonade drinker, and the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the cola drinker.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |    1     | Cola |      3      |
| Beverage   | Lemonade |      | Almond-milk |

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Colombian is in an even position.
2. The Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian.

From clue 1, we know the Colombian is in positions 2 or 4.

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is not in position 3 (since it's an odd position and the Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian).

So, the Colombian must be in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               | Brazilian | Colombian | Malaysian |
| Nationality   |           |     X    |           |
#############

The Colombian is in position 2, so the Malaysian must be in position 1 or 3. But the Colombian is not to the right of the Malaysian, so the Malaysian cannot be in position 3. Therefore, the Malaysian must be in position 1.

Finally, the Brazilian must be in position 3.

#############
|               |           | Colombian | Malaysian |
| Nationality   | Brazilian |     X    |     X    |
#############

The final solution is:

Brazilian is in position 1
Colombian is in position 2
Malaysian is in position 3"

Lv1-1x3-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.

This means that the surfing person is either to the right of the water-polo person or in the same position.

2. The person who's sport is water-polo is not to the left of the person who's sport is cycling.

This means that the water-polo person is either to the right of the cycling person or in the same position.

From these two clues, we can deduce the following:

* The surfing person is either in position 3 or to the right of the water-polo person.
* The water-polo person is either in position 2 or to the right of the cycling person.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Sport   |         |            |         |

Since the surfing person is either in position 3 or to the right of the water-polo person, and the water-polo person is either in position 2 or to the right of the cycling person, we can start by placing the cycling person in position 1:

|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Sport   | Cycling |            |         |

Now, we know that the water-polo person is not to the left of the cycling person, so they must be in position 2 or 3. Since the surfing person is on the right of the water-polo person, they must be in position 3:

|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Sport   | Cycling | Water-Polo | Surfing |

This is the final solution:
