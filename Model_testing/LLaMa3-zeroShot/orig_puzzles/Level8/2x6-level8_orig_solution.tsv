Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the fan of jazz is on the left of the lawyer. From clue 7, we know the lawyer is not to the left of the fan of jazz, so the lawyer must be in the middle or to the right.
* From clue 2, we know the manager is on the left or right of the fan of house. From clue 3, we know the manager is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical. From clue 12, we know the manager is on the right of the paramedic, so the manager must be in the rightmost position.
* From clue 4, we know the fan of soul is not to the left of the nurse. From clue 14, we know the security-guard is somewhere between the fan of house and the nurse, so the nurse must be in the rightmost position.
* From clue 5, we know the security-guard is somewhere to the right of the fan of rock. From clue 6, we know the fan of rock is somewhere between the fan of jazz and the security-guard, so the fan of rock must be in the middle.
* From clue 8, we know the pilot is on the left or right of the fan of house. From clue 9, we know the security-guard is on the left or right of the pilot, so the pilot must be in the middle.

From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the owner of the turtle.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the turtle is in an even position, so it must be either person 2 or person 4.
