Now, let's combine the clues and fill in the table:

|               |     1      |      2      |     3      |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Let's place the person who's hobby is photography in position 1.

|               | Photography |            |            |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is water-polo. Since the person who's hobby is photography is already in position 1, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 2.

|               | Photography | Collecting |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is water-polo and the person who's sport is golf. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 2, the person who's sport is soccer must be in position 3.

|               | Photography | Collecting | Soccer    |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

From clue 1, we know that the person who watches scientific movies is either to the left or to the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who's hobby is photography is already in position 1, the person who watches scientific movies must be in position 2.

|               | Photography | Scientific |            |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

From clue 3, we know that the person who watches western movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 2, the person who watches western movies must be in position 1.

|               | Western    | Scientific |            |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

Finally, from clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person who's hobby is photography is already in position 1, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 3.

|               | Western    | Scientific | Water-Polo |
| Hobby         |            |             |            |

| Sport         |            |             |            |

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:

Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is tennis is not to the right of the person who's sport is basketball.
This means that the tennis player is either to the left of the basketball player or in the middle.

2. The person eating orange is on the left or right of the photographer.
This means that the photographer is not in the middle, and the orange eater is either to the left or right of the photographer.

3. The person eating carrot is not to the right of the photographer.
This means that the carrot eater is either to the left of the photographer or in the middle.

4. The photographer is on the left of the lawyer.
This means that the lawyer is to the right of the photographer.

5. The freelancer is on the left or right of the person eating orange.
This means that the freelancer is either to the left or right of the orange eater.

6. The person who's sport is tennis is in the middle.
This means that the tennis player is in the middle, and the basketball player is either to the left or right of the tennis player.

7. The person eating orange is in the middle.
This means that the orange eater is in the middle, and the tennis player is also in the middle (since the orange eater is in the middle).

Now, let's combine the information:

|         |      1       |   2    |     3      |
| Food    |              |        |            |
| Job     |              |        |            |
| Sport   |              |        |            |

From step 7, we know the orange eater is in the middle. From step 2, we know the photographer is not in the middle, so the orange eater is either to the left or right of the photographer. From step 4, we know the photographer is to the left of the lawyer, so the orange eater is either to the left of the photographer and the lawyer, or to the right of the photographer and the lawyer.

From step 5, we know the freelancer is on the left or right of the orange eater. Since the orange eater is in the middle, the freelancer is either to the left or right of the middle.

From step 3, we know the carrot eater is not to the right of the photographer. Since the photographer is to the left of the lawyer, the carrot eater is either to the left of the photographer and the lawyer, or in the middle.

From step 1, we know the tennis player is not to the right of the basketball player. Since the tennis player is in the middle, the basketball player is either to the left or right of the tennis player.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Malaysian is somewhere between the firefighter and the French.
This means the Malaysian is either to the left of the French or to the right of the firefighter.

2. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means the cola drinker is either to the right of the iced-tea drinker or in the same position.

3. The person drinking cola is not to the left of the French.
This means the cola drinker is either to the right of the French or in the same position.

4. The firefighter is on the left or right of the social-worker.
This means the social-worker is either to the left or right of the firefighter.

5. The person drinking mirinda is on the far right.
This means the mirinda drinker is in the third position.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the French.
This means the iced-tea drinker is either to the left of the French or in the same position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The Malaysian is between the firefighter and the French, so the Malaysian is either to the left of the French or to the right of the firefighter.
* The cola drinker is not to the left of the iced-tea drinker, so the cola drinker is either to the right of the iced-tea drinker or in the same position.
* The cola drinker is not to the left of the French, so the cola drinker is either to the right of the French or in the same position.
* The mirinda drinker is on the far right, so the mirinda drinker is in the third position.
* The iced-tea drinker is not to the right of the French, so the iced-tea drinker is either to the left of the French or in the same position.

With these constraints, we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |           |               |             |
| Job           |           |               |             |
| Nationality   |           |               |             |

Let's start with the mirinda drinker, who is on the far right. Since the Malaysian is between the firefighter and the French, the Malaysian can't be the mirinda drinker. The French can't be the mirinda drinker either, since the iced-tea drinker is not to the right of the French. Therefore, the mirinda drinker must be the Malaysian.

|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |           |               |             |
| Job           |           |               |             |
| Nationality   |           |               |             |
|  Mirinda     |           |               | Malaysian  |

Now, let's focus on the cola drinker. Since the cola drinker is not to the left of the iced-tea drinker, the cola drinker must be either to the right of the iced-tea drinker or in the same position. Since the mirinda drinker is the Malaysian, the cola drinker can't be the Malaysian. The French can't be the cola drinker either, since the cola drinker is not to the left of the French. Therefore, the cola drinker must be the social-worker.

|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |

| Nationality   |           |               |             |
|  Mirinda     |           |               | Malaysian  |
|  Cola        |           |               | Social-worker |

Now, let's focus on the iced-tea drinker. Since the iced-tea drinker is not to the right of the French, the iced-tea drinker must be either to the left of the French or in the same position. Since the cola drinker is the social-worker, the iced-tea drinker can't be the social-worker. Therefore, the iced-tea drinker must be the firefighter.

|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |           |               |             |
| Job           |           |               |             |
| Nationality   |           |               |             |
|  Mirinda     |           |               | Malaysian  |
|  Cola        |           |               | Social-worker |
|  Iced-tea    |           |               | Firefighter |

Finally, let's determine the nationalities. Since the Malaysian is the mirinda drinker, the Malaysian must be the one on the far right. The French can't be the firefighter, since the iced-tea drinker is the firefighter. Therefore, the French must be the social-worker.

|               |     1     |       2       |      3      |
| Beverage      |           |               |             |
| Job           |           |               |             |
| Nationality   |           |               |             |
|  Mirinda     |           |               | Malaysian  |
|  Cola        |           |               | Social-worker |
|  Iced-tea    |           |               | Firefighter |

Lv1-3x3-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the ship is not to the left of the person watching musical movies.
2. The fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship.
3. The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching musical movies.
4. The fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies.
5. The fan of blues is in an even position.
6. The person driving the ship is the person watching musical movies.

From statement 6, we know that the person driving the ship is the person watching musical movies. Let's denote this person as M (for musical).

From statement 1, we know that M is not to the left of the person driving the ship. This means that the person driving the ship must be to the right of M.

From statement 2, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is to the right of M, the fan of d&b must be to the left of M.

From statement 4, we know that the fan of blues is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the fan of d&b is to the left of M, the fan of blues must be to the left of the fan of d&b.

From statement 5, we know that the fan of blues is in an even position. This means that the fan of blues must be in the middle position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

* The fan of blues is in the middle position.
* The fan of d&b is on the left of the person driving the ship.
* The person driving the subway is not to the right of the person watching musical movies, so they must be in the first position.

Lv1-3x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Indian is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla.
2. The Pakistani is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing.
3. The owner of the cat is not to the right of the person who's hobby is fishing.
4. The person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the Indian.
5. The owner of the cat is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the owner of the dog.
6. The owner of the chinchilla is on the far left or far right.

From clue 1, we know the Indian is to the left of the chinchilla owner. From clue 4, we know the photography hobby is to the left of the Indian. So, the order is:

Photography -> Indian ->? -> Chinchilla

From clue 2, we know the Pakistani is to the right of the writing hobby. Since the Indian is already placed, the writing hobby must be to the right of the Indian. So, the order is:

Photography -> Indian -> Writing ->? -> Chinchilla

From clue 3, we know the cat owner is not to the right of the fishing hobby. Since the writing hobby is already placed, the fishing hobby must be to the left of the writing hobby. So, the order is:

Photography -> Indian -> Fishing -> Writing ->? -> Chinchilla

From clue 5, we know the cat owner is between the fishing and dog owners. Since the fishing hobby is already placed, the cat owner must be to the right of the fishing hobby and to the left of the dog owner. So, the order is:

Photography -> Indian -> Fishing -> Cat -> Writing -> Dog -> Chinchilla

From clue 6, we know the chinchilla owner is on the far left or far right. Since the chinchilla owner is already placed, it must be on the far right.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-3x3-6	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The Mexican is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the ship.

This means the Mexican is either driving the car or driving the ship, or is sitting between the two.

2. The person driving the car is somewhere to the right of the person driving the ship.

This means the person driving the car is either to the right of the Mexican (if the Mexican is driving the ship) or to the right of the person driving the ship (if the Mexican is driving the car).

3. The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the Canadian.

This means the Canadian is either driving the car or driving the ship, and the person who's sport is swimming is to the right of the Canadian.

4. The person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming.

This means the person who's sport is climbing is either to the left of the person who's sport is swimming or is in the same position as the person who's sport is swimming.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |

| Transport     |          |          |            |

From clue 1, we know the Mexican is either driving the car or driving the ship. Let's assume the Mexican is driving the car (we can try the other option later).

From clue 2, we know the person driving the car is to the right of the person driving the ship. This means the person driving the ship must be to the left of the Mexican.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is swimming is to the right of the Canadian. Since the Canadian is not driving the car (otherwise, the Mexican would be driving the ship), the Canadian must be driving the ship.

From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is climbing is not to the right of the person who's sport is swimming. This means the person who's sport is climbing is either to the left of the person who's sport is swimming or is in the same position as the person who's sport is swimming.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1     |    2     |     3      |

Lv1-3x3-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the photographer is to the left of the firefighter.

From statement 2, we know the electrician is not eating apricot.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person eating apricot.

From statement 4, we know the person eating onion is not to the right of the person who's hobby is camping.

From statement 5, we know the person eating onion is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the electrician.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is camping is to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|         |      1       |      2      |      3      |

From statement 1, we know the photographer is to the left of the firefighter. Let's assume the photographer is in position 1.

| Job     | Photographer|             | Firefighter|

From statement 2, we know the electrician is not eating apricot. Let's assume the electrician is eating corn.

|         |      1       |      2      |      3      |

| Job     | Photographer| Electrician| Firefighter|

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person eating apricot. Since the photographer is eating apricot, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 2.

|         |      1       |      2      |      3      |

| Job     | Photographer| Electrician| Firefighter|

From statement 4, we know the person eating onion is not to the right of the person who's hobby is camping. Since the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2, the person eating onion must be in position 3.

|         |      1       |      2      |      3      |

| Job     | Photographer| Electrician| Firefighter|

From statement 5, we know the person eating onion is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since there is no person eating cooking, this statement is not applicable.

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is video-games is not to the right of the electrician. Since the electrician is in position 2, the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 1.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is camping is to the right of the person who's hobby is video-games. Since the person who's hobby is video-games is in position 1, the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 2.

Lv1-3x3-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Dutch is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is camping.
2. The person who's hobby is camping is on the right of the Chinese.
3. The person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
4. The person who's hobby is camping is somewhere to the right of the owner of the lizard.
5. The owner of the lizard is between the owner of the pony and the person who's hobby is woodworking.

From clue 1, we know the Dutch is to the left of the camping person. From clue 2, we know the Chinese is to the left of the camping person. Therefore, the order from left to right is: Dutch, Chinese, camping.

From clue 4, we know the camping person is to the right of the lizard owner. Since the camping person is already to the right of the Chinese, the lizard owner must be between the Chinese and the camping person.

From clue 5, we know the lizard owner is between the pony owner and the woodworking person. Since the lizard owner is already between the Chinese and the camping person, the pony owner must be to the left of the Chinese, and the woodworking person must be to the right of the camping person.

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Guinea-pig    |             |           |           |
#############

We still have some unknowns, but we can make some educated guesses:

* The Argentine nationality is often associated with South America, so it's likely that the person with the guinea-pig is Argentine.
* The Chinese person is already in the table, so the person with the gardening hobby is likely Chinese.
* The Dutch person is already in the table, so the person with the woodworking hobby is likely Dutch.
* The pony owner is likely the person with the woodworking hobby, since they're to the left of the Chinese.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-3x3-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is cooking is somewhere to the left of the person eating cabbage.
This means that the cooking hobbyist is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person eating cabbage is in the 3rd column.

2. The person who's hobby is traveling is the musician.
This means that the musician has the traveling hobby.

3. The bartender is not to the right of the person eating spinach.
This means that the bartender is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person eating spinach is in the 3rd column.

4. The musician is on the left of the police-officer.
This means that the musician is in the 1st or 2nd column, and the police-officer is in the 3rd column.

5. The bartender is on the left of the person eating plum.
This means that the bartender is in the 1st column, and the person eating plum is in the 2nd column.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The musician has the traveling hobby (2).
* The musician is on the left of the police-officer (4), so the musician is in the 1st column.
* The bartender is on the left of the person eating plum (5), so the bartender is in the 1st column.
* The person eating cabbage is to the right of the cooking hobbyist (1), so the person eating cabbage is in the 3rd column.
* The person eating spinach is not to the right of the bartender (3), so the person eating spinach is in the 1st or 2nd column.

Here's the final solution table with the people's food, hobby, and job:

Lv1-3x3-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not driving the car.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the car. This means the scooter driver must be on the left of the car driver.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the right of the person eating cauliflower. This means the person eating cauliflower must be on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite.

From statement 6, we know the person eating radish is on the far right.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|             |       1       |      2      |   3    |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |
| Food        |               |             |        |
| Transport   |               |             |        |

Since the person eating radish is on the far right, we can start by placing radish in column 3:

|             |       1       |      2      |   Radish |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |

From statement 3, we know the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the person eating radish is on the far right, the person eating cauliflower must be in column 1:

|             | Cauliflower |      2      |   Radish |

From statement 5, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person eating cauliflower is in column 1, the person drinking almond-milk must be in column 2:

|             | Cauliflower | Almond-milk |   Radish |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |

| Transport   |               |             |        |

From statement 1, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not driving the car. Since the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the car (statement 2), the scooter driver must be in column 1:

|             | Scooter     | Almond-milk |   Radish |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |

From statement 4, we know the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is not yet placed, we'll come back to this statement later.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the right of the person driving the car. Since the scooter driver is already in column 1, the car driver must be in column 3:

|             | Scooter     | Almond-milk |   Radish |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |

Now, let's place the person eating papaya. From statement 4, we know the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is not yet placed, we'll place the person eating papaya in column 2:

|             | Scooter     | Papaya     |   Radish |
| Beverage    |               |             |        |

| Transport   |             |             | Car     |

Finally, let's place the person drinking sprite. From statement 5, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already in column 2, the person drinking sprite must be in column 3:

| Beverage    | Almond-milk |             | Sprite   |
