Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching documentary movies is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter.
This means that the person driving the helicopter must be either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
This means that the person watching documentary movies must be in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person with gardening as a hobby must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

Combining these two clues, we can deduce the following:

* The person driving the helicopter cannot be in the 1st position, since the person watching documentary movies is not to the left of them.
* The person with gardening as a hobby cannot be in the 1st position, since the person watching documentary movies is on their right.
* The person watching documentary movies must be in the 1st position, and the person driving the helicopter must be in the 2nd position.
* The person with gardening as a hobby must be in the 3rd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

1. The person drinking Mirinda is in an even position.
This means the person drinking Mirinda is either in the 1st or 2nd position.

2. The person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the American.
This means the person driving the jet-ski is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the American is in the 3rd or 4th position.

3. The American is somewhere to the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
This means the American is in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person drinking Mirinda is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

Combining the clues, we can conclude that:

* The American is in the 1st position.
* The person drinking Mirinda is in the 2nd position.
* The person driving the jet-ski is in the 1st position (since the American is not to the right of the person driving the jet-ski).

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The architect is on the left of the Spanish.
This means the Spanish person is either in the 2nd or 3rd column, and the architect is in the 1st column.

2. The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the Dutch.
This means the Dutch person is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person with the card-games hobby is in the 1st or 2nd column as well.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

From clue 1, we know the architect is in the 1st column. From clue 2, we know the Dutch person is either in the 1st or 2nd column. Let's assume the Dutch person is in the 1st column for now.

The person with the card-games hobby is not to the right of the Dutch, so they must be in the 1st column as well. This means the Dutch person's hobby is singing.

2. The person who's sport is parkour is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
This means that the person who's sport is parkour must be to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.

1. The person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means that the person eating cranberry is either watching scientific movies or is on the right of the person watching fantasy movies.

2. The Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple.
This means that the Mexican is either eating pineapple or is on the left of the person eating pineapple.

Now, let's create a possible arrangement:

Initially, we can place the Mexican on the left, as they are on the left of the person eating pineapple.

| Movie-Genre   |           |            |

Since the person eating cranberry is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, we can place the person eating cranberry on the right.

| Movie-Genre   |           | fantasy  |
| Nationality   | Mexican |            |

Now, we need to place the person eating pineapple. Since the Mexican is on the left of the person eating pineapple, we can place the person eating pineapple on the right.

| Food          | cranberry | pineapple |
| Movie-Genre   |           | fantasy  |
| Nationality   | Mexican |            |

Finally, we need to place the remaining movie genre (scientific) and nationality (Italian). Since the person eating cranberry is not watching fantasy movies, they must be watching scientific movies. The Italian can be placed on the right, watching fantasy movies.

4. The person watching epic movies is somewhere to the right of the fan of classical
This clue tells us that the fan of classical music is to the left of the person who watches epic movies. We can represent this as:
