| Time-Travel   | Snowboarding  |
| Western        | Parkour       |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.
2. From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
3. From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the middle. This means the person watching documentary movies is on the left, and the person watching time-travel movies is on the right.
4. From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is basketball is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is basketball (clue 1), we can conclude that the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.
5. From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is basketball is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person who's sport is golf. This means the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball, which is between the person who's sport is badminton and the person who's sport is golf.
6. From clue 14, we know the person watching superhero movies is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the person watching superhero movies is in an even position (clue 11), we can conclude that the person watching superhero movies is in the 2nd or 4th position.
7. From clue 6, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in an even position, the person watching spy movies must be in the 1st or 3rd position.
8. From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is rugby is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching satire movies is in the 5th position (due to the even position of the person watching superhero movies), the person who's sport is rugby must be in the 3rd or 4th position.
9. From clue 8, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person watching time-travel movies is already in the 6th position, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in the 5th position.
10. From clue 13, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is not the person watching documentary movies. This means the person who's sport is lacrosse is actually watching a different movie genre.

By combining these clues, we can arrive at the final solution table."	{'movie-genre': ['sport'], 'documentary': ['lacrosse'], 'drama': ['basketball'], 'satire': ['rugby'], 'spy': ['badminton'], 'superhero': ['golf'], 'time-travel': ['snowboarding'], 'western': ['parkour']}	False	0	False

Lv1-2x7-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 7, we know the architect drinks cola.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking cola is between the person drinking tea and the person drinking juice.

From statement 16, we know the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking tea is somewhere to the right of the architect (who drinks cola). Therefore, the person drinking tea is to the right of the person drinking cola.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking juice is not to the right of the person drinking tea. Therefore, the person drinking juice is either to the left of the person drinking tea or in the same position.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the engineer and the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is on the far left or far right (statement 1), the engineer must be on the left side of the dressmaker.

From statement 12, we know the engineer is somewhere to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Therefore, the engineer is to the right of the dressmaker.

From statement 14, we know the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the person drinking juice. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the person drinking juice.

From statement 17, we know the person drinking 7up is between the person drinking almond-milk and the software-developer. Since the software-developer is to the right of the accountant (not explicitly stated, but implied by the fact that the teacher is between the software-developer and the accountant), the person drinking 7up is to the left of the software-developer.

From statement 18, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not the writer. Therefore, the writer must be drinking one of the remaining beverages: iced-tea, juice, or water.

From statement 15, we know the teacher is not the person drinking water. Therefore, the teacher must be drinking one of the remaining beverages: iced-tea, juice, or 7up.

Here's the breakdown of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 21, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the owner of the cat.
2. From clue 1, we know the owner of the cat is somewhere between the person driving the skateboard and the owner of the goldfish.
3. From clue 14, we know the owner of the goldfish is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rat.
4. From clue 6, we know the owner of the rat is on the left of the owner of the goldfish.
5. From clue 19, we know the person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
6. From clue 20, we know the person driving the motorbike is in the middle.
7. From clue 5, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
8. From clue 12, we know the owner of the lizard is not the person driving the quad-bike.
9. From clue 10, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
10. From clue 8, we know the person driving the jet-ski is not to the right of the person driving the van.
11. From clue 9, we know the person driving the boat is not to the right of the person driving the van.
12. From clue 16, we know the person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
13. From clue 17, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is not to the right of the person driving the van.
14. From clue 4, we know the person driving the motorbike is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.
15. From clue 3, we know the owner of the rat is not to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig.

Using these clues, I've arranged the pets and transports as follows:

* Quad-bike (far left)
* Jet-ski (left of lizard)
* Lizard
* Motorbike (middle)
* Boat (right of motorbike)
* Van (right of boat)
* Skateboard (left of cat)
* Cat
* Bus (right of jet-ski)
* Rat (left of goldfish)

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 17, we know the person drinking tea is in the middle. Since there are 7 positions, the person drinking tea must be in position 4.
2. From clue 5, we know the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 4, the person drinking coffee must be in position 5.
3. From clue 1, we know the person drinking coffee is in an odd position, which is position 5.
4. From clue 19, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
5. From clue 12, we know the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
6. From clue 10, we know the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking cola is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
7. From clue 2, we know the owner of the pony is somewhere between the person drinking water and the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
8. From clue 6, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
9. From clue 8, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk, the person drinking lemonade must be to the left of the owner of the turtle.
10. From clue 9, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not to the left of the owner of the turtle. Since the person drinking lemonade is to the left of the owner of the turtle, the person drinking almond-milk must be to the right of the owner of the turtle.
11. From clue 11, we know the owner of the turtle is not to the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is to the right of the owner of the turtle, the owner of the turtle must be in position 2.
12. From clue 12, we know the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the owner of the turtle is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 3.
13. From clue 10, we know the person drinking cola is not to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the person drinking cola must be in position 6.
14. From clue 2, we know the owner of the pony is somewhere between the person drinking water and the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is in position 6, the owner of the pony must be in position 5.
15. From clue 19, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person drinking water. Since the owner of the pony is in position 5, the person drinking water must be in position 1.
16. From clue 16, we know the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
17. From clue 14, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is not yet placed, we'll come back to this later.
18. From clue 15, we know the owner of the horse is not to the left of the owner of the horse. This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.
19. From clue 18, we know the person drinking water is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in position 3, the person drinking water must be in position 1.

With all the clues resolved, we can fill in the remaining positions:

* The owner of the bird is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking fanta, the owner of the bird must be in position 2.
* The owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person drinking fanta. Since the owner of the bird is in position 2, the person drinking fanta must be in position 6.
* The owner of the horse is not to the left of the owner of the horse. This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.
* The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is in position 4, the owner of the mouse must be in position 3.
* The owner of the frog is on the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, the owner of the frog must be in position 2.
