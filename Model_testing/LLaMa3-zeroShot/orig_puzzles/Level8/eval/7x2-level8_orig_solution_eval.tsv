This means that the person driving the taxi is to the left of the person who watches adventure movies.

5. The person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the owner of the goat.
This means that the owner of the goat is to the right of the person who drinks soy-milk.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport     |             |           |

From step 3, we know the fan of electronic is on the far left, so:

|               | electronic |             |

| Transport     |             |           |

From step 1, we know the person who drinks sprite is not to the left of the person who gardens, so the person who drinks sprite must be in the second column:

| Transport     | taxi      | van        |

From step 5, we know the person who drinks soy-milk is to the left of the owner of the goat, so the owner of the goat must be in the second column:

|               | electronic | sprite     |

Lv1-7x2-5	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 1, we know the social-worker is on the right of the person eating peas. Let's assume the person eating peas is on the left. We can't place the social-worker yet, but we'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know the social-worker is Thai. We can place the Thai nationality on the right side of the table.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the goldfish is not to the left of the fan of trance. This means the owner of the goldfish must be on the right side of the table, and the fan of trance must be on the left side.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking coffee is on the far right. We can place the coffee drinker on the far right.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the fan of dubstep. This means the fan of dubstep must be on the left side of the table, and the snowboarder must be on the right side.

Now, let's try to place the remaining information. We know the social-worker is Thai, so they must be on the right side of the table. We also know the person eating peas is on the left, and the social-worker is on the right of the person eating peas. This means the social-worker must be on the right side of the person eating peas.

Here's the current state of the table:

Now, let's try to place the remaining information. We know the person drinking coffee is on the far right, and the social-worker is on the right side of the person eating peas. This means the person drinking coffee must be on the right side of the social-worker.

We also know the fan of dubstep is on the left side, and the snowboarder is on the right side. This means the fan of dubstep must be on the left side of the person eating peas.

Here's the final solution:

Let's put the pilot in the third column:

|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | Mango        |               |               |
| Job           |               |               | Pilot        |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts |               |               |
| Music-Genre   |               |               |               |
| Nationality   |               |               |               |
| Sport         |               |               |               |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |               |

From statement 3, we know the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the person eating mango is already in the first column, the person eating nectarine must be in the second column.

Let's put the fan of punk in the second column:

|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | Mango        | Nectarine    |               |
| Job           |               |               | Pilot        |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts |               |               |
| Music-Genre   |               | Punk         |               |
| Nationality   |               |               |               |
| Sport         |               |               |               |
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |               |

From statement 7, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is the person eating mango. This means the person eating mango is in the same row as the person watching martial-arts movies.

From statement 1, we know the Japanese is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. This means the Japanese is either in the first column or second column, and the person who's sport is weightlifting is in the third or fourth column.

Let's put the Japanese in the second column:

|               |       1       |       2       |       3       |
| Food          | Mango        | Nectarine    |               |
| Job           |               | Fisherman    | Pilot        |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts |               |               |
| Music-Genre   |               | Punk         |               |
| Nationality   | Japanese    |               |               |
| Sport         |               | Skateboarding| Weightlifting|
| Transport     | Snowmobile  |               |               |

Now we have a complete solution:
