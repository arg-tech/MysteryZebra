Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the scooter.

This means that the airplane driver is in the second column (2), and the scooter driver is in the first column (1).

2. The person eating onion is not to the right of the person driving the scooter.

This means that the person eating onion is either in the first column (1) or in the second column (2), but not to the right of the scooter driver.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The airplane driver is in column 2.
* The scooter driver is in column 1.
* The person eating onion is either in column 1 or column 2.

Since there are only two types of food (onion and orange), and two means of transport (airplane and scooter), we can create a table with all possible combinations:

|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        |         |          |
| Transport   |         |          |

1. Onion - Airplane
2. Onion - Scooter
3. Orange - Airplane
4. Orange - Scooter

Now, let's apply the clues:

* Clue 1: Airplane driver is in column 2, scooter driver is in column 1.
* Clue 2: Onion eater is not to the right of scooter driver.

From the table, we can see that:

* In combination 1, the onion eater is to the right of the scooter driver, which contradicts Clue 2.
* In combination 2, the onion eater is in column 1, which satisfies Clue 2.
* In combination 3, the onion eater is in column 2, which contradicts Clue 2.
* In combination 4, the onion eater is in column 1, which satisfies Clue 2.

Therefore, the solution is:

#############
|             |    1    |    2     |
| Food        |  Onion  |  Orange |
| Transport   |  Scooter |  Airplane |

Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is cycling is not to the left of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means that the person who drinks soy-milk cannot be the one who plays cycling.

2. The person who's sport is cycling is somewhere to the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means that the person who drinks soy-milk must be to the left of the person who plays cycling.

From these two clues, we can conclude that the person who drinks soy-milk must be on the left, and the person who plays cycling must be on the right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

| Soy-milk   |  Person B | Person A |
| Cycling    |          |  Person B |

In this solution, Person A drinks juice and plays lacrosse, while Person B drinks soy-milk and plays cycling."	{'juice': ['person a', 'person b'], 'soy-milk': ['person b', 'person a'], 'cycling': ['', 'person b'], 'lacrosse': ['person a', '']}	False	0	False
Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of R&B.
This means that the person eating cabbage is either to the right of the fan of R&B or is the fan of R&B themselves.

2. The person eating peach is on the left of the fan of R&B.
This means that the person eating peach is either the one to the left of the fan of R&B or is the fan of R&B themselves.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

* The person eating peach cannot be the fan of R&B, because then they would be on the right of themselves, which is not possible.
* The person eating cabbage cannot be the fan of R&B, because then they would be to the left of themselves, which is not possible.
* The fan of R&B must be eating either cabbage or peach.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          |       |         |
| Music-Genre   |       |         |

We know that the fan of R&B is eating either cabbage or peach. Let's assume they are eating cabbage. Then, the person eating peach must be the one to the left of the fan of R&B.

|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          | Peach | Cabbage |
| Music-Genre   | R&B  | Pop    |

But wait, this doesn't satisfy the second clue! The person eating peach is supposed to be on the left of the fan of R&B, but in this scenario, the fan of R&B is eating cabbage, which is to the right of the person eating peach.

So, let's try again. This time, let's assume the fan of R&B is eating peach. Then, the person eating cabbage must be the one to the right of the fan of R&B.

|               |   1   |    2    |
| Food          | Cabbage | Peach |
| Music-Genre   | Pop    | R&B  |

And this satisfies both clues! The person eating cabbage is not to the left of the fan of R&B, and the person eating peach is on the left of the fan of R&B.

Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the dog is not to the right of the person eating lime.
This means that the dog owner must be on the left side of the table.

2. The person eating lime is on the right of the owner of the dog.
This means that the person eating lime must be on the right side of the table.

From these two clues, we can conclude that the dog owner is on the left side, and the person eating lime is on the right side.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: ice-hockey, soccer
This means we have two people, each preferring one of these sports.

2. The people use 2 different means of transport: helicopter, snowmobile
This means we also have two people, each using one of these means of transport.

From statement 1, we know the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. This means the person driving the helicopter must be on the right.

From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person driving the snowmobile. This means the person driving the snowmobile must be on the right, and the person who prefers soccer must be on the left.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|             |     1      |     2      |
| Sport       |            |            |

#############
| Sport       | Soccer     | Ice-Hockey |
| Transport   | Snowmobile | Helicopter |
#############

Here's the reasoning:

* Person 1 prefers soccer and drives the snowmobile (statement 2).
* Person 2 prefers ice-hockey and drives the helicopter (since the person driving the helicopter is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter, and the person driving the snowmobile is on the right).

1. The person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
This means that the person who drinks fanta is on the left of the person who plays baseball.

2. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.
This means that the person who plays volleyball is either on the left of the person who plays baseball or on the right of the person who drinks soy-milk.

From clue 1, we know that the person who drinks fanta is on the left of the person who plays baseball. Let's assume the person who drinks fanta is on the left, and the person who plays baseball is on the right.

|            |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage   |            |          |
| Sport      |            |          |

Since there are only 2 people, the person who plays volleyball must be on the left of the person who drinks soy-milk. This means that the person who drinks soy-milk must play volleyball.

|            |     1      |    2     |
| Beverage   | fanta     | soy-milk |

Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating pomegranate is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening.
This means that the person eating pomegranate cannot be in the ""Food"" column next to ""Gardening"" in the table.

2. The person eating pomegranate is not to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
This means that the person eating pomegranate cannot be in the ""Food"" column next to another person eating pomegranate.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating pomegranate is not next to the person with the hobby of gardening. This means that the person eating pomegranate must be in the ""Food"" column next to the person with the hobby of chess.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating pomegranate cannot be next to another person eating pomegranate. This means that there can only be one person eating pomegranate in the table.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |     1     |      2      |

This means that the scooter driver cannot be the librarian, and the librarian must be to the left of the scooter driver.
2. The videographer is on the far left.
This means that the videographer must be in the leftmost column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Transport   |              |           |

From clue 2, we know the videographer is in column 1. From clue 1, we know the scooter driver is not the librarian, so the scooter driver must be in column 2. This leaves the librarian in column 1.

2. The American is somewhere to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

From clue 1, we know that the Mexican is either to the right of the person watching zombie movies or in the same position. From clue 2, we know that the American is to the left of the person watching zombie movies.

Here's a possible arrangement:

|               |    1     |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   |          |         |
| Nationality   |          |         |

Let's fill in the table:

* American is to the left of the person watching zombie movies, so the American is in position 1.
* The person watching zombie movies is to the right of the American, so they are in position 2.
* The Mexican is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies, so the Mexican is in position 2.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-2x2-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is not to the left of the Pakistani.
This means that the Pakistani cannot be on the left of the surfer.

2. The Pakistani is on the far right.
This means that the Pakistani must be in the second column (since there are only two columns).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   |           | Pakistani |
| Sport         |           |           |

Since the Pakistani is on the far right, the surfer must be in the first column. But we don't know the nationality yet.

Let's try to figure out the nationality of the surfer. If the surfer were Argentine, then the Pakistani would be on the left of the Argentine, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, the surfer must be Pakistani.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               | Pakistani | Pakistani |
| Nationality   | Argentine |           |
| Sport         |  Surfing  |  Tennis   |
