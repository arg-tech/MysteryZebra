Lv1-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the subway is on the right of the person driving the van.

This means the subway driver is to the right of the van driver.

2. The person driving the tram is on the left or right of the person driving the trike.

This clue doesn't give us a specific position, but it tells us the tram driver is adjacent to the trike driver.

3. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the tram.

This clue is similar to the previous one, telling us the trike driver is adjacent to the tram driver.

4. The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person driving the tram and the person driving the bike.

This means the subway driver is between the tram driver and the bike driver.

5. The person driving the tram is not to the left of the person driving the bike.

This means the tram driver is either to the right of the bike driver or in the same position.

6. The person driving the tram is not to the left of the person driving the van.

This clue is redundant, as we already know the tram driver is not to the left of the van driver (from clue 1).

7. The person driving the tram is between the person driving the subway and the person driving the trike.

This means the tram driver is between the subway driver and the trike driver.

Now, let's combine the clues and create a possible solution:

| Transport   |  1   |  2  |   3    |  4   |   5   |
|-------------|------|-----|--------|------|-------|
| Bike        |      |     |        |      |       |
| Subway      |      |     |        |      |       |
| Tram        |      |     |        |      |       |
| Trike       |      |     |        |      |       |
| Van         |      |     |        |      |       |

From clue 1, the subway driver is to the right of the van driver. From clue 4, the subway driver is between the tram driver and the bike driver. This means the order is: bike, tram, subway, van.

From clue 7, the tram driver is between the subway driver and the trike driver. This means the order is: bike, tram, subway, trike, van.

From clue 5, the tram driver is not to the left of the bike driver, so the tram driver must be to the right of the bike driver.

The final solution is:

Lv1-1x5-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks
This means that sudoku is to the left of magic-tricks.

2. The person who's hobby is traveling is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks
This means that traveling is either to the right of magic-tricks or in the middle.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is not to the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku
This means that traveling is either to the right of sudoku or in the middle.

4. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks
This clue is redundant, as we already know that sudoku is to the left of magic-tricks.

5. The person who's hobby is traveling is between the person who's hobby is singing and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks
This means that traveling is between singing and magic-tricks.

6. The person who's hobby is traveling is in the middle
This means that traveling is in the middle, which we already knew.

7. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is photography
This means that singing is either to the left or right of photography.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* Sudoku is to the left of magic-tricks
* Traveling is in the middle
* Traveling is between singing and magic-tricks
* Singing is either to the left or right of photography

We can conclude that the order is:

Sudoku, Traveling, Singing, Photography, Magic-tricks

5. The fan of techno is not to the left of the fan of house.

From clue 1, we know that house is to the left of techno.

From clue 2, we know that pop is between hip-hop and house. Since house is to the left of techno, pop must be to the left of techno as well.

From clue 3, we know that hip-hop is between ambient and techno. Since pop is to the left of techno, hip-hop must be to the left of pop.

From clue 4, we know that pop is to the left of house. We already know that pop is between hip-hop and house, so pop must be to the left of hip-hop.

From clue 5, we know that techno is not to the left of house. We already know that house is to the left of techno, so this clue doesn't add any new information.

Now, let's summarize what we know:

* House is to the left of techno.
* Pop is to the left of techno.
* Pop is to the left of hip-hop.

This means 7up is in the middle, so it can't be in the first or last position.

2. The person drinking cola is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
This means cola is in the third or fourth position.

3. The person drinking sprite is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
This means lemonade is in the second or third position, and sprite is in the fourth or fifth position.

4. The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
This means 7up is in the first or second position, and lemonade is in the third or fourth position.

From clue 1, we know the person watching satire movies is on the far right.

This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not in the middle.

2. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the person drinking lemonade is not in the middle.

3. The person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the person drinking lemonade.
This clue is redundant, as it's already established that the person drinking lemonade is not in the middle.

4. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far left or far right.
This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is either in the first or last position.

5. The person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the person drinking almond-milk.

6. The person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade.
This means that the person drinking fanta is either in the same position as the person drinking lemonade or to the right of them.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the first position, the person drinking almond-milk must be in the second position.

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking fanta is in the third or fourth position, the person drinking lemonade must be in the fourth or fifth position.
