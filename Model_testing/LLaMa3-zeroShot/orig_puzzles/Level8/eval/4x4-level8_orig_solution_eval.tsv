#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 5, we know the airplane driver is not to the right of themselves. This means the airplane driver must be in position 4.

Lv1-4x4-4	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 3, we know the musician eats plum.

From clue 4, we know the person eating banana is between the dancer and the electrician. Since the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball (clue 10), and the dancer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf (clue 12), we can deduce that the dancer is on the left of the electrician. Therefore, the person eating banana is between the dancer and the electrician.

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is basketball is not to the right of the person eating banana. Since the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball, and the person eating banana is between the dancer and the electrician, we can deduce that the electrician is on the left of the person eating banana.

From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the electrician, and the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the electrician.

From clue 14, we know the electrician is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the electrician is the person who's sport is basketball, and the person who's sport is golf is not yet determined, we can't make any further deductions.

From clue 6, we know the person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the Dutch.

From clue 13, we know the Dutch is somewhere to the right of the person drinking sprite.

From clue 12, we know the manager is not the Argentine.

From clue 10, we know the person driving the van is on the left or right of the manager.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Transport     |           |         |            |           |

After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Nationality   |  Argentine|  Dutch  |  Nigerian |  Thai     |
| Transport     |  Bus     |  Van    |  Scooter  |  Quad-Bike|
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* The Nigerian is driving the scooter (clue 5), and is somewhere to the right of the manager (clue 9).
* The manager is not the Argentine (clue 12), so the manager must be the Dutch.
* The person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea (clue 14), and is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water (clue 4). This means the person drinking tea is the Thai, and the person drinking water is the Argentine.
* The person drinking iced-tea is not to the right of the Dutch (clue 6), so the person drinking iced-tea must be the Nigerian.
* The person driving the bus is not to the left of the pilot (clue 2), and is not to the left of the person drinking water (clue 3). This means the person driving the bus is the Argentine.
* The person driving the van is on the left or right of the manager (clue 10), and since the manager is the Dutch, the person driving the van is either the Thai or the Nigerian. Since the Nigerian is already driving the scooter, the person driving the van must be the Thai.
* The musician is on the right of the freelancer (clue 11), and since the freelancer is not the Dutch (clue 12), the freelancer must be the Argentine.
* The person driving the quad-bike is the only one left, and must be the pilot.
