Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The nurse is on the left or right of the dancer##3
This means the nurse is either to the left or right of the dancer, but not in the middle.

2. The dancer is somewhere to the right of the nurse##5
This means the dancer is to the right of the nurse, but we already know the nurse is either to the left or right of the dancer, so this clue doesn't add much new information.

3. The dressmaker is not to the left of the entrepreneur##8
This means the dressmaker is either to the right of the entrepreneur or in the middle.

4. The dressmaker is on the left of the nurse
This means the dressmaker is to the left of the nurse, and since the nurse is either to the left or right of the dancer, the dressmaker must be to the left of the dancer as well.

Now, let's combine the clues and create a possible solution:

|       |      1       |     2      |   3   |   4    |
| Job   |              |            |       |        |

Dressmaker (1) | Dancer (2) | Nurse (3) | Entrepreneur (4)

This solution satisfies all the clues:

* The nurse is on the left or right of the dancer (1), and in this case, the nurse is to the right of the dancer.
* The dancer is somewhere to the right of the nurse (2), which is true in this solution.
* The dressmaker is not to the left of the entrepreneur (3), which is also true in this solution.
* The dressmaker is on the left of the nurse (4), which is true in this solution.

1. The person drinking 7up is not to the right of the person drinking mirinda.
This means that 7up must be on the left side of mirinda.

2. The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking mirinda and the person drinking milk.
This means that lemonade is to the right of mirinda and to the left of milk.

3. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
This is already implied by clue 2, but it's worth noting again.

4. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up.
This means that mirinda is to the right of 7up, which we already knew from clue 1.

This means that papaya cannot be in the first position, so it must be in either the second, third, or fourth position.

2. The person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating peach.
This means that apricot must be in the first or second position, and peach must be in the third or fourth position.

3. The person eating grapes is not to the left of the person eating peach.
This means that grapes cannot be in the first or second position, so it must be in the third or fourth position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Apricot must be in the first or second position.
* Papaya is somewhere to the right of grapes, so it can't be in the first position. Therefore, papaya must be in the third or fourth position.
* Grapes is not to the left of peach, so it can't be in the first or second position. Therefore, grapes must be in the third or fourth position.
* Peach must be in the third or fourth position, and apricot is on its left, so apricot must be in the second position.

Lv1-1x4-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is somewhere between the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's hobby is chess.

This means that woodworking cannot be in positions 1 or 4, as it would not be ""between"" baking and chess. It must be in positions 2 or 3.

2. The person who's hobby is woodworking is not to the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

This means that woodworking cannot be in position 4, as it would be to the right of rock-climbing. Therefore, woodworking must be in position 2 or 3.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in an odd position.

This means that rock-climbing cannot be in positions 2 or 4, as they are even numbers. Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 1 or 3.

4. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is baking.

This means that rock-climbing cannot be in position 3, as it would be to the right of baking. Therefore, rock-climbing must be in position 1.

This means that rowing and weightlifting are adjacent to each other.

2. The person who's sport is rowing is not to the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting##8
This means that rowing is to the left of weightlifting.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is biathlon##5
This means that weightlifting is to the left of biathlon.

4. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing
This means that cycling is to the left of rowing.

Now, let's combine the information:

|         |    1    |   2    |       3       |    4     |

From clue 4, we know that cycling is to the left of rowing. From clue 2, we know that rowing is to the left of weightlifting. From clue 3, we know that weightlifting is to the left of biathlon. Therefore, the order is:

cycling -> rowing -> weightlifting -> biathlon

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-1x4-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating pineapple is in an odd position (4).
This means the person eating pineapple is either in position 1, 3, or 4.

2. The person eating asparagus is in an odd position (4).
This means the person eating asparagus is either in position 1, 3, or 4.

3. The person eating asparagus is not to the left of the person eating nectarine.
This means the person eating asparagus cannot be in position 1, because then the person eating nectarine would be in position 2, and the person eating asparagus would be to the left of the person eating nectarine.

Combining the above, we can conclude that the person eating asparagus is in position 3 or 4.

4. The person eating asparagus is the person eating asparagus.
This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|        |     1     |     2     |     3     |   4   |
| Food   |           |           |           |       |

Since the person eating asparagus is in position 3 or 4, and the person eating pineapple is in an odd position (4), we can place the foods as follows:

|        |     1     |     2     |     3     |   4   |
| Food   |           |           | Asparagus | Pineapple |

This means that the gardening person is either in position 3 or 4, and the chess person is in position 1 or 2.

2. The person who's hobby is card-games is not to the right of the person who's hobby is writing.

This means that the card-games person cannot be in position 4, since that would put them to the right of the writing person.

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess.

This means that the card-games person is either in position 2 or 3, since they cannot be in position 1 (since that would put them to the left of the chess person).

4. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is writing.

This means that the card-games person is either in position 1 or 2, since they cannot be in position 4 (since that would put them to the right of the writing person).

Now, let's combine the information:

* The gardening person is on the right of the chess person, so they must be in position 3 or 4.
* The card-games person is to the right of the chess person, so they must be in position 2 or 3.

Lv1-1x4-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of R&B is on the left of the fan of Techno.
2. The fan of R&B is between the fan of Indie and the fan of Techno.

From clue 1, we know R&B is to the left of Techno. From clue 2, we know R&B is between Indie and Techno. This means Indie must be to the left of R&B, and Techno must be to the right of R&B.

3. The fan of Techno is not to the right of the fan of Disco.

This clue doesn't provide any new information, but it confirms that Techno is not to the right of Disco.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Music-Genre   |       |     |        |       |

From clue 1, R&B is to the left of Techno, so R&B must be in position 1 or 2. From clue 2, Indie is to the left of R&B, so Indie must be in position 1. This leaves R&B in position 2.

|               |   1   |  2  |   3    |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | R&B |        |       |

From clue 3, Techno is not to the right of Disco, but we don't know where Disco is yet. Since Techno is to the right of R&B, it must be in position 3 or 4. Let's try to place Disco in position 4, which would make Techno in position 3.

|               |   1   |  2  |   3    |   4   |
| Music-Genre   | Indie | R&B |        | Disco |

This leaves only one possibility for the last position: Techno must be in position 4.

Lv1-1x4-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The bartender is between the doctor and the security-guard: This means the bartender is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.
2. The bartender is not to the left of the doctor: This means the doctor is not in the 1st position. Since the bartender is between the doctor and the security-guard, the doctor must be in the 3rd or 4th position.
3. The musician is somewhere to the right of the security-guard: This means the musician is in the 3rd or 4th position.

From clue 1, we know the bartender is in the 2nd or 3rd position. From clue 2, we know the doctor is not in the 1st position, so the doctor must be in the 3rd or 4th position. From clue 3, we know the musician is in the 3rd or 4th position.

Now, let's combine the information:

| Job   |        |           |                |          |

Since the bartender is between the doctor and the security-guard, and the doctor is not in the 1st position, the bartender must be in the 2nd position. The security-guard must be in the 1st position.

| Job   | Security-guard | Bartender | Doctor/Musician | Doctor/Musician |

Now, we can determine the remaining jobs. The musician is somewhere to the right of the security-guard, so the musician must be in the 3rd or 4th position. Since the doctor is not in the 1st position, the doctor must be in the 3rd or 4th position. We can't determine which one is the doctor and which one is the musician, but we can conclude that the doctor and musician are in the 3rd and 4th positions.

This means the writer is either on the right of the police-officer or on the right of the architect (since the architect is between the police-officer and the doctor).

3. The police-officer is not to the left of the architect.
This means the police-officer is either on the right of the architect or on the right of the doctor.

4. The writer is somewhere to the right of the architect.
This means the writer is either on the right of the architect or on the right of the doctor.

Now, let's combine the clues:
