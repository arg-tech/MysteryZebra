Lv1-5x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right.
This means the last column is occupied by the person who plays lacrosse.

2. The paramedic is on the left or right of the owner of the horse.
This means the paramedic is either in the first or last column, and the owner of the horse is in one of the two adjacent columns.

3. The person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the person eating banana.
This means the person eating banana is in the middle, and the person eating cucumber is either in the first or last column.

4. The person who's sport is volleyball is not to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.
This means the person who plays volleyball is either in the first column or in the middle, since the person who plays lacrosse is already in the last column.

5. The person eating banana is on the right of the paramedic.
This means the paramedic is in the first column, and the person eating banana is in the second column.

6. The person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left.

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest constraints.

From constraint 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This means that the person who's hobby is baking must be in the leftmost column.

From constraint 2, we know that the fan of pop is on the far right. This means that the person who prefers pop music must be in the rightmost column.

From constraint 3, we know that the fan of pop is not to the right of the owner of the pony. This means that the owner of the pony must be in the column to the left of the person who prefers pop music.

From constraint 4, we know that the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that the person who watches romance movies must be in the column to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

Now, let's try to fill in the remaining cells. We know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left, so the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be in the rightmost column. We also know that the fan of pop is on the far right, so the person who prefers pop music must be in the rightmost column.

Here's the current state of the table:

 
|               |    1     |     2      |
| Hobby         |  Baking  |  Filmmaking|
| Movie-Genre   |          |            |
| Music-Genre   |          |  Pop      |
| Pet           |          |  Pony     |
| Sport         |          |  Soccer   |

We still need to fill in the movie-genre, music-genre, and pet columns. We can use the remaining constraints to do this.

From constraint 1, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This means that the person who's hobby is baking must prefer family movies.

From constraint 4, we know that the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. This means that the person who watches romance movies must be in the column to the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the person who's hobby is baking prefers family movies, the person who watches romance movies must be in the column to the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. This means that the person who watches romance movies must be in the leftmost column.

From constraint 2, we know that the people prefer 2 different movie-genres: family, romance. Since the person who's hobby is baking prefers family movies, the person who watches romance movies must prefer romance movies.

From constraint 3, we know that the fan of pop is not to the right of the owner of the pony. This means that the owner of the pony must be in the column to the left of the person who prefers pop music. Since the person who prefers pop music is in the rightmost column, the owner of the pony must be in the second column.

From constraint 2, we know that the people prefer 2 different music-genres: dubstep, pop. Since the person who prefers pop music is in the rightmost column, the person who prefers dubstep music must be in the leftmost column.

From constraint 2, we know that the people prefer 2 different pets: goat, pony. Since the owner of the pony is in the second column, the owner of the goat must be in the leftmost column.

Here's the final solution:

4. The fan of soul is not to the left of the person driving the van.
This means that the person who likes soul music is either to the right of the person driving the van or in the same position.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |

| Music-Genre   |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of soul is the person eating pineapple. Let's assume the person eating pineapple is in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

From clue 2, we know that the fan of reggae is on the right of the person watching action movies. Let's assume the person watching action movies is in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple |            |
| Hobby         |           |            |

| Music-Genre   | Soul      | Reggae    |
| Transport     |           |            |

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the van is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Let's assume the person with the hobby card-games is in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple |            |
| Hobby         | Card-Games |            |
| Movie-Genre   |           | Action    |
| Music-Genre   | Soul      | Reggae    |
| Transport     | Van       |            |

From clue 4, we know that the fan of soul is not to the left of the person driving the van. Since the person driving the van is already in position 2, the fan of soul must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          | Pineapple |            |

| Movie-Genre   |           | Action    |
