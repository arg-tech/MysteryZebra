Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person watching crime movies is the person watching crime movies (no new information).

From statement 2, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Let's assume the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person watching action movies (we can try the other way later).

From statement 3, we know that the person watching crime movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching sports movies. Since we don't know the exact position of the person watching sports movies yet, we'll come back to this statement later.

From statement 4, we know that the person watching action movies is not to the left of the person watching time-travel movies. This means that the person watching action movies must be to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

From statement 5, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the far left or far right. Since we already assumed they're on the left of the person watching action movies, they must be on the far left.

From statement 6, we know that the person watching action movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. This means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be to the left of the person watching action movies.

From statement 7, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is between the person watching action movies and the person watching time-travel movies. This means that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching action movies and to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

From statement 8, we know that the person watching crime movies is on the left or right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since we already know the person watching crime movies is to the right of the person watching sports movies (statement 3), they must be on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

Now, let's try to fit the people into the table:

Lv1-1x6-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 4, we know the person drinking water is on the far right.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking water is on the right of the person drinking sprite. This means sprite cannot be on the far right, so it must be in one of the leftmost positions.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since sprite is not on the far right, iced-tea must be on the far right.

From statement 1, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since iced-tea is on the far right, cola must be in the second-to-last position.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking mirinda is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since cola is in the second-to-last position, mirinda must be in the third position from the left.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking mirinda. Since mirinda is in the third position, almond-milk must be in the second position from the left.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda. Since almond-milk is in the second position, mirinda must be in the third position, and they are adjacent.

The only remaining beverage is sprite, which must be in the first position.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-1x6-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The architect is on the right of the videographer
This means the videographer is on the left of the architect.

2. The mechanic is on the far left or far right
This means the mechanic is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position.

3. The mechanic is on the right of the analyst
This means the analyst is on the left of the mechanic.

4. The manager is on the left of the videographer
This means the manager is on the left of the architect (since the videographer is on the left of the architect).

5. The architect is not to the right of the project-manager
This means the project-manager is either on the left of the architect or on the right of the architect.

6. The analyst is somewhere to the right of the videographer
This means the analyst is either on the right of the videographer or on the right of the architect (since the videographer is on the left of the architect).

Now, let's combine the information:

* The videographer is on the left of the architect.
* The mechanic is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position.
* The analyst is on the left of the mechanic.
* The manager is on the left of the architect.
* The project-manager is either on the left of the architect or on the right of the architect.

With these constraints, we can start filling in the table:

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   |         |              |           | project-        |         |          |

From clue 2, we know the mechanic is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position. Let's assume the mechanic is on the leftmost position for now.

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   | Mechanic|              |           | project-        |         |          |

From clue 3, we know the analyst is on the left of the mechanic.

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   | Mechanic| Analyst    |           | project-        |         |          |

From clue 1, we know the architect is on the right of the videographer. Since the videographer is on the left of the architect, the architect must be in position 5 or 6.

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   | Mechanic| Analyst    |           | project-        | Architect| Videographer|

From clue 4, we know the manager is on the left of the videographer. Since the videographer is on the left of the architect, the manager must be in position 1 or 2.

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     |        4        |    5    |    6     |
| Job   | Mechanic| Manager    |           | project-        | Architect| Videographer|

From clue 5, we know the project-manager is either on the left of the architect or on the right of the architect. Since the architect is in position 5 or 6, the project-manager must be in position 4.

|       |    1    |      2       |     3     | project-manager| Architect| Videographer|

Finally, from clue 6, we know the analyst is somewhere to the right of the videographer. Since the videographer is on the left of the architect, the analyst must be in position 3.

|       |    1    |      2       | Analyst  | project-manager| Architect| Videographer|

Now we have the final solution:

#############
|       |    1    |      2       | Analyst  | project-manager| Architect| Videographer|
| Job   | Mechanic| Manager    |          |                |          |          |
#############

The final solution is:

Mechanic (1)
Manager (2)
Analyst (3)
project-manager (4)
Architect (5)
Videographer (6)"	{'job': ['mechanic', 'manager', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
Lv1-1x6-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Nigerian is on the left of the American.
This means the order is: Nigerian, American,???

2. The American is somewhere to the left of the Egyptian.
This means the order is: Nigerian, American, Egyptian,???

3. The Italian is somewhere between the Polish and the American.
This means the order is: Nigerian, American, Egyptian, Polish, Italian,???

4. The Canadian is on the right of the Italian.
This means the order is: Nigerian, American, Egyptian, Polish, Italian, Canadian

5. The Polish is on the left of the Italian.
This means the order is: Nigerian, American, Egyptian, Polish, Italian, Canadian

6. The Canadian is not to the left of the Canadian.
This is a redundant clue, as it's impossible for the Canadian to be to the left of itself.

Now that we have all the clues, we can fill in the table:
