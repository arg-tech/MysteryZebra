Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clues 2 and 4, we can deduce that the mexican is not to the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, and the thai is not the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This means the thai is to the left of the mexican.

This means the japanese is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. From clues 15 and 25, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is chess is not to the left of the person driving the bike, and the person drinking milk is not to the left of the police-officer. This means the person who's hobby is chess is to the right of the person drinking milk.

From clues 16 and 21, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is hiking is not to the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse, and the person who's hobby is gardening is not to the right of the police-officer. This means the person who's hobby is hiking is to the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.

6. From clues 28 and 34, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the russian, and the scientist is not to the left of the person drinking water. This means the russian is to the left of the person who's hobby is traveling.
7. From clues 30 and 41, we can deduce that the british is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is reading, and the person driving the skateboard is not to the left of the thai. This means the british is to the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
8. From clues 32 and 53, we can deduce that the person who's sport is cycling is not the person drinking almond-milk, and the person who's sport is cycling is not to the left of the person driving the bike. This means the person who's sport is cycling is to the right of the person driving the bike.
9. From clues 36 and 62, we can deduce that the person who's sport is biathlon is the coach, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is somewhere between the person drinking water and the person drinking lemonade. This means the person who's sport is ice-hockey is in position 6.
10. From clues 38 and 46, we can deduce that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon, and the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. This means the person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 2.
