#############
|            |     1      |      2       |      3      |     4     |     5     |
| Beverage   |            |              |             |           |           |
| Food       |            |              |             |           |           |
| Job        |            |              |             |           |           |
| Pet        |            |              |             |           |           |

| Beverage   | Soy-milk  | Iced-tea    | Lemonade   | Cola      | Sprite   |
| Food       | Blueberry | Apple      | Cranberry | Lime      | Plum     |

| Pet        | Guinea-pig| Ferret     | Frog      | Cat       | Turtle   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the person drinking soy-milk is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means soy-milk must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 10, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is the person eating blueberry. Since the guinea-pig is not the owner of the ferret (clue 3), the guinea-pig must be in position 2 or 5.
* From clue 14, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret is not the owner of the guinea-pig, the ferret must be in position 3 or 4.
* From clue 16, we know the person eating cranberry is not to the left of the owner of the ferret. This means cranberry must be in position 2 or 5.
* From clue 18, we know the owner of the cat is on the right of the paramedic. Since the cat is on the far right (clue 7), the paramedic must be in position 3 or 4.
* From clue 20, we know the electrician is somewhere to the right of the videographer. Since the videographer is not the owner of the cat (clue 7), the videographer must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 22, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the guinea-pig is in position 2 or 5, the videographer must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 23, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere to the left of the librarian. Since the librarian is in position 3 or 4, cola must be in position 1 or 2.
* From clue 25, we know the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the pilot. Since the pilot is in an odd position (clue 6), iced-tea must be in position 2 or 4.

By combining these constraints, we can deduce the final solution table."
Lv1-4x5-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
|               |      1      |     2     |      3      |     4      |    5     |

3. From statement 4, we know the person eating eggplant is to the right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in position 1 (statement 14), the person eating eggplant must be in position 2 or 4.

5. From statement 15, we know the person eating pumpkin is not to the left of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is not in position 1 (statement 16), the person eating pumpkin must be in position 3.
6. From statement 22, we know the person eating eggplant is between the owner of the bird and the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the bird is not in position 1 (statement 16), the owner of the bird must be in position 2. The owner of the rat must be in position 4 or 5, and the owner of the horse must be in position 3.
7. From statement 12, we know the owner of the fish is to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is not in position 1 (statement 11), the owner of the fish must be in position 5.
8. From statement 25, we know the person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the person eating pumpkin is in position 3, the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 2 or 4. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is climbing is not to the left of the person eating nectarine, so the person who's sport is climbing must be in position 4.
9. From statement 26, we know the person who's sport is sailing is not the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is not in position 1 (statement 11), the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 3.

Since the fan of rock is on the right of the fan of ambient (statement 9), and the fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of rock (statement 9), the fan of rock must be on the far right.

Since the person eating artichoke is somewhere to the left of the person watching scientific movies (statement 17), and the person watching scientific movies is not to the left of the person eating cucumber (statement 16), the person eating artichoke must be on the far left.
5. From statement 20, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke. Since the person eating artichoke is on the far left, the person watching scientific movies must be on the far left as well.
6. From statement 22, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating artichoke. Since the person eating artichoke is on the far left, the person eating pomegranate must be on the far left as well.

9. From statement 18, we know the person drinking fanta is not to the left of the person drinking fanta. This statement is redundant, but it helps to confirm the placement of the person drinking fanta.
10. From statement 14, we know the person drinking fanta is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is on the far right, the person drinking fanta must be on the far left.
