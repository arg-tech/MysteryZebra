From clue 5, we know the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the Thai is watching adventure movies, the person watching zombie movies must be to the left of the Thai.

From clue 4, we know the Argentine is to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is to the left of the Thai, the Argentine must be on the far left.

From clue 7, we know the Argentine is on the far left or far right. Since the Argentine is already placed on the far left, it must be on the far left.

From clue 9, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Since the Thai is watching adventure movies, the person watching disaster movies must be to the right of the Thai.

Lv1-2x5-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The architect is not to the right of the fan of indie.
This means the architect is either to the left of the fan of indie or in the same position.

2. The fan of dubstep is on the left or right of the fan of folk.
This means the fan of dubstep is either to the left of the firefighter (since the firefighter is the fan of folk) or to the right of the firefighter.

3. The firefighter is between the fan of house and the musician.
This means the firefighter is to the left of the fan of house and to the right of the musician.

4. The firefighter is the fan of folk.
This confirms that the firefighter is indeed the fan of folk.

5. The police-officer is in the middle.
This means the police-officer is in position 3.

6. The architect is on the left of the fan of classical.
This means the architect is in position 1 or 2.

7. The architect is not to the left of the police-officer.
This means the architect is either in position 3 or 4.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The firefighter is the fan of folk and is in position 2.
* The police-officer is in position 3.
* The architect is either in position 1 or 4.
* The fan of dubstep is either to the left or right of the firefighter, so it's either in position 1 or 5.
* The musician is to the right of the firefighter, so it's in position 5.

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Job           | Music-Genre   |
| Architect     | Classical    |
| Firefighter  | Folk         |
| Police-Officer|             |
| Musician      | Indie        |
| Mechanic      | House        |
#############

Note that the fan of dubstep is not explicitly mentioned, but it's implied to be in position 1 or 5. If we assume it's in position 1, the solution would be:

#############
| Job           | Music-Genre   |
| Fan of Dubstep| Dubstep      |
| Architect     | Classical    |
| Firefighter  | Folk         |
| Police-Officer|             |
| Musician      | Indie        |

From statement 5, we know the owner of the frog is to the left of the argentine. Since the polish is already taken, let's assume the argentine is with the german.

* The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the paramedic, so the paramedic cannot be the person watching romance movies.
* The freelancer is on the right of the person watching romance movies, so the freelancer cannot be the person watching romance movies.

* The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, so the person watching disaster movies must be the doctor.
* The person watching family movies is on the left or right of the designer, so the person watching family movies must be the freelancer.

8. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the Turkish.
9. The owner of the snake is not the Thai.
10. The owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the Thai.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the snake is in the middle. Let's call this position ""M"".

From statement 2, we know the Turkish is to the left of the owner of the horse. Let's call the owner of the horse ""H"". Then, the Turkish is to the left of H.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the German. Let's call the German ""G"". Then, the owner of the hedgehog is either to the left or right of G.

From statement 4, we know the Brazilian is to the right of the French. Let's call the French ""F"". Then, the Brazilian is to the right of F.

From statement 5, we know the Turkish is to the right of the owner of the bird. Let's call the owner of the bird ""B"". Then, the Turkish is to the right of B.

From statement 6, we know the Thai is on the far left or far right. Since the Turkish is to the left of H, the Thai cannot be on the far left. Therefore, the Thai must be on the far right.

From statement 7, we know the French is in an odd position. Since the Brazilian is to the right of F, F must be in an even position.

From statement 8, we know the owner of the snake is to the left of the Turkish. Since the owner of the snake is in the middle, the Turkish must be in the right half of the table.

From statement 9, we know the owner of the snake is not the Thai. Since the Thai is on the far right, the owner of the snake cannot be in the rightmost position.

From statement 10, we know the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the Thai. Since the Thai is on the far right, the owner of the hedgehog cannot be in the rightmost position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The Turkish is to the left of H.
* The German is to the left or right of the owner of the hedgehog.
* The Brazilian is to the right of F.
