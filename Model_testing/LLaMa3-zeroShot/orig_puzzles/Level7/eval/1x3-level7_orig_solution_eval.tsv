Lv1-1x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies.

This means that the person watching animation movies is either to the left or to the right of the person watching romance movies, and to the left or to the right of the person watching zombie movies.

2. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.

This means that the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person watching animation movies.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |    1    |     2     |   3    |
| Movie-Genre   |         |           |        |

From clue 2, we know that the person watching romance movies is to the left of the person watching animation movies. So, we can place the romance movies in position 1:

|               | Romance |         |        |
| Movie-Genre   |    1    |           |        |

From clue 1, we know that the person watching animation movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching romance movies is already in position 1, the person watching animation movies must be in position 2:

|               | Romance | Animation |        |
| Movie-Genre   |    1    |     2     |        |

Lv1-1x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating nectarine is somewhere between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus.
2. The person eating peas is on the far right.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating peas is on the far right, so the table looks like this:

|        |     1     |     2     |  3   |
| Food   |           |           | peas |

From clue 1, we know that the person eating nectarine is between the person eating peas and the person eating asparagus. Since the person eating peas is on the far right, the person eating nectarine must be in the middle. Therefore, the table looks like this:

|        |     1     | nectarine |  3   |
| Food   |           |           | peas |

Now, we just need to figure out who is eating asparagus. Since asparagus is not eating nectarine or peas, it must be eating the food on the left. Therefore, the final solution is:

#############
|        |     1     | nectarine |  3   |
| Food   | asparagus |           | peas |
#############

The final solution is that the person eating asparagus is on the left, the person eating nectarine is in the middle, and the person eating peas is on the far right."	{'food': ['asparagus', '', 'peas']}	True	2	False
Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water.

This means that the order is either: hot-chocolate, mirinda, water or hot-chocolate, water, mirinda

2. The person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

This means that the person drinking water cannot be to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the order is: water, hot-chocolate, mirinda

3. The person drinking mirinda is somewhere between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person drinking water.

This clue is redundant, as we already know the order from clue 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

2. The fan of soul is somewhere between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of d&b is to the right of the fan of soul. This means that the fan of soul cannot be in the first position.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul is between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae. This means that the fan of reggae must be in the last position.

Since the fan of reggae is in the last position, we can start by placing it there:

|               |   1    |  2   |  3  |
| Music-Genre   |        |      | Reggae |

Now, we know that the fan of soul is between the fan of d&b and the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is already in the last position, the fan of soul must be in the second position:
