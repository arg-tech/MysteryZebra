Lv1-1x7-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of techno is in the middle.
2. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno.
3. The fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the fan of techno.
4. The fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient.
5. The fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of reggae.
6. The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of classical.

From clue 1, we know the fan of techno is in the middle. Let's assume the middle position is 4.

From clue 2, we know the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is in the middle, the fan of ambient must be either on the left (1) or right (5) of the fan of techno.

From clue 6, we know the fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of classical. This means the fan of classical must be in position 3 or 5.

From clue 4, we know the fan of classical is somewhere to the right of the fan of ambient. Since the fan of ambient is either in position 1 or 5, the fan of classical must be in position 3.

Now, let's consider the fan of dubstep. From clue 3, we know the fan of dubstep is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the fan of techno. Since the fan of techno is in position 4, the fan of dubstep must be in position 3 or 5.

From clue 5, we know the fan of r&b is on the left of the fan of reggae. This means the fan of r&b must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 2, we know the fan of ambient is on the left or right of the fan of techno. Since the fan of ambient is already in position 1, it must be on the right of the fan of techno. This means the fan of techno is in position 5.

Now, we can fill in the remaining positions:

From statement 1, we know the person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Let's assume the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the car. This is just an assumption, and we'll come back to it later.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car. Since we assumed the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the car, the person driving the scooter must be to the right of the person driving the helicopter.

From statement 3, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. This means the person driving the trike is to the right of the person driving the scooter (since the scooter is to the right of the car).

From statement 4, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the subway. This means the person driving the quad-bike is to the right of the person driving the trike (since the trike is to the right of the scooter).

From statement 5, we know the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the person driving the car. Since we assumed the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the car, the person driving the trike must be on the left of the person driving the car.

From statement 6, we know the person driving the subway is on the far left or far right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the trike is on the left of the person driving the car, the person driving the subway must be on the far left.

From statement 7, we know the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person driving the trike. This means the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person driving the car.

From statement 8, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the scooter is to the right of the car, the skateboard must be to the left of the car.

From statement 9, we know the person driving the car is somewhere between the person driving the trike and the person driving the helicopter. Since we assumed the person driving the helicopter is on the right of the person driving the car, the person driving the car must be between the person driving the trike and the person driving the helicopter.

From statement 10, we know the person driving the skateboard is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is to the left of the car, the skateboard must be to the right of the car.

From clue 6, we know the mechanic is to the left of the firefighter, so the mechanic cannot be in position 5 or 6.

From clue 7, we know the security-guard is on the far left or far right, so it must be in position 1 or 7.

From clue 8, we know the police-officer is on the right of the writer, so the police-officer cannot be in position 1.

From clue 9, we know the mechanic is to the left of the writer, so the mechanic cannot be in position 5 or 6.

From clue 10, we know the security-guard is on the left or right of the designer, so the security-guard cannot be in position 2 or 4.

From clue 11, we know the police-officer is on the left or right of the firefighter, so the police-officer cannot be in position 5 or 6.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The police-officer is in position 3.
* The mechanic is in position 2.
* The security-guard is in position 1 or 7.
* The writer is to the right of the mechanic.
* The designer is to the left of the mechanic.
* The scientist is to the right of the mechanic.
* The firefighter is to the right of the police-officer.

4. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the Mexican.
5. The Japanese is on the right of the British.
6. The Canadian is on the left of the Egyptian.
7. The Mexican is on the right of the Japanese.
8. The British is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.
9. The Polish is somewhere to the left of the Japanese.
10. The British is somewhere to the right of the Polish.

From clue 1, we know the British is to the left of the Japanese. From clue 5, we know the Japanese is to the right of the British. This means the British and Japanese are adjacent.

From clue 2, we know the British is to the right of the Canadian. This means the Canadian is to the left of the British.
