Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Indian is a fan of gospel.
2. The person eating tomato is between the person eating kiwi and the Australian.
3. The Australian is to the left of the fan of gospel.
4. The Dutch is a fan of electronic.
5. The fan of electronic is to the right of the fan of gospel.

From statement 1, we know the Indian is a fan of gospel.

From statement 3, we know the Australian is to the left of the fan of gospel, so the Australian cannot be the fan of gospel.

From statement 2, we know the person eating tomato is between the person eating kiwi and the Australian. This means the person eating kiwi must be to the left of the person eating tomato, and the Australian must be to the right of the person eating tomato.

From statement 4, we know the Dutch is a fan of electronic.

From statement 5, we know the fan of electronic is to the right of the fan of gospel. Since the Indian is already known to be a fan of gospel, the fan of electronic must be the Dutch.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 3, we know the person drinking sprite is on the left of the fan of electronic. Since the fan of house is in the second column, the person drinking sprite must be in the third column.

From clue 4, we know the person driving the subway is the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is not in the first column (fan of soul), it must be in the second column.

From clue 5, we know the fan of electronic is somewhere between the person driving the helicopter and the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is in the second column, the fan of electronic must be in the third column.

2. The fan of rock is on the far right.
This means that the rock fan is in the 3rd column.

3. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the designer.
This means that the mirinda drinker is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the designer is in the 2nd or 3rd column.

4. The scientist is somewhere between the fan of rock and the fan of d&b.
This means that the scientist is in the 2nd column, as the rock fan is on the far right and the d&b fan is somewhere to the left of the scientist.

Now, let's combine the information:

From clue 1, the juice drinker is in the 1st or 2nd column. From clue 3, the mirinda drinker is also in the 1st or 2nd column. Since there are only 3 beverage options, the 3rd column must be 7up.

From clue 4, the scientist is in the 2nd column. The designer is either in the 1st or 2nd column, but since the mirinda drinker is in the 1st or 2nd column, the designer must be in the 2nd column as well.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
7. The person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person driving the bike.

From statement 1, we know the police-officer is to the right of the doctor. From statement 2, we know the doctor is to the right of the entrepreneur. Therefore, the order is: entrepreneur, doctor, police-officer.

From statement 3, we know the person driving the bus is on the far right. Since the police-officer is already on the right, the bus driver must be the police-officer.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike. Since the trike driver is not the bus driver (statement 3), the trike driver must be the entrepreneur.

From statement 5, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since the entrepreneur is already on the right (statement 4), the iced-tea drinker must be on the far left.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water. Since the iced-tea drinker is on the far left, the water drinker must be on the far left as well.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere between the person driving the bus and the person driving the bike. Since the bus driver is the police-officer, and the trike driver is the entrepreneur, the hot-chocolate drinker must be the doctor.

This means that the person watching thriller movies cannot be in the middle.

This means that the Russian cannot be on the left of the person drinking soy-milk, as they would be on the right of the Australian, which is not possible.

3. The person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching western movies.
This means that the person drinking milk cannot be in the middle.

4. The person watching thriller movies is the Russian.
This means that the Russian is watching thriller movies.
