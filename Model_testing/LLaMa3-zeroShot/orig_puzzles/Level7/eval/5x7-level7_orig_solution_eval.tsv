#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the dancer is not watching scientific movies, so the dancer must be watching a different genre.
2. From statement 4, we know the person watching animation movies is in an even position. Since there are only 7 positions, the person watching animation movies must be in position 2 or 4.
3. From statement 13, we know the person watching animation movies is to the left of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in an even position, the person watching scientific movies must be in an odd position.
4. From statement 42, we know the person drinking almond-milk is watching scientific movies. Therefore, the person drinking almond-milk must be in an odd position.

9. From statement 29, we know the electrician is on the left or right of the designer. Since the designer is in position 2, the electrician must be in position 1 or 3.
10. From statement 31, we know the electrician is on the right of the spanish. Since the electrician is in position 1 or 3, the spanish must be in position 2 or 4.
11. From statement 34, we know the architect is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the architect is in an even position (statement 18), the owner of the chinchilla must be in an odd position.
12. From statement 37, we know the architect is to the right of the german. Since the architect is in an even position, the german must be in an odd position.
13. From statement 38, we know the person watching spy movies is to the right of the chinese. Since the chinese is in position 6, the person watching spy movies must be in position 7.
14. From statement 39, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is watching documentary movies. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is the malaysian, the malaysian must be watching documentary movies.
