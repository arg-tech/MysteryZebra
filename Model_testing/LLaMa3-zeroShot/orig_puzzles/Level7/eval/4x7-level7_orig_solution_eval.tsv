Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 15, we know the owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the motorbike.
2. From clue 20, we know the person drinking water is the person driving the train.
3. From clue 22, we know the owner of the turtle is the person driving the ship.
4. From clue 23, we know the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat.
5. From clue 24, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
6. From clue 25, we know the person driving the bike is somewhere to the right of the person drinking water.
7. From clue 26, we know the person drinking soy-milk is not the owner of the hedgehog.
8. From clue 27, we know the person drinking juice is on the right of the person driving the van.
9. From clue 29, we know the person drinking water is not the person driving the van.

Using these clues, we can start filling in the table. We can start with the person drinking soy-milk, who is not the owner of the hedgehog. This means the owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the motorbike (clue 15). The person drinking soy-milk is likely to be on the right of the owner of the hedgehog, so we can place them in position 5.

Next, we can look at the person drinking iced-tea, who is on the right of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person watching epic movies (clue 18), we can place the owner of the snake in position 6. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the owner of the snake, so we can place them in position 7.

From here, we can start filling in the rest of the table using the remaining clues. We can use the fact that the owner of the turtle is the person driving the ship (clue 22) to place the turtle in position 4. We can use the fact that the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the boat (clue 23) to place the person watching horror movies in position 3.

The rest of the table can be filled in using the remaining clues. The final solution is shown above."	{'snake': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'turtle': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'bike': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'boat': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'motorbike': ['', '', '', 'motor', '', '', ''], 'ship': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'skateboard': ['', '', '', '', '', '', ''], 'train': ['', '', '', '', '', '', '']}	False	0	False

From statement 9, we know the person driving the scooter is not the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. From statement 10, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is somewhere between the person driving the subway and the person driving the roller.

2. From statement 5, we know the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. From statement 1, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter.

5. From statement 25, we know the person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the train. From statement 29, we know the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the right of the person driving the scooter. This means the person drinking soy-milk must be the person who's hobby is photography.
6. From statement 31, we know the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. From statement 35, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk. This means the person drinking 7up must be the person who's hobby is traveling.
7. From statement 24, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is photography. From statement 27, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is somewhere to the left of the person watching sports movies.

8. From statement 33, we know the person watching spy movies is in an odd position. From statement 12, we know the person watching spy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. This means the person watching spy movies must be in the middle.
