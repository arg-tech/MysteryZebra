Lv1-4x5-4	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. From clue 1, we know that the fan of dubstep is between the fan of jazz and the person watching western movies. This means that the fan of jazz is on the right of the fan of dubstep.

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is cricket. From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. This means that the person drinking sprite (cricket) is not on the same side as the person watching western movies.

From clue 10, we know that the fan of gospel is in an even position. From clue 14, we know that the person watching western movies is in an odd position. This means that the fan of gospel cannot be the person watching western movies.

From clue 15, we know that the person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the far left or far right. This means that the person drinking milk is either on the far left or on the far right.

From clue 16, we know that the person drinking tea is somewhere to the left of the fan of gospel. From clue 3, we know that the person drinking tea is somewhere between the person who's sport is lacrosse and the person watching thriller movies. This means that the person drinking tea is on the left of the fan of gospel.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |    1    |       2       |    3     |    4     |    5     |

From the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

* The fan of dubstep is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so the fan of dubstep is in position 1.

* The fan of gospel is in an even position, so the fan of gospel is in position 2.
* The person watching thriller movies is the fan of gospel, so the person watching thriller movies is in position 2.
* The person drinking sprite (cricket) is in position 5.
* The person drinking milk is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling, so the person drinking milk is in position 1.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since the person who's sport is cycling is already in position 1, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be in position 3.

From clue 12, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the person who's sport is cycling is already in position 1, the person who's sport is sailing must be in position 5.
