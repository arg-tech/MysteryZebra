Lv1-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the rat is somewhere between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the ferret.
This means that the owner of the rat is either to the left of the person watching drama movies or to the right of the owner of the ferret.

2. The owner of the bird is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret.
This means that the owner of the bird is either to the right of the owner of the ferret or in the same position as the owner of the ferret.

3. The person watching mystery movies is somewhere to the right of the owner of the ferret.
This means that the person watching mystery movies is either to the right of the owner of the ferret or in the same position as the owner of the ferret.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The owner of the rat is between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the ferret.
* The owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the ferret.
* The person watching mystery movies is to the right of the owner of the ferret.

We can create a possible arrangement:

| Movie-Genre   |         |         |       |

* The owner of the rat is between the person watching drama movies and the owner of the ferret.
* The owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the ferret.
* The person watching mystery movies is to the right of the owner of the ferret.

Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the subway is in an odd position.
This means the subway driver is in either the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The fan of country is somewhere between the fan of reggae and the person driving the tram.
This means the country fan is in either the 2nd or 3rd position.

3. The person driving the subway is on the far right.
This means the subway driver is in the 3rd position.

Now, let's combine the information:

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            |         |        |
| Transport     |            |         |        |

From clue 3, we know the subway driver is in the 3rd position. From clue 1, we know the subway driver is in an odd position, so they must be in the 1st position.

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            |         |        |
| Transport     | Subway    |         |        |

From clue 2, we know the country fan is between the reggae fan and the tram driver. Since the subway driver is in the 1st position, the country fan must be in the 2nd position.

|               |     1      |    2    |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |            | Country |        |
| Transport     | Subway    | Tram    |        |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

* The reggae fan must be in the 3rd position, since the country fan is in the 2nd position.
* The van driver must be in the 2nd position, since the tram driver is in the 2nd position.

Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table:

1. The person driving the subway is somewhere between the person drinking coffee and the person driving the roller.
This means that the subway driver is either to the left of the coffee drinker or to the right of the roller driver.

2. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.
This means that the train driver is either to the left of the mirinda drinker or the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the train driver.

From these clues, we can start filling in the table:

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    |        |         |        |
| Transport   |        |         |        |

Initially, we can place the train driver on the left, since the train driver is on the left of the mirinda drinker.

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    |        |         |        |
| Transport   |  Train |        |        |

Now, we can place the subway driver between the coffee drinker and the roller driver. Since the subway driver is to the right of the coffee drinker, we can place the coffee drinker on the left.

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    | Coffee |        |        |
| Transport   |  Train | Subway |        |

Finally, we can place the mirinda drinker to the right of the train driver, since the train driver is on the left of the mirinda drinker.

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Mirinda |        |
| Transport   |  Train | Subway |        |

The roller driver must be on the right, since the subway driver is between the coffee drinker and the roller driver.

|             |   1    |    2    |   3    |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Mirinda | Water  |

Lv1-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The project-manager is somewhere between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist.
This means the project-manager is either to the left of the scientist or to the right of the person watching time-travel movies.

2. The person watching comedy movies is not the project-manager.
This means the project-manager is not watching comedy movies.

3. The person watching time-travel movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching comedy movies.
This means the person watching time-travel movies is either the project-manager or the scientist.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |

| Movie-Genre   |           |                 |             |

From clue 2, we know the project-manager is not watching comedy movies. Let's assume the project-manager is watching action movies (we'll come back to this later).

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |

| Movie-Genre   | Action    | Comedy        | Time-Travel |

From clue 1, we know the project-manager is between the person watching time-travel movies and the scientist. Since the project-manager is watching action movies, the person watching time-travel movies must be the scientist.

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |
| Job           | Action    | Comedy        | Scientist  |

From clue 3, we know the person watching time-travel movies (the scientist) is to the right of the person watching comedy movies. This means the person watching comedy movies must be the teacher.

|               |     1     |        2        |      3      |
| Job           | Action    | Teacher      | Scientist  |

Now, let's revisit the assumption that the project-manager is watching action movies. We can confirm this by looking at the table: the project-manager is between the person watching time-travel movies (the scientist) and the person watching comedy movies (the teacher), which matches the original assumption.

This means that the order of the people is: skateboard -> quad-bike ->? -> hip-hop

2. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the fan of salsa.

This means that the fan of salsa is on the left of the motorbike driver, and the motorbike driver is on the right of the fan of salsa.

3. The fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.

This means that the fan of hip-hop is either immediately to the left or right of the quad-bike driver.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The person driving the quad-bike is between the skateboard and hip-hop fan.
* The fan of salsa is on the left of the motorbike driver.

From clue 1, we know the order is: skateboard -> quad-bike ->? -> hip-hop

From clue 2, we know the fan of salsa is on the left of the motorbike driver, so let's place the fan of salsa on the left:

| Music-Genre   |            |           |           |
| Transport     | Skateboard | Quad-Bike | Motorbike |

From clue 3, we know the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the quad-bike driver. Since the fan of salsa is already on the left, the fan of hip-hop must be on the right of the quad-bike driver:
