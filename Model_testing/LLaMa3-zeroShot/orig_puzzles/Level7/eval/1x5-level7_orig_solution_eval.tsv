This means the ship is in position 1 or 2, and the taxi is in position 2 or 3.

3. The person driving the jet-ski is somewhere to the right of the person driving the bike.
This means the bike is in position 1 or 2, and the jet-ski is in position 3 or 4.

4. The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the ship and the person driving the quad-bike.
This means the taxi is in position 2.

This means that tennis must be in position 1 or 2, and weightlifting must be in position 3 or 4.

2. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person who's sport is weightlifting.

This clue doesn't add new information, but it reinforces the idea that tennis and weightlifting are adjacent.

3. The person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's sport is rugby.

This means that cycling and rugby must be in adjacent positions, either 1-2 or 3-4.

4. The person who's sport is rugby is in an even position.

This means that rugby must be in position 2 or 4.

5. The person who's sport is rugby is somewhere between the person who's sport is tennis and the person who's sport is golf.

This means that rugby must be in position 2, and tennis must be in position 1. Golf must be in position 3 or 5.

Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
This means the boat driver is not the first person, and the jet-ski driver is the first person.

2. The person driving the boat is the person driving the boat.
This is a tautology, so we can ignore it.

3. The person driving the taxi is somewhere between the person driving the car and the person driving the train.
This means the taxi driver is not the first or last person. Since the jet-ski driver is the first person, the taxi driver must be between the car driver and the train driver.

4. The person driving the jet-ski is on the far left.
We already know this from clue 1.

5. The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the taxi.
This means the car driver is not the first person, and the taxi driver is between the jet-ski driver and the car driver.

Now, let's combine the information:

3. The paramedic is on the left of the dressmaker.
This confirms the previous clue: the paramedic is to the left of the dressmaker.

4. The bartender is somewhere to the right of the paramedic.
This means the bartender is to the right of the paramedic.

5. The teacher is on the far right.
This means the teacher is on the rightmost position.

Lv1-1x5-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is card-games is somewhere between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

This means that card-games is either between reading and filmmaking, or between reading and magic-tricks (since filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks). Let's assume it's between reading and filmmaking for now.

2. The person who's hobby is reading is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.

This means that reading is to the right of card-games.

3. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.

This means that card-games is to the right of skydiving.

4. The person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

This means that skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks.

5. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.

This means that filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Card-games is between reading and filmmaking (from clue 1)
* Reading is to the right of card-games (from clue 2)
* Card-games is to the right of skydiving (from clue 3)
* Skydiving is to the right of magic-tricks (from clue 4)
* Filmmaking is to the left of magic-tricks (from clue 5)

The possible order is:

Skydiving -> Magic-tricks -> Card-games -> Reading -> Filmmaking

But wait, we can't have card-games between reading and filmmaking if it's to the right of skydiving! So, let's try again:

Magic-tricks -> Skydiving -> Card-games -> Reading -> Filmmaking

This order satisfies all the clues. Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

2. The person watching sports movies is on the far left.
3. The person watching horror movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching documentary movies.
4. The person watching spy movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies.

From clue 2, we know the person watching sports movies is on the far left, so we can start by placing them in position 1.

From clue 3, we know the person watching horror movies is between the person watching romance movies and the person watching documentary movies. Since the person watching sports movies is on the far left, the person watching horror movies must be in position 2.

From clue 1, we know the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person watching horror movies, so they must be in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the person watching spy movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies, so they must be in position 4.

The only genre left is romance, which must be in position 2, since the person watching horror movies is between them and the person watching documentary movies.

This means that romance and martial-arts movies are adjacent to each other.

2. The person watching comedy movies is somewhere between the person watching romance movies and the person watching family movies.
This means that comedy movies are between romance and family movies.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is somewhere between the person watching comedy movies and the person watching romance movies.
This is already implied by clue 1, but it reinforces the idea that martial-arts movies are between comedy and romance movies.

4. The person watching sports movies is in an odd position.
This means that sports movies are in positions 1, 3, or 5.

5. The person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
This means that romance movies are to the right of martial-arts movies.

6. The person watching sports movies is on the left of the person watching family movies.
This means that sports movies are to the left of family movies.

Now, let's combine the clues and create a possible solution:

```
#############
| Movie-Genre | Comedy | Martial-Arts | Romance | Family | Sports |
#############
```

From clue 4, we know that sports movies are in an odd position, so they must be in position 1 or 3 or 5. From clue 6, we know that sports movies are to the left of family movies, so they must be in position 1 or 3. Let's assume they're in position 1 for now.

From clue 2, we know that comedy movies are between romance and family movies. Since romance movies are to the right of martial-arts movies (clue 5), comedy movies must be to the left of romance movies. This means that comedy movies are in position 2.

From clue 3, we know that martial-arts movies are between comedy and romance movies. Since comedy movies are in position 2, martial-arts movies must be in position 3.

From clue 1, we know that romance movies are on the left or right of martial-arts movies. Since martial-arts movies are in position 3, romance movies must be in position 4.

Finally, family movies must be in position 5, since they're to the right of romance movies and sports movies are already in position 1.

Here's the final solution:

```

This is a redundant statement, but it doesn't provide any new information.

4. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing.
This means that skiing must be in the second position, and snowboarding must be in the third position.

3. The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.

Since there are 5 pets, the middle position is the 3rd position. Therefore, the chinchilla is in the 3rd position:

4. The owner of the guinea-pig is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake.

This means the guinea-pig is in the 4th or 5th position. Since the chinchilla is already in the 3rd position, the guinea-pig must be in the 4th position:
