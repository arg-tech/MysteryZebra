#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the fan of d&b is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. From statement 12, we know the person drinking lemonade is in an odd position, so the fan of d&b must be in an even position.
2. From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the fan of r&b. Since the fan of d&b is in an even position, the fan of r&b must be in an odd position.
3. From statement 4, we know the dutch is not the person drinking fanta. From statement 19, we know the dutch is to the left of the security-guard. Since the security-guard is not drinking fanta, the dutch must be drinking soy-milk.
4. From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the ferret. From statement 9, we know the owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the owner of the bird (statement 23), the owner of the ferret must be the person drinking hot-chocolate.
5. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the malaysian. From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.

7. From statement 17, we know the lawyer is the fan of salsa. From statement 30, we know the lawyer is the fan of salsa. From statement 31, we know the dutch is between the lawyer and the person who's sport is surfing. Since the person who's sport is surfing is the owner of the ferret (statement 6), the dutch must be the owner of the goat.
8. From statement 22, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is the owner of the goat. From statement 28, we know the fan of folk is not the owner of the goat. From statement 29, we know the bartender is not the fan of folk. Therefore, the fan of folk must be the mexican (statement 15).
9. From statement 32, we know the person drinking milk is on the far right. From statement 33, we know the fan of folk is not the person who's sport is surfing. Therefore, the fan of folk (mexican) must be in the second position.
10. From statement 14, we know the malaysian is not the owner of the mouse. From statement 20, we know the police-officer is to the right of the owner of the mouse. Therefore, the malaysian must be the owner of the bird.
11. From statement 16, we know the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the goat. From statement 22, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is the owner of the goat. Therefore, the owner of the bird must be the person who's sport is cricket.
