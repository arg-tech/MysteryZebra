Lv1-3x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Thai is a fan of disco.
2. The fan of classical is on the far right.
3. The Brazilian is in an odd position, so they must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.
4. The Italian is not a fan of classical, so they must be a fan of one of the other three genres: country, disco, or funk.
5. The person who plays rugby is not the Thai, so they must be either the Brazilian or the Italian.
6. The person who plays ice-hockey is on the left or right of the Brazilian, so they must be in either the 2nd or 4th position.
7. The Brazilian is between the fan of disco and the Colombian, so the Colombian must be in the 2nd position.
8. The person who plays badminton is between the fan of country and the fan of disco, so the fan of country must be in the 1st position.
9. The person who plays rugby is on the left or right of the fan of funk, so the fan of funk must be in either the 3rd or 4th position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From statement 5, we know the Nigerian eats blueberry. From statement 6, we know the Polish eats pepper. From statement 4, we know the person drinking water eats pepper, which is the Polish.

From statement 2, we know the person eating blueberry is in an odd position. Since the Nigerian eats blueberry, the Nigerian must be in an odd position.

From statement 1, we know the person eating raspberry is on the far left or far right. Since the Nigerian is in an odd position, the Nigerian cannot be eating raspberry. Therefore, the person eating raspberry must be on the far left or far right.

From statement 8, we know the person eating raspberry is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since the Nigerian is not eating raspberry, the Mexican must be eating raspberry.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican. Since the Mexican eats raspberry, the person drinking sprite must be on the right of the Mexican.

From statement 9, we know the person drinking 7up is somewhere between the person eating raspberry and the person drinking sprite. Since the Mexican eats raspberry and the person drinking sprite is on the right of the Mexican, the person drinking 7up must be on the right of the Mexican.

From statement 10, we know the Nigerian is on the left or right of the person eating pepper. Since the Nigerian eats blueberry and the Polish eats pepper, the Nigerian must be on the left of the Polish.

From statement 1, we know the fan of jazz is on the far right. Since the fan of gospel is driving the motorbike, the fan of jazz must be driving the quad-bike (the only remaining option).

From statement 3, we know the person driving the airplane is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the Argentine is driving the airplane (statement 6), the Argentine must be on the right of the Indian.

From statement 7, we know the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of blues. Since the Mexican is the fan of salsa, and the fan of jazz is on the far right, the Mexican must be the fan of blues.

3. The owner of the horse is in an odd position.

Lv1-3x4-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the Egyptian's hobby is magic-tricks.

From statement 2, we know the Egyptian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the Egyptian's hobby is magic-tricks, the person who's hobby is chess must be on the left or right of the Egyptian.

From statement 3, we know the Colombian is somewhere to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the Colombian's nationality is not specified, we can't place them yet.

From statement 4, we know the person drinking lemonade is somewhere between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the Egyptian's hobby is magic-tricks, the person drinking lemonade must be between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the Egyptian.

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking 7up. This means the Colombian (who is to the right of the 7up drinker) must be to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. This means the person who's hobby is filmmaking (who drinks 7up) is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking soy-milk is somewhere to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the soy-milk drinker is not specified, we can't place them yet.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking lemonade is not the British. This means the British person must be drinking either 7up, fanta, or soy-milk.

Now, let's try to place the people:

* The Egyptian is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the Egyptian's hobby is magic-tricks, the person who's hobby is chess must be on the left or right of the Egyptian. Let's place the Egyptian on the left of the chess player.
* The person drinking lemonade is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is on the left of the chess player, the person drinking lemonade must be between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the chess player.
* The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person drinking 7up. This means the Colombian (who is to the right of the 7up drinker) must be to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.
* The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. This means the person who's hobby is filmmaking (who drinks 7up) is on the right of the person drinking lemonade.
* The British person is not drinking lemonade. Since the British person must be drinking either 7up, fanta, or soy-milk, let's place them on the left of the chess player (since the Egyptian is already on the left).

From statement 8, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the train is in an even position, the motorbike driver must be in an odd position. This means the motorbike driver can only be in position 1.

Now, let's look at statement 7. The musician is between the person driving the quad-bike and the person driving the airplane. Since the motorbike driver is in position 1, the quad-bike driver must be in position 3. The musician is between the quad-bike driver and the airplane driver, so the musician must be in position 2.

From statement 4, we know the doctor is to the right of the musician. Since the musician is in position 2, the doctor must be in position 4.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the goat is to the right of the doctor. Since the doctor is in position 4, the owner of the goat must be in position 5.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the dog is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat. Since the owner of the goat is in position 5, the owner of the dog must be in position 4 (between the goldfish and the goat).
