Lv1-2x5-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is badminton is the person drinking 7up.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the person who's sport is tennis.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.

From statement 6, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person who's sport is lacrosse.

From statement 8, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is somewhere between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking coffee.

Combining these statements, we can conclude that the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk, which is the person who's sport is tennis, and the person who's sport is lacrosse is between them.

From statement 2, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not the person who's sport is water-polo.

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the far left or far right. Since we already know the person who's sport is tennis is drinking soy-milk, this means the person who's sport is tennis is on the far left.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|            |    1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |     5     |
| Beverage   |          |             |          |            |           |
| Sport      |          |             |          |            |           |

* 1: 7up (badminton)
* 2: almond-milk (lacrosse)
* 3: soy-milk (tennis)
* 4: iced-tea (water-polo)
* 5: coffee (baseball)

From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is baseball is not the person drinking coffee. This means the person drinking coffee must be the person who's sport is not baseball.

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is badminton is the person drinking 7up, which we already filled in.

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not on the far left or far right, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 4.

The final solution table is:
