2. From statement 14, we know the person watching western movies is the person who's hobby is filmmaking.

3. From statement 6, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person drinking water. From statement 19, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. This means the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.
4. From statement 16, we know the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position. Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, the person drinking almond-milk must be in the middle.
5. From statement 12, we know the person drinking iced-tea is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching family movies. From statement 15, we know the person watching family movies is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. This means the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
6. From statement 25, we know the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle, the person drinking cola must be on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
7. From statement 11, we know the person drinking iced-tea is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is filmmaking. Since the person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
8. From statement 23, we know the person drinking almond-milk is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle, the person who's hobby is reading must be on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
9. From statement 18, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is somewhere to the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk, the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
