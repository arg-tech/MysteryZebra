Lv1-4x3-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
2. The person who's sport is basketball is in the middle.
3. The person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person driving the boat.
4. The person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies.
5. The person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing.
6. The person watching disaster movies is somewhere between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is basketball is in the middle. From clue 3, we know this person is on the right of the person driving the boat. So, the person driving the boat must be on the left of the person who's sport is basketball.

From clue 4, we know the person driving the helicopter is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person watching thriller movies. Since the person driving the boat is already placed, the person driving the helicopter must be on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.

Now, let's focus on the hobbies. From clue 5, we know the person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing. This means the person watching fantasy movies must be either the person who's hobby is magic-tricks or photography.

From clue 6, we know the person watching disaster movies is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person who's hobby is photography. Since the person watching fantasy movies is not the person who's hobby is fishing, the person watching disaster movies must be the person who's hobby is fishing.

Now we have a good idea of the layout. Here's the solution table with the people in the correct order:

Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of hip-hop is the person watching horror movies.

5. The person watching western movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching horror movies.
6. The fan of techno is in the middle.
7. The owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is golf.

From statement 1, we know the fan of hip-hop is watching horror movies. Let's call this person A.

From statement 2, we know the person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. Since A is watching horror movies, the person watching western movies must be to the right of A.

From statement 3, we know the person watching western movies is the owner of the hamster. Let's call this person B.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the cat is between the person who's sport is golf and the person who's sport is tennis. Since B is the owner of the hamster, B must be to the right of the person who's sport is golf.

From statement 5, we know the person watching western movies (B) is to the right of the person watching horror movies (A). This means A must be to the left of B.

From statement 6, we know the fan of techno is in the middle. Since A is watching horror movies and B is watching western movies, the fan of techno must be between A and B.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the ferret is the person who's sport is golf. Since B is to the right of the person who's sport is golf, the owner of the ferret must be B.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-4x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is collecting is the person watching mystery movies.

This means that the collecting hobby is paired with the mystery movie genre. We can't determine the exact position of this person yet, but we know that collecting and mystery are connected.

2. The manager is somewhere to the left of the person watching adventure movies.

This means that the manager is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person watching adventure movies is in the 3rd column.

3. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the teacher.

This means that the rock-climbing hobby is paired with a job that is to the left of the teacher. Since the teacher is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (from statement 4), the rock-climbing hobby must be paired with the paramedic job.

4. The teacher is not the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.

This means that the teacher has a different hobby, which must be collecting (since collecting is paired with mystery movies).

5. The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the manager.

This means that the manager is in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person watching adventure movies is in the 3rd column.

6. The person drinking iced-tea is between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the person drinking almond-milk.

This means that the rock-climbing hobby is paired with the iced-tea drinker, and the almond-milk drinker is to the right of the iced-tea drinker.

7. The person drinking iced-tea is somewhere between the manager and the person who's hobby is collecting.

This means that the iced-tea drinker is either in the 1st or 2nd column, and the person who's hobby is collecting is in the 3rd column.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The manager is in the 1st column (from statement 2 and 5).
* The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the 1st column (from statement 3 and 6).
* The person drinking iced-tea is in the 1st column (from statement 7).

From statement 3, we know the fan of metal is either to the left or right of S. Let's call the fan of metal M. If M is to the left of S, then M is to the left of T as well. But then M would be to the left of A, which would mean M is the project-manager (contradicting statement 4). Therefore, M must be to the right of S.

From statement 5, we know the person watching comedy movies is between the coach and the person watching spy movies. Let's call the coach C and the person watching spy movies Sp. This means the person watching comedy movies is either to the left of C and to the right of Sp, or to the right of C and to the left of Sp.

From statement 6, we know the person watching comedy movies is to the left of Sp. This means the person watching comedy movies is either to the left of C and to the right of Sp, or to the right of C and to the left of Sp.

From statement 7, we know the person watching comedy movies is to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Let's call the person who's sport is soccer So. This means the person watching comedy movies is either to the right of C and to the left of So, or to the right of So and to the left of Sp.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |        2        |    3     |
| Job           |         |                 |          |

| Music-Genre   |         |                 |          |
| Sport         |         |                 |          |

A (ambient) - - -
S (skateboarding) - - -
T (tennis) - - -
M (metal) - - -
C (coach) - - -
Sp (spy) - - -
So (soccer) - - -

From the above, we can conclude that:

* A is on the far left
* S is to the left of T
* M is to the right of S
* C is between A and Sp
* The person watching comedy movies is to the left of Sp
* The person watching comedy movies is to the right of So

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-4x3-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching fantasy movies is the bartender.
This means the bartender's movie genre is fantasy.

2. The person watching family movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
This means the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person watching family movies.

3. The australian is on the far right.
This means the australian is on the right of the person watching family movies (since the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person watching family movies).

4. The russian is not the person who's hobby is reading.
This means the russian's hobby is either fishing or skydiving.

5. The videographer is somewhere between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender.
This means the videographer is either between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person watching family movies, or between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the bartender.

6. The bartender is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading.
This means the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the bartender.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

This means that salsa is the 3rd music genre, and hip-hop is either the 1st or 2nd music genre.

5. The fan of salsa is on the right of the fan of hip-hop.

This is redundant with statement 4, but it doesn't provide any new information.

6. The brazilian is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

This means that soccer is either the 2nd or 3rd sport, and brazilian is either the 1st or 2nd nationality.
