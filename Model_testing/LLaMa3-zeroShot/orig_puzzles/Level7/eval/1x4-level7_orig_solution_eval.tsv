Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the snake.

This means the snake cannot be on the rightmost position, so the snake must be in one of the first three positions.

2. The owner of the goat is somewhere between the owner of the hamster and the owner of the snake.

This means the goat cannot be on the leftmost position, and it cannot be on the rightmost position (since the snake is not on the rightmost position). Therefore, the goat must be in the second or third position.

3. The owner of the hamster is on the left of the owner of the goat.

This means the hamster cannot be in the third position (since the goat is in the second or third position), so the hamster must be in the leftmost position.

Now, let's put the pets in the correct order:

|       |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |
| Pet   | Hamster | Goat | Snake | Frog |

The final solution is:

|       |    1    |  2   |   3   |  4   |
