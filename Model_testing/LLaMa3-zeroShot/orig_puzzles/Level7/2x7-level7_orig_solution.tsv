Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 9, we know the person eating mango is the owner of the goat. From statement 15, we know the person eating mango is on the far left. Therefore, the person eating mango is the owner of the goat, and is in position 1.
2. From statement 16, we know the person eating mango is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony. Since the person eating mango is already in position 1, the owner of the pony must be in position 7.
3. From statement 18, we know the owner of the fish is somewhere to the right of the person eating zucchini. Since the owner of the pony is in position 7, the person eating zucchini must be in position 6.
4. From statement 10, we know the person eating strawberry is between the person eating raspberry and the owner of the goldfish. Since the person eating raspberry is on the right of the owner of the fish (statement 13), the person eating strawberry must be in position 4.
5. From statement 2, we know the person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person eating strawberry is in position 4, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 5.
6. From statement 5, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in position 5, the owner of the hamster must be in position 6.
7. From statement 12, we know the owner of the goldfish is in the middle. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 4, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3.
8. From statement 11, we know the person eating blueberry is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the person eating blueberry is not in position 1 (mango), it must be in position 2. The owner of the cat must be in an even position (statement 8), so it's in position 4.
9. From statement 14, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating strawberry. Since the person eating pomegranate is in position 3, it's on the left of the person eating strawberry.
10. From statement 17, we know the person eating blueberry is somewhere to the right of the owner of the cat. Since the person eating blueberry is in position 2, the owner of the cat is in position 4.
11. From statement 3, we know the person eating strawberry is on the left or right of the person eating raspberry. Since the person eating strawberry is in position 4, it's on the right of the person eating raspberry.
12. From statement 6, we know the owner of the goldfish is somewhere between the owner of the fish and the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the goldfish is in position 4, the owner of the fish must be in position 3.

The rest of the positions can be filled in accordingly."
Lv1-2x7-9	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the Indonesian.

From clue 3, we know the Argentine is on the right of the Japanese.

From clue 14, we know the Italian is on the right of the owner of the snake.

From clue 15, we know the Turkish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |    1    |    2     |    3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |     7      |

From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the Indonesian, so the Argentine must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, we know the Argentine is on the right of the Japanese, so the Japanese must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 5, we know the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the left of the Japanese, so the turtle must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know the British is not the owner of the ferret, so the British must be in position 1, 3, or 5.

From clue 10, we know the owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so the snake must be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 11, we know the Italian is somewhere between the owner of the snake and the owner of the rat, so the Italian must be in position 3 or 4.

From clue 12, we know the Indonesian is on the right of the owner of the rabbit, so the rabbit must be in position 5 or 6.

From clue 13, we know the Russian is in the middle, so the Russian must be in position 4.

From clue 14, we know the Italian is on the right of the owner of the snake, so the Italian must be in position 4.

From clue 15, we know the Turkish is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat, so the Turkish must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |    1    |    2     |    3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |     7      |

After some trial and error, we get:

|               |    1    |    2     |    3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |     7      |

From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is the fan of indie. Let's place them at the far right, as stated in statement 13.

From statement 4, we know the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere between the fan of soul and the fan of metal. Let's place the fan of soul to the left of the person who's sport is baseball, and the fan of metal to the right of the person who's sport is baseball.

From statement 9, we know the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient. From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is soccer is between the fan of gospel and the person who's sport is baseball. So, the fan of gospel must be to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

From statement 8, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is soccer. Let's place them to the left of the fan of gospel.

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the fan of ambient. From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere to the left of the fan of ambient. So, the person who's sport is rowing must be to the left of the fan of ambient.
