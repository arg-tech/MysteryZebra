Lv1-7x3-9	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 4, we know the Argentine is on the far right. From clue 1, we know the owner of the lizard is in an odd position, which means they are either in the first or third position.

From clue 2, we know the photographer is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the photographer is not the owner of the rabbit (clue 3), and the Argentine is on the far right, the photographer must be in the second position.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the photographer is between the person drinking soy-milk and the person who's hobby is rock-climbing, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be in the third position.

Since the person who's hobby is board-games is not in the first or third position (due to the Argentine being on the far right), the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in the second position.

From clue 12, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is in an odd position. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is not in the first or third position (due to the Argentine being on the far right), the person who's hobby is hiking must be in the second position.
