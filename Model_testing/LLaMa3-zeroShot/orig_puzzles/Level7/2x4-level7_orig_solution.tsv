Lv1-2x4-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the owner of the hedgehog.

This means that the order of sports is either: skateboarding, volleyball, rowing, cycling or skateboarding, rowing, volleyball, cycling. Since the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere between the person who's sport is volleyball and the person who's sport is skateboarding, the hedgehog owner must be the one who's sport is rowing.

2. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog.

This means that the snake owner is either the first or second person. Since the owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the snake (clue 4), the goat owner must be the first person.

3. The owner of the snake is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

This means that the snake owner is either the third or fourth person. Since the owner of the snake is already known to be somewhere to the left of the owner of the dog (clue 2), the snake owner must be the third person.

4. The owner of the goat is on the left of the owner of the snake.

This confirms that the goat owner is the first person.

5. The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is skateboarding and the person who's sport is rowing.

This means that the order of sports is: skateboarding, volleyball, rowing. The hedgehog owner is already known to be the one who's sport is rowing, so the hedgehog owner is the fourth person.

Now we can fill in the table:
