Now, let's look at the remaining clues.

From clue 3, we know the fan of reggae is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies. Since we don't know who's watching musical movies yet, we can't place the fan of reggae yet.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since we don't know where the fan of reggae is yet, we can't place the person who's hobby is fishing yet.

From clue 6, we know the person watching time-travel movies is somewhere between the person watching spy movies and the person drinking water. We can't place the person watching time-travel movies yet, but we can note that the person drinking water is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (clue 7).

From clue 11, we know the fan of dubstep is not the person watching time-travel movies.
