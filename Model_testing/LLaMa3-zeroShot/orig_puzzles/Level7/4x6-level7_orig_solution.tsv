9. From clue 20, we know the person watching family movies is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. From clue 10, we know the person watching thriller movies is in an even position. Therefore, the person watching family movies is in position 2.
10. From clue 21, we know the person watching thriller movies is not the person who's sport is cycling. From clue 18, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Therefore, the person watching thriller movies is in position 4.
