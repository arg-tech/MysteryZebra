#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is the person eating grapes. From clue 12, we know the person eating artichoke is the person watching documentary movies. Since cooking is not photography, and documentary is not satire, we can conclude that the person eating artichoke is not the person who's hobby is cooking.

3. From clue 21, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is the fan of indie. From clue 40, we know the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the person who's sport is baseball is not the fan of indie.
4. From clue 25, we know the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the owner of the hamster. From clue 36, we know the person who's sport is cricket is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. This means the person who's hobby is cooking is not the owner of the hamster.
5. From clue 27, we know the person who's hobby is chess is on the far right. From clue 43, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the turtle. This means the person driving the motorbike is not the person who's hobby is chess.
6. From clue 29, we know the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. From clue 42, we know the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is swimming. This means the person who's hobby is photography is not the person who's sport is weightlifting.
7. From clue 30, we know the person eating apple is somewhere to the right of the person watching documentary movies. From clue 12, we know the person eating artichoke is the person watching documentary movies. This means the person eating apple is not the person eating artichoke.
8. From clue 31, we know the person eating eggplant is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. From clue 37, we know the person who's hobby is photography is somewhere between the owner of the chinchilla and the person who's hobby is dancing. This means the person eating eggplant is not the person who's hobby is photography.
9. From clue 33, we know the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's hobby is card-games. From clue 40, we know the person who's sport is baseball is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. This means the person who's sport is soccer is not the person who's hobby is card-games.
10. From clue 34, we know the owner of the turtle is in an odd position. From clue 43, we know the person driving the motorbike is on the left of the owner of the turtle. This means the owner of the turtle is in position 3 or 5.
