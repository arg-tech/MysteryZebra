From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is to the right of the project-manager.

From statement 8, we know the police-officer is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is cooking.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |
| Beverage      |             |                |                 |              |

From the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

|               |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

| Movie-Genre   |             |                |                 | Martial-arts |

Now, let's try to figure out the remaining information:

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is not the person watching crime movies. Since the police-officer watches crime movies, the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be the police-officer. The scientist is already taken, so the person who's hobby is cooking must be the project-manager.

From statement 7, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is to the right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is the person who's hobby is cooking, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must be the mechanic.

From statement 8, we know the police-officer is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the mechanic is the person who's hobby is magic-tricks, the police-officer must be between the mechanic and the project-manager.

From statement 1, we know the person watching crime movies is to the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since the police-officer watches crime movies, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing must be the person who's job is project-manager.

From statement 10, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person drinking soy-milk is already placed, the person watching drama movies must be the person who's job is scientist.

From statement 3, we know the person drinking mirinda is to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is already placed, the person drinking mirinda must be the person who's job is mechanic.

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

|               |      1      |       2        |        3        |      4       |

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is not the owner of the dog. Let's assume the person drinking soy-milk is in position 2. Then, the owner of the dog must be in position 1.

|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |       4       |

| Transport     |           | quad-bike|        | ship        |

From clue 9, we know that the person driving the bus is on the right of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is in position 1, the person driving the bus must be in position 3.

|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |       4       |

From clue 10, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. This is already satisfied.

From clue 11, we know that the person driving the bus is somewhere to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is not the person watching adventure movies (clue 12), and the person watching adventure movies is not yet assigned, let's assume the owner of the snake is in position 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |       4       |
| Beverage      | 7up      | snake   | bus    | hot-cho    te |

| Transport     |           | quad-bike|        | ship        |

From clue 13, we know that the person driving the tram is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the turtle. Since the owner of the turtle is not yet assigned, let's assume the owner of the turtle is in position 4.

|               |     1     |     2     |   3    |       4       |
| Beverage      | 7up      | snake   | bus    | hot-cho    te |

| Transport     |           | quad-bike|        | ship        |

From clue 14, we know that the owner of the snake is in an even position. Since the owner of the snake is in position 2, this is already satisfied.

Now, let's summarize the remaining clues:

* The person watching family movies is not the owner of the turtle (clue 2).
* The person watching adventure movies is not the owner of the snake (clue 12).
* The person drinking 7up is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (clue 10).
* The person driving the tram is somewhere between the person drinking 7up and the owner of the turtle (clue 13).

From these clues, we can deduce that the person watching family movies must be the owner of the turtle, and the person watching adventure movies must be the owner of the dog.
