Lv1-5x3-9	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the Polish person. Let's assume the Polish person is in position 2. Then, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 3, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the project-manager is somewhere between the person who's sport is surfing and the Australian person. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 1, the project-manager must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that the photographer is on the right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in position 1, the person watching superhero movies must be in position 3.

From clue 5, we know that the Turkish person is in an even position. Since the Polish person is in position 2, the Turkish person must be in position 4.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is in position 3, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 2.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the Polish person. This is already satisfied since the Polish person is in position 2 and the person who's hobby is woodworking is in position 3.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is between the person watching scientific movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person who's hobby is sudoku is not yet placed, let's assume it's in position 5. Then, the person watching scientific movies must be in position 4, and the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 6.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:
