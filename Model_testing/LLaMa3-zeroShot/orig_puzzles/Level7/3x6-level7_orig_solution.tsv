Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 18, we know the Pakistani drinks 7up.
2. From statement 2, we know the fan of metal drinks soy-milk. Since the fan of metal is the person drinking soy-milk, we can conclude that the Japanese drinks soy-milk (from statement 11).

8. From statement 16, we know the fan of reggae is between the person drinking 7up and the fan of funk. Since the Pakistani drinks 7up, the fan of reggae must be between the Pakistani and the fan of funk.
9. From statement 17, we know the person drinking cola is somewhere between the fan of funk and the person drinking juice. Since the fan of reggae is between the Pakistani and the fan of funk, the person drinking cola must be between the fan of funk and the person drinking juice.
10. From statement 14, we know the fan of funk is not the Canadian. Since the fan of funk is not the Canadian, the Canadian must be in position 5.
11. From statement 13, we know the Canadian is on the left or right of the Japanese. Since the Canadian is in position 5, the Japanese must be in position 6.
12. From statement 1, we know the fan of ambient is not the Japanese. Since the fan of ambient is not the Japanese, the fan of ambient must be in position 5 or 6. However, since the fan of classical is in position 4, the fan of ambient must be in position 5.
13. From statement 8, we know the person drinking juice is not the British. Since the person drinking juice is not the British, the person drinking juice must be in position 6.

Lv1-3x6-10	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've come up with the solution. Here it is:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Nationality | Sport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Adventure | Canadian | Handball |
| Animation | Dutch | Tennis |
| Drama | Colombian | Cycling |
| Fantasy | Australian | Golf |
| Horror | Egyptian | Biathlon |
| Martial-Arts | American | Sailing |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 6, we know the person watching adventure movies is the person who's sport is handball. From statement 3, we know the Canadian is on the left of the Colombian. So, the Canadian must be watching adventure movies (handball).
2. From statement 5, we know the Colombian is on the left of the person watching drama movies. From statement 8, we know the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. So, the Colombian must be watching drama movies.
3. From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is tennis is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching animation movies. Since the Canadian is watching adventure movies, the person watching animation movies must be on the right of the Canadian.
4. From statement 10, we know the Dutch is on the left or right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the Dutch is watching animation movies (from statement 2), the person who's sport is golf must be on the right of the Dutch.
5. From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since the Canadian is watching handball, the person who's sport is golf must be on the left of the Canadian.
6. From statement 9, we know the Egyptian is on the right of the person watching horror movies. Since the Egyptian is not watching adventure, drama, or animation movies, they must be watching horror movies.
7. From statement 11, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the American is not watching adventure, drama, or animation movies, they must be watching martial-arts movies.
8. From statement 15, we know the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the Dutch is watching animation movies, the person who's sport is golf must be on the right of the Dutch.
9. From statement 16, we know the person who's sport is tennis is in an even position. Since the person who's sport is tennis is between the person watching adventure movies and the person watching animation movies, they must be in the middle.
10. From statement 17, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the Australian. Since the American is watching martial-arts movies, the Australian must be watching fantasy movies (from statement 2).

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
