Lv1-2x6-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Pet           |
|-------------|---------------|
| Disaster    | Snake         |
| Documentary | Fish          |
| Drama      | Guinea-pig    |
| Fantasy    | Dog           |
| Horror     | Mouse         |
| Time-travel | Chinchilla    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. This means the documentary person is on the left.
2. From statement 2, we know the owner of the snake is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the snake person is on the left or right, they can't be the documentary person (who is on the left). So, the snake person is on the right of the drama person.
3. From statement 3, we know the owner of the mouse is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since the mouse person is on the left or right, they can't be the snake person (who is on the right). So, the mouse person is on the left of the horror person.
4. From statement 4, we know the person watching drama movies is on the left or right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the drama person is on the left or right, they can't be the snake person (who is on the right). So, the drama person is on the left of the guinea-pig person.
5. From statement 5, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the left of the owner of the mouse. This means the time-travel person is on the left of the horror person.
6. From statement 6, we know the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Since the horror person is on the left or right, they can't be the time-travel person (who is on the left). So, the horror person is on the right of the drama person.
7. From statement 7, we know the person watching horror movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies. This is already satisfied by statement 6.
8. From statement 8, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the far left or far right. Since the snake person is on the right of the drama person, the disaster person must be on the far right.
9. From statement 9, we know the person watching horror movies is not the owner of the mouse. This is already satisfied by the solution.
10. From statement 10, we know the owner of the chinchilla is somewhere between the owner of the snake and the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the snake person is on the right of the drama person, the chinchilla person must be between the snake and guinea-pig people.
11. From statement 11, we know the owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the person watching horror movies. Since the horror person is on the right of the drama person, the fish person must be on the left of the drama person.
12. From statement 12, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the dog. This means the time-travel person is on the right of the dog person.
13. From statement 13, we know the owner of the snake is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the snake person is on the right of the drama person, the chinchilla person must be on the left of the snake person.
14. From statement 14, we know the owner of the snake is in an even position. Since the snake person is on the right of the drama person, the snake person must be in an even position.
15. From statement 15, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the guinea-pig person is on the right of the drama person, the fantasy person must be on the left of the drama person.
16. From statement 16, we know the owner of the snake is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. This is already satisfied by the solution.
17. From statement 17, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the owner of the dog and the person watching horror movies. Since the fantasy person is on the left of the drama person, and the horror person is on the right of the drama person, the fantasy person must be between the dog and horror people.

By combining these constraints, we arrive at the final solution table."
