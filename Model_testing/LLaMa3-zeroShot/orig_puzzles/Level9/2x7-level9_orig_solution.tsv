* From statement 2, we know the person driving the quad-bike is not to the right of the person eating lime. This means the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person eating lime.
* From statement 3, we know the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person eating garlic. Since the person driving the ship is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the boat (statement 6), the person driving the ship must be eating garlic.
* From statement 15, we know the person driving the bus is to the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person driving the bus is eating artichoke, the person driving the jet-ski must be eating peach.
* From statement 11, we know the person eating lime is not to the right of the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is eating garlic, the person eating lime must be to the left of the person driving the ship.

* From statement 14, we know the person driving the ship is to the left of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the ship is eating garlic, the person driving the roller must be eating peas.
* From statement 7, we know the person driving the boat is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the ship. Since the person driving the ship is eating garlic, the person driving the boat must be eating pear.
* From statement 16, we know the person eating carrot is not to the right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach is to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, the person eating carrot must be to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.
