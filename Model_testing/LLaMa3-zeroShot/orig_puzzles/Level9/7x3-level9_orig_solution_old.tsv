|               |       1       |    2     |       3       |
| Beverage      |  Iced-Tea     |  Juice   |  Sprite      |

| Sport         |  Golf        |  Skateboarding |  Weightlifting |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person who bakes and owns the turtle has the same parity position. Since the Brazilian owns the turtle (statement 8), the Brazilian must be the one who bakes.
2. From statement 2, we know the owner of the goldfish and the person who does weightlifting have different parity positions. Since the person who does weightlifting is also the one who reads (statement 14), the owner of the goldfish must be the Italian.
3. From statement 3, we know the owner of the guinea-pig and the fan of country music have the same parity position. Since the fan of country music is to the right of the person who does golf (statement 13), the owner of the guinea-pig must be the Spanish.
4. From statement 4, we know the person drinking iced-tea is to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the Brazilian bakes and owns the turtle, the Brazilian must be the one drinking iced-tea.
5. From statement 5, we know the person eating pear is to the right of the Italian. Since the Italian is to the right of the person drinking sprite (statement 11), the person eating pear must be the Spanish.
6. From statement 6, we know the fan of hip-hop is between the owner of the turtle and the person who bakes. Since the Brazilian bakes and owns the turtle, the fan of hip-hop must be the Italian.
7. From statement 7, we know the person who cooks is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the Italian is to the right of the person drinking sprite (statement 11), the Italian must be the one who cooks.
8. From statement 9, we know the fan of hip-hop and the person eating apricot have different parity positions. Since the fan of hip-hop is the Italian, the person eating apricot must be the Brazilian.
9. From statement 10, we know the person drinking sprite is on the far left or far right. Since the Italian is to the right of the person drinking sprite (statement 11), the Italian must be the one drinking sprite.
10. From statement 12, we know the owner of the guinea-pig and the person drinking juice have the same parity position. Since the Spanish owns the guinea-pig, the Spanish must be the one drinking juice.
11. From statement 15, we know the person eating pear is not the person who reads. Since the person eating pear is the Spanish, the Spanish cannot be the one who reads. Therefore, the Italian must be the one who reads.

8. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the fan dubstep. Since the fan dubstep is not on the far left (from statement 2), the person who's hobby is woodworking must be on the right of the fan dubstep.
9. From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is skiing is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer. Since the person who's sport is soccer is not the roller driver (from statement 1), the person who's sport is skiing must be on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
10. From statement 11, we know the person who's sport is soccer and the person who's hobby is chess have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is soccer is not the roller driver (from statement 1), the person who's hobby is chess must be on the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 5, we know the person eating cabbage watches adventure movies. From statement 11, we know the software-developer watches adventure movies, so the software-developer eats cabbage.
2. From statement 8, we know the person eating cherry is in the middle. Since there are only three people, the person eating cherry must be in position 2.
3. From statement 15, we know the person eating papaya is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the person eating cherry is in the middle, the person eating papaya must be in position 1.
4. From statement 2, we know the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is somewhere to the right of the pakistani (statement 3), the person drinking milk must be in position 1 or 2.
5. From statement 12, we know the person drinking mirinda is not the colombian. Since the colombian is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the entrepreneur (statement 9), the person drinking mirinda must be in position 3.
6. From statement 10, we know the owner of the cat is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in position 3, the owner of the cat must be in position 1 or 2.
7. From statement 13, we know the owner of the cat is not the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's sport is cricket is in position 3, the owner of the cat must be in position 1 or 2.
8. From statement 16, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 3.
9. From statement 17, we know the owner of the guinea-pig and the person watching fantasy movies have different parity positions. Since the owner of the guinea-pig is in position 2, the person watching fantasy movies must be in position 1 or 3.
10. From statement 1, we know the colombian is not to the right of the person who's sport is rowing. Since the colombian is somewhere between the person drinking mirinda and the entrepreneur (statement 9), the colombian must be in position 2.
11. From statement 4, we know the colombian is on the left or right of the chinese. Since the colombian is in position 2, the chinese must be in position 1 or 3.
12. From statement 7, we know the pakistani is not to the right of the chinese. Since the pakistani is in position 1, the chinese must be in position 2 or 3.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
