1. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person drinking tea.

This means that the person who drinks tea must be on the right side of the table. Let's call this person T.

2. The writer and the person who's hobby is skydiving have different parity positions.

This means that the writer and the person who does skydiving must be on opposite sides of the table. Let's call the writer W and the person who does skydiving S.

3. The fan of hip-hop is on the right of the fan of soul.

This means that the fan of hip-hop must be on the right side of the table, and the fan of soul must be on the left side of the table.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Soul          |              |              |

From point 2, we know W and S are on opposite sides. Since T is on the right side, W must be on the left side. Let's put W on the left side:

This means that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is either the project-manager or the person who eats papaya, while the scientist is the other one.

2. The russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading

This means that the person who's hobby is reading is either the project-manager or the scientist, and the russian is to their right.

3. The person who's hobby is reading is somewhere to the left of the person eating pear##5

This means that the person who eats pear is either the project-manager or the scientist, and the person who's hobby is reading is to their left.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is either the project-manager or the person who eats papaya.
* The russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading, so the person who's hobby is reading is either the project-manager or the scientist.
* The person who eats pear is either the project-manager or the scientist, and the person who's hobby is reading is to their left.

From these clues, we can deduce the following:

* The person who's hobby is reading is the project-manager (since the russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading, and the person who eats pear is either the project-manager or the scientist).
* The person who eats pear is the scientist (since the person who's hobby is reading is the project-manager, and the person who eats pear is either the project-manager or the scientist).
* The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who eats papaya (since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is either the project-manager or the person who eats papaya, and the person who eats papaya is not the project-manager).

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot.

This means that the person eating apricot is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the owner of the turtle is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The person who's hobby is reading and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.

This means that the person who's hobby is reading is either in an odd-numbered position (1st or 3rd) or an even-numbered position (2nd). Since the owner of the turtle is in an even-numbered position (2nd or 3rd), the person who's hobby is reading must be in an even-numbered position.

3. The person who's sport is cricket and the person who's hobby is woodworking have the same parity positions.

This means that the person who's sport is cricket is either in an odd-numbered position (1st or 3rd) or an even-numbered position (2nd). Since the person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd-numbered position (1st or 3rd), the person who's sport is cricket must be in an odd-numbered position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|         |      1      |       2       |
| Food    | apricot     | asparagus   |
| Hobby   | reading     | woodworking |
| Pet     |             | turtle      |
| Sport   | cricket     | skateboarding|

The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person eating apricot, so the turtle must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. Since the person who's hobby is reading is in an even-numbered position, they must be in the 2nd position. This means the owner of the turtle is in the 3rd position.

The person who's sport is cricket is in an odd-numbered position, so they must be in the 1st position. The person who's hobby is woodworking is in an odd-numbered position, so they must be in the 1st position as well.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

1. The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
This means that the lizard owner cannot be the person driving the bus.

2. The person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even. Let's assume they are both odd (we can come back to this assumption later).

3. The owner of the lizard is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies.
This means that the lizard owner cannot be the person watching satire movies.

Now, let's fill in the table with the given information:

| Transport     |              |           |

From clue 2, we know the person eating lemon and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. Since we assumed they are both odd, the person eating lemon must be in position 1 (lizard owner).

|               |      1       |     2     |
| Food          | Lemon       |           |

| Transport     |              |           |

From clue 3, we know the lizard owner is somewhere to the left of the person watching satire movies. Since the lizard owner is already in position 1, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2.

|               |      1       |     2     |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

* The person eating cranberry must be in position 2, as they are not the lizard owner and not watching satire movies.
* The person driving the bus must be in position 2, as they are not the lizard owner and not watching satire movies.
* The person driving the motorbike must be eating lemon, as they have the same parity positions.
* The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 1, as they are not the lizard owner and not watching satire movies.

This means the Russian is either on the left of the person who prefers swimming or on the left of the person who prefers cycling. Since we don't have any other information about the Russian's position, we can't determine which sport the Russian is on the left of.

2. The owner of the rabbit is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony.

This means the owner of the pony is either on the left of the owner of the rabbit or in the same position as the owner of the rabbit. We can't determine the exact position of the owner of the pony yet.

3. The owner of the rabbit and the person eating onion have the same parity positions.

This means that if the owner of the rabbit is on an odd-numbered position, the person eating onion is also on an odd-numbered position. If the owner of the rabbit is on an even-numbered position, the person eating onion is also on an even-numbered position.

Now, let's analyze the possible positions:

* If the owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the rabbit, the owner of the pony must be on an even-numbered position (since the owner of the rabbit is on an odd-numbered position). This means the person eating onion is also on an even-numbered position.
* If the owner of the pony is in the same position as the owner of the rabbit, the owner of the pony and the owner of the rabbit are on the same parity position. This means the person eating onion is also on the same parity position as the owner of the pony and the owner of the rabbit.

Considering the above analysis, we can conclude that:

* The owner of the pony is on an even-numbered position.
* The person eating onion is on an even-numbered position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1     |     2      |
| Food          |           |            |
| Nationality   |           |            |
| Pet           |           |            |

| Pet           | Pony      | Rabbit     |
| Sport         | Cycling   | Swimming   |
#############

The final solution is:

The Indonesian eats pineapple and prefers cycling, the Russian eats onion and prefers swimming, the owner of the pony is on the left, and the owner of the rabbit is on the right."
Lv1-4x2-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The musician and the person eating peach have different parity positions.
This means that the musician is either on an odd-numbered row or the person eating peach is on an even-numbered row. Since there are only two rows, this means that the musician is on row 1 and the person eating peach is on row 2.

2. The person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person driving the bus.
This means that the person driving the bus has fishing as their hobby. Since the person driving the bus is to the right of the person with chess as their hobby, the person with chess as their hobby must be on row 1.

3. The person driving the train is the person who's hobby is chess.
This means that the person driving the train is on row 1 and has chess as their hobby.

4. The musician is on the far left.
This means that the musician is on row 1, column 1.
