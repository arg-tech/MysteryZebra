Note that the parity positions are not explicitly mentioned in the puzzle, but based on the given constraints, I inferred the correct positions."
Lv1-3x7-10	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

#############
| Food          | Job           | Movie-Genre   |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| Broccoli     | Doctor        | Drama        |
| Lemon        | Nurse         | Romance      |
| Peach        | Photographer | Musical      |
| Radish       | Pilot         | Animation    |
| Raspberry    | Teacher       | Time-Travel  |
| Spinach      | Freelancer   | Disaster     |
| Zucchini     | Writer        | Satire       |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clues 1 and 6, we know the nurse is not watching time-travel movies and the photographer is on the left of the person eating lemon.
2. From clues 2 and 9, we know the writer and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions, and the person watching drama movies is not to the left of the person eating peach.
3. From clues 4 and 22, we know the doctor is not to the left of the person watching animation movies and the person watching disaster movies is not to the left of the person eating spinach.
4. From clues 5 and 13, we know the person eating spinach is not to the left of the person watching satire movies and the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person eating zucchini.
5. From clues 10 and 14, we know the person eating zucchini is on the right of the person watching animation movies and the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching romance movies.
6. From clues 11 and 27, we know the person watching satire movies is not the freelancer and the person watching romance movies is not the person eating lemon.
7. From clues 15 and 30, we know the person watching musical movies is not to the right of the person watching time-travel movies and the person watching romance movies is not to the right of the photographer.
8. From clues 16 and 25, we know the person eating raspberry is in an odd position and the pilot is not to the left of the person eating zucchini.
9. From clues 17 and 20, we know the photographer is on the right of the freelancer and the freelancer is on the left of the photographer.
10. From clues 21 and 24, we know the teacher is somewhere between the person eating spinach and the person eating raspberry and the person eating spinach is somewhere to the left of the person watching drama movies.
11. From clues 23 and 29, we know the doctor is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies and the freelancer is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
12. From clues 31 and 32, we know the person eating spinach is the person watching disaster movies and the pilot is on the left or right of the person eating spinach.
13. From clues 33 and 36, we know the doctor is on the far left or far right and the pilot is not to the right of the photographer.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the final solution table."
