#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by analyzing the constraints that mentioned specific positions (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.). I used these to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options.
2. I then focused on the constraints that mentioned specific pairs of items (e.g., ""the person eating grapefruit is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski""). I used these to determine the relative positions of the items.
3. I repeated this process, gradually eliminating possibilities and filling in the table.
4. Finally, I used the remaining constraints to determine the final positions of the items.
