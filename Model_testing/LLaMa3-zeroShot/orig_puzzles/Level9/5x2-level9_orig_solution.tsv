Lv1-5x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of R&B is the dressmaker.
This means the dressmaker's music genre is R&B.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person watching disaster movies.
This means the person who watches disaster movies is to the right of the person who plays skateboarding.

3. The person eating asparagus and the fan country have different parity positions.
This means the person eating asparagus is either in an odd position or the fan country is in an odd position.

4. The fan country is in an even position.
This means the fan country is in an even position, which contradicts clue 3. However, we can still use this information to conclude that the fan country is in an even position.

5. The fan country is not to the right of the bartender.
This means the fan country is either to the left of the bartender or in the same position as the bartender.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Food          |               |            |

| Sport         |               |            |

From clue 1, we know the dressmaker's music genre is R&B. From clue 4, we know the fan country is in an even position, so the fan country must be in position 2.

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Food          |               |            |

| Sport         |               |            |

From clue 5, we know the fan country is not to the right of the bartender. This means the fan country must be in position 2, which is even. Therefore, the bartender must be in position 1.

|               |       1 (Bartender) |     2 (Fan Country)      |
| Food          |               |            |

| Sport         |               |            |

From clue 2, we know the person who plays skateboarding is on the left of the person who watches disaster movies. Since the bartender is in position 1, the person who plays skateboarding must be in position 1. This means the person who watches disaster movies must be in position 2.

|               |       1 (Bartender, Skateboarding) |     2 (Disaster Movies)      |

| Sport         |               |            |

From clue 3, we know the person eating asparagus and the fan country have different parity positions. Since the fan country is in an even position, the person eating asparagus must be in an odd position. Therefore, the person eating asparagus must be in position 1.

|               |       1 (Bartender, Skateboarding, Asparagus) |     2 (Fan Country, Disaster Movies)      |
| Food          | Asparagus | Plum          |

1. The analyst is not to the right of the owner of the mouse.
This means the analyst is either to the left of the mouse owner or in the same position.

2. The fan of pop and the person driving the taxi have different parity positions.
This means the fan of pop is either an odd-numbered position or the person driving the taxi is in an even-numbered position.

Lv1-5x2-7	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions.
This means that the entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different genders.

2. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is swimming.
This means that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is swimming.

3. The fan metal is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing.
This means that the fan metal is either to the left of the person who's sport is climbing or in the same position.

4. The fan metal is on the right of the fan salsa.
This means that the fan metal is to the right of the fan salsa.

5. The person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions.
This means that the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same gender.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |     1      |      2       |
| Hobby         |            |              |
| Job           |            |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |              |
| Sport         |            |              |
| Transport     |            |              |

From statement 2, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is the person who's sport is swimming. Let's assume the person who's hobby is filmmaking is in position 1. Then, the person who's sport is swimming is also in position 1.

From statement 1, we know that the entrepreneur and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in position 1, the entrepreneur must be in position 2.

From statement 5, we know that the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks have the same parity positions. Since the entrepreneur is in position 2, the person driving the bus and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks must also be in position 2.

From statement 3, we know that the fan metal is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in position 1, the fan metal must be in position 1 or 2. But from statement 4, we know that the fan metal is on the right of the fan salsa. Therefore, the fan metal must be in position 2, and the fan salsa must be in position 1.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |      2       |
| Hobby         | filmmaking | magic-tricks |

2. The person who's sport is rowing and the person eating cucumber have the same parity positions.

This means that if the person eating cucumber is on an odd-numbered row, the person playing rowing is also on an odd-numbered row. If the person eating cucumber is on an even-numbered row, the person playing rowing is also on an even-numbered row.

3. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person eating cucumber.

This means that the person eating cucumber is on the left of the person who plays chess.

4. The software-developer is the person who's sport is basketball.

This means that the person who plays basketball is also a software-developer.

Now, let's fill in the table:

1. The person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
This means that coffee cannot be in the rightmost column.

2. The person watching thriller movies is on the far right.
This means that thriller movies must be in the rightmost column.

3. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber.
This means that sailing and cucumber cannot be in the same column.

4. The person who's sport is basketball and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

5. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person driving the roller.
This means that scooter cannot be in the leftmost column.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|               |     1     |      2      |

From (1), coffee is to the left of almond-milk, so coffee must be in column 1.

From (2), thriller movies are in column 2.

From (3), sailing and cucumber cannot be in the same column, so sailing must be in column 1 and cucumber in column 2.

From (4), basketball and scooter have the same parity, so they must be in the same column. Since scooter is to the right of roller, scooter must be in column 2 and roller in column 1.

From (5), scooter is to the right of roller, so scooter is in column 2.

Now we have:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Beverage      | coffee    | almond-milk |

1. The Turkish person is not to the right of the person eating radish.
This means the Turkish person must be on the left side of the table, and the person eating radish must be on the right side.

2. The security-guard is in an even position.
This means the security-guard must be in either the 1st or 2nd position.

3. The person driving the airplane and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.
This means the person driving the airplane (Turkish) must be in an odd position, and the owner of the dog must be in an even position.

4. The person eating radish is on the far left.
This means the person eating radish is in the 1st position.

5. The Turkish person is the person driving the airplane.
This confirms that the Turkish person is in an odd position.
