From statement 10, we know that C is between the person who's sport is rowing and the person who's hobby is dancing. Let's call the person who's sport is rowing ""R"" and the person who's hobby is dancing ""D"".

From statement 5, we know that R is on the left of C. From statement 10, we know that C is between R and D, so D must be on the right of C.

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking coffee and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions. Since D is on the right of C, the person drinking coffee must be on the right of C as well.

From statement 9, we know that the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Let's call the person who's hobby is woodworking ""W"". Since the person drinking coffee is on the right of C, W must be on the right of C as well.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is somewhere to the left of the person drinking 7up. Let's call the person drinking 7up ""S"". Since W is on the right of C, S must be on the left of C.

From statement 3, we know that the person who's hobby is camping (C) is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. This means that the person who's hobby is chess must be on the left of C.

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey (C) and the person who's hobby is chess have different parity positions. Since C is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is chess must be on the left of C.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's sport is sailing is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up (S). Since S is on the left of C, the person who's sport is sailing must be on the left of S.

From statement 7, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking 7up (S). Since S is on the left of C, the person drinking water must be on the left of S.

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Sport      |        |            |         |             |

From the above deductions, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Hobby      | Camping | Chess     | Dancing | Woodworking |
| Sport      | Ice-hockey | Rowing    | Lacrosse | Sailing |

#############

Note that the parity positions of the people are not explicitly stated in the puzzle, but we can infer them based on the above deductions. The person drinking coffee and the person who's hobby is dancing have the same parity positions, which means they are either both odd or both even. Since the person drinking coffee is on the right of C, and C is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess, the person who's hobby is dancing must be on the right of C as well. This means that the person drinking coffee and the person who's hobby is dancing are both odd."

From statement 5, we know the nigerian is not to the right of the fan techno. Since the nigerian is to the right of the fan disco, the fan techno must be to the right of the nigerian.

From statement 8, we know the person driving the train is somewhere to the left of the polish. Since the polish is not to the left of the fan techno (from statement 3), the person driving the train must be to the left of the polish.

From statement 12, we know the person driving the skateboard and the fan techno have the same parity positions. Since the fan techno is to the right of the nigerian, the person driving the skateboard must also be to the right of the nigerian.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gospel | Mexican | Skateboard |
| Disco | Nigerian | Jet-ski |
| Electronic | Polish | Train |
| Techno | Turkish | Quad-bike |
#############

Here's the reasoning:

* The mexican is on the far left, so the gospel music genre must be assigned to the mexican.
* The nigerian is to the right of the fan disco, so the nigerian must be assigned to the disco music genre.
* The polish is to the left of the fan techno, so the polish must be assigned to the electronic music genre.
* The person driving the train is to the left of the polish, so the train must be assigned to the polish.
* The person driving the jet-ski is in an even position, so the jet-ski must be assigned to the nigerian.
* The person driving the skateboard is to the right of the nigerian, so the skateboard must be assigned to the turkish.
* The fan techno is to the right of the nigerian, so the fan techno must be assigned to the turkish.

Note that this solution satisfies all the given statements."

| Nationality   | Japanese | British|          | Spanish  |

From statement 5, we know that the fan of ambient is not Japanese. Let's place the fan of ambient in the third column, since the Japanese person is already placed.

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |     4     |
| Food          |            | British| Japanese|           |

The final solution is:

#############
| Food          |            | British| Japanese| Watermelon|

| Nationality   |            | British|          | Spanish  |
#############

Note that the fan of dubstep is not explicitly placed, but it can be inferred that the fan of dubstep is the Spanish person, since the Spanish person is the only one left to be placed and the fan of dubstep has different parity positions with the Spanish person."
Lv1-3x4-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 3, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is the person who's sport is skiing. This means that the person who's hobby is chess must be in position 1.

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person who's hobby is chess is in position 1, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 2 or 3.
