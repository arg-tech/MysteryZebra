Lv1-2x5-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.

From clue 4, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the owner of the pony.

From clue 6, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.

Combining these clues, we can conclude that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the pony, and the owner of the hedgehog is also on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. This means the owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere between the person who's sport is cycling and the owner of the mouse.

From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person who's sport is rowing.

Combining these clues, we can conclude that the person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person who's sport is rowing, and also between the person who's sport is cycling and the owner of the mouse. This means the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball, and the owner of the mouse is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball.

From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.

From clue 8, we know the owner of the hedgehog is not the person who's sport is snowboarding.

From clue 9, we know the owner of the rat is on the far left or far right.

From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is somewhere to the right of the owner of the pony.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|         |    1     |    2     |     3      |   4    |      5       |

| Sport   |          |          |            |        |              |

From the above analysis, we can conclude that:

* The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon.
* The owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.
* The person who's sport is volleyball is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person who's sport is rowing.

Lv1-2x5-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is collecting is in an odd position##4
This means the collecting person is in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere between the person eating carrot and the person who's hobby is reading##7
This means the fishing person is in positions 2, 3, or 4.

3. The person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing##3
This means the camping person is in positions 1, 2, or 5.

4. The person who's hobby is fishing is somewhere between the person eating carrot and the person who's hobby is reading##7
This is the same as statement 2.

5. The person eating asparagus is the person who's hobby is camping
This means the camping person is eating asparagus.

6. The person eating banana is in the middle
This means the banana person is in position 3.

7. The person eating zucchini is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting##3
This means the zucchini person is in positions 1 or 5.

8. The person eating asparagus and the person who's hobby is collecting have different parity positions##9
This means the collecting person is in an odd position, and the asparagus person is in an even position.

9. The person eating asparagus and the person who's hobby is fishing have different parity positions##9
This means the fishing person is in an even position.

10. The person who's hobby is camping is not to the right of the person eating asparagus##8
This means the camping person is in position 1 or 3.

11. The person who's hobby is fishing is not to the right of the person eating orange##8
This means the orange person is in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The camping person is eating asparagus and is in position 1 or 3.
* The banana person is in position 3.
* The zucchini person is in positions 1 or 5.
* The collecting person is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
* The fishing person is in an even position and is between the carrot and reading people.
* The orange person is in position 1 or 2.

From statement 6, we know the banana person is in the middle, so the orange person must be in position 2.

From statement 5, we know the camping person is eating asparagus, so the asparagus person must be in position 1.

From statement 7, we know the zucchini person is in positions 1 or 5, but since the asparagus person is in position 1, the zucchini person must be in position 5.

From statement 2, we know the fishing person is between the carrot and reading people. Since the orange person is in position 2, the carrot person must be in position 1, and the reading person must be in position 4.

From statement 3, we know the camping person is on the left or right of the writing person. Since the camping person is in position 1, the writing person must be in position 2.

From statement 1, we know the collecting person is in an odd position. Since the camping person is in position 1, the collecting person must be in position 3.

Now, we can fill in the table:

#############
|         |    1    |     2     |    3    |    4     |     5      |
| Food    | Asparagus | Orange  | Banana  | Carrot  | Zucchini  |
| Hobby   | Camping  | Writing | Collect | Fishing  | Reading   |

The final solution is:

The person eating asparagus is camping, the person eating orange is writing, the person eating banana is in the middle, the person eating carrot is reading, and the person eating zucchini is fishing."

From statement 12, we know the Colombian and the person who's sport is handball have different parity positions. Since the Colombian is to the right of the handball position, the handball position must be in an even position (2 or 4).

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |    4     |     5     |

From the above deductions, we can fill in the table as follows:

|               |     1      |    2     |     3      |    4     |     5     |

| British      |            |          | Water-Polo |          |           |
