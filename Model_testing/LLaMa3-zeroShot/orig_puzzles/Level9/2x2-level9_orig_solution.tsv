Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is rowing is in an odd position.
This means that the rowing person is either in position 1 or position 3.

2. The person eating raspberry and the person who's sport is rowing have the same parity positions.
This means that both the raspberry-eater and the rowing person have the same position (either odd or even).

From the above statements, we can conclude that:

* The rowing person is in an odd position (1 or 3).
* The raspberry-eater is also in an odd position (1 or 3).
* The person eating grapes is in an even position (2).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |     1     |    2    |
| Food    |           |         |
| Sport   |           |         |
#############
| Food    | Grapes   | Raspberry |
| Sport   | Rowing   | Parkour   |
#############

The final solution is:

The person eating grapes is in position 2, and the person eating raspberry is in position 1 (since the rowing person is in an odd position). The sport for position 1 is rowing, and the sport for position 2 is parkour."
Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The person drinking 7up is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
This means that milk must be in the leftmost column, and 7up must be in the rightmost column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage   |  Milk    |  7up     |
| Food       |  Asparagus |  Pineapple |
#############

The first clue tells us that the person drinking 7up and the person eating asparagus have the same parity positions. Since 7up is in the rightmost column, the person eating asparagus must also be in the rightmost column. This means that pineapple must be in the leftmost column.

The second clue tells us that milk is in the leftmost column, and 7up is in the rightmost column. This confirms our previous conclusion.

The final solution table is:

#############
|            |     1     |     2     |
| Beverage   |  Milk    |  7up     |
| Food       |  Asparagus |  Pineapple |

Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: folk, r&b
This means that each person prefers one of these two genres.

2. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, ice-hockey
This means that each person prefers one of these two sports.

3. The fan of folk and the person who's sport is cycling have different parity positions
This means that the person who prefers folk music and the person who prefers cycling as a sport have different genders (male or female).

4. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling
This means that the person who prefers ice-hockey as a sport is to the right of the person who prefers cycling as a sport.

Now, let's create a table to represent the puzzle:

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |
| Sport         |         |            |

We can start by placing the person who prefers ice-hockey as a sport on the right, since that's what the puzzle tells us.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |         |            |
| Sport         | Cycling | Ice-Hockey |

Next, we can place the person who prefers folk music. Since they have different parity positions with the person who prefers cycling, we can assume that the person who prefers folk music is the opposite gender of the person who prefers cycling.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Folk    | R&B      |
| Sport         | Cycling | Ice-Hockey |

Finally, we can place the person who prefers R&B music. Since they have the same gender as the person who prefers cycling, we can assume that they are the same gender.

|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Folk    | R&B      |
| Sport         | Cycling | Ice-Hockey |

The final solution table is:

#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | Folk    | R&B      |
| Sport         | Cycling | Ice-Hockey |

Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour.

This means that the swimming person is adjacent to the parkour person. Let's assume the swimming person is on the left for now.

2. The mexican and the person who's sport is swimming have different parity positions.

This means that the mexican person has an even position (1 or 2) if the swimming person has an odd position, and vice versa. Since we assumed the swimming person is on the left, the mexican person must be on the right.

3. The argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour.

This means that the argentine person is on the right, and since the mexican person is already on the right, the argentine person must be on the far right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1    |     2     |
| Nationality   |         |           |
| Sport         |         |           |
#############
| Argentine    |         | Parkour  |
| Mexican      | Swimming |           |
#############

The solution is:

The Argentine person prefers parkour, and the Mexican person prefers swimming."
Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking sprite and the person who's hobby is gardening have different parity positions.
This means that if the person drinking sprite is odd-numbered, the person who's hobby is gardening is even-numbered, and vice versa.

2. The person drinking sprite is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
This means that the person drinking sprite is either in position 1 or 2, and the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 2 or 1, respectively.

From clue 2, we can conclude that the person drinking sprite is in position 1, and the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 2.

Now, let's consider the beverages. We know that there are 2 different favourite beverages: iced-tea, sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 1, the person in position 2 must be drinking iced-tea.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |  Sprite    |  Iced-Tea  |
| Hobby      |  Woodworking|  Gardening|
#############

So, the person in position 1 drinks sprite and has woodworking as their hobby, and the person in position 2 drinks iced-tea and has gardening as their hobby."
Lv1-2x2-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon.
This means that the person eating pineapple is either in the ""Food"" row, 1st column, or in the ""Pet"" row, 1st column.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   |           |        |
| Pet    |           |        |

From statement 2, we know the person eating pineapple is either in the ""Food"" row, 1st column, or in the ""Pet"" row, 1st column. Let's try to place the person eating pineapple in the ""Food"" row, 1st column:

|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple |        |
| Pet    |           |        |

Now, from statement 1, we know the owner of the dog and the person eating pineapple have the same parity positions. This means that either both are odd or both are even. Since the person eating pineapple is eating pineapple, let's assume they are even. This means the owner of the dog is also even.

Since the person eating pineapple is in the ""Food"" row, 1st column, the owner of the dog must be in the ""Pet"" row, 1st column. This means the dog is the pet in the 1st column.

|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple |        |
| Pet    | Dog       |        |

Now, let's try to place the person eating lemon. From statement 2, we know the person eating pineapple is on the left of the person eating lemon. This means the person eating lemon must be in the ""Food"" row, 2nd column or in the ""Pet"" row, 2nd column.

Since the person eating pineapple is eating pineapple, let's assume they are even. This means the person eating lemon must be odd. This means the person eating lemon is either in the ""Food"" row, 2nd column or in the ""Pet"" row, 2nd column.

Let's place the person eating lemon in the ""Food"" row, 2nd column:

|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple | Lemon  |
| Pet    | Dog       |        |

Now, the only remaining space is in the ""Pet"" row, 2nd column. Since the ferret is the only remaining pet, let's place it there:

|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple | Lemon  |
| Pet    | Dog       | Ferret |

The final solution is:

#############
|        |     1     |   2    |
| Food   | Pineapple | Lemon  |
| Pet    | Dog       | Ferret |

Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fisherman and the owner of the rat have different parity positions.
This means that if the fisherman is in an odd position, the owner of the rat is in an even position, and vice versa.

2. The owner of the snake is in an odd position.
This means that the snake owner is in either position 1 or position 3.

From clue 2, we know the snake owner is in an odd position. Since there are only two odd positions (1 and 3), the snake owner must be in position 1.

Now, let's consider the fisherman. If the fisherman is in position 1, the owner of the rat would be in position 2, which is an even position. But we know the owner of the rat has a different parity position, so the fisherman cannot be in position 1. Therefore, the fisherman must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|       |     1     |   3   |
| Job   |           |       |
| Pet   |           |       |

The snake owner is in position 1, so the snake must be in position 1. The fisherman is in position 3, so the rat must be in position 3.

Here is the final solution:

#############
|       |     1     |   3   |
| Job   | Nurse    | Fisherman |
| Pet   | Snake    | Rat      |
#############

The nurse owns the snake, and the fisherman owns the rat."
Lv1-2x2-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate and the person driving the roller have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee.
This means that the person drinking coffee must be in the leftmost position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    |           |               |
| Transport   |           |               |

Since the person drinking coffee is in the leftmost position, we can start by placing the coffee drinker there:

|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee   |               |
| Transport   |           |               |

Now, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person drinking coffee, so we can place the hot-chocolate drinker in the rightmost position:

|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee   | Hot-Chocolate |
| Transport   |           |               |

Finally, we need to determine the transport modes. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person driving the roller have the same parity positions, we can conclude that either both are odd or both are even. Since the person drinking coffee is in the leftmost position, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the rightmost position, which means they are driving the quad-bike (since the roller is already taken by the coffee drinker). Therefore, the roller is driven by the person drinking coffee:

|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee   | Hot-Chocolate |
| Transport   | Roller   | Quad-Bike    |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|             |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage    | Coffee   | Hot-Chocolate |
| Transport   | Roller   | Quad-Bike    |

Lv1-2x2-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: family, satire
This means we have two people, each preferring one of the two genres.

2. The people use 2 different means of transport: car, motorbike
This means we have two people, each using one of the two means of transport.

3. The person watching satire movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching family movies
This means the order of the people is: family,?, satire

4. The person driving the car and the person watching satire movies have different parity positions
This means the person driving the car has an even parity (i.e., they are the second person), and the person watching satire movies has an odd parity (i.e., they are the first or third person).

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The person watching satire movies is the first or third person (odd parity).
* The person driving the car is the second person (even parity).
* The order of the people is: family,?, satire.

We can conclude that the person watching satire movies is the first person, and the person driving the car is the second person. This means the person watching family movies is the third person.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############

The person watching satire movies uses a motorbike, and the person watching family movies uses a car."
Lv1-2x2-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating apricot and the Indonesian have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot.
This means that the person eating carrot cannot be in the first position.

From these clues, we can start filling in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |
| Food          |            |         |
| Nationality   |            |         |

Since the person eating apricot and the Indonesian have the same parity positions, let's assume they are both even. This means the person eating apricot is in the even position (2).

|               |     1      |    2    |
| Food          |            |         |
| Nationality   |            |         |

The person eating carrot is somewhere to the right of the person eating apricot, so they must be in the first position (1).

|               |     1      |    2    |
| Food          | Carrot    | Apricot  |
| Nationality   | British   | Indonesian |

Now we can fill in the remaining cells:
