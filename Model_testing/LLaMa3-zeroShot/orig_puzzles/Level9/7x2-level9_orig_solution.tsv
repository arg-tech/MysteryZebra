Lv1-7x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Polish person is not to the right of the lawyer.
2. The person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
3. The person eating avocado is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.
4. The person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
5. The Polish person is drinking iced-tea.
6. The person watching spy movies and the person eating cabbage have the same parity positions.
7. The person eating avocado is not to the right of the lawyer.

From statement 1, we know the Polish person is not to the right of the lawyer. Let's assume the lawyer is on the left side of the table. Then, the Polish person must be on the right side.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the Polish person is drinking iced-tea (statement 5), the person drinking almond-milk must be on the right side.

From statement 3, we know the person eating avocado is to the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is to the left of the person drinking almond-milk, the person eating avocado must be on the right side.

From statement 4, we know the person eating cabbage is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is not specified, we can't determine the exact position of the person eating cabbage.

From statement 5, we know the Polish person is drinking iced-tea.

From statement 6, we know the person watching spy movies and the person eating cabbage have the same parity positions. Since the person eating cabbage's position is unknown, we can't determine the exact position of the person watching spy movies.

From statement 7, we know the person eating avocado is not to the right of the lawyer. Since the lawyer is on the left side, the person eating avocado must be on the right side.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-7x2-4	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The pilot is in an odd position, so the pilot must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.
2. The person eating garlic is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret. This means the owner of the ferret cannot be in the 1st or 3rd position, as the pilot is already occupying one of those positions. Therefore, the owner of the ferret must be in the 2nd or 4th position.
3. The person watching mystery movies is on the left of the German. This means the German must be in an even position (2nd or 4th), and the person watching mystery movies must be in an odd position (1st or 3rd).

5. The owner of the fish is somewhere to the left of the fan of reggae. This means the fan of reggae must be in an even position (2nd or 4th), and the owner of the fish must be in an odd position (1st or 3rd).

Now, let's start filling in the table:

From clue 4, we know the owner of the ferret and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the ferret is in an even position, the person drinking soy-milk must also be in an even position. Let's put the person drinking soy-milk in the 2nd position.

Lv1-7x2-5	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the Indonesian is not to the right of the fan of disco. This means that the Indonesian must be to the left of the fan of disco.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left. This means that the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in the first column.

From clue 3, we know that the Canadian is not to the left of the person drinking cola. This means that the Canadian must be to the right of the person drinking cola.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person drinking cola. This means that the person driving the skateboard must be in the first column, and the person drinking cola must be in the second column.

From clue 5, we know that the owner of the mouse and the person eating onion have different parity positions. This means that the owner of the mouse must be on an odd-numbered row, and the person eating onion must be on an even-numbered row.

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the Canadian. This means that the owner of the pony must be in the same column as the Canadian.

From clue 7, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person eating onion. This means that the fan of hip-hop must be in the third column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1       |    2     |    3     |

* The fan of disco must be in the first column, since the Indonesian is not to the right of the fan of disco.
* The fan of hip-hop must be in the third column, since the person eating onion is in the second column and the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person eating onion.
* The Canadian must be in the third column, since the person drinking cola is in the second column and the Canadian is not to the left of the person drinking cola.
* The owner of the pony must be in the third column, since the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the Canadian.
* The person driving the skateboard must be in the first column, since the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person drinking cola.

Lv1-7x2-6	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the electrician is to the right of the person who plays tennis. Let's assume the electrician is in the 2nd column and the person who plays tennis is in the 1st column.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking sprite and the person watching horror movies have the same parity positions. Since there are only 2 columns, this means that the person drinking sprite and the person watching horror movies are in the same column.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the person who plays tennis. Since the electrician is to the right of the person who plays tennis, the person watching disaster movies must be in the 2nd column.

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is not a fan of rock music. This means that the owner of the hedgehog must be in the 1st column.

From clue 5, we know that the Japanese person is not to the right of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is not yet determined, we can't conclude anything about the Japanese person's position.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching disaster movies and the owner of the hedgehog have the same parity positions. Since the person watching disaster movies is in the 2nd column, the owner of the hedgehog must also be in the 2nd column.

Now we can start filling in the table:

| Sport         | Tennis      |             |

Next, we can determine the music genre and beverage preferences. Since the owner of the hedgehog is not a fan of rock music, the owner of the hedgehog must be a fan of gospel music. The person who watches disaster movies is in the 2nd column, so they must be the fan of rock music. The person who drinks sprite is in the same column as the person who watches horror movies, so they must be the fan of sprite.
