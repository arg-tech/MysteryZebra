Lv1-4x4-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 11, we know that the person eating nectarine is the person who's sport is cricket.

From statement 1, we know that the person eating broccoli and the nurse have different parity positions. Since the person eating nectarine is cricket, and cricket is not mentioned in statement 1, we can conclude that the person eating broccoli is not the nurse.

From statement 2, we know that the bartender is somewhere to the left of the person eating broccoli. Since the person eating broccoli is not the nurse, and the nurse is not to the left of the owner of the goat (statement 7), the bartender must be to the left of the owner of the goat.

From statement 6, we know that the bartender and the owner of the goat have different parity positions. Since the bartender is to the left of the owner of the goat, the owner of the goat must be the one eating broccoli.

From statement 13, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left of the person eating garlic. Since the owner of the goat is eating broccoli, the owner of the fish must be to the left of the person eating garlic.

Since the owner of the fish is to the left of the person eating garlic, and the owner of the goat is eating broccoli, the owner of the hamster must be between the owner of the mouse and the person who's sport is baseball.

From statement 10, we know that the pilot is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the pilot is not the owner of the mouse (statement 9), the pilot must be to the right of the person who's sport is sailing.

From statement 3, we know that the person eating grapefruit and the person who's sport is baseball have different parity positions. Since the person eating grapefruit is to the right of the person eating garlic, and the person who's sport is baseball is to the right of the owner of the hamster, the person who's sport is baseball must be to the right of the person eating grapefruit.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person who's sport is rowing is in an even position, so they must be in position 2 or 4.
2. From statement 5, we know the person driving the helicopter is somewhere to the right of the person eating radish. Since the person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography (statement 2), the person driving the helicopter must be in position 4.
3. From statement 4, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles and the person driving the helicopter have the same parity positions. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 4, the person who's hobby is puzzles must also be in position 4.
4. From statement 9, we know the person who's hobby is gardening and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is rowing is in an even position (statement 1), the person who's hobby is gardening must be in an odd position. This means the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 1.
5. From statement 10, we know the person eating avocado and the person who's sport is rowing have different parity positions. Since the person who's sport is rowing is in an even position (statement 1), the person eating avocado must be in an odd position. This means the person eating avocado must be in position 3.
6. From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is not the person driving the trike. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in position 4 (from statement 4), the person driving the trike must be in position 1.
7. From statement 12, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is not to the left of the person driving the helicopter. Since the person driving the helicopter is in position 4, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 3 or 4. However, statement 6 says the person who's sport is weightlifting is not the person driving the trike, so the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 3.
8. From statement 13, we know the person eating radish is not to the left of the person eating lemon. Since the person eating radish is in position 1 (from statement 4), the person eating lemon must be in position 2.
9. From statement 14, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person eating cucumber. Since the person eating cucumber is in position 2 (from statement 13), the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 1 or 3. However, statement 16 says the person who's sport is water-polo is not to the right of the person eating lemon, so the person who's sport is skateboarding must be in position 1.
10. From statement 15, we know the person eating cucumber is not to the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person eating cucumber is in position 2, the person who's sport is weightlifting must be in position 3 (from statement 12).
11. From statement 17, we know the person eating avocado is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the person eating avocado is in position 3, the person driving the jet-ski must be in position 4.
12. From statement 18, we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since the person driving the roller is not in position 1 (from statement 7), it must be in position 2.
