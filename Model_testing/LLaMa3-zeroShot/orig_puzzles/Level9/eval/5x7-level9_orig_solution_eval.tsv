Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left, and from statement 14, we know the owner of the bird is in an odd position. Since the bird owner is in an odd position, they must be in position 1.
* From statement 13, we know the person eating pomegranate is the person drinking milk. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left, they must be the one eating pomegranate and drinking milk.
* From statement 4, we know the owner of the cat is somewhere to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is not the owner of the ferret (statement 6), the owner of the cat must be in position 4.
* From statement 10, we know the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is in position 4, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 5.
* From statement 11, we know the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is collecting. Since the owner of the cat is in position 4, the person who's hobby is collecting must be in position 3.
* From statement 8, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is between the person drinking juice and the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 2.
* From statement 31, we know the person drinking tea is the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin (statement 34), the person drinking tea must be in position 6.
* From statement 29, we know the owner of the ferret is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since the person eating pumpkin is in position 6, the owner of the ferret must be in position 7.
* From statement 45, we know the person eating eggplant is the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person who's sport is tennis is not the person who's hobby is writing (statement 15), the person eating eggplant must be in position 5.
* From statement 46, we know the owner of the hedgehog is somewhere to the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating eggplant is in position 5, the owner of the hedgehog must be in position 4.
