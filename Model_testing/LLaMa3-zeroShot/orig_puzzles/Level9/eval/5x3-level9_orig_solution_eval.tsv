2. The fan of jazz is somewhere to the right of the person watching western movies.
3. The person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies.

7. The person watching western movies and the person eating corn have different parity positions.
8. The accountant is the fan of jazz.
9. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the pilot.

From statement 5, we know the engineer's hobby is dancing. From statement 9, we know the engineer is on the left of the pilot. This means the pilot's job is not engineer.

From statement 8, we know the accountant is the fan of jazz. This means the accountant's music preference is jazz.

From statement 2, we know the fan of jazz is to the right of the person watching western movies. This means the person watching western movies is not the accountant.

From statement 7, we know the person watching western movies and the person eating corn have different parity positions. This means the person eating corn is on the left of the person watching western movies.

From statement 3, we know the person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies. This means the order is: pumpkin, watermelon, spy movies.

From statement 1, we know the person eating corn is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating watermelon is between the person eating pumpkin and the person watching spy movies, the person eating corn must be on the far left.

Now we can start filling in the table:

From clue 8, we know that the person watching epic movies is not to the right of the person drinking juice. This means that the person watching epic movies must be to the left of the person drinking juice.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is the police-officer. This means that the person who's hobby is singing is also the police-officer.

Now, let's try to fill in the table. We know that the teacher is to the left of the person watching epic movies, and the police-officer is to the right of the teacher. This means that the teacher must be in the top-left corner, and the police-officer must be in the top-right corner.

We also know that the person who's hobby is singing is the police-officer, and the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the person driving the ship.

We can now start filling in the table:

We can now start making some more deductions. From clue 5, we know that the person drinking tea is between the person driving the car and the person drinking water. This means that the person drinking tea must be in the middle row.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is singing is not to the right of the person drinking tea. This means that the person who's hobby is singing must be in the top-right corner.

From clue 8, we know that the person watching epic movies is not to the right of the person drinking juice. This means that the person watching epic movies must be in the top-left corner.
