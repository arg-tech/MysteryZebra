Lv1-6x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is to the left of the photographer. Let's assume the photographer is in the 2nd column. Then, the taxi driver must be in the 1st column.

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking sprite is to the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Let's assume the person with the hobby of baking is in the 1st column. Then, the person drinking sprite must be in the 3rd or 4th column.

From clue 3, we know that the French person is to the right of the American. Let's assume the American is in the 1st column. Then, the French person must be in the 2nd or 3rd column.

From clue 4, we know that the person watching documentary movies and the person who's hobby is baking have the same parity positions. Since the person with the hobby of baking is assumed to be in the 1st column, the person watching documentary movies must also be in the 1st column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |       2       |

| Movie-Genre   |  Documentary|  Thriller   |
| Nationality   |  American  |  French     |
| Transport     |  Taxi      |  Helicopter |
#############

Here's the solution:

* The person driving the taxi is in the 1st column, which is the American fisherman.
* The person drinking sprite is in the 3rd column, which is the French photographer.
* The person with the hobby of baking is in the 1st column, which is the American fisherman.

This means that the bus driver cannot be the person who plays video-games.

2. The project-manager is on the right of the person drinking tea.
This means that the project-manager cannot be the person who drinks hot-chocolate (since the other person who drinks tea is already on the left).

This means that the fan r&b must be on the left of the person who plays video-games.

This means that the person who plays video-games must be on the left of the fan r&b.

5. The owner of the dog and the person who's hobby is video-games have different parity positions.
This means that the owner of the dog must be on the opposite side of the person who plays video-games.

From statement 1, we know the pony owner is on the right of the R&B fan. Let's assume the pony owner is on the rightmost position.

From statement 5, we know the person eating kiwi is driving the train. Since the train is not mentioned in the other statements, we can place the kiwi eater in the train column.

From statement 4, we know the kiwi eater is not to the right of the horror movie fan. Since the kiwi eater is already placed in the train column, the horror movie fan must be to the left of the kiwi eater.

From statement 2, we know the banana eater is to the left of the horror movie fan. Since the kiwi eater is already placed in the train column, the banana eater must be in the 1st column.

From statement 3, we know the cycling sport and quad-bike transport have different parity positions. Since the kiwi eater is already placed in the train column, the cycling sport must be in the 2nd column.

From statement 7, we know the R&B fan is not to the left of the horror movie fan. Since the pony owner is on the right of the R&B fan, the pony owner must be in the 4th column.

From statement 1, we know the pony owner is on the right of the R&B fan. Since the pony owner is already placed in the 4th column, the R&B fan must be in the 3rd column.

If the owner of the snake is on the right, the person driving the tram is also on the right.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. Let's call the person who's hobby is sudoku ""S"" and the person watching zombie movies ""ZM"". This means that either S is on the left of ZM or they are in the same position.
