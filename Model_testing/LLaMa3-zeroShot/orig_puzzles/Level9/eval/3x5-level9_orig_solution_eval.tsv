| Transport   |  Train   | Trike   | Subway     | Quad-Bike| Scooter  |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 5, we know the person drinking coffee and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. Since the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person drinking coffee (statement 1), the person drinking coffee must be in an even position.
2. From statement 14, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the person driving the trike (statement 12), the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 1.
3. From statement 4, we know the person drinking sprite is somewhere to the left of the owner of the rat. Since the person drinking sprite is not to the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (statement 10) and not to the right of the person drinking lemonade (statement 16), the person drinking sprite must be in position 4.
4. From statement 18, we know the person drinking coffee and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions. Since the person drinking coffee is in an even position, the owner of the rabbit must be in an odd position.
5. From statement 2, we know the person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position, the person driving the scooter must be in an even position.
6. From statement 15, we know the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the train is in position 1, the person driving the subway must be in position 3.
7. From statement 9, we know the person driving the train is somewhere to the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the person drinking mirinda is not in position 1, it must be in position 2.
8. From statement 11, we know the person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person driving the trike. Since the person driving the scooter is in an even position, the person driving the trike must be in an odd position.
9. From statement 17, we know the person drinking lemonade is not to the left of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5.
10. From statement 3, we know the person driving the subway is somewhere to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 5, the person driving the subway must be in position 3.
11. From statement 6, we know the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person drinking sprite. Since the person drinking sprite is in position 4, the owner of the cat must be in position 3 or 5.
12. From statement 8, we know the owner of the guinea-pig is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the rat is in position 4, the owner of the guinea-pig must be in position 3 or 5.
13. From statement 19, we know the owner of the rat and the person driving the quad-bike have different parity positions. Since the person driving the quad-bike is in position 5, the owner of the rat must be in an even position.

14. From clue 8, we know the librarian and the person driving the motorbike have different parity positions.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the final solution. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the mouse, so the owner of the mouse must be the chef. The owner of the bird is not to the left of the owner of the mouse, so the owner of the bird must be the librarian. The owner of the rat is somewhere to the right of the owner of the bird, so the owner of the rat must be the doctor. The person driving the snowmobile is the coach, and the person driving the subway is on the far left.

Lv1-3x5-6	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Let's denote the person watching drama movies as D and the person watching time-travel movies as T. Then, we can write:

D > T

From clue 9, we know that T is to the left of D. This confirms our previous deduction.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching adventure movies is not to the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Let's denote the person watching adventure movies as A and the person who's hobby is skydiving as S. Then, we can write:

A ≥ S

From clue 10, we know that A is on the left or right of S. Since A ≥ S, we can conclude that A is either to the left or to the right of S.

From clue 4, we know that A is in an even position. Since A ≥ S, we can conclude that A is in an even position to the right of S.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is between S and T. Let's denote the person who's hobby is drawing as D. Then, we can write:

S < D < T

From clue 6, we know that the fan of country music is to the left of the fan of r&b. Let's denote the fan of country music as C and the fan of r&b as R. Then, we can write:

C < R

From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is to the right of the person watching musical movies. Let's denote the person watching musical movies as M. Then, we can write:

S > M

From clue 8, we know that the fan of country music is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Let's denote the person who's hobby is board-games as B. Then, we can write:

C < B

From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Let's denote the person who's hobby is baking as K. Then, we can write:

K > B

From clue 12, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is in an odd position. Since T is in an odd position, we can conclude that T is in position 1 or 3.

From clue 13, we know that the fan of r&b is in an even position. Since R is in an even position, we can conclude that R is in position 2 or 4.

From clue 14, we know that the fan of classical music is the person watching musical movies. Let's denote the fan of classical music as F. Then, we can write:

F = M

From clue 15, we know that the person who's hobby is baking and the fan of r&b have different parity positions. Since K > B and R is in an even position, we can conclude that K is in an odd position.

From clue 16, we know that the fan of funk is not the person watching drama movies. Let's denote the fan of funk as G. Then, we can write:

G ≠ D

Now, let's summarize the information we have:

* D > T
* A ≥ S
* A is in an even position to the right of S
* S < D < T
* C < R
* S > M
* C < B
* K > B
* T is in an odd position
* R is in an even position
* F = M
* K is in an odd position
* G ≠ D

We can now start filling in the table:

From the clues, we know that T is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1. Since D > T, D must be in position 3. Since A ≥ S and A is in an even position to the right of S, A must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is between S and T. Since D is in position 3, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of country music is to the left of the fan of r&b. Since R is in an even position, it must be in position 4. Since C < R, C must be in position 2.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is to the right of the person watching musical movies. Since M = F, M must be in position 5.

From clue 8, we know that the fan of country music is to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since B is in position 2, C must be in position 1.

From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is baking is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since B is in position 2, K must be in position 5.

From clue 12, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is in an odd position. Since T is in position 1, it must be watching time-travel movies.

From clue 14, we know that the fan of classical music is the person watching musical movies. Since M = F, M must be watching musical movies.
