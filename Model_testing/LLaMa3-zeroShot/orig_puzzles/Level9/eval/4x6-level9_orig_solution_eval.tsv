| Pet           |  fish     |  mouse   |  hedgehog    |  rabbit   |  ferret     |  horse     |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 37, we know the person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the fish.
2. From statement 29, we know the pilot and the person watching fantasy movies have the same parity positions. Since the pilot is in an even position (statement 22), the person watching fantasy movies must also be in an even position.
3. From statement 24, we know the chef is the person drinking coffee. Since the chef is not to the left of the person watching scientific movies (statement 1), the person watching scientific movies must be in an even position.
4. From statement 25, we know the person watching spy movies is not to the left of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in an odd position (statement 7), the person watching spy movies must be in an even position.
5. From statement 30, we know the person watching spy movies and the owner of the rabbit have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the rabbit is in an even position (statement 15), the person watching spy movies must also be in an even position.
6. From statement 26, we know the owner of the ferret is the person drinking milk. Since the owner of the ferret is the security-guard (statement 12), the person drinking milk must be the security-guard.
7. From statement 34, we know the teacher is on the left or right of the bartender. Since the teacher is in an even position (statement 13), the bartender must be in an odd position.
8. From statement 18, we know the person drinking almond-milk is not the person watching spy movies. Since the person drinking almond-milk is in an even position (statement 27), the person watching spy movies must be in an odd position.
9. From statement 20, we know the owner of the rabbit is not to the right of the person drinking 7up. Since the owner of the rabbit is in an even position (statement 15), the person drinking 7up must be in an odd position.
10. From statement 21, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left of the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur is in an odd position, the person drinking 7up must be in an even position, which contradicts the previous conclusion. Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be the entrepreneur.
11. From statement 11, we know the owner of the horse is in an odd position. Since the owner of the horse is not the person watching superhero movies (statement 10), the owner of the horse must be the person drinking 7up (entrepreneur).
12. From statement 16, we know the person drinking fanta is the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching zombie movies is the bartender (statement 19), the person drinking fanta must be the bartender.
13. From statement 28, we know the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since the person drinking fanta is the bartender, the person drinking iced-tea must be the owner of the fish (statement 37).
14. From statement 33, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is the security-guard, the person watching fantasy movies must be in an even position.
15. From statement 36, we know the person drinking iced-tea is not to the left of the bartender. Since the person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the fish, the bartender must be in an even position.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the rest of the table to arrive at the final solution."	{'beverage': ['iced-tea', 'fanta', 'milk', '7up', 'coffee', 'almond-milk'], 'job': ['pilot', 'teacher', 'security-guard', 'chef', 'entrepreneur', 'bartender'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'superhero', 'fantasy', 'spy', 'scientific', 'zombie'], 'pet': ['fish', 'mouse', 'hedgehog', 'rabbit', 'ferret', 'horse']}	True	7	False
