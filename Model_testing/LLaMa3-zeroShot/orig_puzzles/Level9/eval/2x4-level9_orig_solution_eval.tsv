Lv1-2x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the rat is not to the right of the owner of the ferret.
2. The owner of the rat is on the right of the Brazilian.
3. The Chinese is on the left or right of the German.
4. The Mexican is somewhere to the right of the owner of the guinea-pig.
5. The Mexican is not to the left of the owner of the rat.
6. The owner of the hamster is somewhere to the left of the Chinese.
7. The Chinese is somewhere between the Brazilian and the owner of the guinea-pig.
8. The Chinese and the owner of the rat have the same parity positions.
9. The German and the owner of the ferret have different parity positions.

From statement 1, we know the rat owner is not to the right of the ferret owner. From statement 2, we know the rat owner is to the right of the Brazilian. Combining these, we can conclude that the ferret owner is to the left of the Brazilian.

From statement 3, we know the Chinese is on the left or right of the German. Since the ferret owner is to the left of the Brazilian, and the Chinese is somewhere between the Brazilian and the guinea-pig owner (statement 7), the Chinese must be to the right of the German.

From statement 4, we know the Mexican is to the right of the guinea-pig owner. Since the Chinese is to the right of the German, and the Mexican is to the right of the guinea-pig owner, the Mexican must be to the right of the Chinese.

From statement 5, we know the Mexican is not to the left of the rat owner. Since the rat owner is to the right of the Brazilian, and the Mexican is to the right of the Chinese, the Mexican cannot be to the left of the rat owner.

From statement 6, we know the hamster owner is to the left of the Chinese. Since the Chinese is to the right of the German, the hamster owner must be to the left of the German.

From statement 8, we know the Chinese and the rat owner have the same parity positions. Since the Chinese is to the right of the German, and the rat owner is to the right of the Brazilian, the rat owner must be to the right of the Chinese.

From statement 9, we know the German and the ferret owner have different parity positions. Since the ferret owner is to the left of the Brazilian, and the German is to the left of the Chinese, the ferret owner must be to the left of the German.

Now, let's fill in the table:

1. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left or far right.
This means that the dancing person can be in positions 1 or 4.

2. The person who's hobby is traveling and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions.
This means that if the traveling person is in an odd position, the coffee drinker must also be in an odd position. If the traveling person is in an even position, the coffee drinker must also be in an even position.

3. The person who's hobby is drawing is not to the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku.
This means that the drawing person must be in a position that is not to the right of the sudoku person.

4. The person who's hobby is dancing is not to the right of the person drinking tea.
This means that the dancing person must be in a position that is not to the right of the tea drinker.

5. The person who's hobby is dancing is somewhere to the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
This means that the dancing person must be in a position that is to the left of the almond-milk drinker.

This means that the coffee drinker must be in a position that is to the right of the almond-milk drinker.

8. The person drinking tea is on the far left or far right.
This means that the tea drinker can be in positions 1 or 4.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The dancing person is in positions 1 or 4.
* The tea drinker is in positions 1 or 4.
* The dancing person is not to the right of the tea drinker, so the tea drinker must be in position 1.
* The dancing person is to the left of the almond-milk drinker, so the dancing person must be in position 1.
* The almond-milk drinker is to the right of the drawing person, so the drawing person must be in position 2.
* The coffee drinker is to the right of the almond-milk drinker, so the coffee drinker must be in position 3.
* The traveling person and the coffee drinker have the same parity positions, so the traveling person must be in an odd position. Since the coffee drinker is in position 3, the traveling person must also be in position 3.

Here is the final solution:

From clue 6, we know that Fanta is to the left of Artichoke. From clue 2, we know that Artichoke is to the right of Fanta. This means that Artichoke is in the middle.

From clue 5, we know that Coffee is to the right of Fanta. From clue 7, we know that Avocado is not to the left of Artichoke. This means that Avocado is either to the right of Artichoke or on the far right.

From clue 8, we know that Cola and Avocado have the same parity positions. Since Cola is on the far left, Avocado must also be on the far left.

Here's the final solution table with the correct order:

6. The Indian is not to the left of the person watching animation movies.
7. The Thai is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies.
8. The person watching documentary movies is not to the right of the Thai.

From statement 1, we know the person watching documentary movies is on the far left or far right. Let's assume they are on the far left. This means the person watching animation movies must be on the far right, as there are only 4 people and we need to leave space for the other two.

From statement 2, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. This means the person watching scientific movies must be second from the left, and the person watching superhero movies must be third from the left.

From statement 3, we know the Indian is somewhere to the left of the person watching superhero movies. Since the person watching superhero movies is third from the left, the Indian must be second from the left.

From statement 4, we know the American and the person watching scientific movies have the same parity positions. Since the person watching scientific movies is second from the left, the American must also be second from the left.

From statement 5, we know the person watching superhero movies and the American have different parity positions. This means the American cannot be third from the left, so the American must be first from the left.

From statement 6, we know the Indian is not to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the Indian is second from the left, the person watching animation movies must be fourth from the left.

From statement 7, we know the Thai is somewhere to the left of the person watching animation movies. Since the person watching animation movies is fourth from the left, the Thai must be third from the left.

Lv1-2x4-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the trike is not to the left of the person eating broccoli.
This means the person eating broccoli is either to the left of the person driving the trike or in the same position.

2. The person eating watermelon and the person driving the trike have the same parity positions.
This means they are either both on the left or both on the right.

3. The person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the person driving the tram.
This means the person driving the tram is to the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

4. The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.
This means the person eating pepper is either to the left or to the right of the person driving the snowmobile.

5. The person eating papaya is somewhere between the person driving the snowmobile and the person driving the trike.
This means the person eating papaya is to the left of the person driving the trike.

6. The person eating watermelon is on the far right.
This means the person eating watermelon is in the last position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating broccoli is either to the left of the person driving the trike or in the same position.
* The person eating watermelon is on the far right.
* The person eating papaya is to the left of the person driving the trike.
* The person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile.

We can start by placing the person eating watermelon on the far right. Then, we can place the person eating papaya to the left of the person driving the trike.

Next, we can place the person eating broccoli. Since the person eating broccoli is either to the left of the person driving the trike or in the same position, and the person eating papaya is to the left of the person driving the trike, the person eating broccoli must be to the left of the person eating papaya.

Now, we can place the person eating pepper. Since the person eating pepper is on the left or right of the person driving the snowmobile, and the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person driving the tram, the person eating pepper must be to the right of the person driving the tram.

Finally, we can place the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person driving the tram, and the person eating pepper is to the right of the person driving the tram, the person driving the snowmobile must be to the right of the person eating pepper.

Here is the final solution:
