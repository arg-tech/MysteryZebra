Lv1-2x6-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 3, we know the police-officer eats strawberry.

From statement 7, we know the person eating strawberry is on the left of the lawyer.

From statement 4, we know the lawyer is on the left of the person eating pumpkin.

So, the order from left to right is: police-officer (strawberry), lawyer, person eating pumpkin.

From statement 10, we know the person eating radish is somewhere to the left of the person eating pumpkin.

From statement 8, we know the engineer is on the left of the person eating radish.

So, the order from left to right is: engineer, person eating radish, police-officer (strawberry), lawyer, person eating pumpkin.

From statement 1, we know the engineer is not to the right of the person eating pumpkin. This means the engineer must be on the left of the person eating pumpkin.

From statement 12, we know the person eating cauliflower is not to the right of the engineer. This means the person eating cauliflower must be on the left of the engineer.

From statement 11, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the freelancer.

From statement 5, we know the freelancer and the person eating apple have different parity positions. This means the freelancer must be on the left of the person eating apple.

From statement 13, we know the person eating pumpkin is somewhere to the left of the person eating apple. This means the person eating pumpkin must be on the left of the freelancer.

So, the final order from left to right is:

* Person eating cauliflower
* Engineer
* Person eating radish
* Police-officer (strawberry)
* Lawyer
* Person eating pumpkin
* Freelancer
* Person eating apple

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 8, we know the person watching scientific movies is in an even position. Since there are only 6 positions, this means they must be in position 2 or 4.
2. From statement 12, we know the fisherman is on the left or right of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is somewhere to the right of the software-developer (statement 7), the fisherman must be in position 1 or 6.
3. From statement 10, we know the software-developer is on the right of the pilot. This means the pilot must be in position 1.
4. From statement 16, we know the pilot is on the right of the coach. This means the coach must be in position 2.
5. From statement 14, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere to the left of the firefighter. Since the firefighter is in position 3 or 5, the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 2 or 4.
6. From statement 6, we know the person watching fantasy movies and the software-developer have the same parity positions. Since the software-developer is in position 5 or 6, the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 5 or 6.
7. From statement 15, we know the person watching action movies is between the person watching fantasy movies and the person watching crime movies. Since the fantasy movie watcher is in position 5 or 6, the action movie watcher must be in position 4.
8. From statement 9, we know the firefighter is somewhere to the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in position 5 or 6, the firefighter must be in position 3 or 5.
9. From statement 11, we know the person watching horror movies and the coach have different parity positions. Since the coach is in position 2, the horror movie watcher must be in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
10. From statement 17, we know the fisherman is not to the left of the person watching family movies. Since the fisherman is in position 1 or 6, the family movie watcher must be in position 2, 3, 4, or 5.
11. From statement 4, we know the person watching fantasy movies is somewhere between the firefighter and the coach. Since the firefighter is in position 3 or 5, the fantasy movie watcher must be in position 2 or 4.
12. From statement 3, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 1 or 6, the scientific movie watcher must be in position 2.

| Movie-Genre | Pet |
| --- | --- |
| Action | Hamster |
| Animation | Bird |
| Musical | Frog |
| Satire | Dog |
| Time-Travel | Ferret |
| Zombie | Cat |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 14, we know the owner of the ferret is the person watching time-travel movies.
2. From statement 7, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Therefore, the owner of the hamster is watching action movies.
3. From statement 5, we know the person watching action movies is not the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the hamster is watching action movies, the owner of the cat must be watching zombie movies.
4. From statement 10, we know the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the cat is watching zombie movies, the owner of the dog must be watching satire movies.
5. From statement 8, we know the owner of the frog is between the person watching animation movies and the person watching satire movies. Since the owner of the dog is watching satire movies, the owner of the frog must be watching musical movies.
6. From statement 17, we know the owner of the bird is in an odd position. Since the owner of the bird is not watching time-travel movies (statement 18), the owner of the bird must be watching animation movies.
7. From statement 20, we know the owner of the bird and the person watching animation movies have the same parity positions. Therefore, the owner of the bird is indeed watching animation movies.
8. From statement 19, we know the person watching animation movies is not to the right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is watching animation movies, the person watching animation movies must be in the first position.
9. From statement 3, we know the person watching animation movies is in an odd position. Therefore, the person watching animation movies is in the first position.
10. From statement 1, we know the person watching satire movies is not to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the owner of the cat is watching zombie movies, the person watching satire movies must be in the fourth position.
11. From statement 4, we know the person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person watching satire movies. Since the person watching time-travel movies is in the fifth position, the person watching satire movies must be in the fourth position.
12. From statement 2, we know the person watching zombie movies is not to the right of the person watching zombie movies. This statement is redundant, but it confirms that the owner of the cat is indeed watching zombie movies.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 2, we know the water-polo person is on the far left or far right. From clue 16, we know they're not to the left of rugby, so they must be on the far right.
2. From clue 4, we know the bird owner is to the right of the ice-hockey person. From clue 10, we know the rat owner has the same parity position as the ice-hockey person, so the bird owner must be on the right side.
3. From clue 11, we know swimming is to the left of rugby. From clue 7, we know rugby is to the right of swimming, so swimming must be in an odd position (clue 8).
4. From clue 14, we know the lizard owner is between the fish owner and the baseball person. From clue 12, we know the lizard owner is on the left or right of the dog owner, so the dog owner must be on the left side.
5. From clue 15, we know the dog owner is not the weightlifting person. From clue 9, we know the weightlifting person is not to the right of water-polo, so the dog owner must be on the left side.
6. From clue 17, we know baseball is to the left of water-polo. From clue 2, we know water-polo is on the far right, so baseball must be on the left side.
7. From clue 6, we know the frog owner is not the swimming person. From clue 3, we know the frog owner is not to the left of the fish owner, so the frog owner must be on the right side.
