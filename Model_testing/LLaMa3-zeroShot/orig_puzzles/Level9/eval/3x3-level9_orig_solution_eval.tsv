Lv1-3x3-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Dutch is on the far left or far right. This means the Dutch cannot be in the middle position.
2. The person eating artichoke is between the fan of jazz and the person eating cucumber. This means the artichoke eater is in the middle position, and the fan of jazz is to their left.
3. The fan of house and the Brazilian have different parity positions. This means the fan of house is either on the left or in the middle, and the Brazilian is on the right.
4. The person eating artichoke is somewhere to the right of the Dutch. This means the Dutch is on the far left, and the artichoke eater is in the middle position.
5. The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz. This means the fan of pop is on the far right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1     |     2     |    3     |
| Food          |           |           |          |

| Music-Genre  | Jazz      | Pop      | House     |

#############

Here's the solution:

* The Dutch is on the far left, eating cranberry.
* The person eating artichoke is in the middle position, which is the Brazilian.
* The fan of jazz is to the left of the artichoke eater, so they are in the second position.
* The fan of pop is on the right of the fan of jazz, so they are on the far right.
* The fan of house is in the third position, which is the Russian.

Note that the parity positions of the fan of house and the Brazilian are different, as required by clue 3."	{'dutch': ['artichoke', '', 'cranberry'], 'music-genre': ['jazz', 'pop', 'house'], 'nationality': ['', 'russian', 'brazilian']}	False	0	False
Lv1-3x3-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The mexican is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means the mexican is either to the right of the person watching fantasy movies or in the middle.

2. The egyptian is the person watching documentary movies.
This means the egyptian is in the first position.

3. The egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means the egyptian is either in the first position (watching documentary) or in the third position (watching fantasy).

4. The egyptian and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions.
This means the egyptian and the person driving the scooter are either both odd or both even.

5. The person driving the roller is the person driving the roller.
This statement doesn't provide any new information.

6. The chinese is somewhere between the egyptian and the person driving the scooter.
This means the chinese is in the second position.

7. The person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions.
This means the person watching romance movies is even, and the person driving the roller is odd.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Movie-Genre   |             |         |         |

| Transport     |             |         |         |

From statement 2, the egyptian is in the first position, watching documentary movies.

From statement 6, the chinese is in the second position.

From statement 1, the mexican is not to the left of the person watching fantasy movies, so the mexican is either in the second or third position.

From statement 3, the egyptian is on the left or right of the person watching fantasy movies. Since the egyptian is already in the first position, the person watching fantasy movies must be in the third position.

From statement 4, the egyptian and the person driving the scooter have the same parity positions. Since the egyptian is even (watching documentary), the person driving the scooter must also be even.

From statement 7, the person watching romance movies and the person driving the roller have different parity positions. Since the person driving the roller is odd (from statement 7), the person watching romance movies must be even.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
| Movie-Genre   |      1      |    2    |    3    |
| Nationality   | Egyptian    | Chinese | Mexican  |
| Transport     |             | Scooter | Roller   |
#############

The final solution is:

* Egyptian (documentary) is in the first position.
* Chinese is in the second position.
* Mexican is in the third position.
* The person driving the scooter is even (Chinese).
* The person driving the roller is odd (Mexican).
* The person watching romance movies is even (Egyptian)."	{'movie-genre': ['1', '2', '3'], 'nationality': ['egyptian', 'chinese', 'mexican'], 'transport': ['', 'scooter', 'roller']}	True	3	False
Lv1-3x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The mechanic is on the right of the scientist.
This means the scientist is on the left of the mechanic.

2. The owner of the goldfish and the mechanic have the same parity positions.
This means the owner of the goldfish is either on the left or on the right of the mechanic.

3. The owner of the ferret is in the middle.
This means the ferret owner is between the scientist and the mechanic.

4. The scientist is not to the left of the scientist.
This statement is contradictory, so we can ignore it.

5. The person watching epic movies is between the owner of the rat and the person watching romance movies.
This means the owner of the rat is on the left of the epic movie watcher, and the romance movie watcher is on the right of the epic movie watcher.

6. The person watching epic movies is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
This means the epic movie watcher is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle.

7. The scientist is not to the right of the owner of the rat.
This means the scientist is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The scientist is on the left of the mechanic (1).
* The ferret owner is in the middle (3).
* The owner of the goldfish and the mechanic have the same parity positions (2).
* The owner of the goldfish is either on the left or on the right of the mechanic.
* The epic movie watcher is between the owner of the rat and the romance movie watcher (5).
* The epic movie watcher is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle (6).
* The scientist is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle (7).

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Job           | Movie-Genre | Pet           |

| Mechanic     | Epic        | Goldfish      |
| Photographer | Animation   | Rat           |
#############

Here's how we arrived at the solution:

* The scientist is on the left of the mechanic (1), so the scientist is on the left of the ferret owner (3).
* The owner of the goldfish and the mechanic have the same parity positions (2), so the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the mechanic.
* The epic movie watcher is between the owner of the rat and the romance movie watcher (5), so the epic movie watcher is on the left of the owner of the rat.
* The epic movie watcher is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle (6), so the epic movie watcher is in the middle.
* The scientist is either on the left of the owner of the rat or in the middle (7), so the scientist is on the left of the owner of the rat.
* The photographer is left with the animation movie genre, as the scientist is already assigned to romance and the mechanic is already assigned to epic."	{'job': ['movie-genre', 'pet'], 'scientist': ['romance', 'ferret'], 'mechanic': ['epic', 'goldfish'], 'photographer': ['animation', 'rat']}	False	0	False
