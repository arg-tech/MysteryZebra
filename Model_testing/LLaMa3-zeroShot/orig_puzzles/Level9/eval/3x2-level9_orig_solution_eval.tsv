Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the information and solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know:

* The person driving the roller is on the right of the Malaysian.
* This means the Malaysian is not driving the roller.

From statement 2, we know:

* The person driving the jet-ski and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions.
* This means they are either both odd or both even.

Now, let's fill in the table with possible combinations:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   |           |            |
| Transport     |           |            |

Initially, we can fill in the nationalities:

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |
| Nationality   | Australian | Malaysian |
| Transport     |           |            |

Since there are only two movie-genres, we can assume one person watches epic movies and the other watches superhero movies. We'll place the epic movie watcher on the left for now.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Australian | Malaysian |
| Transport     |           |            |

Now, let's consider the transport options. From statement 1, we know the roller is driven by someone on the right of the Malaysian. This means the Malaysian cannot drive the roller. Since there are only two transport options, the Malaysian must drive the jet-ski.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic      | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Australian | Malaysian |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Roller    |

Finally, we can determine the parity positions. Since the person driving the jet-ski (Malaysian) and the person watching epic movies have the same parity positions, the Australian must be watching epic movies.

|               |     1     |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic (A) | Superhero |
| Nationality   | Australian | Malaysian |
| Transport     | Jet-ski  | Roller    |

The final solution is:

#############

Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even.

2. The person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions.
This means that if the owner of the dog is odd, the person drinking tea is even, and vice versa.

3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left.
This means that the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      |               |         |
| Movie-Genre   |               |         |
| Pet           |               |         |

From statement 3, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 1. Let's assume this person is odd (we'll come back to this later). Then, from statement 1, the owner of the dog is also odd.

From statement 2, the person drinking tea is even. Since the owner of the dog is odd, the person drinking tea cannot be the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person drinking tea is in position 2.

Now, let's look at the pets. The owner of the dog is odd, so the dog must be in position 1. The hamster is left, so it must be in position 2.

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | hot-chocolate | tea     |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | sports  |
| Pet           | dog          | hamster |

Now, let's check our assumptions. We assumed the person watching martial-arts movies is odd. But we also know the owner of the dog is odd. Since the owner of the dog is odd, the person watching martial-arts movies must be even. This is a contradiction, so our initial assumption was incorrect.

Let's try again. This time, let's assume the person watching martial-arts movies is even. Then, from statement 1, the owner of the dog is also even.

From statement 2, the person drinking tea is odd. Since the owner of the dog is even, the person drinking tea cannot be the owner of the dog. Therefore, the person drinking tea is in position 2.

Now, let's look at the pets. The owner of the dog is even, so the dog must be in position 2. The hamster is left, so it must be in position 1.

|               |       1       |    2    |
| Beverage      | tea     | hot-chocolate |
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | sports  |
| Pet           | hamster | dog          |

This solution satisfies all the conditions:

* The owner of the dog and the person watching martial-arts movies have the same parity positions (both are even).
* The person drinking tea and the owner of the dog have different parity positions (tea is odd, dog is even).
* The person watching martial-arts movies is on the far left.

Lv1-3x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is hiking and the person drinking milk have the same parity positions##9

This means that the person who drinks milk and the person who enjoys hiking have the same row (1 or 2). Let's call the person who drinks milk ""Milk"" and the person who enjoys hiking ""Hiking"".

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is not to the left of the person drinking milk##8

This means that Hiking is either in the same row as Milk or in the row below Milk.

3. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the left of the person who's hobby is hiking##5

This means that the frog owner is either in the same row as Hiking or in the row above Hiking.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Milk and Hiking have the same parity positions, so they are either in the same row or in adjacent rows.
* The frog owner is to the left of Hiking, so the frog owner is in the row above Hiking.
* The frog owner is not in the same row as Milk, because Milk and Hiking have the same parity positions.

In this solution, the frog owner is in the top row, the person who drinks milk is in the middle row, and the person who enjoys hiking is in the bottom row.

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions.
This means that either both are odd or both are even. Let's assume they are both odd. We'll come back to this later.

2. The owner of the frog is somewhere to the right of the person drinking milk.
This means that the person drinking milk is either in the first or second column, and the owner of the frog is in the third column.

Now, let's fill in the table with possible combinations:

| Pet           |              |         |         |

From clue 2, we know the owner of the frog is in column 3. Let's assume the person drinking milk is in column 1. Then, the person drinking cola must be in column 2.

|               |      1       |    2    |    3    |

| Pet           |              |         |  Frog   |

Now, let's consider clue 1 again. We assumed the person drinking cola and the person watching romance movies have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking cola is in column 2, the person watching romance movies must also be in column 2.

|               |      1       |    2    |    3    |

| Pet           |              |         |  Frog   |

Finally, let's consider the remaining pet, the turtle. Since the owner of the frog is in column 3, the owner of the turtle must be in column 1.

Lv1-3x2-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people have 2 different hobbies: card-games, writing
This means we have two people, and each person has one of these two hobbies.

2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: animation, mystery
This means we have two people, and each person prefers one of these two movie-genres.

3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: cycling, ice-hockey
This means we have two people, and each person prefers one of these two sports.

4. The person who's hobby is writing and the person who's sport is ice-hockey have different parity positions
This means that the person who writes and the person who plays ice-hockey are either both odd or both even. Let's call the person who writes ""W"" and the person who plays ice-hockey ""I"". If W is odd, then I must be even, and vice versa.

5. The person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey
This means that the person who watches mystery movies is either I or the person who watches animation movies (since the person who watches mystery movies is on the right of I).

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |

| Movie-Genre   |            |         |
| Sport         |            |         |

Initially, we can't determine the exact positions, but we can make some educated guesses based on the clues.

From clue 4, we know that W and I have different parity positions. Let's assume W is odd (we can try the other way around later). This means I must be even.

From clue 5, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the right of I. Since I is even, the person watching mystery movies must be either I or the person who watches animation movies.

Let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |
| Hobby         | W (odd)   |         |
| Movie-Genre   |            |         |
| Sport         |            | I (even) |

Now, let's try to figure out the movie-genres. Since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of I, and I is even, the person watching mystery movies must be I. This means the person who watches animation movies must be W.

| Movie-Genre   | Animation | Mystery |
| Sport         |            | I (even) |

Finally, let's figure out the sports. Since I is even, and W is odd, the person who plays cycling must be W. This means the person who plays ice-hockey must be I.

|               |     1      |    2    |

1. The person who's hobby is camping and the owner of the rabbit have different parity positions.

This means that the person who camps and owns the rabbit is either first or third in the table. If they were second, the owner of the frog would also own the rabbit, which is not possible since there are only two owners of rabbits.

2. The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical music.

This means that the owner of the frog is either first or second in the table. If they were third, the owner of the frog would be on the right of the fan of classical music, which is not possible.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of classical music, so they must be either first or second.
* The person who camps and owns the rabbit is either first or third, and they have different parity positions, so they must be third.

This means that the person who likes country music and plays baseball must be in an odd-numbered position (1 or 3).

2. The fan of metal is not to the right of the person driving the scooter##8
This means that the person driving the scooter cannot be in the same position as the fan of metal. Since the scooter driver is somewhere to the right of the baseball player (clue 3), the scooter driver must be in an even-numbered position (2).

3. The person driving the scooter is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is baseball##5

* The person watching time-travel movies is on an even-numbered row, and the person who's sport is lacrosse is on an odd-numbered row.

Since the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right, we can conclude that the person watching time-travel movies is on the left side of the table.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right.

This means that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on row 2, since row 1 is already occupied by the person watching time-travel movies.

Lv1-3x2-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: mystery, romance
This means we have two people, each preferring one of the two genres.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: american, colombian
This means we have two people, one American and one Colombian.

3. The people use 2 different means of transport: bus, quad-bike
This means we have two people, one driving the bus and one driving the quad-bike.

4. The person watching romance movies is on the left of the person driving the bus
This means the person watching romance movies is either the American or the Colombian, and they are on the left of the bus driver.

5. The American and the person watching romance movies have different parity positions
This means the American and the person watching romance movies are in different positions (i.e., one is on the left and the other is on the right).
