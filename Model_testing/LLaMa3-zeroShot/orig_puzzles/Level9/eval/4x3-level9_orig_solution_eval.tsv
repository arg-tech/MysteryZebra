| Hobby         |              |           |             |
| Movie-Genre   |              |           |             |
| Transport     |              |           |             |

From (1), the coffee drinker is in the 1st or 2nd column, and the sprite drinker is in the 2nd or 3rd column. From (4), the baking hobbyist is in the 1st column, and the sprite drinker is in the 2nd or 3rd column. This means that the coffee drinker is in the 1st column, and the baking hobbyist is also in the 1st column.

From (3), the superhero movie watcher is in the 2nd column, between the almond-milk drinker and the martial-arts movie watcher. From (6), the airplane driver is in the 2nd column, and the superhero movie watcher is also in the 2nd column. This means that the almond-milk drinker is in the 1st column, and the martial-arts movie watcher is in the 3rd column.

From (2), the trike driver is the martial-arts movie watcher, so the trike driver is in the 3rd column.

From (5), the time-travel movie watcher and the collecting hobbyist have the same parity positions. Since the baking hobbyist is in the 1st column, the collecting hobbyist is also in the 1st column. This means that the time-travel movie watcher is in the 1st column.

From (7), the martial-arts movie watcher is not to the right of the coffee drinker, so the martial-arts movie watcher is in the 1st or 2nd column. Since the martial-arts movie watcher is already in the 3rd column, this is a contradiction. Therefore, the martial-arts movie watcher is actually in the 1st column.

Now we can fill in the table:

From statement 2, we know the guinea-pig owner is on the left of the onion eater. Since the Canadian is on the right, the guinea-pig owner must be on the left of the Canadian.

From statement 3, we know the collecting hobbyist and the Canadian have the same parity positions. Since the Canadian is on the right, the collecting hobbyist must also be on the right.

From statement 4, we know the video-games hobbyist is in an odd position. Since the Canadian is on the right, the video-games hobbyist must be on the left of the Canadian.

7. The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul music.
8. The owner of the dog is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard.

From statement 2, we know the owner of the ferret is watching fantasy movies. From statement 3, we know the owner of the ferret is not to the left of the fan of soul music. This means the fan of soul music is either to the left of the owner of the ferret or in the middle.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the dog and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions. This means they are either both on the left or both on the right.

From statement 5, we know the person driving the jet-ski is not to the left of the person driving the skateboard. This means the person driving the skateboard is either to the left of the person driving the jet-ski or in the middle.

From statement 6, we know the fan of R&B is between the owner of the ferret and the person driving the jet-ski. This means the fan of R&B is either to the left of the owner of the ferret and to the right of the person driving the jet-ski, or to the right of the owner of the ferret and to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.

From statement 7, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul music. This means the person watching superhero movies is either to the left of the fan of soul music or to the right of the fan of soul music.

| Transport     |         |            |            |

Let's assume the fan of soul music is in the middle. Then, the owner of the ferret is to the left of the fan of soul music, and the fan of R&B is to the right of the owner of the ferret. This means the person driving the jet-ski is to the right of the fan of R&B.

The person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the fan of soul music, so let's assume they are to the right of the fan of soul music. This means the person watching superhero movies is to the right of the fan of R&B and to the left of the person driving the jet-ski.

The owner of the dog and the fan of R&B have the same parity positions, so they are both on the right. The person driving the skateboard is either to the left of the person driving the jet-ski or in the middle. Let's assume they are in the middle.

The person driving the bike is on the far left or far right, so let's assume they are on the far right. This means the person driving the bike is the one watching animation movies.

Lv1-4x3-10	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right. Since the person driving the car is on the far left (clue 11), the person drinking iced-tea cannot be the one driving the car. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea must be on the far right.
