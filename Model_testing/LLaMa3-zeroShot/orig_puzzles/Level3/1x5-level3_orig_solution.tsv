1. The person watching western movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.
This means the order is either: documentary,?, western or?, documentary, western

2. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.
This means the order is either: musical, satire or?, musical, satire

3. The person watching sports movies is on the right of the person watching western movies.
This means the order is either: documentary, western, sports or?, documentary, western, sports

Combining clues 1 and 3, we get: documentary, western,?, sports

Combining clues 2 and 1, we get: musical,?, satire, documentary, western, sports

Now, let's apply clue 4: the person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person watching satire movies.

Lv1-1x5-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fisherman is on the right of the architect.
This means the architect is on the left of the fisherman.

2. The fisherman is on the left of the entrepreneur.
This means the entrepreneur is on the right of the fisherman.

3. The architect is on the left or right of the journalist.
This means the journalist is either on the left or right of the architect.

4. The entrepreneur is on the left of the mechanic.
This means the mechanic is on the right of the entrepreneur.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The architect is on the left of the fisherman (from clue 1).
* The fisherman is on the left of the entrepreneur (from clue 2).
* The entrepreneur is on the left of the mechanic (from clue 4).
* The journalist is either on the left or right of the architect (from clue 3).

We can conclude that the order is:

Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fisherman is on the right of the coach.
This means the coach is on the left of the fisherman.

2. The security-guard is on the far left or far right.
This means the security-guard is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position.

3. The fisherman is on the left of the security-guard.
This means the fisherman is in the second position from the left, and the security-guard is in the rightmost position.

4. The dancer is on the left or right of the coach.
This means the dancer is either on the left of the coach (immediately to the left) or on the right of the coach (immediately to the right).

Now, let's combine the information:

|       |     1     |   2    |   3   |     4     |       5        |

Since the fisherman is in the second position, the coach must be in the first position. The security-guard is in the rightmost position, so it must be in the fifth position.

The dancer is either on the left or right of the coach. Since the fisherman is already in the second position, the dancer cannot be in the second position. Therefore, the dancer must be in the third position.

The paramedic is the only job left, so it must be in the fourth position.

Here is the final solution:

#############
|       | Coach | Fisherman | Dancer | Paramedic | Security-guard |
| Job   |       |           |        |           |                |
