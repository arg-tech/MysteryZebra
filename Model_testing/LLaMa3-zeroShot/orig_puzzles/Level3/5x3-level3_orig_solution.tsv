From statement 2, we know the subway driver watches scientific movies. From statement 4, we know the subway driver is on the far right. So, we can place the subway driver and scientific movies on the rightmost position:

|               |     1      |       2       |       3       |

From statement 5, we know the bartender is on the right of the person eating cucumber. From statement 6, we know the bartender's hobby is rock-climbing. So, we can place the bartender and rock-climbing on the right of the person eating cucumber:

From statement 3, we know the person eating pear is on the left of the skydiver, and the architect is on the right of the skydiver. We also know the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the scooter driver. Since the person eating cucumber is already placed, the person eating pear must be on the left of the scooter driver. We can place the person eating pear and the skydiver:

From statement 7, we know the person watching satire movies is on the right of the filmmaker. We also know the person eating cucumber is on the left of the bartender.

| Food          | Cucumber | Pear        |               |

| Food        |              |         |          |

From statement 6, we know the chef is on the far right. From statement 9, we know the climbing person is also on the far right. This means the chef and climbing person are in the same column.

From statement 7, we know the banana eater is driving the ship. Since the chef is on the far right, the banana eater must be in the second column.

From statement 5, we know the tennis player is between the mouse owner and the entrepreneur. Since the banana eater is in the second column, the mouse owner and entrepreneur must be in the first and third columns, respectively.

From statement 8, we know the tennis player is to the right of the quad-bike driver. Since the tennis player is between the mouse owner and entrepreneur, the quad-bike driver must be in the first column.
