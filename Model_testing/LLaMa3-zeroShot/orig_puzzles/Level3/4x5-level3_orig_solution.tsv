From clue 1, we know the person drinking coffee is the owner of the pony.

From clue 6, we know the person drinking coffee is on the far right. This means the Indian must be on the far left.

From clue 14, we know the French is on the left of the owner of the goat. This means the owner of the goat must be on the right of the Canadian.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is the Mexican (clue 5), the person drinking soy-milk must be on the right of the Mexican.

3. From statement 3, we know the malaysian is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the person eating radish is on the far right, the malaysian cannot be on the right. Therefore, the malaysian is on the left of the person driving the trike.
4. From statement 4, we know the person driving the subway is between the person watching family movies and the person watching zombie movies. Since the person eating artichoke is on the far right, the person watching zombie movies must be on the far right, which means the person watching family movies is on the left of the person driving the subway.

Lv1-4x5-9	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the people's preferences and nationalities:

#############
|               |     1     |     2      |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |         |           |         |

#############

| Movie-Genre   | Action | Musical | Satire | Spy | Superhero |
| Music-Genre   | Ambient | Blues | Classical | Country | D&B |
| Nationality   | Nigerian | Italian | Russian | German | Colombian |
| Pet           | Rabbit | Hedgehog | Frog | Chinchilla | Pony |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, the Russian is in the middle.
2. From clue 6, the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the Colombian, so the Colombian is on the left of the Russian.
3. From clue 5, the fan of classical is on the far left, so the Italian is on the far left.
4. From clue 7, the fan of country is between the Italian and the fan of ambient, so the fan of ambient is on the far left.
5. From clue 8, the German is on the left or right of the person watching musical movies, and the Italian is on the far left, so the German is on the right of the Italian.
6. From clue 11, the person watching musical movies is on the left of the person watching spy movies, so the German is on the left of the person watching spy movies.
7. From clue 12, the owner of the pony is on the far right, so the Colombian is on the far right.
8. From clue 13, the owner of the frog is on the left of the owner of the hedgehog, so the frog is on the left of the Russian.
9. From clue 14, the person watching satire movies is on the right of the fan of d&b, so the Russian is on the right of the fan of d&b.
10. From clue 15, the Italian is on the far left or far right, so the Italian is on the far left.

By combining these clues, I was able to determine the preferences and nationalities of the people."
Lv1-4x5-10	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking tea is Chinese. From clue 3, we know the Chinese person is on the left of the American. So, the Chinese person is on the leftmost position.

From clue 6, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the Australian. Since the Chinese person is already on the leftmost position, the Australian must be in the second position.

From clue 12, we know the Japanese person is between the American and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the American is not in the leftmost position (because the Chinese person is), the American must be in the third position. The Japanese person must be in the fourth position, and the person drinking soy-milk must be in the rightmost position.

From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the Dutch person is the one who's hobby is skydiving (from clue 5), the person who's hobby is cooking must be in the second position from the right.

From clue 10, we know the American is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, the American is in the third position from the right.

From clue 11, we know the Chinese person is the one who's sport is tennis. Since the Chinese person is already in the leftmost position, the Chinese person's sport is tennis.

From clue 13, we know the person who's sport is soccer is in the middle. Since the American is in the third position, the person who's sport is soccer must be in the second position.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is cricket is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the Dutch person is the one who's hobby is skydiving (from clue 5), the Dutch person's hobby is not photography. Therefore, the person who's hobby is photography must be in the second position from the left.

From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta. Since the person drinking fanta is not yet placed, we'll come back to this clue later.

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. Since the Chinese person is already in the leftmost position, the person who's hobby is hiking must be in the second position from the left.

From clue 9, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking soy-milk is already in the rightmost position, the person drinking soy-milk is on the far right.
