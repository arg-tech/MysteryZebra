| Transport   | van        | boat    | ship             | jet-ski    | skateboard| trike    |
#############

Here's the step-by-step solution:

8. From statement 13, we know the person driving the jet-ski is between the person driving the skateboard and the person driving the ship. Since the manager is driving the ship, the person driving the jet-ski must be between the person driving the skateboard and the manager.
9. From statement 15, we know the owner of the fish is on the far left or far right. Since the owner of the fish is not the manager (statement 2), the owner of the fish must be on the far left or far right.
10. From statement 16, we know the person eating raspberry is the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is the manager, the person eating raspberry must be the manager.
11. From statement 17, we know the person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is the manager, the person eating asparagus must be on the left or right of the manager.
12. From statement 18, we know the person driving the trike is on the left or right of the librarian. Since the librarian is on the right of the person eating avocado (statement 4), the person driving the trike must be on the left or right of the librarian.
