From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. This means that the person who's sport is cycling cannot be on the far left (since the person eating pepper is on the far left, and the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing). Therefore, the person who's sport is cycling must be on the second or third column.

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the roller is drinking sprite (from clue 7), the owner of the chinchilla must be on the right of the person drinking sprite.

Now, let's try to place the remaining people:
