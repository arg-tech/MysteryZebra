Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The social-worker is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta.
This means that the person drinking fanta is either the social-worker or the person on the right of the social-worker.

2. The musician is on the right of the social-worker.
This means that the musician is on the right of the social-worker, and the social-worker is on the left of the musician.

Combining these two statements, we can conclude that the person drinking fanta is either the social-worker or the musician.

3. The person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian.
This means that the Italian is on the left of the person driving the bike.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      |               |          |
| Job           |               |          |
| Nationality   |               |          |
| Transport     |               |          |

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking fanta is either the social-worker or the musician. Let's assume the social-worker drinks fanta. Then, the musician must be on the right of the social-worker, and the person on the right of the social-worker must drink soy-milk.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | fanta        | soy-milk |
| Job           | social-worker| musician |
| Nationality   |               |          |
| Transport     |               |          |

From statement 3, we know that the Italian is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the bike is on the right of the Italian, the Italian must be on the left of the social-worker.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | fanta        | soy-milk |
| Job           | social-worker| musician |
| Nationality   | italian     | mexican  |
| Transport     | bike        | airplane |

Finally, we can conclude that the Mexican is the musician, and the person on the right of the social-worker (drinking soy-milk) is the Mexican.

|               |       1       |    2     |
| Beverage      | fanta        | soy-milk |
| Job           | social-worker| musician |
| Nationality   | italian     | mexican  |
| Transport     | bike        | airplane |

Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter.
This means that the cat owner is either the first or second person from the left.

2. The person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of r&b.
This means that the person eating watermelon is either the first or second person from the left, and the fan of r&b is either the second or third person from the left.

3. The person driving the scooter is on the far left.
This means that the scooter driver is the first person from the left.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The scooter driver is the first person from the left.
* The cat owner is either the first or second person from the left.
* The person eating watermelon is either the first or second person from the left, and the fan of r&b is either the second or third person from the left.

We can create a possible arrangement:

|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |
| Food          | Watermelon | Cauliflower |             |
| Music-Genre   |            | R&B         | Punk        |
| Pet           | Cat        |             | Rabbit      |
| Transport     | Scooter    | Airplane    |             |

This arrangement satisfies all the conditions:

* The owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person driving the scooter (the cat owner is the second person from the left).
* The person eating watermelon is on the left of the fan of r&b (the person eating watermelon is the first person from the left, and the fan of r&b is the second person from the left).
* The person driving the scooter is on the far left (the scooter driver is the first person from the left).

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-4x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of R&B is on the far right.
2. The person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst.
3. The person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike.
4. The person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of R&B.

From clue 1, we know the fan of R&B is on the far right. From clue 4, we know the person driving the scooter is on the left of the fan of R&B. Therefore, the person driving the scooter is second from the right.

From clue 3, we know the person driving the scooter is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the scooter driver is second from the right, the quad-bike driver must be either on the far left or second from the left.

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the analyst. Since the analyst is not on the far left (otherwise, the scooter driver would be on the right of the quad-bike driver, which contradicts clue 3), the analyst must be third from the left.

Now we have a rough outline:

|               |        1        |      2      |      3      |      4      |
| Hobby         |                 |             |             |             |
| Job           |                 |             |             |             |
| Music-Genre   |                 |             |             |             |
| Transport     |                 |             |             |             |

The person driving the scooter is second from the right, so they must be in position 4. The fan of R&B is on the far right, so they must be in position 4 as well. The analyst is in position 3.

Now we can fill in the remaining positions:

|               |        1        |      2      |      3      |      4      |
| Hobby         | Hiking        |             |             | Board-games |

| Music-Genre   | Folk          |             |             | R&B         |
| Transport     | Quad-bike    |             |             | Scooter     |

The final solution is:

Lv1-4x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of disco is on the left or right of the owner of the rat.
This means that the owner of the rat must be in the middle, and the fan of disco must be either on the left or right of them.

2. The person drinking tea is the owner of the hamster.
This means that the owner of the hamster must be in the left or middle position, and they must be drinking tea.

3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person watching epic movies.
This means that the person watching epic movies must be in the middle or left position, and the person drinking cola must be on the right.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The owner of the hamster is in the left or middle position and drinks tea.
* The owner of the rat is in the middle.
* The person watching epic movies is in the middle or left position.
* The person drinking cola is on the right.

Here's the possible solution:

#############
|               |    1    |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Tea   |  Cola  |
| Movie-Genre   |  Action|  Epic  |
| Music-Genre   |  Disco |  Trance|
| Pet           | Hamster|  Rat   |
#############

In this solution, the owner of the hamster (who drinks tea) is on the left, the owner of the rat is in the middle, and the person drinking cola is on the right. The person watching epic movies is in the middle, and the fan of disco is on the right of the owner of the rat."
Lv1-4x2-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating kiwi is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
This means that the person eating kiwi is adjacent to the person drinking 7up.

2. The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale.
This means that the person eating kale is on the left of the person eating kiwi.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the order of food is: kale, kiwi.

3. The accountant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis.
This means that the accountant is on the left of the person who prefers tennis.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   |            |              |
| Food       | kale      | kiwi        |
| Job        | accountant| entrepreneur|
| Sport      |            |              |
#############

Since the accountant is on the left of the person who prefers tennis, and the person who prefers tennis is not yet assigned, we can conclude that the person who prefers tennis is the entrepreneur.

Now, let's assign the beverages:

* The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person drinking 7up, so the person drinking 7up must be the one eating kale.
* The person eating kiwi is on the right of the person eating kale, so the person eating kiwi must be the one drinking fanta.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |     1      |      2       |
| Beverage   | 7up      | fanta       |
| Food       | kale      | kiwi        |
| Job        | accountant| entrepreneur|
| Sport      |            | tennis      |
#############

Note that the sport for the accountant is not specified, but it can be either climbing or tennis."
Lv1-4x2-6	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is Skydiving.

This means that the person drinking Mirinda cannot be the one who does Skydiving, as they would be in the middle. So, we can place the person drinking Mirinda on either side of the person who does Skydiving.

2. The person drinking Sprite is on the left or right of the owner of the Bird.

This means that the person drinking Sprite must be adjacent to the owner of the Bird. Since the person eating Asparagus is on the left of the owner of the Bird (see below), the person drinking Sprite must be on the right of the owner of the Bird.

3. The person eating Asparagus is on the left of the owner of the Bird.

This means that the owner of the Bird is on the right of the person eating Asparagus. Since the person drinking Sprite is on the right of the owner of the Bird, the person eating Asparagus must be on the left of the owner of the Bird.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage   |           |         |

| Pet        |           |         |
#############

From the above deductions, we can start filling in the table:

* The person eating Asparagus is on the left of the owner of the Bird, so the owner of the Bird must be on the right of the person eating Asparagus.
* The person drinking Sprite is on the right of the owner of the Bird, so the owner of the Bird must be on the right of the person eating Asparagus.
* The person drinking Mirinda is on the left or right of the person who does Skydiving, so the person doing Skydiving must be in the middle.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |     1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Mirinda  | Sprite  |
| Food       | Asparagus| Garlic  |

Lv1-4x2-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the roller is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.
This means that the person who sails must be either the one driving the roller or the one driving the quad-bike. Let's call the person who sails ""S"".

2. The owner of the cat is the person who's sport is sailing.
This means that S is the owner of the cat.

3. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender.
This means that the bartender must be driving the roller (since the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the bartender).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|             |     1     |     2     |

| Transport   |           |           |
#############

From step 2, we know that S (the person who sails) owns the cat. From step 1, we know that S is either driving the roller or the quad-bike. Since the bartender is driving the roller (from step 3), S must be driving the quad-bike.

So, the table looks like this:

#############
|             |     1     |     2     |
| Job         | Bartender | Lawyer   |

| Sport       | Sailing  | Swimming |
| Transport   | Roller   | Quad-bike|
#############

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells:

* The person who is not S (the one who swims) must be the lawyer, since the bartender is already taken.
* The person who owns the dog must be the lawyer, since the bartender owns the cat.

The final solution table is:

This means that the person who watches scientific movies is to the left of the person who plays golf.

3. The owner of the cat is on the right of the nigerian.

3. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the fan of folk.
This means that the fan of folk is to the right of T.

Now, let's combine the information:

|               |     1     |      2      |
| Food          |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |             |
| Pet           |           |             |
| Sport         |           |             |

From (1), we know that the owner of the turtle is not the one who plays basketball. From (2), we know that the person eating cauliflower is to the right of T. From (3), we know that the fan of folk is to the right of T.

Let's assume the owner of the turtle is in position 1. Then, the person eating cauliflower would be in position 2, and the fan of folk would be in position 3.

|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |
| Food          |           |           |             |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |             |
| Pet           | Turtle    | Cauliflower| Folk        |
| Sport         |           | Basketball|             |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

* The person eating asparagus must be in position 1, since the person eating cauliflower is in position 2.
* The person playing climbing must be in position 3, since the person playing basketball is in position 2.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1     |      2      |      3      |
| Food          | Asparagus| Cauliflower|             |
| Music-Genre   |           |           | Folk        |
| Pet           | Turtle    |           |             |
| Sport         |           | Basketball| Climbing    |

Note that the person eating asparagus is not specified, but it doesn't matter since the puzzle only requires us to find the correct positions for each category."
