From statement 3, we know the Colombian is eating lime.

From statement 4, we know the British is eating cabbage.

From statement 5, we know the German is eating asparagus.

From statement 10, we know the person eating asparagus (German) is between the person driving the ship and the person eating cabbage (British).

From statement 14, we know the Colombian is driving the ship.

So, the order of the people eating asparagus, ship, and cabbage is: German, Colombian, British.

From statement 1, we know the person eating mango is on the far left or far right. Since the German is already placed, the person eating mango must be on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the person eating mango is on the far left or far right. This statement is redundant, but it doesn't provide any new information.

From statement 9, we know the person eating pineapple is on the far left. Since the person eating mango is on the far right, the person eating pineapple must be on the far left.

From statement 11, we know the person driving the jet-ski is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating pineapple is on the far left, the person driving the jet-ski must be on the far left.

From statement 15, we know the Colombian is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the Colombian is already placed, the person driving the roller must be on the right of the Colombian.

From statement 12, we know the person driving the airplane is on the left or right of the person driving the train. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the Colombian, the person driving the airplane must be on the left of the Colombian.

From statement 6, we know the person driving the airplane is on the left of the person eating asparagus (German). Since the German is already placed, the person driving the airplane must be on the left of the German.

From statement 13, we know the person driving the taxi is on the far right. Since the person eating mango is on the far right, the person driving the taxi must be on the far right.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x6-2	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

#############
|         |       1       |      2      |     3      |    4     |      5      |     6      |

| Sport   |  Baseball    |  Basketball  |  Cricket   |  Ice-hockey  |  Tennis    |  Water-polo |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is baseball is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. From clue 9, we know this person is on the far left or far right. Since there are only 6 people, this person must be on the far left.
2. From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the right of the person eating pomegranate. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left, the person who's sport is basketball must be on the far right.
3. From clue 11, we know the person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating carrot. From clue 12, we know the person eating eggplant is also the person who's hobby is dancing. Therefore, the person eating carrot must be on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
4. From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games. Since the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is already on the far left, the person who's hobby is board-games must be on the second left.
5. From clue 14, we know the person who's sport is tennis is the person eating pomegranate. From clue 16, we know the person eating eggplant is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Therefore, the person eating pomegranate must be on the right of the person eating eggplant.
6. From clue 15, we know the person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating pomegranate is already on the right, the person eating watermelon must be on the far right.
7. From clue 17, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the person eating eggplant. Since the person eating eggplant is already on the right of the person eating carrot, the person who's hobby is collecting must be on the left of the person eating carrot.
8. From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the person who's sport is cricket is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position. However, we can conclude that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not on the far left or far right.
9. From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is cricket is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating carrot is already placed, the person who's sport is cricket must be on the right of the person eating carrot.
10. From clue 3, we know the person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the person eating eggplant is already placed, the person who's sport is tennis must be on the right of the person eating eggplant.
11. From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is baseball is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon. Since the person eating watermelon is already placed, the person who's sport is baseball must be on the left of the person eating watermelon.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the entire table. The final solution is shown above."

Lv1-3x6-5	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at the solution. Here it is:

| Sport         |  parkour   |  swimming     |  cricket|  golf      |  water-polo|  basketball|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person who drinks juice plays golf. From statement 3, we know the person who drinks hot-chocolate plays cricket. From statement 4, we know the fan of gospel is on the far left or far right, so we can conclude that the fan of gospel is not next to the person who drinks juice (since they play golf).
2. From statement 5, we know the fan of house is on the left or right of the fan of d&b. From statement 9, we know the fan of d&b is on the left or right of the fan of house, so they must be adjacent.
3. From statement 6, we know the fan of house is between the person who plays golf and the person who plays parkour. Since the person who drinks juice plays golf, the fan of house must be between the person who drinks juice and the person who plays parkour.
4. From statement 8, we know the person who drinks juice is on the left or right of the fan of rock. Since the fan of house is between the person who drinks juice and the person who plays parkour, the fan of rock must be on the other side of the fan of house.
5. From statement 10, we know the person who drinks sprite plays water-polo. From statement 12, we know the fan of funk is on the left of the person who plays water-polo, so the fan of funk must be on the left of the person who drinks sprite.
6. From statement 11, we know the fan of gospel is on the right of the person who plays swimming. From statement 13, we know the person who plays water-polo is the fan of gospel, so the person who plays swimming must be on the left of the person who drinks sprite.
7. From statement 14, we know the person who plays cricket is on the right of the person who drinks water. Since the person who drinks hot-chocolate plays cricket, the person who drinks water must be on the left of the fan of funk.
8. From statement 15, we know the person who drinks 7up is on the right of the fan of d&b. Since the fan of d&b is adjacent to the fan of house, the person who drinks 7up must be on the right of the fan of house.
9. From statement 16, we know the fan of house is on the left or right of the person who plays parkour. Since the fan of house is already placed, we can conclude that the person who plays parkour is on the right of the fan of house.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
