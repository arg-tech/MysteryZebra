Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The bartender is on the far left.
2. The pilot is on the left of the project-manager.
3. The fisherman is on the left or right of the engineer.
4. The bartender is on the left or right of the pilot.
5. The pilot is on the right of the bartender.
6. The project-manager is on the left of the fisherman.

From clue 1, we know the bartender is on the far left.

From clue 2, we know the pilot is on the left of the project-manager, so the order is: bartender, pilot, project-manager.

From clue 5, we know the pilot is on the right of the bartender, which confirms the order: bartender, pilot, project-manager.

From clue 3, we know the fisherman is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the pilot is already placed, the engineer must be on the right of the pilot. This means the order is: bartender, pilot, engineer, project-manager, fisherman.

From clue 6, we know the project-manager is on the left of the fisherman, which confirms the order: bartender, pilot, engineer, project-manager, fisherman.

The only job left is the writer, which must be on the right of the fisherman.

5. The person eating orange is on the left or right of the person eating watermelon.
6. The person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating apricot.
7. The person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating orange.

From statement 1, we know that the person eating watermelon is on the right of the person eating orange. From statement 2, we know that the person eating watermelon is on the left of the person eating papaya. This means that the order is: orange, watermelon, papaya.

From statement 4, we know that the person eating papaya is on the right of the person eating watermelon. This confirms the order we found earlier.

From statement 7, we know that the person eating nectarine is on the left of the person eating orange. This means that the order is: nectarine, orange, watermelon, papaya.

From statement 3, we know that the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person eating lettuce. Since we already know the order of the other foods, we can conclude that the person eating apricot is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Let's assume the person eating apricot is on the right of the person eating nectarine. This means the order is: apricot, nectarine, orange, watermelon, papaya.

From statement 6, we know that the person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating apricot. Since we already know the order, we can conclude that the person eating nectarine is indeed on the right of the person eating apricot.

Lv1-1x6-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person eating carrot is on the left or right of the person eating kiwi. Since statement 3 says the person eating carrot is on the left of the person eating kiwi, we can conclude that the order is: carrot, kiwi.

From statement 2, we know that the person eating lime is on the right of the person eating kiwi. So, the order is: carrot, kiwi, lime.

From statement 4, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the left or right of the person eating asparagus. Since statement 6 says the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person eating asparagus, we can conclude that the person eating asparagus is on the left of the person eating pomegranate.

From statement 5, we know that the person eating asparagus is on the left or right of the person eating lime. Since we already know the order is carrot, kiwi, lime, the person eating asparagus must be on the left of the lime.

From statement 7, we know that the person eating pomegranate is between the person eating cranberry and the person eating asparagus. Since we know the order is carrot, kiwi, lime, asparagus, pomegranate, cranberry is the only possible order that satisfies this statement.

Lv1-1x6-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.

This means that mirinda cannot be on the far left, so it must be in positions 2-4.

2. The person drinking 7up is on the far left.

This means that 7up must be in position 1.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.

This means that iced-tea can be in positions 1 or 6.

4. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

This means that coffee cannot be in position 1, so it must be in positions 2-5.

5. The person drinking mirinda is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

This means that coffee cannot be in positions 2 or 4, so it must be in positions 1, 3, or 5.

Now, let's combine the information:

* 7up is in position 1.
* Mirinda is in positions 2-4.
* Coffee is in positions 1, 3, or 5.
* Iced-tea is in positions 1 or 6.
