From clue 1, we know that the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Let's assume the owner of the dog is on the left of the motorbike driver. We'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating tomato is on the far right. Let's place the tomato eater on the far right.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating plum is on the left of the fan of metal. Since the fan of metal is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing (clue 10), let's place the plum eater on the left of the rock-climbing fan.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Let's place the jet-ski driver on the left of the horror movie fan.

From clue 6, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person driving the bus. This means the bus driver is on the left of the jet-ski driver.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the far right. Let's place the lacrosse player on the far right.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the left of the owner of the dog. Since we assumed the owner of the dog is on the left of the motorbike driver, the chess fan must be on the left of the motorbike driver.

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the far left. Let's place the turtle owner on the far left.

From clue 10, we know that the fan of metal is the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. We already placed the rock-climbing fan on the left of the plum eater, so the metal fan is also on the left of the plum eater.

From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since the rock-climbing fan is already placed, the dubstep fan must be on the right of the rock-climbing fan.

From clue 12, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the jet-ski driver is on the left of the horror movie fan, the ice-hockey player must be on the left or right of the horror movie fan.

Lv1-7x3-7	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making some deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is handball is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Let's call the person who's sport is handball ""H"" and the person who's sport is badminton ""B"". We can't determine the exact position of H and B yet, but we know that H is on the left of B.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the tram is between the person watching disaster movies and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Let's call the person watching disaster movies ""D"" and the person who's hobby is magic-tricks ""M"". We can't determine the exact position of D and M yet, but we know that the person driving the tram is between them.

From clue 3, we know that the person eating lemon is on the far right. Let's call this person ""L"".

From clue 4, we know that the person eating apple is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. Let's call this person ""A"".

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Let's call the person drinking coffee ""C"". We can't determine the exact position of C yet, but we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left or right of C.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching sports movies is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking milk. Let's call the person watching sports movies ""S"" and the person drinking milk ""M"". We can't determine the exact position of S and M yet, but we know that S is between them.

From clue 7, we know that the dancer is on the far left or far right. Let's call this person ""Dancer"".

From clue 8, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the left of the software-developer. Let's call the software-developer ""SD"".

From clue 9, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right. This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is either C or the person drinking milk (M).

From clue 10, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is the person eating apple (A). This means that A is not the person driving the tram (since the tram is driven by the person between D and M).

Now, let's try to combine the information we have so far. We know that H is on the left of B, and L is on the far right. We also know that A is not the person driving the tram, and that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.

Here's a possible arrangement:

|               |      1       |      2      |         3          |
| Beverage      |              |             |                    |
| Food          |              | apple       | lemon              |
| Hobby         |              | sudoku      | magic-tricks      |
| Job           |              | dancer      | software-developer |
| Movie-Genre   |              | disaster    | sports            |
| Sport         | handball     | ice-hockey  | badminton         |
| Transport     | boat        | quad-bike   | tram              |

In this arrangement, H is on the left of B, and L is on the far right. A is eating apple and driving the quad-bike. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right, which means it's either C or M. Since M is already drinking milk, it's likely that C is drinking hot-chocolate.

The person driving the tram is between D and M, which means that the person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person driving the tram. This means that D is on the left of the tram.

The person watching sports movies is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and the person drinking milk, which means that S is between the person who's hobby is sudoku and M.

The dancer is on the far left or far right, which means that Dancer is either on the left of H or on the right of L.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the far left. From statement 5, we know this person is either on the far left or far right. Since the engineer is on the far right (statement 2), the person who's hobby is filmmaking must be on the far left.
2. From statement 3, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the far left, the person who's hobby is drawing must be in the middle.
3. From statement 4, we know the person watching western movies is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in the middle (from statement 3), the person watching western movies must be in the middle.
4. From statement 6, we know the owner of the hamster is between the fan of reggae and the analyst. Since the fan of reggae is not in the middle (from statement 2), the owner of the hamster must be on the left of the analyst.
5. From statement 7, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the bartender. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is in the middle, the person who's sport is basketball must be on the left of the bartender.
6. From statement 8, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the bartender (statement 7), the person driving the subway must be on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
7. From statement 9, we know the person watching epic movies is the person driving the bike. Since the person driving the bike is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling (from statement 8), the person watching epic movies must be on the left of the person who's sport is cycling.
8. From statement 10, we know the fan of funk is on the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the owner of the horse is in the middle, the fan of funk must be in the middle.
9. From statement 11, we know the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling (from statement 9), the person watching western movies must be on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.
