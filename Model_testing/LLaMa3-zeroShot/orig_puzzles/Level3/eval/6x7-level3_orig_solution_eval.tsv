Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

1. I started by using the given information to create a rough outline of the table. I focused on the hobbies, movie genres, and music genres, as these seemed to be the most connected.
2. I used the clues to eliminate possibilities and narrow down the options. For example, clue 2 told me that the Indian is the person watching horror movies, so I could eliminate horror movies from the other nationalities.
3. I used the clues to make connections between the different categories. For example, clue 4 told me that the person driving the train is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is video-games, so I could use this to place the train driver and the video-games hobbyist.
4. I continued to use the clues to fill in the table, making sure to check for consistency and accuracy.
5. Finally, I used the remaining clues to fill in the last few gaps and ensure that the solution was correct.

I hope this helps!
