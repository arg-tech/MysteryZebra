Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
This means that the person drinking juice cannot be in the middle. Let's assume the person drinking juice is on the left. Then, the person drinking tea must be on the right.

2. The person eating lemon is on the right of the person drinking tea.
This means that the person eating lemon cannot be on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking juice, the person eating lemon must be on the right of the person drinking tea.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|            |  1   |   2   |
| Beverage   | Juice | Tea   |
| Food       | Kiwi  | Lemon |
#############

The solution is:

The person drinking juice is on the left, and the person drinking tea is on the right. The person eating kiwi is on the left, and the person eating lemon is on the right."	{'beverage': ['juice', 'tea'], 'food': ['kiwi', 'lemon']}	True	2	False
Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the left or right of the person drinking water.
This means that the person drinking water is not in the middle. Let's call the person drinking water ""W"".
2. The person drinking water is on the far right.
This means that W is in the second column (since there are only two columns).

Now, let's consider the possible arrangements:

|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   |             |       |
| Sport      |             |       |

Case 1: W is in the first row (leftmost column)
| Almond-milk | Water     |       |
| Golf        | Surfing  |       |

Case 2: W is in the second row (middle column)
| Almond-milk |       | Water     |
| Golf        | Surfing  |       |

Case 3: W is in the third row (rightmost column)
|       |       | Water     |
| Golf        | Surfing  | Almond-milk |

Since W is on the far right, Case 3 is the only possible arrangement.

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells:

|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Water     |
| Sport      | Golf        | Surfing  |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|            |      1      |   2   |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Water     |
| Sport      | Golf        | Surfing  |

Lv1-2x2-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: sports, western
This means that each person watches both sports and western movies.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: french, nigerian
This means that each person has a different nationality.

3. The french is on the left of the person watching western movies
This means that the french person is on the left of the person who watches western movies.

4. The french is on the left or right of the person watching western movies
This is a redundant clue, as we already know the french person is on the left of the person watching western movies.

From the clues, we can deduce the following:

* The french person watches western movies.
* The person who watches western movies is on the left of the french person.
* The other person (nigerian) watches sports movies.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############

The french person is on the left of the person who watches western movies, which is the nigerian person."	{'movie-genre': ['sports', 'western'], 'nationality': ['nigerian', 'french']}	True	2	False
Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating apricot is on the right of the person drinking sprite.

This means that the person drinking sprite is on the left of the person eating apricot. Let's represent this as:

|            |   1    |    2    |
| Beverage   | ?    | ?    |
| Food       | ?    |  apricot |

2. The person drinking fanta is on the far left or far right.

This means that the person drinking fanta is either on the leftmost position (1) or the rightmost position (2). Let's represent this as:

|            |   1    |    2    |
| Beverage   |  fanta | ?    |
| Food       | ?    | ?    |

Now, let's combine the two clues. Since the person eating apricot is on the right of the person drinking sprite, and the person drinking fanta is on the far left or far right, we can conclude that:

* The person drinking fanta is on the leftmost position (1).
* The person eating apricot is on the rightmost position (2).

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different music-genres: ambient, salsa
This means we have two people, each preferring one of the two music genres.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: american, australian
This means we have two people, one with each nationality.

3. the australian is on the right of the fan of salsa
This means the Australian is either the salsa fan or the ambient fan, and they are on the right side of the salsa fan.

4. the fan of salsa is on the left or right of the fan of ambient
This means the salsa fan is either on the left or right of the ambient fan.

Now, let's combine the information:

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   |          |            |
| Nationality   |          |            |

From (3), we know the Australian is on the right of the salsa fan. Let's assume the Australian is the salsa fan (we'll come back to this assumption later). Then, the American must be the ambient fan.

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | ambient | salsa     |
| Nationality   | american| australian|

Now, let's check if this solution satisfies (4). The salsa fan (Australian) is on the right of the ambient fan (American), which is correct.

However, we assumed the Australian is the salsa fan. What if the American is the salsa fan instead? Then, the Australian would be the ambient fan.

|               |    1     |     2      |
| Music-Genre   | salsa    | ambient  |
| Nationality   | american| australian|

This solution also satisfies (3) and (4). We have two possible solutions:

Lv1-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the Mexican.
This means that the Mexican is not in the middle. Let's assume the Mexican is on the right for now.

2. The Mexican is on the right of the Malaysian.
This means that the Malaysian is on the left of the Mexican.

Now, let's combine the two clues:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   |           |         |
| Nationality   |           |         |

Since the Mexican is on the right, and the Malaysian is on the left, the order is:

Malaysian -? - Mexican

The fan of ambient is on the left or right of the Mexican, so it must be the second person. This means the fan of ambient is not the Malaysian (since the Malaysian is on the left).

The only remaining option is that the fan of ambient is the person in the middle, and the fan of d&b is the Malaysian.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Music-Genre   | ambient   | d&b    |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Mexican |

The fan of ambient is in the middle, and the fan of d&b is the Malaysian. The Mexican is on the right."	{'music-genre': ['ambient', 'd&b'], 'nationality': ['malaysian', 'mexican']}	True	4	True
Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Thai is on the left or right of the Malaysian.
This means that the Thai cannot be in the middle. Let's assume the Thai is on the left of the Malaysian. We'll come back to this assumption later.

2. The owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai.
This means that the snake owner must be the Malaysian, since the Thai is on the left of the Malaysian.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Thai  |
| Pet           | Snake     | Cat  |

The Malaysian is on the left of the Thai, and the owner of the snake is on the left of the Thai, so the Malaysian must be the snake owner.

The Thai is on the left of the Malaysian, so the cat must be on the right of the Thai.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1     |  2   |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | Thai  |
| Pet           | Snake     | Cat  |

Lv1-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing.

This means that the woodworking hobby is on the left, and the singing hobby is on the right.

| Hobby   | Woodworking | Singing |
| Job     |             |         |

2. The manager is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is woodworking.

Since the woodworking hobby is already on the left, the manager must be on the left of the woodworking hobby.

|         |      1      |    2    |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Singing |
| Job     | Manager    |         |

3. The person who's job is chef is not the person who's hobby is woodworking.

This clue doesn't provide any new information, but it helps to eliminate possibilities.

Now, let's fill in the remaining job. The person who's hobby is singing must be the chef, since the manager is already on the left of the woodworking hobby.

|         |      1      |    2    |

Lv1-2x2-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating avocado is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person eating avocado.

2. The person drinking coffee is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means that the person drinking coffee is either on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person eating avocado. From clue 2, we know that the person drinking coffee is either on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.

Let's consider the possible arrangements:

**Case 1:** Coffee is on the left of iced-tea, and avocado is on the right of iced-tea.

|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   |  Coffee | Iced-Tea |
| Food       | Avocado | Papaya  |

**Case 2:** Coffee is on the right of iced-tea, and avocado is on the right of iced-tea.

|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Coffee  |
| Food       | Avocado | Papaya  |

In both cases, we can see that papaya is not paired with iced-tea, which means that papaya must be paired with coffee. Therefore, the correct solution is:

#############
|            |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage   | Coffee  | Iced-Tea |

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: comedy, musical
This means that each person watches both comedy and musical movies.

2. The people use 2 different means of transport: quad-bike, van
This means that each person uses both the quad-bike and the van.

3. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike
This means that the person driving the van is either to the left or to the right of the person driving the quad-bike.

4. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies
This means that the person driving the quad-bike is also watching comedy movies, since they are on the left of the person watching comedy movies.

Now, let's create a table to represent the puzzle:

|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |        |
| Transport     |           |        |

| Movie-Genre   | Comedy   | Musical |
| Transport     | Quad-Bike | Van     |

Now, let's apply the constraints:

1. The person driving the van is on the left or right of the person driving the quad-bike
This means that person 1 is driving the van, and person 2 is driving the quad-bike.

2. The person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person watching comedy movies
This means that person 2 is watching comedy movies, and person 1 is watching musical movies.
