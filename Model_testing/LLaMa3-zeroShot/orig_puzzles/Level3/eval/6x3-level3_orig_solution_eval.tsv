Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |

| Transport     |           |              |               |

After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

#############
|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |

| Sport         | swimming   | surfing    | biathlon    |
| Transport     | subway     | jet-ski    | motorbike   |
#############

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the fan of electronic, so the fan of electronic is in position 1.
* The person drinking mirinda is on the left of the bartender, so the bartender is in position 3.
* The person drinking tea is the fan of electronic, so the fan of electronic is in position 1.
* The person who's sport is swimming is the firefighter, so the firefighter is in position 2.
* The person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person driving the subway, so the person driving the subway is in position 3.
* The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the fan of country, so the fan of country is in position 2.
* The person driving the jet-ski is the fan of d&b, so the fan of d&b is in position 3.
* The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person who's sport is biathlon, so the person who's sport is biathlon is in position 3.

I hope this solution is correct!

From clue 4, we know that the paramedic is on the left of the owner of the mouse. This means the paramedic cannot be the owner of the mouse.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the teacher is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, the teacher cannot be the person eating blueberry.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left or right of the journalist. Since the journalist is between the fan of folk and the person drinking mirinda, the journalist cannot be the person who's sport is swimming.

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person drinking fanta. This means the person who's sport is swimming is not the person eating onion (since the person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking fanta).

From clue 8, we know that the paramedic is the fan of pop. This means the paramedic cannot be the fan of folk or gospel.

From clue 9, we know that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating blueberry. This means the owner of the mouse is not the person eating onion (since the person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking fanta).

From clue 10, we know that the owner of the dog is the fan of folk. This means the owner of the dog is not the paramedic (since the paramedic is the fan of pop).

Now, let's summarize what we know:

* The person eating onion is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
* The teacher is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
* The journalist is between the fan of folk and the person drinking mirinda.
* The paramedic is on the left of the owner of the mouse and is the fan of pop.
* The owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating blueberry.
* The owner of the dog is the fan of folk.
* The person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

With this information, we can start filling in the table:

| Beverage      |           |            |           |
| Food          |           |            |           |
| Job           |           |            |           |

| Sport         |           |            |           |

Let's start with the person eating onion. Since they're on the left of the person drinking fanta, and the person who's sport is swimming is on the right of the person drinking fanta, the person eating onion must be on the left of the person drinking fanta and on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.

This means the person eating onion is in position 1, and the person drinking fanta is in position 2.

 
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      |           |  Fanta    |           |
| Food          |  Onion   |           |           |
| Job           |           |            |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |            |           |
| Pet           |           |            |           |
| Sport         |  Swimming|            |           |

Now, let's focus on the teacher. Since the teacher is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey, and the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person eating blueberry (since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating blueberry), the teacher must be in position 3.

 
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      |           |  Fanta    |           |
| Food          |  Onion   |           |  Blueberry|
| Job           |           |            |  Teacher  |
| Music-Genre   |           |            |           |
| Pet           |           |            |           |
| Sport         |  Swimming|            |  Ice-Hockey|

Now, let's focus on the journalist. Since the journalist is between the fan of folk and the person drinking mirinda, and the owner of the dog is the fan of folk, the journalist must be in position 2.

 
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      |           |  Fanta    |           |
| Food          |  Onion   |  Blueberry|  Blueberry|
| Job           |           |  Journalist|  Teacher  |
| Music-Genre   |           |  Folk     |           |
| Pet           |           |            |           |
| Sport         |  Swimming|            |  Ice-Hockey|

Now, let's focus on the paramedic. Since the paramedic is on the left of the owner of the mouse, and the owner of the mouse is on the left of the person eating blueberry, the paramedic must be in position 1.

 
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      |  Paramedic|  Fanta    |           |
| Food          |  Onion   |  Blueberry|  Blueberry|
| Job           |  Paramedic|  Journalist|  Teacher  |
| Music-Genre   |  Pop      |  Folk     |           |
| Pet           |  Mouse   |            |           |
| Sport         |  Swimming|            |  Ice-Hockey|

Finally, let's focus on the person who's sport is swimming. Since they're on the right of the person drinking fanta, and the person drinking fanta is in position 2, the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 3.

 
|               |     1     |     2      |     3     |
| Beverage      |  Paramedic|  Fanta    |  Swimming|
| Food          |  Onion   |  Blueberry|  Blueberry|
| Job           |  Paramedic|  Journalist|  Teacher  |
| Music-Genre   |  Pop      |  Folk     |           |
| Pet           |  Mouse   |            |           |
| Sport         |           |            |  Ice-Hockey|

And that's the final solution!
