Lv1-7x2-2	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The Russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing.
2. The fan of folk is on the left of the social-worker.
3. The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies.
4. The owner of the goat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is dancing.

From clue 1, we know the Russian is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing. Let's call the person who's hobby is dancing ""D"". Then, the Russian is on the right of D.

From clue 2, we know the fan of folk is on the left of the social-worker. Let's call the social-worker ""SW"". Then, the fan of folk is on the left of SW.

From clue 3, we know the person driving the van is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Let's call the person watching horror movies ""HM"". Then, the person driving the van is on the left of HM.

Now, let's try to combine the information:

* D is on the left of the Russian (from clue 1).
* SW is on the left of the fan of folk (from clue 2).
* HM is on the left of the person driving the van (from clue 3).

We can create a possible arrangement:

|               |      1       |       2       |
| Hobby         |  Dancing    |  Writing     |
| Job           |  Entrepreneur|  Social-worker|
| Movie-Genre   |  Horror     |  Western     |
| Music-Genre   |  Folk       |  Trance      |
| Nationality   |  Pakistani  |  Russian     |
| Pet           |  Goat       |  Mouse      |
| Transport     |  Van        |  Snowmobile  |

The Russian is on the right of D, so the Russian must be the one who prefers writing (since the other person prefers dancing). This means the Pakistani is the one who prefers dancing.

The fan of folk is on the left of SW, so the fan of folk must be the one who prefers writing (since the other person prefers folk). This means the Russian is the one who prefers folk.

The person driving the van is on the left of HM, so the person driving the van must be the one who prefers western (since the other person prefers horror). This means the Pakistani is the one who drives the van.

The owner of the goat is on the left or right of D, so the owner of the goat must be the one who prefers writing (since the other person prefers dancing). This means the Russian is the one who owns the goat.

Now, let's try to fill in the rest of the table. We know that there are two different favourite beverages, so the person drinking juice must be in the second column. We also know that there are two different types of food, so the person eating apricot must be in the first column.

Here's the current state of the table:

From clue 1, we know the person watching sports movies is on the left of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola is the one who's sport is handball, the person watching sports movies must be on the left of the person drinking cola. Let's put that in the table:

Now let's go back to clue 2. We know the fan of pop is on the left or right of the videographer. Since the videographer is on the right, the fan of pop must be on the left. But we also know the person driving the skateboard is on the left of the firefighter. Since the skateboard is on the left, the firefighter must be on the right. This means the videographer is actually on the left, and the fan of pop is on the right.

From clue 1, we know the fan of techno is on the left of the pakistani. This means the pakistani cannot be on the left of the fan of techno, so the pakistani must be on the right.

From clue 5, we know the pakistani is driving the van. This means the pakistani must be on the right, and the fan of techno must be on the left.

From clue 4, we know the person driving the skateboard is the security-guard. This means the security-guard must be on the left, and the fan of techno must be on the left of the pakistani.

From clue 2, we know the person watching western movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. This means the person watching western movies must be on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.

From clue 3, we know the person eating plum is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard. Since the security-guard is driving the skateboard, the person eating plum must be on the left or right of the security-guard.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|               |       1        |     2     |
| Food          |                |           |
| Job           |                |           |
| Movie-Genre   |                |           |

|               | Security-Guard | Pakistani    |
| Food          |                |           |
| Job           | Security-Guard | Pakistani    |
| Movie-Genre   |                |           |

| Transport     | Skateboard    | Van          |

From here, we can start making some educated guesses. Since the pakistani is driving the van, they must be on the right. The security-guard is driving the skateboard, so they must be on the left.

From clue 2, we know the person watching western movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing. This means the person watching western movies must be on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.

From clue 1, we know the fan of techno is on the left of the pakistani. This means the fan of techno must be on the left of the pakistani.

Lv1-7x2-8	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Let's assume the owner of the dog is on the left of the person drinking juice. We'll come back to this later.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating orange is the owner of the cat. This means that the person eating orange cannot be the same as the person drinking juice (since the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person drinking juice).

From clue 3, we know that the person watching superhero movies is the lawyer. This means that the lawyer cannot be the same as the person eating orange (since the person eating orange is the owner of the cat).

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the owner of the dog. This means that the person driving the trike is on the left of the person drinking juice (since the owner of the dog is on the left or right of the person drinking juice).

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket. This means that the person who's sport is surfing cannot be the same as the person drinking juice (since the person driving the trike is on the left of the person drinking juice).

From clue 6, we know that the analyst is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that the analyst cannot be the same as the person drinking juice (since the person drinking juice is already accounted for).

Now, let's try to fill in the table. We know that the person eating orange is the owner of the cat, and the person watching superhero movies is the lawyer. We also know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the person drinking juice.

Here's a possible solution:
