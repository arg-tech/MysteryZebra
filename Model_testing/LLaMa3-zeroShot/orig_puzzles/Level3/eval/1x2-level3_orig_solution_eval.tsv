Lv1-1x2-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right.
This means that the person drinking soy-milk cannot be in the middle.

2. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk.
This means that the person drinking fanta must be in the middle or on the right.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the far left or far right. Let's assume they are on the far left. Then, the person drinking fanta must be in the middle or on the right. But if the person drinking fanta is on the right, then the person drinking soy-milk would not be on the far right, which contradicts the assumption. Therefore, the person drinking fanta must be in the middle.

Here's the solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|            |    Fanta   | Soy-Milk |
| Beverage   |          |       |
