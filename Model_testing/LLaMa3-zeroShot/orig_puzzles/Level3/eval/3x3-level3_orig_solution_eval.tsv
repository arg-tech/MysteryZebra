2. The person eating potato is on the far left or far right##3
This means that the person who eats potato is either in the first or third column.

Since both the rock fan and the potato eater are on the far left or far right, they must be in the same column. Let's assume they are in the first column.

This means that the person who likes folk music is also the person who watches romance movies.

4. The fan of reggae is on the left of the person watching superhero movies
This means that the person who likes reggae music is to the left of the person who watches superhero movies.

Since the rock fan and potato eater are in the first column, the reggae fan must be in the second column.

5. The person eating peach is between the person watching superhero movies and the person eating potato##2
This means that the person who eats peach is in the second column, between the person who watches superhero movies and the person who eats potato.

Now, let's fill in the table:

1. The person watching crime movies is on the far left or far right.
This means the person watching crime movies is either in the first or third column.

2. The Russian is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
This means the Russian is in the third column, and the person watching crime movies is in the second column.

3. The person watching romance movies is between the owner of the turtle and the German.
This means the person watching romance movies is in the middle column, and the owner of the turtle is on the left of the German.

4. The owner of the turtle is on the left of the owner of the dog.
This means the owner of the turtle is in the first column, and the owner of the dog is in the second column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Pet           |            |         |              |
#############

From clue 4, we know the owner of the turtle is in the first column, and the owner of the dog is in the second column. From clue 3, we know the person watching romance movies is between the owner of the turtle and the German, so the German is in the third column.

From clue 2, we know the Russian is in the third column, so the German must be the Russian.

Now, let's look at statement 5. The person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person eating onion. Since the person eating avocado is on the far left, the person eating onion must be in the middle or on the right. But the writer is already on the right, so the person eating onion must be in the middle.

From statement 6, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cycling. Since the person eating onion is in the middle, the person who's sport is cycling must be on the right.

2. The person who's sport is rugby is on the right of the person who's hobby is collecting.
3. The person who's sport is rowing is on the far left.

From statement 1, we know the taxi driver is on the left of the rugby person. From statement 3, we know the rowing person is on the far left. Therefore, the rowing person is on the left of the taxi driver.

From statement 2, we know the rugby person is on the right of the collecting person. Since the taxi driver is on the left of the rugby person, the collecting person must be on the left of the taxi driver.

Now, let's look at statement 6: the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the collecting person is on the left of the taxi driver, and the fishing person is on the left of the quad-bike driver, the fishing person must be on the left of the collecting person.

Now we have a rough outline:

Statement 5 says the motorbike driver is on the right of the taxi driver. Since the taxi driver is on the left of the rugby person, the motorbike driver must be on the right of the rugby person.

The only remaining spot is the person who's hobby is video-games. Since they're not on the left of the collecting person, they must be on the right of the rugby person.

5. The security-guard is on the far left or far right.
This means the security-guard is either in the first column (already occupied by the turtle owner) or the third column (already occupied by the car driver). Since the security-guard is not in the middle column, it must be in the first column.
