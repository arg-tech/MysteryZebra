Lv1-1x3-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of trance is on the far left or far right.
2. The fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance.

From clue 1, we know the fan of trance is either in position 1 or position 3.

From clue 2, we know the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of trance. This means the fan of soul must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* If the fan of trance is in position 1, the fan of soul must be in position 2. This would leave position 3 for the fan of rock.
* If the fan of trance is in position 3, the fan of soul must be in position 2. This would leave position 1 for the fan of rock.

In both cases, the fan of soul is in position 2, and the fan of trance is either in position 1 or 3. Since the fan of trance is not in position 2 (because the fan of soul is), the fan of trance must be in position 3.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |  Rock | Soul | Trance |
| Music-Genre   |      |      |        |

Lv1-1x3-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the horse is on the far left or far right.
This means the horse owner is either in position 1 or position 3.

2. The owner of the snake is in the middle.
This means the snake owner is in position 2.

3. The owner of the snake is on the right of the owner of the hamster.
This means the hamster owner is in position 1 (since the snake owner is in the middle and the horse owner is on the far left or far right).

Now, let's combine the information:

|       |    1    |   2   |   3   |
| Pet   |         |       |       |

Since the hamster owner is in position 1, the horse owner is in position 3 (due to clue 1). The snake owner is in position 2 (due to clue 2).

Here's the final solution:

#############
|       | Hamster | Snake | Horse |
| Pet   |         |       |       |

Lv1-1x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left.
This means the dancing hobby is in column 1.

2. The person who's hobby is writing is on the far left or far right.
This means the writing hobby is either in column 1 or column 3.

From clue 1, we know dancing is in column 1. From clue 2, we know writing is either in column 1 or column 3. Since dancing is already in column 1, writing must be in column 3.

The only hobby left is sudoku, which must be in column 2.

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of techno is on the far right.
2. The fan of classical is on the far left or far right.

From clue 1, we know the fan of techno is on the far right, so the table looks like this:

|               |     1     |  2   |   3    |
| Music-Genre   |           |      | techno |

From clue 2, we know the fan of classical is on the far left or far right. Since the fan of techno is already on the far right, the fan of classical must be on the far left. Therefore, the table looks like this:

|               | classical |  2   | techno |
| Music-Genre   |           |      |        |

Now, we're left with one spot for the fan of folk. Since there are only three genres, and we've already filled in two spots, the fan of folk must be in the middle:

|               | classical | folk  | techno |
| Music-Genre   |           |      |        |

So, the final solution is:

3. The person watching documentary movies is in the middle.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching documentary movies.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching documentary movies is in the middle. This means that the person watching martial-arts movies must be on the right, as we already established.

Now, let's look at the table:

Lv1-1x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking coffee is on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate.
This means that coffee and hot-chocolate are adjacent to each other, either in the order coffee, hot-chocolate or hot-chocolate, coffee.

2. The person drinking coffee is on the far left or far right.
This means that coffee cannot be in the middle. It must be either in the first or last position.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|            |   1    |       2       |  3  |
| Beverage   |        |               |     |

From clue 2, we know coffee must be in the first or last position. Let's try it in the first position:

|            |   Coffee  |      ?       | ?  |
| Beverage   |        |               |     |

From clue 1, we know hot-chocolate is to the right of coffee. So, let's put hot-chocolate in the second position:

|            |   Coffee  |   Hot-Chocolate  | ?  |
| Beverage   |        |               |     |

Now, we're left with tea and the third position. Since tea is not mentioned as being adjacent to coffee or hot-chocolate, it must be in the third position:

|            |   Coffee  |   Hot-Chocolate  |  Tea  |
| Beverage   |        |               |     |

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left. Let's represent this as:

|            | Almond-milk |          |          |

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking almond-milk is already on the far left, the person drinking mirinda must be on the far right. Let's represent this as:

|            | Almond-milk |          | Mirinda |

Now, we need to figure out who is drinking lemonade. Since there are only two people left, and one of them is drinking mirinda, the other person must be drinking lemonade. Let's represent this as:

2. The fisherman is on the right of the manager.

From clue 1, we know the manager is either in position 1 or position 3.

From clue 2, we know the fisherman is on the right of the manager, which means the fisherman is either in position 2 or position 3.

Now, let's combine the information:

* If the manager is in position 1, the fisherman must be in position 2 (since the fisherman is on the right of the manager).
* If the manager is in position 3, the fisherman must be in position 2 (since the fisherman is on the right of the manager).

In both cases, the firefighter must be in position 1 (since the manager is not in position 1).

Lv1-1x3-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Colombian is on the far left.
2. The Turkish is on the right of the Mexican.
3. The Mexican is on the left or right of the Turkish.

From clue 1, we know the Colombian is on the leftmost position.

From clue 2, we know the Turkish is on the right of the Mexican. This means the Mexican cannot be on the far right, as that would leave no space for the Turkish. Therefore, the Mexican must be in the middle position.

Now, let's look at clue 3. Since the Mexican is in the middle, the Turkish must be on the right of the Mexican. This means the Colombian is on the left of the Mexican.

Here's the final solution:

The Colombian is on the left, the Mexican is in the middle, and the Turkish is on the right."	{}	False	0	False
