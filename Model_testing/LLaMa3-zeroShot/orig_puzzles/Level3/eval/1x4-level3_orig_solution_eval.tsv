Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating blueberry is on the far left.
2. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry.
3. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating kale.

From clue 1, we know the person eating blueberry is on the far left. Let's represent this as:

|        | Blueberry |           |      |        |

From clue 2, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is already on the far left, the person eating cranberry must be on the left or right of the blueberry. Let's represent this as:

|        | Blueberry | Cranberry |      |        |

From clue 3, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating cranberry is already on the left or right of the person eating blueberry, the person eating kale must be on the left or right of the person eating cranberry. Let's represent this as:

|        | Blueberry | Cranberry | Kale   |        |

Now, we need to figure out who is eating radish. Since there are only 4 people, and we've already accounted for blueberry, cranberry, and kale, the person eating radish must be on the far right. Let's represent this as:

#############
|        | Blueberry | Cranberry | Kale   | Radish |
#############

The final solution is:

Blueberry is eaten by the person on the far left.
Cranberry is eaten by the person to the right of the person eating blueberry.
Kale is eaten by the person to the right of the person eating cranberry.
Radish is eaten by the person on the far right."	{}	False	0	False
Lv1-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking coffee is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
This means that coffee cannot be in the first position, so it must be in either the second, third, or fourth position. Let's assume it's in the second position for now.

2. The person drinking water is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means that water cannot be in the fourth position, as iced-tea would be on the far right, which is not allowed. So, water must be in either the first or second position. Let's assume it's in the first position for now.

3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the far left or far right.
This means that iced-tea cannot be in the second or third position, as it would not be on the far left or far right. So, iced-tea must be in either the first or fourth position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Water is in the first position (from clue 2).
* Coffee is in the second position (from clue 1).
* Iced-tea is in either the first or fourth position (from clue 3).

If iced-tea is in the first position, then fanta would be in the second position, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, iced-tea must be in the fourth position.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |   1   |   2    |   3   |    4     |
| Beverage   | Water | Coffee | Fanta | Iced-Tea |
#############

The final solution is:

Water - 1
Coffee - 2
Fanta - 3
Iced-Tea - 4"	{'beverage': ['water', 'coffee', 'fanta', 'iced-tea']}	True	2	False
Lv1-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

This means that the person who's hobby is fishing must be on the far right. Let's denote the person who's hobby is fishing as F.

2. The person who's hobby is baking is on the far left or far right.

This means that the person who's hobby is baking must be either on the leftmost or rightmost position. Let's denote the person who's hobby is baking as B.

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right.

We already know that F is on the far right, so this clue doesn't add any new information.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* F is on the far right.
* B is on the far left or far right.
* The person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of F.

This means that the person who's hobby is card-games must be on the second position from the right. Let's denote the person who's hobby is card-games as C.

The only remaining hobby is drawing, which must be on the second position from the left. Let's denote the person who's hobby is drawing as D.

Lv1-1x4-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person watching spy movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching spy movies is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
3. The person watching animation movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies.

From clue 1, we know the spy movie person is on the far right.

From clue 2, we know the superhero movie person is to the left of the spy movie person.

From clue 3, we know the animation movie person is either to the left or right of the superhero movie person. Since the spy movie person is on the far right, the animation movie person cannot be to the right of the superhero movie person. Therefore, the animation movie person must be to the left of the superhero movie person.

Lv1-1x4-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
2. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking juice.
3. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee.

From clue 1, we know that fanta is to the right of iced-tea.

From clue 2, we know that iced-tea is to the right of juice.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the order is: juice, iced-tea, fanta.

Now, let's look at clue 3. It says that fanta is on the left or right of coffee. Since fanta is already placed to the right of iced-tea, it must be on the left of coffee.

Lv1-1x4-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching disaster movies is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies.
This means that the person watching disaster movies is either the first or the last person.

2. The person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right.
This means that the person watching epic movies is either the first or the last person.

From clues 1 and 2, we can conclude that the person watching epic movies is the first or the last person, and the person watching disaster movies is also the first or the last person. Since they can't be the same person, we can assume that the person watching epic movies is the first person and the person watching disaster movies is the last person.

3. The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies.
This means that the person watching adventure movies is either the second or the third person.

4. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far right.
This means that the person watching fantasy movies is the last person, which we already concluded.

Now we can start filling in the table:

From clue 2, we know the person watching epic movies is the first person. From clue 4, we know the person watching fantasy movies is the last person. From clue 3, we know the person watching adventure movies is the second or third person. Let's assume the person watching adventure movies is the second person.

Lv1-1x4-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating broccoli is on the right of the person eating strawberry.
This means that broccoli cannot be in the first position, so it must be in either the second or third position.

2. The person eating broccoli is between the person eating avocado and the person eating strawberry.
This means that avocado must be to the left of broccoli, and strawberry must be to the right of broccoli.

Combining the two clues, we can conclude that the order is: [Avocado, Broccoli, Strawberry]

3. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.
This clue doesn't provide much new information, but it does confirm that avocado is not in the same position as pumpkin.

4. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the person eating pumpkin.
This clue is redundant and doesn't provide any new information.

Now that we have the order of [Avocado, Broccoli, Strawberry], we can place pumpkin in the remaining position (first or fourth).

Since pumpkin is not mentioned in the first three clues, we can place it in either the first or fourth position. Let's try both options:

**Option 1: Pumpkin is in the first position**
[Avocado, Broccoli, Strawberry, Pumpkin]

**Option 2: Pumpkin is in the fourth position**
[Pumpkin, Avocado, Broccoli, Strawberry]

Both options satisfy the clues, but we can eliminate Option 1 because it would mean that avocado is between broccoli and strawberry, which contradicts Clue 2.

Therefore, the correct solution is:
