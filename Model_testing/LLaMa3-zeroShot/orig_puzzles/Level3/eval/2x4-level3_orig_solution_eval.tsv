Lv1-2x4-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching thriller movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies.
2. The person watching crime movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies.
From these two statements, we can conclude that the person watching thriller movies is on the left, and the person watching crime movies is on the right.

3. The person driving the car is on the far left or far right.
Since the person watching thriller movies is on the left, the person driving the car must be on the far left.

4. The person watching musical movies is on the right of the person driving the motorbike.
Since the person driving the car is on the far left, the person driving the motorbike must be on the right of the car.

5. The person driving the roller is between the person driving the car and the person driving the motorbike.
Since the person driving the car is on the far left, the person driving the roller must be between the car and the motorbike.

6. The person watching thriller movies is the person driving the bike.
Since the person watching thriller movies is on the left, and the person driving the bike is watching thriller movies, the person driving the bike must be on the far left.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Thriller      | bike     |          |         |          |
#############

Since the person driving the bike is watching thriller movies, and the person watching thriller movies is on the left, the person driving the bike must be on the far left.

The person driving the car is on the far left, so the person driving the car must be watching crime movies.

The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the car, so the person driving the motorbike must be watching musical movies.

The person driving the roller is between the car and the motorbike, so the person driving the roller must be watching disaster movies.

Here's the final solution:

4. The person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the helicopter.
5. The fan of rock is on the far right.
6. The person driving the bus is on the far left.

From clue 1, we know the hip-hop fan is on the left of the helicopter driver. From clue 4, we know the trike driver is on the right of the helicopter driver. Therefore, the order from left to right is:

* Bus driver (far left)
* Hip-hop fan
* Helicopter driver
* Trike driver

From clue 3, we know the techno fan is on the left of the trike driver. Since the trike driver is on the right of the helicopter driver, the techno fan must be on the left of the helicopter driver. Therefore, the order from left to right is:

* Bus driver (far left)
* Techno fan
* Hip-hop fan
* Helicopter driver
* Trike driver

From clue 5, we know the rock fan is on the far right. Since the trike driver is already in the middle, the rock fan must be on the far right, which means the order from left to right is:

* Bus driver (far left)
* Techno fan
* Hip-hop fan
* Helicopter driver
* Trike driver
