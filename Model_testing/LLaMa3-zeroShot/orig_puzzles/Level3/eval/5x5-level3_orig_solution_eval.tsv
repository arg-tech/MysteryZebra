#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is cooking is the owner of the bird. Since the pakistani is the owner of the bird (clue 5), the person who's hobby is cooking must be the pakistani.
* From clue 2, we know the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the pakistani is the person who's hobby is cooking, the person watching scientific movies must be on the left of the pakistani.
* From clue 3, we know the project-manager is on the far right. Since the pakistani is the project-manager (clue 19), the pakistani must be on the far right.
* From clue 4, we know the person watching time-travel movies is in the middle. Since the engineer is in the middle (clue 13), the person watching time-travel movies must be the engineer.
* From clue 6, we know the australian is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the engineer is watching time-travel movies, the australian must be on the right of the engineer.
* From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the american. Since the american is not on the far right (the pakistani is), the american must be in position 2 or 3. However, the australian is already in position 3, so the american must be in position 2. This means the person who's hobby is fishing is in position 4.
* From clue 8, we know the australian is between the pakistani and the owner of the snake. Since the pakistani is on the far right, the australian must be in position 3, and the owner of the snake must be in position 5.
* From clue 9, we know the software-developer is on the left of the pakistani. Since the pakistani is on the far right, the software-developer must be in position 1.
* From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the right of the musician. Since the musician is not in position 1 or 2 (the software-developer and engineer are), the musician must be in position 3 or 4. However, the australian is already in position 3, so the musician must be in position 4. This means the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 5.
* From clue 11, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the right of the owner of the cat. Since the cat is not in position 1 or 2 (the software-developer and engineer are), the cat must be in position 3 or 4. However, the australian is already in position 3, so the cat must be in position 4. This means the person watching zombie movies is in position 5.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the documentary movies are not in position 1 or 2 (the software-developer and engineer are), the documentary movies must be in position 3 or 4. However, the australian is already in position 3, so the documentary movies must be in position 4. This means the person who's hobby is camping is in position 2.
* From clue 14, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the engineer. Since the engineer is in the middle, the owner of the frog must be in position 1 or 3. However, the person who's hobby is hiking is already in position 5, so the owner of the frog must be in position 1. This means the person who's hobby is hiking is also the owner of the frog.
* From clue 15, we know the person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the british. Since the british is not in position 1 or 2 (the software-developer and engineer are), the british must be in position 3 or 4. However, the australian is already in position 3, so the british must be in position 4. This means the person watching documentary movies is in position 3.
* From clue 16, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is the owner of the frog. We already know the person who's hobby is hiking is in position 5, so the owner of the frog is also in position 5.
* From clue 17, we know the pakistani is the owner of the bird. We already know the pakistani is the project-manager and is on the far right, so the pakistani must be in position 5.
* From clue 18, we know the project-manager is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the project-manager is already in position 5, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in position 4.
* From clue 19, we know the pakistani is the project-manager. We already know the pakistani is in position 5, so the pakistani is indeed the project-manager.
