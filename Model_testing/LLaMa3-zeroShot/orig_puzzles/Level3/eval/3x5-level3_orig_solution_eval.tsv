Now, let's combine all the clues and make a table:

#############
| Job           | Movie-Genre   | Transport     |
| Analyst      |              |              |
| Architect    |              |              |

From statement 9, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is on the right of the rabbit (statement 2), the lemonade drinker must be on the right of the rabbit. Let's place the rabbit in position 1.

From statement 3, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the coffee drinker is on the left of the rabbit, the goldfish owner must be on the left of the coffee drinker. Let's place the goldfish in position 1.

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   |    3     |    4     |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |

| Pet        |  Goldfish |  Rabbit  |          |          |  Horse    |

From statement 4, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the goldfish is already placed, the pony owner must be on the left of the goldfish. Let's place the pony in position 2.

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   |    3     |  Pony   |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |

From statement 5, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is on the right of the rabbit, the sudoku person must be on the left of the rabbit. Let's place the sudoku person in position 3.

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   | Sudoku  |  Pony   |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |

| Pet        |  Goldfish |  Rabbit  |          |          |  Horse    |

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since the sudoku person is on the left of the lizard, the gardening person must be on the right of the sudoku person. Let's place the gardening person in position 4.

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   | Sudoku  |  Pony   |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |

| Pet        |  Goldfish |  Rabbit  |          |          |  Horse    |

From statement 10, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the gardening person is in position 4, the 7up drinker must be in position 3 or 4. However, position 3 is already occupied by the sudoku person. Therefore, the 7up drinker must be in position 4, which means the person who's hobby is gardening is actually the 7up drinker. Let's update the table:

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   | 7up     |  Pony   |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |
| Hobby      |        |  Writing  | Sudoku  |  Gardening |           |
| Pet        |  Goldfish |  Rabbit  |          |          |  Horse    |

From statement 11, we know the owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's hobby is photography. Since the pony owner is in position 2, the photography person must be in position 1. Let's update the table:

|            |  Lemonade |  Coffee   | 7up     |  Pony   |  Iced-tea  |
| Beverage   |  Water    |             |          |          |           |
| Hobby      | Photography |  Writing  | Sudoku  |  Gardening |           |
| Pet        |  Goldfish |  Rabbit  |          |  Pony   |  Horse    |

The final solution is:

Lv1-3x5-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The Brazilian is on the right of the owner of the lizard.
2. The Mexican is the chef.
3. The British is on the left of the owner of the fish.
4. The Argentine is on the left or right of the British.
5. The owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
6. The freelancer is the owner of the pony.
7. The owner of the fish is on the left of the coach.
8. The freelancer is the Argentine.
9. The British is on the right of the owner of the pony.
10. The nurse is the British.
11. The Brazilian is on the far right.

From statement 2, we know the Mexican is the chef.

From statement 7, we know the owner of the fish is on the left of the coach.

From statement 9, we know the British is on the right of the owner of the pony.

From statement 10, we know the nurse is the British.

From statement 11, we know the Brazilian is on the far right.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |
| Job           |            |         |         |        |               |
| Nationality   |            |         |         |        |               |
| Pet           |            |         |         |        |               |

We can start by placing the Mexican (chef) in position 1:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |
| Job           |  Chef     |         |         |        |               |

From statement 2, we know the Brazilian is on the right of the owner of the lizard. Since the Mexican is the chef, the Brazilian cannot be the chef. Therefore, the Brazilian must be in position 5.

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

From statement 7, we know the owner of the fish is on the left of the coach. Since the coach is not yet placed, we can't determine the exact position of the fish owner. However, we can place the coach in position 3:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |
| Job           |  Chef     |         | Coach  |        |  Brazilian  |

From statement 9, we know the British is on the right of the owner of the pony. Since the British is the nurse, the pony must be in position 4:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |
| Job           |  Chef     |         | Coach  | Nurse  |  Brazilian  |

| Pet           |            |         |         | Pony   |               |

From statement 6, we know the freelancer is the owner of the pony. Since the freelancer is the Argentine, the Argentine must be in position 2:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |            |         |         | Pony   |               |

From statement 5, we know the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. Since the pony is in position 4, the hamster must be in position 2 or 4. However, the Argentine is already in position 2, so the hamster must be in position 4. This means the owner of the hamster is the same as the owner of the pony, which is the freelancer.

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |            |         |         | Hamster |               |

From statement 3, we know the British is on the left of the owner of the fish. Since the British is the nurse, the fish must be in position 1:

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |  Fish    |         |         | Hamster |               |

From statement 8, we know the freelancer is the Argentine. However, we already placed the Argentine as the freelancer in position 2. This is a contradiction, so we must re-examine the puzzle.

From statement 4, we know the Argentine is on the left or right of the British. Since the British is the nurse, the Argentine must be in position 2 or 4. However, the Argentine is already in position 2, so the Argentine must be in position 4.

|               |     1      |    2    |    3    |   4    |       5       |

| Pet           |  Fish    |         |         | Hamster |               |

From statement 11, we know the Brazilian is on the far right. Since the Brazilian is already in position 5, this is correct.

The final solution is:

Lv1-3x5-5	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and making deductions.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the Mexican. Let's call the Mexican ""M"". Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of M, we can write:

| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |      3      |      4      |     5      |

From clue 2, we know that the Brazilian is on the far left or far right. Since the Brazilian is not on the far left (because the person who's hobby is reading is already there), the Brazilian must be on the far right. Let's call the Brazilian ""B"".

| Hobby         |     1     |       2       |      3      |      4      |     5      |

From clue 3, we know that the Turkish is on the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the Turkish is not on the far right (because the Brazilian is already there), the Turkish must be in position 3 or 4. Let's call the Turkish ""T"".

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's sport is rugby is not on the far left (because the person who's hobby is reading is already there), the person who's sport is rugby must be on the far right. Let's call the person who's sport is rugby ""R"".

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.

From clue 10, we know the fan of classical is on the far left. Since there are only 5 people, we can place the fan of classical in the first column.

```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3       |       4       |     5      |

```

From clue 8, we know the person drinking water is on the far left. Since the fan of classical is already in the first column, the person drinking water must be in the second column.

```
|               |     1     |     2      |       3       |       4       |     5      |

```

```

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since lacrosse is already in the second column, golf must be in the third column.

```

```

```

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the fan of hip-hop. Since there are only 5 people, we can place the fan of hip-hop in the fourth column.

```
|               | hot-choc |  water    |               | hip-hop     |            |
| Music-Genre   | classical|            |               |            |            |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

From clue 9, we know the person drinking milk is on the right of the fan of hip-hop. Since there are only 5 people, we can place milk in the fifth column.

| Music-Genre   | classical|            |               |            |            |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

From clue 4, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the fan of metal. Since there are only 5 people, we can place metal in the fourth column.

```
|               | hot-choc |  water    | metal       | hip-hop     | milk       |
| Music-Genre   | classical|            |               |            |            |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

From clue 7, we know the fan of dubstep is in the middle. Since there are only 5 people, we can place dubstep in the third column.

```
|               | hot-choc |  water    | dubstep     | metal       | milk       |
| Music-Genre   | classical|  dubstep  |               |            |            |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

Now we can fill in the remaining columns. Since punk is the only remaining music genre, we can place it in the fifth column.

```
|               | hot-choc |  water    | dubstep     | metal       | milk       |
| Music-Genre   | classical|  dubstep  |               |            |  punk      |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

Finally, we can place mirinda in the fourth column, since it's the only remaining beverage.

```
|               | hot-choc |  water    | mirinda     | metal       | milk       |
| Music-Genre   | classical|  dubstep  |               |            |  punk      |
| Sport         |  golf    |  lacrosse |               |  weightlifting|            |
```

The final solution is:

```
#############
|               | hot-choc |  water    | mirinda     | metal       | milk       |
| Music-Genre   | classical|  dubstep  |               |            |  punk      |

| R (R&B)      | B (Baking) |           |              |        |        |

The final solution is:

#############
