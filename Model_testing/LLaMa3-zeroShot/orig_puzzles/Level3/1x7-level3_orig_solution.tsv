Lv1-1x7-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
2. The person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person drinking juice.
3. The person drinking cola is on the right of the person drinking juice.
From these three clues, we can conclude that the person drinking juice is in the middle, and the person drinking cola is to the right of juice.

4. The person drinking 7up is on the far left or far right.
5. The person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking cola.
6. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking sprite.
7. The person drinking milk is on the far left or far right.
8. The person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea.
9. The person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.

From clues 4 and 7, we know that the person drinking 7up is either on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking juice is in the middle, the person drinking 7up cannot be on the left of juice. Therefore, the person drinking 7up must be on the far right.

From clues 8 and 9, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means that the person drinking iced-tea must be on the left of the person drinking 7up.

Now we can start filling in the table:

|            |  1   |   2   |  3   |   4    |    5     |    6     |  7  |
| Beverage   |      |       |      |        |          |          |     |

From the above analysis, we know that:

* The person drinking juice is in the middle (3)
* The person drinking cola is to the right of juice (5)
* The person drinking 7up is on the far right (7)
* The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of 7up (1)

We can now fill in the table:

| Beverage   | iced-tea |      | juice |        | cola     | lemonade | 7up |

The final solution is:

The person drinking iced-tea is on the left, the person drinking juice is in the middle, the person drinking cola is to the right of juice, the person drinking lemonade is to the right of cola, and the person drinking 7up is on the far right."

6. The electrician is on the left of the photographer: This means the photographer is to the right of the electrician.
7. The electrician is on the left of the photographer: This is a duplicate of clue 6, so we can ignore it.
8. The designer is between the videographer and the dressmaker##2: This means the designer is in the position between the videographer and the dressmaker.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

4. The Russian is on the left or right of the Mexican.
5. The Spanish is on the right of the Dutch.
6. The Russian is on the right of the Spanish.
7. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian.

From clue 3, we know the Egyptian is on the far left. From clue 7, we know the Chinese is on the left or right of the Egyptian. Since the Egyptian is already on the far left, the Chinese must be on the left of the Egyptian.

From clue 1, we know the Russian is between the Mexican and the Spanish. This means the Russian cannot be on the far left or far right. From clue 4, we know the Russian is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since the Russian is not on the far left, it must be on the right of the Mexican.

From clue 5, we know the Spanish is on the right of the Dutch. From clue 6, we know the Russian is on the right of the Spanish. This means the Russian cannot be on the right of the Dutch, as that would put the Spanish in the middle. Therefore, the Dutch must be on the right of the Argentine.

Now we can start filling in the table:
