1. The person watching adventure movies is the person driving the subway.
This means the person driving the subway has a preference for adventure movies.

2. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the subway.
This means the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person driving the subway.

3. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies.
This means the person watching mystery movies is either to the left or right of the person driving the taxi.

4. The person driving the subway is on the far left.
This means the person driving the subway is in the first position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |            |            |
| Transport     |           |            |            |

From clue 4, we know the person driving the subway is in the first position. From clue 1, we know this person watches adventure movies.

|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure |           |            |
| Transport     | Subway    |            |            |

From clue 2, we know the person driving the taxi is to the right of the person driving the subway. This means the person driving the taxi is in the second or third position.

|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |

| Transport     | Subway    | Taxi      |            |

From clue 3, we know the person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching mystery movies. Since the person driving the taxi is in the second or third position, the person watching mystery movies must be in the first or third position.

|               |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Movie-Genre   | Mystery   |           | Adventure |

Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is handball.

This means that the person who's sport is golf is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position, and the person who's sport is handball is in the middle.

2. The pilot is on the left of the fisherman.

This means that the pilot is either in the leftmost position or the second position from the left, and the fisherman is in the rightmost position or the second position from the right.

3. The person who's sport is golf is on the far left or far right.

This clue is already satisfied by clue 1, which states that the person who's sport is golf is either on the leftmost position or the rightmost position.

4. The librarian is the person who's sport is ice-hockey.

This means that the librarian is in the middle position, since the person who's sport is ice-hockey cannot be in the leftmost or rightmost position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The pilot is on the left of the fisherman, so the pilot is either in the leftmost position or the second position from the left.
* The librarian is in the middle position, and their sport is ice-hockey.
* The person who's sport is golf is on the left of the person who's sport is handball, so the person who's sport is golf is either in the leftmost position or the rightmost position.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-2x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of R&B is on the far left or far right.
2. The accountant is on the far right.
3. The paramedic is the fan of techno.
4. The fan of R&B is on the right of the fan of techno.

From clue 1, we know the fan of R&B is either on the leftmost or rightmost position.

From clue 2, we know the accountant is on the far right, so the fan of R&B cannot be on the rightmost position (since the accountant is already there). Therefore, the fan of R&B must be on the leftmost position.

From clue 3, we know the paramedic is the fan of techno.

From clue 4, we know the fan of R&B is on the right of the fan of techno. Since the fan of R&B is already on the leftmost position, the fan of techno must be in the middle position.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############

Lv1-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.

This means that the video-games person is either on the left of the fishing person or on the right of the fishing person.

2. The person who's hobby is video-games is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing.

This clue doesn't add much new information, but it reinforces the idea that the video-games person is either on the left or right of the fishing person.

3. The owner of the fish is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the owner of the mouse.

This clue tells us that the fish owner is sandwiched between the video-games person and the mouse owner.

Now, let's start filling in the table:

|         |      1      |    2    |   3    |
| Hobby   |             |         |        |
| Pet     |             |         |        |

From clue 1, we know the video-games person is on the left of the fishing person. Let's assume the video-games person is in position 1.

|         | Video-games |    2    |   3    |
| Hobby   |             |         |        |
| Pet     |             |         |        |

From clue 3, we know the fish owner is between the video-games person and the mouse owner. Since the video-games person is in position 1, the fish owner must be in position 2.

|         | Video-games | Fish    |   3    |
| Hobby   |             |         |        |
| Pet     |             |         |        |

Now, we know the fish owner is in position 2, and the video-games person is in position 1. From clue 1, we know the fishing person is to the right of the video-games person, so the fishing person must be in position 3.

|         | Video-games | Fish    | Fishing |
| Hobby   |             |         |        |
| Pet     |             |         |        |

The only pet left is the mouse, which must be owned by the person in position 3 (fishing).

|         | Video-games | Fish    | Fishing |
| Hobby   |             |         |        |
| Pet     |             | Mouse  |        |

Finally, the only hobby left is baking, which must be the hobby of the person in position 1 (video-games).

|         | Video-games | Fish    | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Baking     |         |        |
| Pet     |             | Mouse  |        |

The final solution is:

|         | Video-games | Fish    | Fishing |
| Hobby   | Baking     |         |        |

Lv1-2x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person watching action movies##3
This means the person watching action movies is either on the left or right of the taxi driver.

2. The person driving the subway is on the left of the person driving the ship
This means the subway driver is to the left of the ship driver.

3. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person watching action movies
This means the taxi driver is to the right of the person watching action movies.

4. The person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the person driving the taxi##2
This means the person watching action movies is sandwiched between the person watching disaster movies and the taxi driver.

From clue 4, we know the order is: disaster movies -> action movies -> taxi driver

From clue 3, we know the taxi driver is to the right of the person watching action movies, so the order is: disaster movies -> action movies -> taxi driver

From clue 1, we know the taxi driver is on the left or right of the person watching action movies. Since we already know the taxi driver is to the right of the person watching action movies, the taxi driver must be on the right.

From clue 2, we know the subway driver is on the left of the ship driver. Since we don't have any information about the subway driver's position relative to the person watching action movies, we'll come back to this clue later.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Transport |
| Action      | Taxi      |
| Disaster    |?        |
| Family      |?        |
|            | Ship     |
|            | Subway   |
#############

We know the taxi driver is on the right of the person watching action movies, so the taxi driver must be in the ""Transport"" column. We also know the person watching action movies is between the person watching disaster movies and the taxi driver, so the person watching action movies must be in the ""Action"" row.

From clue 4, we know the person watching disaster movies is to the left of the person watching action movies. Since the taxi driver is on the right of the person watching action movies, the person watching disaster movies must be on the left of the taxi driver.

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Transport |
| Action      | Taxi      |
| Disaster    | Ship     |
| Family      | Subway   |
#############

We've solved the puzzle! The person watching action movies is in the ""Action"" row, the person watching disaster movies is in the ""Disaster"" row, and the person watching family movies is in the ""Family"" row. The taxi driver is in the ""Transport"" column, the ship driver is in the ""Disaster"" row, and the subway driver is in the ""Family"" row."
Lv1-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The lawyer is on the left of the accountant.
This means the order is:? (lawyer) - accountant -?

2. The person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking.
This means the person who bakes is on the left of the person who plays chess.

3. The person who's hobby is traveling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is baking.
This means the person who bakes is sandwiched between the person who travels and the person who plays chess.

4. The person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the engineer.
This means the order is:? (engineer) -? (baking) -?

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The lawyer is on the left of the accountant.
* The engineer is on the left of the person who bakes.
* The person who bakes is on the left of the person who plays chess.
* The person who travels is on the left or right of the person who bakes.

The possible order is:

|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Hobby   |           |        |            |
| Job     |           |        |            |

 Lawyer (traveling) - Engineer - Baker (baking) - Accountant (chess)

Or:

|         |     1     |   2    |     3      |
| Hobby   |           |        |            |
| Job     |           |        |            |

 Lawyer (traveling) - Baker (baking) - Engineer - Accountant (chess)

The second option is not possible because the lawyer would be on the right of the accountant, which contradicts clue 1.

So, the final solution is:

2. The person eating orange is in the middle.
This means that the person eating orange is in the second position.

3. The person drinking milk is on the left of the person drinking fanta.
This means that the person drinking milk is in the leftmost position, and the person drinking fanta is in the second position.

4. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.
