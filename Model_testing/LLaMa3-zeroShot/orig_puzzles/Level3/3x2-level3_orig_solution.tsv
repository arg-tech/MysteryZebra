Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the fan of d&b
This means that the surfing sport is paired with either d&b music or soul music. Since the person eating mango is on the left or right of the fan of soul (clue 2), the surfing sport cannot be paired with soul music. Therefore, the surfing sport must be paired with d&b music.

2. The person eating mango is on the left or right of the fan of soul
This means that the person eating mango is either the fan of soul or is paired with the fan of soul.

Now, let's create a possible solution table:

|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Avocado  | Mango   |
| Music-Genre   | d&b      | Soul    |
| Sport         | Badminton| Surfing |

In this solution, the person eating mango is paired with the fan of soul, and the person eating avocado is paired with the fan of d&b. The surfing sport is paired with d&b music, and the badminton sport is paired with soul music.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The videographer is on the right of the person driving the car.
This means that the videographer cannot be the one driving the car, and the person driving the car must be on the left of the videographer.

2. The person driving the car is on the left or right of the Nigerian.
This means that the Nigerian must be in the middle, and the person driving the car must be either on the left or right of the Nigerian.

From clue 1, we know the videographer is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the Nigerian is in the middle, the videographer must be on the right of the Nigerian.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

Lv1-3x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: fantasy, thriller
This means we have two people, each preferring one of these genres.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: australian, chinese
This means we have two people, each with one of these nationalities.

3. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: climbing, ice-hockey
This means we have two people, each preferring one of these sports.

4. The chinese is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies
This means the Chinese person is on the left of the person who prefers fantasy movies.

5. The person who's sport is climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies
This means the person who prefers climbing is either on the left or right of the person who prefers thriller movies.

Now, let's create a table to represent the puzzle:

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |            |            |

| Sport         |            |            |

From clue 4, we know the Chinese person is on the left of the person watching fantasy movies. Let's assume the Chinese person is on the left, and the person watching fantasy movies is on the right. This means the person watching thriller movies must be on the left of the Chinese person.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Thriller  |  Fantasy   |
| Nationality   |  Chinese  |  Australian|
| Sport         |            |            |

From clue 5, we know the person who prefers climbing is on the left or right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching thriller movies is already on the left, the person who prefers climbing must be on the right.

|               |     1      |     2      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Thriller  |  Fantasy   |
| Nationality   |  Chinese  |  Australian|

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: satire, superhero
This clue doesn't give us any direct information about the table, but it tells us that there are two people who prefer satire and two people who prefer superhero movies.

2. There are 2 different nationalities: british, french
This clue tells us that there are two people with different nationalities, one British and one French.

3. 2 different pets are kept: hedgehog, snake
This clue tells us that there are two people who keep different pets, one with a hedgehog and one with a snake.

4. The British is on the left of the person watching satire movies
This clue tells us that the British person is on the left of the person who prefers satire movies.

5. The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French
This clue tells us that the owner of the hedgehog is either on the left or right of the French person.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

|               |     1     |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |        |
| Nationality   |           |        |
| Pet           |           |        |

From clue 4, we know the British person is on the left of the person who prefers satire movies. Let's assume the British person is in position 1. Then, the person who prefers satire movies must be in position 2.

|               |     1 (British) |   2    |
| Movie-Genre   |           |        |
| Nationality   |           |        |
| Pet           |           |        |

From clue 2, we know there is a French person. Since the British person is already in position 1, the French person must be in position 2. But we also know that the person who prefers satire movies is in position 2, so the French person cannot be the one who prefers satire movies. Therefore, the French person must prefer superhero movies.

|               |     1 (British) |   2 (French) |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire        | Superhero   |
| Nationality   |           |        |
| Pet           |           |        |

From clue 3, we know there are two people who keep different pets, one with a hedgehog and one with a snake. Let's assume the person with the hedgehog is in position 1. Then, the person with the snake must be in position 2.

|               |     1 (British, Hedgehog) |   2 (French, Snake) |
| Movie-Genre   | Satire        | Superhero   |
| Nationality   | British      | French      |
| Pet           | Hedgehog    | Snake       |

Now, let's check if the solution satisfies all the clues:

* Clue 1: The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: satire, superhero (satisfied)
* Clue 2: There are 2 different nationalities: british, french (satisfied)
* Clue 3: 2 different pets are kept: hedgehog, snake (satisfied)
* Clue 4: The British is on the left of the person watching satire movies (satisfied)
* Clue 5: The owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the French (satisfied)

The solution satisfies all the clues, so we can conclude that the final solution is:

Lv1-3x2-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the fisherman. This means that the fisherman cannot be drinking lemonade.

From clue 2, we know that the Brazilian is on the left or right of the fisherman. This means that the Brazilian cannot be the person drinking lemonade, since the person drinking lemonade is already on the right of the fisherman.

Now, let's consider the possible combinations:

* If the fisherman is on the left, the Brazilian must be on the right, and the person drinking lemonade must be on the right of the fisherman. But then, the Brazilian would be on the right of the fisherman, which contradicts clue 2. So, the fisherman cannot be on the left.
* If the fisherman is on the right, the Brazilian must be on the left, and the person drinking lemonade must be on the right of the fisherman. This combination satisfies all the clues.

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-3x2-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the fan of rock.
This means that the fan of rock is either in the middle or on the right side of the table.

2. The person who's hobby is photography is on the left of the fan of rock.
This means that the fan of rock is on the right side of the table, and the person with photography as their hobby is on the left side.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 2, we know that the person with photography as their hobby is on the left side. Let's assume this person is in position 1.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of rock is on the right side. Let's assume this person is in position 2.

We still need to determine the music genre for the person in position 1. Since the person in position 1 has photography as their hobby, they might prefer a music genre that is often associated with photography, such as soul. Let's assume this is the case.

Lv1-3x2-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

This means that the person who prefers satire movies must be in the rightmost column, and the person who prefers skateboarding must be in either the leftmost or second column.

2. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person drinking mirinda.

This means that the person who prefers skateboarding must be in either the leftmost or rightmost column, and the person who drinks mirinda must be in the same column.

Combining these two statements, we can conclude that:

* The person who prefers skateboarding is in the leftmost column.
* The person who drinks mirinda is in the leftmost column.
* The person who prefers satire movies is in the rightmost column.

Now, let's consider the remaining information:

* There are 2 different favourite beverages: fanta, mirinda
* The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: epic, satire
* The people prefer 2 different types of sport: parkour, skateboarding

We know that the person who drinks mirinda is in the leftmost column, so they must prefer fanta (since mirinda is already taken). This means that the person in the leftmost column prefers fanta and skateboarding.

The person in the rightmost column prefers satire movies, so they must prefer epic (since satire is already taken). This means that the person in the rightmost column prefers epic and parkour.
