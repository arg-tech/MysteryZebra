This means that the person who likes skateboarding also likes electronic music.

Now, let's fill in the table:

From statement 1, we know that the person who eats papaya has reading as their hobby. Let's put the person who eats papaya in position 2:

From statement 3, we know that the person who owns the guinea-pig is either to the left or right of the person who likes skateboarding. Since the person who likes skateboarding also likes electronic music (statement 4), let's put the person who owns the guinea-pig in position 1 (since we don't know which side they are on yet):

|               | d&b        | papaya      |

| Sport         |             |               |

From statement 4, we know that the person who likes skateboarding also likes electronic music. Since the person who likes skateboarding is either to the left or right of the person who owns the guinea-pig, let's put the person who likes skateboarding in position 2:

|               | d&b        | papaya      |
| Food          |             | papaya      |

Lv1-5x2-4	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest clues and work our way up.

From clue 1, we know the fan of salsa is on the far right. Let's put a ""S"" in the Music-Genre column for the far-right person.

| Music-Genre   |             | S          |

From clue 2, we know the person watching spy movies is the person drinking lemonade. Let's put a ""L"" in the Beverage column for the person watching spy movies.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             | L          |

| Movie-Genre   | S          |            |
| Music-Genre   |             | S          |

From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. Let's put a ""S"" in the Hobby column for the person on the left.

|               |      1      |     2      |

| Music-Genre   |             | S          |

From clue 4, we know the person eating papaya is on the left or right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the person drinking lemonade is already placed, let's put a ""P"" in the Food column for the person on the left of the lemonade drinker.

|               |      1      |     2      |

| Music-Genre   |             | S          |

Now we can start making some deductions. Since the person eating papaya is on the left of the lemonade drinker, the person eating cauliflower must be on the right of the lemonade drinker. Let's put a ""C"" in the Food column for the person on the right of the lemonade drinker.

|               |      1      |     2      |

| Music-Genre   |             | S          |

Finally, we can place the remaining person. Since the person watching thriller movies is not the person drinking lemonade, and the person eating papaya is on the left of the lemonade drinker, the person watching thriller movies must be the person on the right. Let's put a ""T"" in the Movie-Genre column for the person on the right.

|               |      1      |     2      |
| Beverage      |             | L          |

Lv1-5x2-7	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the ferret is on the left or right of the fan of indie.
This means that the ferret owner is adjacent to the indie fan.

2. The owner of the hamster is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.
This means that the hamster owner is to the right of the rowing sport enthusiast.

3. The fan of indie is on the left or right of the person driving the roller.
This means that the indie fan is adjacent to the roller driver.

4. The owner of the ferret is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk.
This means that the ferret owner is to the left of the almond-milk drinker.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The ferret owner is adjacent to the indie fan (clue 1).
* The indie fan is adjacent to the roller driver (clue 3).
* The ferret owner is to the left of the almond-milk drinker (clue 4).

This means that the ferret owner is to the left of the indie fan, who is adjacent to the roller driver, who is to the right of the almond-milk drinker.

Here's the possible arrangement:

#############
|  Ferret  |  Indie  |  Roller  |  Almond-milk  |
|  Hamster  |  Rowing  |  Juice  |  Helicopter  |
#############

The remaining cells can be filled in as follows:

* The person drinking juice is the rowing sport enthusiast, as they are adjacent to the hamster owner.
* The person driving the helicopter is the fan of rock music, as they are not adjacent to the indie fan.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|  Ferret  |  Indie  |  Roller  |  Almond-milk  |
|  Hamster  |  Rowing  |  Juice  |  Helicopter  |
|  Rock  |  Music-Genre  |  Pet  |  Sport  |
#############

Note that the table is not fully filled, as some cells do not have unique values. However, the above arrangement satisfies all the given clues."

Lv1-5x2-10	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the trike is on the left of the Polish person.
2. The person driving the trike is on the left or right of the Polish person. (This statement is redundant, but it doesn't hurt to keep it in mind.)
3. The person drinking water is on the right of the person watching drama movies.
4. The owner of the hedgehog is on the far left.

From statement 1, we know the trike driver is on the left of the Polish person. Let's call the Polish person P.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the far left. Since the hedgehog owner is on the far left, the Polish person P cannot be the hedgehog owner. Therefore, the hedgehog owner is on the far left, and P is on the second position from the left.

Now, let's consider the trike driver. From statement 1, we know the trike driver is on the left of P. From statement 2, we know the trike driver is on the left or right of P. Since P is on the second position from the left, the trike driver must be on the far left, which means the hedgehog owner is also the trike driver.

Now, let's focus on the person drinking water. From statement 3, we know the person drinking water is on the right of the person watching drama movies. Since the trike driver is on the far left, the person watching drama movies must be on the right of the trike driver. Let's call the person watching drama movies D.

The remaining person is the owner of the ferret. Since the ferret owner is not the trike driver, hedgehog owner, or the person drinking water, they must be the person watching satire movies.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1     |    2    |
| Beverage      | Mirinda  | Water   |
| Movie-Genre   | Drama    | Satire  |
| Nationality   | Polish   | Spanish |
| Pet           | Hedgehog | Ferret  |
| Transport     | Trike    | Scooter |
#############

Here's the solution:

1. The person driving the trike is the hedgehog owner, who is on the far left.
2. The person watching drama movies is on the right of the trike driver.
3. The person drinking water is on the right of the person watching drama movies.
4. The owner of the ferret is the person watching satire movies.

Note that the Polish person is on the second position from the left, and the Spanish person is on the right."
