#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the lizard owner is on the left or right of the almond-milk drinker. Since the lizard owner is on the far right (statement 9), the almond-milk drinker must be on the left.
2. From statement 2, we know the spinach eater is the lacrosse player. Since the spinach eater is not the person eating peas (statement 3), the lacrosse player must be someone else.
3. From statement 4, we know the magic-tricks hobbyist is the handball player. Since the handball player is not the person eating peas (statement 3), the magic-tricks hobbyist must be someone else.
4. From statement 5, we know the dressmaker is on the right of the mechanic. Since the dressmaker is also on the right of the almond-milk drinker (statement 17), the mechanic must be on the left of the almond-milk drinker.
5. From statement 6, we know the helicopter driver is on the left or right of the baseball player. Since the helicopter driver is on the far left or far right (statement 16), the baseball player must be in the middle.

11. From statement 15, we know the car driver is on the left or right of the cherry eater. Since the car driver is not the person eating peas (statement 3), the car driver must be someone else.
12. From statement 16, we know the helicopter driver is on the far left or far right. Since the helicopter driver is already placed (statement 6), this statement is redundant.
