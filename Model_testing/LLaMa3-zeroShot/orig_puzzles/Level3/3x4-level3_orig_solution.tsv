Since the Japanese is the dancer, we can remove the dancer from the job column. We're left with bartender, doctor, and videographer.

The Brazilian is on the right of the American, so the American must be on the left of the Brazilian. The person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the Brazilian, so the person who's hobby is writing must be on the left of the American.

The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the doctor, and the American is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. This means the doctor must be on the left of the American.

The videographer is on the right of the Japanese, and the Japanese is on the left of the doctor. This means the videographer must be on the right of the doctor.

The person who's hobby is camping is on the left of the Japanese, and the doctor is on the right of the Japanese. This means the person who's hobby is camping must be on the left of the doctor.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1       |    2     |     3     |     4     |
| Hobby         | writing      | gardening | camping   | traveling |
| Job           | doctor       | videographer | bartender | dancer    |
| Nationality   | american     | mexican     | brazilian | japanese  |
#############

Note that this solution assumes the Brazilian is on the right of the American. If we assume the Brazilian is on the left of the American, we can derive a different solution. However, this solution satisfies all the given statements."
