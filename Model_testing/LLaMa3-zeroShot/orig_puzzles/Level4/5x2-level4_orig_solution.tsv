3. There are 2 different nationalities: nigerian, pakistani
4. 2 different pets are kept: chinchilla, horse
5. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: golf, skiing

From clue 1, we know that the person who watches epic movies is not the same as the person who watches family movies. Let's call the person who watches epic movies ""E"" and the person who watches family movies ""F"".

From clue 2, we know that the person who likes electronic music is in an even position. Let's call this person ""E"" (since they like epic movies and electronic music).

From clue 3, we know that the pakistani is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since E is already in an even position, the pakistani must be in an odd position. Let's call the pakistani ""P"".

From clue 4, we know that the person who likes skiing is in an odd position. Since P is already in an odd position, the person who likes skiing must be to the right of P. Let's call this person ""S"".

From clue 5, we know that the person who keeps the horse is on the far left. Let's call this person ""H"".

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-5x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step:

1. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the dog.
This means that the person drinking almond-milk is either in position 2 or 3, and the owner of the dog is in position 1.

2. The person watching action movies is the manager.
This means that the manager is in position 1 or 3, and watches action movies.

3. The person watching action movies is in an even position.
This means that the manager is in position 2, since they watch action movies and are in an even position.

4. The scientist is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
This means that the scientist is in position 1 or 3, and the person who's sport is surfing is in position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |      2      |

| Sport         |            |             |
#############

From clue 1, we know the owner of the dog is in position 1. From clue 2, we know the manager is in position 2 and watches action movies. From clue 3, we know the manager is in position 2. From clue 4, we know the scientist is in position 1 or 3.

Let's assume the scientist is in position 1. Then, the person who's sport is surfing is in position 2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the owner of the dog, so they are in position 3.

Here's the updated table:

#############
|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |

| Sport         |            | Surfing    |            |
#############

From the remaining clues, we can fill in the table:

* The person drinking mirinda is the scientist, since they are not the manager and don't watch action movies.
* The person watching epic movies is the person in position 3, since they are not the manager and don't watch action movies.
* The person keeping a lizard is the person in position 2, since they are not the owner of the dog and don't watch action movies.
* The person keeping a dog is the owner of the dog, who is in position 1.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |

Now, let's try to fill in the table. We know that the person who likes blues is on the right of the person who likes cycling, so the person who likes blues must be in the rightmost column. This means that the person who likes cycling must be in the second column from the right.

We also know that the person eating cranberry is on the right of the person watching action movies, so the person eating cranberry must be in the rightmost column. This means that the person watching action movies must be in the column to the left of the cranberry eater, which is the second column from the right.

Now, let's try to fill in the remaining columns. We know that the nigerian is in an odd position, so the nigerian must be in either the first or third column. We also know that the person who likes blues is on the right of the person who likes cycling, so the person who likes blues must be in the rightmost column.

Lv1-5x2-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Malaysian is on the left or right of the person eating pomegranate.
This means the Malaysian is either in the first or third column.

2. The person watching romance movies is in an odd position.
This means the person watching romance movies is either in the first or third column.

3. The teacher is on the right of the Malaysian.
This means the teacher is in the third column, and the Malaysian is in the first or second column.

4. The person driving the motorbike is on the far right.
This means the person driving the motorbike is in the last column.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The Malaysian is in the first or second column.
* The teacher is in the third column.
* The person driving the motorbike is in the last column.

We can create a possible arrangement:

|               |     1      |      2      |      3      |      4      |

| Transport     |            |            |            |            |

Since the Malaysian is in the first or second column, let's assume they are in the first column. The teacher is in the third column, and the person driving the motorbike is in the last column.

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

* The person eating pomegranate is not the Malaysian, so they must be in the second column.
* The person watching romance movies is in an odd position, so they must be in the first or third column. Since the Malaysian is in the first column, the person watching romance movies must be in the third column.
* The person eating strawberry is not the person watching romance movies, so they must be in the second column.

1. The electrician is in an odd position, which means they are either in the first or third column.
2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the person watching spy movies. This means that the hot-chocolate drinker is either in the second or third column, and the spy movie fan is in the first or second column.
3. The person who's hobby is collecting is the writer. This means that the writer is in the second column (since the electrician is in an odd position).
