Lv1-7x2-9	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of R&B is on the left of the dressmaker. Let's assume the dressmaker is on the right side of the table. Then, the fan of R&B must be on the left side.

From clue 2, we know that the Dutch person is in an odd position. Since there are only 2 odd positions (1st and 3rd), the Dutch person must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.

From clue 3, we know that the dressmaker's sport is sailing. Since the dressmaker is on the right side, the dressmaker must be in the 2nd position.

From clue 4, we know that the electrician is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the dressmaker is on the right side, the electrician must be in the 1st position.

From clue 5, we know that the person who's hobby is card-games is on the left of the person eating tomato. Since the electrician is on the left side, the person eating tomato must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Food          |             | Tomato    |
| Hobby         | Card-games  | Video-games|
| Job           | Electrician| Dressmaker |
| Music-Genre   |             | R&B       |
| Nationality   | Dutch      | Chinese   |
| Pet           | Goldfish   | Bird      |
| Sport         |             | Sailing   |
#############

We can now fill in the remaining cells:

* The person eating zucchini must be the Chinese person, since they are not the dressmaker and not eating tomato.
* The person with the hobby video-games must be the Chinese person, since they are not the electrician and not eating tomato.
* The person with the music genre dubstep must be the Dutch person, since they are not the Chinese person and not eating tomato.

Here is the final solution table:

#############
|               |      1      |      2      |
| Food          | Zucchini   | Tomato    |
| Hobby         | Card-games  | Video-games|
| Job           | Electrician| Dressmaker |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep    | R&B       |
| Nationality   | Dutch      | Chinese   |
| Pet           | Goldfish   | Bird      |
| Sport         |             | Sailing   |
