Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Russian is in an odd position, so it must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.
2. The Turkish is between the German and the Russian, so the Turkish must be in the 2nd position.
3. The Turkish is on the right of the German, which means the German must be in the 1st position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |   1    |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Nationality   |  German | Turkish |        | Russian |
#############

The solution is:

German (1)
Turkish (2)
? (3)
Russian (4)

The Thai nationality is not mentioned in the clues, so we can't determine its position. However, we can conclude that the German is in the 1st position, the Turkish is in the 2nd position, and the Russian is in the 4th position."
Lv1-1x4-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating avocado is on the left of the person eating potato.

This means that avocado cannot be in the last position (4), and potato cannot be in the first position (1). We can also conclude that avocado is to the left of potato, so the possible positions are:

|        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
| Food   |        |         |        |       |
|        | ?    | ?    | Avocado | Potato |

2. The person eating banana is in an odd position (1, 3, or 4).

This means that banana cannot be in the second position (2). We can conclude that banana is in either position 1, 3, or 4.

3. The person eating banana is on the left or right of the person eating avocado.

This means that if banana is in position 1, it would be on the left of avocado. If banana is in position 3, it would be on the right of avocado. If banana is in position 4, it would be on the right of avocado. We can conclude that banana is in either position 1 or 4.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Avocado is on the left of potato, so it's not in position 4.
* Banana is in an odd position, so it's not in position 2.
* Banana is on the left or right of avocado, so it's either in position 1 or 4.

The only possible solution is:

|        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
| Food   |  Banana | ?    | Avocado | Potato |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* The person eating lemon is in position 2, as it's the only remaining option.
* The person eating potato is in position 4, as we already concluded.
* The person eating avocado is in position 3, as we already concluded.

The final solution is:

#############
|        |   1    |    2    |   3    |   4   |
| Food   |  Banana |  Lemon | Avocado | Potato |

Lv1-1x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
This means that the person watching zombie movies cannot be in the middle, as they would be sandwiched between the person watching drama movies and someone else. So, the person watching zombie movies must be either on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.

2. The person watching drama movies is in an odd position.
This means that the person watching drama movies cannot be in the middle (position 2), as the middle is an even position. So, the person watching drama movies must be either in position 1 (odd) or position 3 (odd).

3. The person watching mystery movies is between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching martial-arts movies.
This means that the person watching mystery movies cannot be in position 1 or 4, as they would not be between the person watching zombie movies and the person watching martial-arts movies. So, the person watching mystery movies must be in position 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies, and the person watching drama movies is in an odd position. This means that the person watching zombie movies must be in position 1 or 4.
* The person watching mystery movies is in position 2.
* The person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3, as they are not in position 1 or 2.

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Movie-Genre | Drama | Mystery | Martial-Arts | Zombie |
|-------------|--------|---------|--------------|--------|
|             | 3      | 2       | 1           | 4      |

Lv1-1x4-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the person who's sport is baseball.

This means that snowboarding cannot be in position 1 or 3, as it would be in the middle of baseball. So, snowboarding must be in position 2 or 4.

2. The person who's sport is soccer is in an even position.

This means that soccer must be in position 2 or 4, as only these positions are even.

3. The person who's sport is weightlifting is between the person who's sport is baseball and the person who's sport is soccer.

This means that weightlifting must be in position 3, as it is between baseball (which is not in position 3) and soccer (which is in an even position).

Now, let's combine the information:

* Snowboarding is in position 2 or 4.
* Soccer is in position 2 or 4.
* Weightlifting is in position 3.

The only combination that satisfies all these conditions is:

#############
|         |      1       |    2     |       3       |   4    |
| Sport   | Baseball    | Snowboarding | Weightlifting | Soccer |
#############

So, the final solution is:

Baseball in position 1
Snowboarding in position 2
Weightlifting in position 3
Soccer in position 4"
Lv1-1x4-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is handball is in an even position.
This means that the person who plays handball is either in position 2 or 4.

2. The person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is handball.
This means that if the person who plays handball is in position 2, the person who plays sailing must be in position 3 or 4. If the person who plays handball is in position 4, the person who plays sailing must be in position 4.

3. The person who's sport is lacrosse is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing.
This means that if the person who plays sailing is in position 3, the person who plays lacrosse must be in position 2 or 4. If the person who plays sailing is in position 4, the person who plays lacrosse must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the clues and try to find a solution:

If the person who plays handball is in position 2, the person who plays sailing must be in position 3 or 4. But then, the person who plays lacrosse would have to be in position 1, which is not possible according to clue 3.

So, the person who plays handball must be in position 4. This means that the person who plays sailing must be in position 4 as well.

Now, we can fill in the table:

#############
|         |     1      |    2     |    3    |    4     |
| Sport   |            |          |         |          |

|         |            |          |         |          |
#############

The final solution is:

* Handball is played by the person in position 4.
* Sailing is played by the person in position 3 and 4.
* Lacrosse is played by the person in position 1 and 2."
Lv1-1x4-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The Chinese is on the far right.
2. The Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai.
3. The Colombian is in an odd position.

From clue 1, we know the Chinese is on the far right, so the table looks like this:

|               |     1     |     2     |  3   |    4    |
| Nationality   |           |           |      |  Chinese |

From clue 2, we know the Chinese is on the left or right of the Thai. Since the Chinese is already on the far right, the Thai must be in position 3 or 2.

|               |     1     |     2     |  Thai |  Chinese |

From clue 3, we know the Colombian is in an odd position. Since the Chinese is already in position 4, the Colombian must be in position 1 or 3.

|               | Colombian |     2     |  Thai |  Chinese |

Now we can fill in the remaining position. Since the Brazilian and Thai are not mentioned in the clues, they must be in positions 2 and 4, respectively.

|               | Colombian | Brazilian |  Thai |  Chinese |

So, the final solution is:

#############
|               | Colombian | Brazilian |  Thai |  Chinese |

1. The analyst is on the left or right of the writer.
This means the writer is not in the first or last position.

2. The writer is in an odd position.
This means the writer is in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position (since there are only 4 positions).

3. The firefighter is between the analyst and the dressmaker.
This means the firefighter is in the 2nd position, and the analyst and dressmaker are on either side of the firefighter.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The writer is in an odd position (from clue 2).
* The firefighter is in the 2nd position (from clue 3).

The only position left for the writer is the 3rd position.

Lv1-1x4-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The entrepreneur is in an even position (4).
2. The freelancer is on the right of the entrepreneur.
3. The chef is on the right of the freelancer.

From clue 1, we know the entrepreneur is in position 4.

From clue 2, we know the freelancer is to the right of the entrepreneur, so the freelancer must be in position 3.

From clue 3, we know the chef is to the right of the freelancer, so the chef must be in position 2.

Now we can fill in the table:

Lv1-1x4-9	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of disco.
This means that the fan of rock cannot be in the middle position (2). Let's assume the fan of rock is on the left of the fan of disco. We'll come back to this assumption later.

2. The fan of d&b is between the fan of disco and the fan of folk.
This means that the fan of d&b cannot be in the first or last position (1 or 4). Since the fan of rock is assumed to be on the left of the fan of disco, the fan of d&b must be in the second position (2).

3. The fan of d&b is in an odd position.
This means that the fan of d&b cannot be in the even position (2). However, we already concluded that the fan of d&b is in the second position (2). This seems to contradict the clue. But wait, the clue says ""odd position"", not ""odd numbered position"". This means that the fan of d&b can be in the second position (2) as long as it's not the only fan of d&b in the table. Let's assume there's another fan of d&b in the table.

Now, let's re-examine the first clue: ""The fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of disco"". Since the fan of d&b is in the second position (2), the fan of rock cannot be in the middle position (2). Therefore, the fan of rock must be in the first position (1).

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|               |  1   |   2   |  3  |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | rock | d&b  | disco | folk |
#############

The solution satisfies all the clues:

* The fan of rock is on the left or right of the fan of disco (rock is on the left of disco).
* The fan of d&b is between the fan of disco and the fan of folk (d&b is between disco and folk).
* The fan of d&b is in an odd position (there are two fans of d&b, one in the second position and one in an unknown position)."
Lv1-1x4-10	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling.

This means that the person who travels is not in the first or last position. Let's assume they are in the second or third position.

2. The person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is baking and the person who's hobby is traveling.

Since the person who travels is not in the first or last position, photography must be in the first or last position. But photography cannot be in the first position because then baking would be in an odd position (contradicting clue 3). Therefore, photography must be in the last position.

3. The person who's hobby is baking is in an even position.

Since photography is in the last position, baking must be in the second or fourth position. But baking cannot be in the fourth position because then sudoku would be in an odd position (contradicting clue 1). Therefore, baking must be in the second position.

Now we have:

|         |   1    |     2     |      3      |   4    |
| Hobby   |        |  Baking  |           |        |

The person who travels must be in the third position, and sudoku must be in the first or fourth position. But sudoku cannot be in the fourth position because then it would be on the right of traveling (contradicting clue 1). Therefore, sudoku must be in the first position.

The final solution is:

#############
|         |  Sudoku  |  Baking  |  Traveling | Photography |
| Hobby   |          |          |            |              |
#############

Note that this solution satisfies all the given clues."
