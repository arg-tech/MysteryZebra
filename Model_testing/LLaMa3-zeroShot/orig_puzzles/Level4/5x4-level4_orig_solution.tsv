Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, the accountant is on the far left or far right. Since the fisherman is on the train (clue 13), the accountant cannot be on the far left. Therefore, the accountant is on the far right.
2. From clue 6, the person driving the snowmobile is on the far right. Since the analyst is driving the snowmobile (clue 14), the analyst is on the far right.
3. From clue 3, the person driving the train is on the left of the person driving the skateboard. Since the paramedic is driving the train (clue 13), the paramedic is on the left of the skateboard driver.
4. From clue 4, the person watching superhero movies is in an odd position. Since the analyst is driving the snowmobile (clue 14) and the snowmobile is on the far right, the analyst is watching superhero movies.
5. From clue 5, the person watching western movies is the person watching western movies. Since the accountant is on the far right (clue 1) and is watching western movies, the accountant is watching western movies.
6. From clue 7, the person who's sport is parkour is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the rat owner is on the left or right of the analyst (clue 15), the parkour person is on the left or right of the analyst.
7. From clue 8, the person driving the quad-bike is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the paramedic is driving the train (clue 13) and the train is on the left of the skateboard (clue 3), the paramedic is driving the quad-bike.
8. From clue 9, the fisherman is on the left or right of the person watching family movies. Since the fisherman is on the train (clue 13) and the train is on the left of the skateboard (clue 3), the fisherman is on the left of the family movie watcher.
9. From clue 10, the person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the person watching superhero movies. Since the analyst is watching superhero movies (clue 4) and is on the far right (clue 6), the adventure movie watcher is on the left of the analyst.
10. From clue 11, the accountant is on the left of the person watching western movies. Since the accountant is watching western movies (clue 5) and is on the far right (clue 1), the accountant is on the left of the western movie watcher.
11. From clue 12, the owner of the rabbit is between the person watching superhero movies and the owner of the dog. Since the analyst is watching superhero movies (clue 4) and is on the far right (clue 6), the rabbit owner is between the analyst and the dog owner.
12. From clue 15, the owner of the rat is on the left or right of the analyst. Since the rat owner is on the left or right of the parkour person (clue 7), the rat owner is on the left or right of the analyst.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake.
* From clue 2, we know the fan of rock is the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 6), and the person driving the snowmobile is not the fan of rock, the fan of rock must be the person driving the tram (which is the only remaining transport option).
* From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the fan of hip-hop. Since the fan of hip-hop is not the person driving the jet-ski (clue 4), the person who's hobby is drawing must be the librarian.
* From clue 4, we know the fan of trance is between the person driving the jet-ski and the person driving the snowmobile. Since the person driving the jet-ski is not the fan of trance, the fan of trance must be the person driving the quad-bike.
* From clue 5, we know the owner of the cat is on the far left. Since the owner of the horse is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (clue 7), the owner of the horse must be the second person from the left.
* From clue 8, we know the owner of the hedgehog is the person driving the quad-bike. Since the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake (clue 1), the owner of the snake must be the person driving the snowmobile.
* From clue 9, we know the fan of hip-hop is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since the fan of reggae is not the person driving the jet-ski (clue 4), the fan of hip-hop must be the person driving the tram.
* From clue 10, we know the librarian is on the left of the bartender. Since the librarian is already placed, the bartender must be the person driving the snowmobile.
* From clue 11, we know the scientist is in an odd position. Since the scientist is the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 12), and the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 6), the scientist must be the person driving the jet-ski.
* From clue 13, we know the scientist is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the scientist is already placed, the person who's hobby is drawing must be the librarian.
* From clue 14, we know the librarian is on the left or right of the bartender. Since the librarian is already placed, the bartender must be the person driving the snowmobile.
* From clue 15, we know the project-manager is on the far right. Since the project-manager is not the person driving the jet-ski (clue 11), the project-manager must be the person driving the tram.

Lv1-5x4-10	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the correct placements:

#############
|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |    4    |

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table."
