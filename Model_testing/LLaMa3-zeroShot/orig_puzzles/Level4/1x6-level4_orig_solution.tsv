Lv1-1x6-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician.
2. The chef is on the far left or far right.
3. The chef is in an odd position.
4. The accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager.
5. The electrician is on the right of the firefighter.
6. The software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant.

From clue 1, we know the firefighter is between the software-developer and the electrician. This means the order is: software-developer, firefighter, electrician.

From clue 2, we know the chef is on the far left or far right. Since the firefighter is already in the middle, the chef must be on the far left.

From clue 3, we know the chef is in an odd position. Since the chef is on the far left, it must be in position 1.

From clue 4, we know the accountant is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since the chef is already in position 1, the accountant must be in position 2 or 4. But if the accountant were in position 2, the software-developer would not be between the firefighter and the accountant (clue 6). Therefore, the accountant must be in position 4.

From clue 5, we know the electrician is on the right of the firefighter. Since the electrician is already in position 3, it must be in position 3.

From clue 6, we know the software-developer is between the firefighter and the accountant. Since the software-developer is already in position 1, it must be in position 1.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
| Job   |  1   |        2        |     3      |         4          |      5      |      6      |

Lv1-1x6-8	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is board-games and the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is photography is in an even position (statement 2), it must be in position 2 or 4.

From statement 3, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games. This means that the person who's hobby is video-games must be in position 5 or 6.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is between the person who's hobby is skydiving and the person who's hobby is board-games. This means that the person who's hobby is board-games must be in position 1 or 6.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is board-games is not in position 2 or 4 (because the person who's hobby is photography is in one of those positions), it must be in position 1 or 6.

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is camping is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (statement 7), the person who's hobby is camping must be in position 3 or 5.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person who's hobby is photography is in position 2 or 4.
* The person who's hobby is board-games is in position 1 or 6.
* The person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 3 or 5.
* The person who's hobby is video-games is in position 5 or 6.
* The person who's hobby is camping is in position 3 or 5.
* The person who's hobby is fishing is in position 2 or 4.

The only combination that satisfies all the conditions is:

#############
| Hobby   | board-games | photography | camping | fishing | skydiving | video-games |
|---------|-------------|-------------|---------|---------|-----------|-------------|
#############

So, the final solution is:

The person who's hobby is board-games is in position 1.
The person who's hobby is photography is in position 2.
The person who's hobby is camping is in position 3.
The person who's hobby is fishing is in position 4.
The person who's hobby is skydiving is in position 5.
The person who's hobby is video-games is in position 6."

2. The person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola, so the order must be: juice, lemonade, cola.
3. The person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking almond-milk, so tea cannot be in position 1 (since almond-milk is in position 6). This means tea must be in position 3 or 5.
4. The person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person drinking tea, so cola cannot be in position 2 (since lemonade is in position 2). This means cola must be in position 2 or 4.
5. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far right, so they must be in position 6.
6. The person drinking tea is on the right of the person drinking cola, so tea must be in position 5.
