1. The fan of soul is in an odd position##4: This means the fan of soul is in positions 1, 3, or 5.
2. The fan of soul is in the middle: This means the fan of soul is in position 3.
3. The person eating radish is on the left or right of the fan of pop##3: Since the fan of soul is in position 3, the fan of pop must be in position 1 or 5. Radish is on the left or right of pop, so radish is in position 2 or 4.
4. The person eating lettuce is on the right of the person eating pumpkin: Let's assume pumpkin is in position x. Lettuce is in position x+1.
5. The person eating cauliflower is between the fan of soul and the fan of salsa##2: Cauliflower is in position 2, between soul (3) and salsa (5).
6. The person eating radish is in the middle: This is already given in the puzzle, but it's worth noting that radish is in position 2 or 4.
7. The fan of soul is on the right of the fan of trance: Soul is in position 3, and trance is in position 1 or 5.
8. The person eating pumpkin is on the left or right of the person eating radish##3: Pumpkin is in position x, and radish is in position 2 or 4. Since radish is in the middle, pumpkin is in position 1 or 5.

* Radish is in position 2 or 4.
* Cauliflower is in position 2.
* Soul is in position 3.
* Pumpkin is in position 1 or 5.
* Lettuce is in position 4 (since it's on the right of pumpkin).

1. The person drinking almond-milk is in an even position (4).
2. The person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming.
3. The person drinking water is in the middle (3).
4. The person who's sport is tennis is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

6. The person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk.
7. The person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking tea.

From statement 1, we know the person drinking almond-milk is in position 4. From statement 3, we know the person drinking water is in position 3. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the right of the person who's sport is swimming (statement 2), the person who's sport is swimming must be in position 2.

From statement 5, we know the person who's sport is badminton is between the person drinking iced-tea and the person who's sport is swimming. Since the person who's sport is swimming is in position 2, the person who's sport is badminton must be in position 1.

From statement 7, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the person who's sport is badminton is in position 1, the person drinking iced-tea must be in position 2, and the person drinking tea must be in position 5.

Now we can fill in the remaining positions:

* Position 1: Badminton, Iced-Tea
* Position 2: Swimming, Fanta
* Position 3: Water
* Position 4: Almond-Milk, Surfing
