Lv1-1x7-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Japanese is between the German and the Canadian.
This means the order is: German, Japanese, Canadian.

2. The Mexican is on the right of the Brazilian.
This means the Brazilian is in an odd position (as stated in clue 7), so it must be in position 1 or 3. Since the Mexican is on the right, it must be in position 3 or 5. But the Mexican is in the middle (clue 4), so it must be in position 3.

3. The Russian is on the right of the Italian.
This means the Italian is in an even position (since the Russian is on the right), so it must be in position 2 or 4. But the Mexican is in the middle (clue 4), so the Italian must be in position 2.

4. The Mexican is in the middle.
As mentioned earlier, the Mexican is in position 3.

5. The Canadian is in an odd position.
Since the Canadian is between the German and the Japanese (clue 1), it must be in position 5.

6. The German is on the left of the Japanese.
This confirms the order: German, Japanese, Canadian.

7. The Brazilian is in an odd position.
As mentioned earlier, the Brazilian is in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Nationality   |    1    |    2    |     3     |    4    |   5    |    6     |    7     |
|               |  Brazilian  |  Italian  |  Mexican  |         |  Canadian  |  Japanese  |  German  |

The final solution is:

Brazilian, Italian, Mexican,?, Canadian, Japanese, German"
Lv1-1x7-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person who's sport is golf.
2. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left.
3. The person who's sport is climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.
4. The person who's sport is golf is in an even position.
5. The person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton.
6. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton.

From clue 2, we know that snowboarding is on the far left. From clue 1, we know that sailing is on the left of golf. Since golf is in an even position (clue 4), it must be in the 2nd or 4th position. If it were in the 2nd position, sailing would be in the 1st position, but that would mean sailing is not on the left of golf, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, golf must be in the 4th position.

From clue 5, we know that snowboarding is on the left of badminton. Since snowboarding is already on the far left (clue 2), badminton must be in the 2nd or 3rd position. If badminton were in the 2nd position, snowboarding would be in the 1st position, but that would mean sailing is not on the left of golf, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, badminton must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 6, we know that soccer is on the left or right of badminton. Since badminton is in the 3rd position, soccer must be in the 2nd or 4th position. If soccer were in the 2nd position, badminton would be in the 1st position, but that would mean sailing is not on the left of golf, which contradicts clue 1. Therefore, soccer must be in the 4th position.

From clue 3, we know that climbing is on the right of soccer. Since soccer is in the 4th position, climbing must be in the 5th or 6th position. If climbing were in the 5th position, soccer would be in the 4th position, which is already the case. Therefore, climbing must be in the 6th position.

The final solution is:

7. The fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie.

From clue 2, we know the fan of gospel is on the far left. From clue 7, we know the fan of gospel is on the left of the fan of indie. Therefore, the order from left to right is:

Gospel, Indie,?

From clue 4, we know the fan of funk is in the middle. Since the fan of gospel is on the left, the fan of funk must be in the second position from the left.

Gospel, Funk, Indie,?

From clue 1, we know the fan of R&B is on the right of the fan of classical. Since the fan of funk is in the middle, the fan of classical must be in an even position (clue 6). Therefore, the fan of classical is in the third or fifth position.
