Lv1-1x3-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.
This means that the surfing person is to the left of the skateboarding person.

2. The person who's sport is rugby is on the far right.
This means that the rugby person is in the third position.

3. The person who's sport is rugby is in an odd position.
This means that the rugby person is in either the first or third position (since 1 and 3 are odd numbers).

Combining the clues, we can deduce the following:

* The surfing person is to the left of the skateboarding person.
* The rugby person is in the third position (far right).
* The rugby person is in an odd position, so it must be in the first position.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|         |    1    |       2       |   3   |
| Sport   | Rugby  | Surfing      | Skateboarding |
#############

The solution is that the person who prefers rugby is in the first position, the person who prefers surfing is in the second position, and the person who prefers skateboarding is in the third position."
Lv1-1x3-2	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating carrot is in an odd position.
This means the person eating carrot is either in position 1 or 3.
2. The person eating cabbage is on the far left.
This means the person eating cabbage is in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|        |    1    |     2      |   3    |
| Food   |         |            |        |

Since the person eating cabbage is in position 1, we can fill that in:

|        | Cabbage |            |        |

The person eating carrot is in an odd position, so it must be in position 1 or 3. But we already know the person eating cabbage is in position 1, so the person eating carrot must be in position 3.

|        | Cabbage |            | Carrot |

The only food left is watermelon, so we can fill in the remaining position:

|        | Cabbage | Watermelon | Carrot |

#############
|        | Cabbage | Watermelon | Carrot |

Lv1-1x3-3	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is drawing is in an even position.
This means the drawing person is either in position 1 or 2.

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks.
This means the drawing person is adjacent to the magic-tricks person.

3. The person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.
This means the magic-tricks person is in position 3, and the drawing person is in position 1 or 2.

Combining the clues, we can conclude:

* The drawing person is in position 2 (since it's an even position and not position 1).
* The magic-tricks person is in position 3 (since it's on the right of the drawing person).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|         |      1      |    2    |      3       |

1. The fan of jazz is in an odd position.
2. The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz.

From clue 1, we know the fan of jazz is in an odd position, which means they are either in the 1st or 3rd position.

From clue 2, we know the fan of techno is on the left of the fan of jazz. This means the fan of techno is either in the 1st or 2nd position.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the fan of techno is in the 1st position, and the fan of jazz is in the 3rd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating onion is on the left of the person eating papaya.
2. The person eating onion is in an odd position.

From clue 1, we know that the order is either: onion,?, papaya or?, onion, papaya.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating onion is in an odd position, which means they are either in position 1 or position 3.

Combining the two clues, we can conclude that the order is: onion,?, papaya.

Now, let's try to figure out who is eating what:

* The person eating kiwi must be in position 2, since onion is in an odd position and papaya is on the right of onion.
* The person eating papaya is on the right of onion, so they must be in position 3.
* The person eating onion is in an odd position and on the left of papaya, so they must be in position 1.

Here is the final solution:

| Food   |  Onion | Kiwi  | Papaya |

Lv1-1x3-6	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the person drinking mirinda.

This means that hot-chocolate cannot be in position 3, because mirinda would be on the right of hot-chocolate, not on the left.

2. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.

This means that hot-chocolate can only be in positions 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* Hot-chocolate is in an even position (1 or 2).
* Hot-chocolate is on the left of mirinda.
* Mirinda cannot be in position 1, because hot-chocolate would be on the right of mirinda, not on the left.

So, hot-chocolate must be in position 2, and mirinda must be in position 3.

The only remaining position is 1, which must be 7up.

Here is the final solution:

#############
|            |  7up  |  Hot-chocolate  |  Mirinda  |
| Beverage   |     |               |         |

The solution is:

7up - 1
Hot-chocolate - 2
Mirinda - 3"
Lv1-1x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The engineer is on the right of the designer.
2. The engineer is in an even position.

From clue 1, we know the engineer is to the right of the designer. This means the designer cannot be in the first position.

From clue 2, we know the engineer is in an even position. This means the engineer is either in the 2nd or 4th position.

Let's try to combine these clues:

|       |    1     |    2     |    3    |
| Job   |          |          |         |

Since the engineer is in an even position, let's assume they are in the 2nd position.

|       |    1     |  Engineer |    3    |
| Job   |          |          |         |

Now, the designer is to the right of the engineer, so they must be in the 3rd position.

|       |    1     |  Engineer | Designer |
| Job   |          |          |         |

The only position left is the 1st position, which must be the analyst.

#############
|       | Analyst |  Engineer | Designer |
| Job   |          |          |         |
#############

The final solution is:

|       | Analyst |  Engineer | Designer |
| Job   |          |          |         |

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
Lv1-1x3-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The teacher is in an odd position.
This means the teacher is either in the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The paramedic is the paramedic.
This clue doesn't give us any new information, but it's a nice confirmation that we're looking for a paramedic in the table.

3. The teacher is on the right of the paramedic.
This means the teacher is in the 3rd position, since the paramedic is in an even position (2nd position).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|       |    1     |     2     |    3    |
| Job   |          |           |         |

Lv1-1x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person drinking cola.
This means that the cola drinker is to the left of the iced-tea drinker.

2. The person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position.
This means that the iced-tea drinker is either in position 1 or position 3.

From clue 1, we know that the cola drinker is to the left of the iced-tea drinker. Since the iced-tea drinker is in an odd position, it must be in position 1 or 3. If it were in position 1, the cola drinker would be in position 2, which is even. Therefore, the iced-tea drinker must be in position 3, and the cola drinker is in position 2.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|            |   1   |  2   |    3     |
| Beverage   |  Fanta | Cola | Iced-Tea |
#############

The final solution is that the person drinking Fanta is in position 1, the person drinking Cola is in position 2, and the person drinking Iced-Tea is in position 3."
Lv1-1x3-10	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person eating pepper is on the left of the person eating papaya.
This means that the person eating papaya is in an odd position (since pepper is on the left).

2. The person eating papaya is in an even position.

These two clues seem to contradict each other, but let's analyze them further:

* If the person eating papaya is in an even position, it means they are in position 2 or 4.
* However, since the person eating pepper is on the left of the person eating papaya, and papaya is in an even position, pepper must be in position 1.
* This means papaya is in position 2 or 4, but since pepper is on the left, papaya must be in position 4.

So, the final solution is:

#############
|        |   1    |   2    |  3   |
| Food   |  Pepper | Papaya | Plum |
#############

In this solution, the person eating pepper is in position 1, the person eating papaya is in position 4, and the person eating plum is in position 3."
