#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an even position (clue 12), it must be in position 2 or 4. We'll come back to this later.
* From clue 2, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the chinchilla is in an even position (clue 3), it must be in position 2 or 4. We'll come back to this later.
* From clue 4, we know the person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an even position, it must be in position 2.
* From clue 5, we know the owner of the pony is the Polish. Since the Polish is in an even position (clue 13), it must be in position 4.

* From clue 7, we know the person driving the roller is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. Since the person driving the roller is on the left of the malaysian (clue 17), it must be in position 1.
* From clue 8, we know the person driving the skateboard is between the person driving the car and the person who's hobby is chess. Since the person driving the skateboard is the American (clue 9), it must be in position 3.
* From clue 10, we know the person driving the car is on the left of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person driving the car is in an odd position (clue 14), it must be in position 1.
* From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is the Brazilian (clue 16), it must be in position 1 or 6.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is in an even position. Since we already know it's in position 2, this clue is redundant.
* From clue 13, we know the owner of the goat is in an even position. Since the owner of the goat is not yet assigned, it must be in position 2 or 4.
* From clue 14, we know the person driving the snowmobile is in an odd position. Since the person driving the snowmobile is not yet assigned, it must be in position 1 or 3.
* From clue 15, we know the Thai is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the Thai is not yet assigned, it must be in position 2 or 4.
* From clue 16, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is the Brazilian. Since the person who's hobby is collecting is already assigned to position 1, this clue is redundant.
* From clue 17, we know the person driving the roller is on the left of the malaysian. Since the person driving the roller is already assigned to position 1, this clue is redundant.
* From clue 18, we know the malaysian is in an odd position. Since the malaysian is not yet assigned, it must be in position 1 or 3.
* From clue 19, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left or right of the brazilian. Since the owner of the chinchilla is already assigned to position 2, this clue is redundant.
* From clue 20, we know the owner of the frog is in an odd position. Since the owner of the frog is not yet assigned, it must be in position 1 or 3.
* From clue 21, we know the owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the owner of the cat is already assigned to position 5, this clue is redundant.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table. The final solution is:
