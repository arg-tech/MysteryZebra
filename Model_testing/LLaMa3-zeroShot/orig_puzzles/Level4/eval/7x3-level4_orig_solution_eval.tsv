| Pet           | Bird     | Ferret    | Snake           |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the fan of ambient is the person eating nectarine. This helps us place the music-genre and food.
2. From clue 2, we know the manager is on the left or right of the Russian. This helps us place the job and nationality.
3. From clue 3, we know the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the owner of the snake. Since the owner of the snake is the person drinking hot-chocolate (clue 13), this helps us place the movie-genre and beverage.
4. From clue 4, we know the dancer is the Russian. This helps us place the job and nationality.
5. From clue 5, we know the owner of the bird is between the person eating plum and the person drinking soy-milk. This helps us place the pet and beverage.
6. From clue 6, we know the person drinking hot-chocolate is in an odd position. Since the owner of the snake is the person drinking hot-chocolate, this means the snake is in position 3.
7. From clue 7, we know the person eating plum is on the left or right of the Mexican. This helps us place the food and nationality.
8. From clue 8, we know the person watching thriller movies is on the far right. This helps us place the movie-genre.
9. From clue 9, we know the person eating nectarine is between the Japanese and the fan of country. This helps us place the food, nationality, and music-genre.
10. From clue 10, we know the person watching superhero movies is the manager. This helps us place the job and movie-genre.
11. From clue 11, we know the owner of the bird is between the person watching thriller movies and the Russian. This helps us place the pet, movie-genre, and nationality.
12. From clue 12, we know the owner of the bird is on the right of the owner of the ferret. This helps us place the pet.
13. From clue 13, we know the owner of the snake is the person drinking hot-chocolate. This helps us place the pet and beverage.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table with the correct information."	{'beverage': ['fanta', 'soy-milk', 'hot-chocolate'], 'food': ['eggplant', 'nectarine', 'plum'], 'job': ['dancer', 'manager', 'software-developer'], 'movie-genre': ['romance', 'superhero', 'thriller'], 'music-genre': ['ambient', 'country', 'funk'], 'nationality': ['japanese', 'mexican', 'russian'], 'pet': ['bird', 'ferret', 'snake']}	True	13	False
Lv1-7x3-2	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the table step by step.

From clue 10, we know the Chinese is the accountant. From clue 14, we know the Chinese is in an odd position. Since there are only 3 positions, the Chinese must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is baseball is the person eating apple. From clue 1, we know the designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the designer is not the person eating apple (because the designer is not eating onion, see clue 6), the person eating apple must be in position 2.

From clue 15, we know the owner of the frog is the owner of the frog. This is redundant, but it confirms that the frog is in position 2.

From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is chess is the Spanish. Since the Spanish is not the accountant (because the accountant is Chinese), the Spanish must be in position 3.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 1, we know the scientist's sport is skateboarding.
* From clue 2, we know the person watching animation movies is on the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the scientist is the person watching animation movies, the scientist must be on the right of the quad-bike driver.
* From clue 3, we know the German is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the journalist is the person who's sport is rugby (from clue 5), the German must be on the right of the journalist.
* From clue 4, we know the dressmaker is the person watching disaster movies. Since the dressmaker is not the scientist (from clue 1), the dressmaker must be on the left of the scientist.
* From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is rugby is the journalist. Since the journalist is not the scientist (from clue 1), the journalist must be on the right of the scientist.
* From clue 6, we know the person drinking Mirinda is on the far right. Since the scientist is on the right of the quad-bike driver (from clue 2), the scientist cannot be the person drinking Mirinda. Therefore, the person drinking Mirinda must be on the far right, which is the dressmaker.
* From clue 7, we know the German is on the left or right of the person eating nectarine. Since the German is on the right of the journalist (from clue 3), the German must be on the right of the person eating nectarine.
* From clue 8, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's sport is water-polo is not the scientist (from clue 1), the person who's sport is water-polo must be on the far left or far right.
* From clue 9, we know the French is between the person eating pineapple and the dressmaker. Since the dressmaker is on the far right (from clue 6), the French must be between the person eating pineapple and the dressmaker.
* From clue 10, we know the German is on the far left or far right. Since the German is already placed (from clue 7), this clue does not provide new information.
* From clue 11, we know the person driving the scooter is the person driving the scooter. This is a tautology and does not provide new information.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is in an odd position. Since the scientist is the person who's sport is skateboarding, the scientist must be in an odd position.
* From clue 13, we know the person drinking milk is the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is already placed (from clue 11), this clue does not provide new information.
* From clue 14, we know the person watching animation movies is on the far left or far right. Since the scientist is already placed (from clue 2), this clue does not provide new information.
* From clue 15, we know the person eating nectarine is on the left or right of the person eating cauliflower. Since the person eating nectarine is already placed (from clue 7), this clue does not provide new information.
