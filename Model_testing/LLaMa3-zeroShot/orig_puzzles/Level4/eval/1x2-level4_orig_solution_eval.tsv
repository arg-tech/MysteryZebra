Lv1-1x2-1	"Let's solve the puzzle!

From the given information, we know:

1. The Indian is in an even position.

This means the Indian can be in either position 2 or position 4.

Let's fill in the table with possible solutions:

#############
|               |   1    |   2    |
| Nationality   |        |        |
#############

Since the Indian is in an even position, we can start by placing the Indian in position 2:

#############
|               |   1    |   Indian | Polish |
| Nationality   |        |          |        |
#############

Now, we need to place the Polish nationality. Since it's not in position 2, it must be in position 1 or position 4. But position 4 is already occupied by the Indian, so the Polish nationality must be in position 1:

#############
|               | Polish |   Indian |        |
| Nationality   |        |          |        |
#############

This is the final solution! The Indian is in position 2, and the Polish nationality is in position 1."	{'nationality': ['', '', '']}	True	0	False

From the puzzle, we know:

1. The person who's sport is swimming is in an even position.
2. There are 2 different types of sport: cycling and swimming.

Since there are only 2 people, we can conclude that the person who prefers swimming is in either position 2 or position 4.

Let's assume the person who prefers swimming is in position 2. Then, the person in position 1 must prefer cycling.

|         |    1    |    2     |
| Sport   |  Cycling | Swimming |

However, this doesn't satisfy the condition that the person who prefers swimming is in an even position. So, let's try again.

Let's assume the person who prefers swimming is in position 4. Then, the person in position 3 must prefer cycling.

From the puzzle, we know:

1. The person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position.
2. There are 2 different types of sport: sailing and snowboarding.

Since the person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position, it means they are either in position 2 or position 4.

Let's assume the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 2. Then, the person in position 1 must be sailing.

But this doesn't satisfy the condition that the person who's sport is snowboarding is in an even position. So, let's try again.

This time, let's assume the person who's sport is snowboarding is in position 4. Then, the person in position 3 must be sailing.

1. The person watching fantasy movies is in an odd position.

This means that the person who prefers fantasy movies is either in the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The people prefer 2 different movie-genres: fantasy, superhero.

This means that each person prefers one fantasy movie and one superhero movie.

From the clue, we know that the person who prefers fantasy movies is in an odd position. Let's assume they are in the 1st position. Then, the person in the 2nd position must prefer superhero movies.

From the puzzle, we know:

1. The person who's sport is volleyball is in an even position.
2. There are 2 different types of sport: snowboarding and volleyball.

Since there are only 2 people, we can conclude that:

From the given information, we know that the Mexican is in an even position. This means the Mexican can be in either the 2nd or 4th position.

Let's assume the Mexican is in the 2nd position. Then, the Chinese would be in the 1st position.

|               |    1    |    2    |
| Nationality   | Chinese | Mexican |

But this doesn't fit the given information, as the Mexican is already in an even position. So, the Mexican must be in the 4th position.

|               |    1    |    2    |    3    |    4    |
| Nationality   | Chinese |?      |?      | Mexican |

Now, we need to figure out who is in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd positions. Since there are only two nationalities, Chinese and Mexican, and we already know the Mexican is in the 4th position, the Chinese must be in one of the other three positions.

Let's try to fill in the remaining positions. If the Chinese is in the 1st position, the unknown nationality would be in the 2nd or 3rd position. But then, the Mexican would be in an odd position, which contradicts the given information.

So, the Chinese must be in the 3rd position. This means the unknown nationality is in the 2nd position.

| Nationality   |?      |?      | Chinese | Mexican |

Now, we can fill in the remaining positions. Since the unknown nationality is not Chinese, it must be Mexican. This means the 1st position is occupied by the unknown nationality (Mexican).

From the statement ""the person eating artichoke is in an even position"", we can deduce that the person eating artichoke is either in position 2 or 4.

Since there are only 2 types of food, and we know the person eating artichoke is in an even position, we can conclude that the person eating tomato is in an odd position (1 or 3).

From statement 2, we know that the person driving the bike is in positions 2 or 4. Since there are only 2 people, the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 1 or 3.

Since the person driving the bike is in an even position, let's assume they are in position 2. This means the person in position 1 is driving the quad-bike.
