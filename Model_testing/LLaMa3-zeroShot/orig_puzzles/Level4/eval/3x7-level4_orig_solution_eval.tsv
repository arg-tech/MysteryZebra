Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clues 1 and 4, we know the Pakistani is on the left or right of the Colombian, and the Turkish is on the left or right of the Pakistani. Since the Colombian is on the far right (clue 17), the Pakistani must be on the left of the Colombian.
* From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. Since the Turkish is the person who's hobby is fishing (clue 7), the person who's hobby is writing must be on the left of the Turkish.
* From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left or right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey (clue 19), the person who's sport is soccer must be on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
* From clue 5, we know the Indian is on the right of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian is on the right of the Italian (clue 13), the Indian must be on the right of the Italian.
* From clue 6, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is also the person who's sport is soccer (clue 11), the person who's hobby is traveling must be on the far left.
* From clue 8, we know the Malaysian is the person who's sport is sailing. Since the Malaysian is on the right of the Italian, the Italian must be on the left of the Malaysian.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse (clue 12), the person who's hobby is reading must be on the left of the Italian.
* From clue 10, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is the same as the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is not mentioned elsewhere, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is cooking is the same as the person who's sport is skateboarding.
* From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is traveling is the same as the person who's sport is soccer. Since the person who's hobby is traveling is on the far left, the person who's sport is soccer must be on the far left.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is in the middle. Since the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the Italian, the person who's sport is lacrosse must be on the right of the Italian.
* From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position. Since the person who's hobby is writing is on the left of the Turkish, the person who's hobby is chess must be on the right of the Turkish.
* From clue 15, we know the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position. This is consistent with the previous conclusion.
* From clue 16, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since the person who's hobby is cooking is the same as the person who's sport is skateboarding, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on the right of themselves, which is not possible. Therefore, this clue is inconsistent with the previous conclusions.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person eating peas is the person drinking tea. From statement 3, we know the Canadian is the person eating peas, so the Canadian is drinking tea.
2. From statement 2, we know the Argentine is in an odd position (4th or 6th). Since the Canadian is drinking tea (1st or 7th), the Argentine must be in the 4th position.
3. From statement 9, we know the Argentine is the person eating onion. From statement 17, we know the person eating garlic is on the left or right of the person eating onion. Since the Argentine is in the 4th position, the person eating garlic must be in the 3rd position.
4. From statement 10, we know the Australian is the person eating artichoke. From statement 12, we know the person drinking milk is on the left of the Australian. Since the Argentine is in the 4th position, the person drinking milk must be in the 2nd position.
5. From statement 11, we know the Malaysian is the person drinking coffee. From statement 16, we know the Australian is on the left of the Malaysian. Since the Australian is in the 5th position, the Malaysian must be in the 6th position.
6. From statement 18, we know the person drinking 7up is the person eating cucumber. Since the Argentine is in the 4th position, the person eating cucumber must be in the 1st position.
7. From statement 7, we know the person drinking juice is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the Malaysian is in the 6th position, the person drinking juice must be in the 7th position.
8. From statement 8, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the Canadian is drinking tea, the person drinking mirinda must be in the 5th position.
9. From statement 14, we know the person eating cucumber is on the left or right of the Argentine. Since the Argentine is in the 4th position, the person eating cucumber must be in the 1st position.
10. From statement 15, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left of the person eating artichoke. Since the Australian is in the 5th position, the person eating cranberry must be in the 3rd position.
11. From statement 13, we know the Indonesian is on the right of the Russian. Since the Russian is in the 1st position, the Indonesian must be in the 7th position.
12. From statement 4, we know the person drinking milk is in an odd position (1st, 3rd, or 5th). Since the person drinking milk is in the 2nd position, the Argentine is not drinking milk.
