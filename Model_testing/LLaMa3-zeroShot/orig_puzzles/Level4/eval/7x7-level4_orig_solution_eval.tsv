#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clues 1, 5, and 37, we can determine that the owner of the goldfish is on the left or right of the owner of the goat, and the owner of the pony is on the left or right of the owner of the rat. Since the owner of the goat is on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (clue 27), the owner of the goldfish must be on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing.
* From clues 2, 4, and 21, we can determine that the person watching zombie movies is between the person who's hobby is fishing and the person drinking iced-tea, the person who's hobby is writing is the person driving the van, and the person driving the airplane is on the far left or far right. Since the person who's hobby is writing is the person driving the van, and the person driving the airplane is on the far left or far right, the person who's hobby is writing must be on the far left.
* From clues 3, 6, 8, 13, 18, 25, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, and 43, we can determine the remaining positions and preferences.

Note that there may be multiple possible solutions, but this is one possible solution that satisfies all the given clues."	{'beverage': ['water', 'fanta', 'iced-tea', 'hot-chocolate', 'juice', 'sprite', '7up'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'video-games', 'sudoku', 'baking', 'fishing', 'chess', 'skydiving'], 'job': ['photographer', 'entrepreneur', 'engineer', 'dressmaker', 'nurse', 'electrician', 'musician'], 'movie-genre': ['thriller', 'romance', 'mystery', 'crime', 'time-travel', 'zombie', 'disaster'], 'music-genre': ['rock', 'reggae', 'indie', 'pop', 'hip-hop', 'electronic', 'country'], 'pet': ['hamster', 'chinchilla', 'goldfish', 'goat', 'pony', 'rabbit', 'rat'], 'transport': ['skateboard', 'van', 'bike', 'car', 'ship', 'quad-bike', 'airplane']}	True	9	False
