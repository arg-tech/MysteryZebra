Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the taxi is on the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing.
This means that the taxi driver is either next to the surfer or across from them.

2. The person drinking fanta is in an even position.
This means that the person drinking fanta is either in the 1st or 2nd position.

3. The person watching spy movies is the person drinking coffee.
This means that the person drinking coffee is also watching spy movies.

4. The person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski.
This means that the taxi driver is to the right of the jet-ski driver.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

From statement 2, we know the person drinking fanta is in an even position. Let's assume it's in the 2nd position.

|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      |         | Fanta |

| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

From statement 3, we know the person drinking coffee is watching spy movies. Since the person drinking fanta is in the 2nd position, the person drinking coffee must be in the 1st position.

|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy    |         |
| Sport         |         |         |
| Transport     |         |         |

From statement 1, we know the taxi driver is either next to the surfer or across from them. Since the taxi driver is on the right of the jet-ski driver (statement 4), the jet-ski driver must be in the 1st or 2nd position. Let's assume the jet-ski driver is in the 1st position.

|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta |

| Sport         | Surf   |         |
| Transport     | Jet-Ski | Taxi   |

The only sport left is cycling, so the person who's sport is cycling must be in the 3rd position.

|               |    1    |    2    |
| Beverage      | Coffee | Fanta |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy    |         |

Lv1-4x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table:

1. The owner of the rat is in an odd position##4
This means the owner of the rat is in either the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The person watching action movies is the person driving the tram
This means the person watching action movies is in the 2nd position (since the tram driver is in the 2nd position).

3. The person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies
This means the person eating cabbage is in the 3rd position (since the person watching documentary movies is in the 1st position).

Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 1, we know the owner of the rat is in an odd position, so it must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 2, we know the person watching action movies is the tram driver, so it must be in the 2nd position.

From clue 3, we know the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person watching documentary movies, so the person eating cabbage must be in the 3rd position.

Now, let's fill in the remaining cells:

Lv1-4x2-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the helicopter is on the left or right of the entrepreneur.
This means that the entrepreneur is not driving the helicopter. Let's assume the helicopter driver is on the left of the entrepreneur. We'll come back to this later.

2. The owner of the lizard is on the right of the entrepreneur.
This means that the entrepreneur is not the owner of the lizard. Let's assume the lizard owner is on the right of the entrepreneur.

3. The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position.
This means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is either in the first or third position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The entrepreneur is not driving the helicopter, so they must be in an odd position (1 or 3).
* The lizard owner is on the right of the entrepreneur, so they must be in an even position (2).
* The person drinking hot-chocolate is in an even position, so they must be in position 2.

Here's the solution table with the final arrangement:

* The owner of the lizard (in position 2) is on the right of the entrepreneur, which is true.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate (in position 2) is in an even position, which is true.

This means that the person eating zucchini is on the left side, and the person drinking almond-milk is on the right side.

3. The fan of pop is in an even position.

This means that the fan of pop is either in the first or third position.

Now, let's combine the information:

| Music-Genre   |            |             |

From clue 1, we know that cooking is on the right side, so it must be in position 2. Card-games must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know that zucchini is on the left side, so it must be in position 1. Almond-milk is on the right side, so it must be in position 2.

From clue 3, we know that pop is in an even position. Since cooking is in position 2, pop must be in position 1.

2. The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching action movies.
This means the person watching action movies is either in position 2 or 3, and the person drinking lemonade is in position 1.

3. The architect is in an even position.
This means the architect is in position 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating banana is in position 1 or 2.
* The architect is in position 2.
* The person drinking lemonade is in position 1.

We can conclude that:

* The person eating banana is in position 1.
* The architect is in position 2.
* The person drinking lemonade is in position 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      |  Lemonade |  7up     |
| Food          |  Banana  |  Papaya  |
| Job           |  Writer  |  Architect |
| Movie-Genre   |  Spy     |  Action  |
#############

Here's the final solution:

* The person drinking lemonade is in position 1 and prefers 7up.
* The person eating banana is in position 1 and prefers papaya.
* The architect is in position 2 and prefers action movies.
* The writer is in position 2 and prefers spy movies."	{'beverage': ['lemonade', '7up'], 'food': ['banana', 'papaya'], 'job': ['writer', 'architect'], 'movie-genre': ['spy', 'action']}	True	8	True
