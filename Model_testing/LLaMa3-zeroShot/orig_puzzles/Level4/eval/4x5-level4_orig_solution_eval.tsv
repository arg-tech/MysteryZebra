Lv1-4x5-9	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the correct placements:

#############
|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |     4      |     5      |

| Transport     |  Subway  |  Roller   |  Jet-ski  |  Ship     |  Helicopter |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the person driving the ship is on the far right.
* From clue 1, we know the Dutch is between the person driving the ship and the Russian. Since the ship driver is on the far right, the Dutch must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 3, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the Dutch. This means the Dutch is in position 3, and the subway driver is in position 1.
* From clue 4, we know the person who's sport is surfing is between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's sport is parkour. Since the Dutch is in position 3, the person eating pomegranate must be in position 5, and the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 4.
* From clue 6, we know the person driving the helicopter is the person who's sport is surfing. This means the person who's sport is surfing is in position 4, and the person driving the helicopter is also in position 4.
* From clue 8, we know the Indonesian is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller driver is not yet placed, we'll come back to this clue later.
* From clue 11, we know the person eating corn is the person who's sport is basketball. This means the person who's sport is basketball is in position 4, and the person eating corn is also in position 4.
* From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the water-polo player is not yet placed, we'll come back to this clue later.
* From clue 13, we know the person eating cabbage is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the parkour player is in position 3, the person eating cabbage must be in position 5.
* From clue 14, we know the person who's sport is basketball is on the far left or far right. Since the basketball player is in position 4, it must be on the far right.
* From clue 15, we know the person eating corn is on the left or right of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating corn is in position 4, the person eating carrot must be in position 3.

With these placements, we can fill in the remaining positions:

* The Russian is in position 5, since the Dutch is in position 3.
* The Egyptian is in position 2, since the Dutch is in position 3.
* The Polish is in position 1, since the Dutch is in position 3.
* The person driving the roller is in position 2, since the Indonesian is on the right of the roller driver.
* The person who's sport is water-polo is in position 2, since the water-polo player is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket, and the cricket player is in position 3.
* The person eating pomegranate is in position 5, since the person eating pomegranate is between the person who's sport is surfing and the person who's sport is parkour.
