From clue 1, we know the fan of gospel is in an even position, which means they are either in position 2 or 4.

From clue 2, we know the person watching epic movies is on the right of the dressmaker. This means the dressmaker cannot be in position 3, so they must be in position 1. The person watching epic movies must be in position 2 or 4.
