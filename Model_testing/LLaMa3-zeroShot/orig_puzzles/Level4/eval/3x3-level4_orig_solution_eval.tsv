4. The owner of the bird is in an odd position.
5. The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left.
6. The person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies.

From statement 5, we know the person watching time-travel movies is on the far left. Let's call this person A.

From statement 1, we know the American is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies (statement 3), the American cannot be the owner of the bird. Therefore, the American must be on the left of the owner of the bird.

From statement 2, we know the Australian is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is not on the far left (statement 5), the Australian must be in the middle or on the right.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the bird is in an odd position. Since the American is on the left of the owner of the bird, the owner of the bird must be in the middle.

Now, let's summarize the positions:

* A (time-travel) is on the far left
* American is on the left of the owner of the bird
* Owner of the bird is in the middle
* Australian is on the left of the owner of the mouse

From statement 6, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the owner of the bird is in the middle, the person watching romance movies must be on the right of the owner of the bird. Therefore, the person watching satire movies must be on the left of the owner of the bird.

* Corn,?, Pineapple
*?, Corn, Pineapple

From statement 2, we know that the person who's sport is lacrosse is between the pilot and the person eating potato. This means that the pilot cannot be next to the person eating potato, and the person eating potato cannot be next to the person who's sport is lacrosse. This also means that the person who's sport is lacrosse is either on the left or right of the pilot.

From statement 3, we know that the photographer is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. This means that the photographer cannot be next to the pilot, and the person who's sport is lacrosse cannot be next to the person eating potato.
