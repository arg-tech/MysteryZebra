From statement 1, we know the person driving the airplane is the person who's hobby is writing. Let's assume this person is in position 1.

From statement 3, we know the person who's hobby is writing is in an odd position (1 or 3). Since we've already placed the person in position 1, the person who's hobby is writing must be in position 1.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the bus is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person driving the airplane is in position 1, the person driving the bus must be in position 2.

From statement 5, we know the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person driving the bus is in position 2, the person watching martial-arts movies must be in position 3.

From statement 6, we know the person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person driving the ship must be in position 4.

From statement 8, we know the person driving the ship is between the person watching satire movies and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person driving the ship is in position 4, the person watching satire movies must be in position 2, and the person who's hobby is hiking must be in position 3.

Lv1-3x4-2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the boat is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is sudoku##3

This means the boat driver is either 1st or 3rd. Let's assume they're 1st for now.

2. The person who's hobby is video-games is the mexican

This means the Mexican is either 1st, 2nd, or 4th. Since the boat driver is 1st, the Mexican can't be 1st. So, the Mexican is either 2nd or 4th.

3. The person who's hobby is sudoku is in an even position##4

This means the Sudoku person is either 2nd or 4th. Since the Mexican is either 2nd or 4th, the Sudoku person must be 2nd.

4. The person driving the airplane is on the far right

This means the Airplane driver is 4th.

5. The person driving the taxi is on the far left

This means the Taxi driver is 1st.

6. The person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the japanese

This means the Singer is either 1st or 2nd. Since the Taxi driver is 1st, the Singer must be 2nd.

7. The american is between the person who's hobby is video-games and the person who's hobby is singing##2

This means the American is 2nd. Since the Mexican is 2nd, the American must be between the Mexican and the Singer.

8. The polish is between the japanese and the person who's hobby is sudoku##2

This means the Polish is 2nd. Since the Sudoku person is 2nd, the Polish must be between the Japanese and the Sudoku person.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-3x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The German is between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating tomato.

This means the German is not eating grapefruit or tomato, and the person eating grapefruit is on the left of the German, while the person eating tomato is on the right.

2. The Argentine is the person driving the train.

This doesn't give us any new information about the food or nationality, but it's a useful fact to keep in mind.

3. The person driving the motorbike is the person eating lemon.

This means the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating tomato (since the motorbike driver is on the right of the person eating tomato, according to clue 4).

4. The person driving the motorbike is on the right of the person eating tomato.

This confirms what we already knew: the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating tomato.

5. The person eating tomato is in an odd position.

This means the person eating tomato is either first or third in the table.

6. The Canadian is between the person eating kiwi and the American.

This means the Canadian is not eating grapefruit, lemon, or tomato, and the American is not eating kiwi.

7. The German is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile.

This means the person driving the snowmobile is not the German, and the German is on the left of someone who is not driving the motorbike (since the motorbike driver is eating lemon, and the German is not eating grapefruit or tomato).

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |   2    |     3      |     4     |
| Food          |            |        |            |           |
| Nationality   |            |        |            |           |
| Transport     |            |        |            |           |

From clue 1, we know the German is between the person eating grapefruit and the person eating tomato. Let's assume the German is on the left of the person eating tomato. Then, the person eating grapefruit must be on the left of the German.

From clue 6, we know the Canadian is between the person eating kiwi and the American. Since the Canadian is not eating grapefruit, lemon, or tomato, the person eating kiwi must be the Canadian. The American must be eating the remaining fruit, which is the lemon (since the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating tomato).

From clue 3, we know the person driving the motorbike is eating lemon. Since the person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating tomato, the person eating tomato must be in the odd position (first or third). Let's assume the person eating tomato is in the first position. Then, the person eating grapefruit must be in the second position, and the person eating kiwi must be in the fourth position.

From clue 7, we know the German is on the left of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the German is not eating grapefruit or tomato, the person driving the snowmobile must be eating one of those fruits. Let's assume the person driving the snowmobile is eating grapefruit. Then, the German must be on the left of the person eating grapefruit, which is consistent with clue 1.

From clue 2, we know the Argentine is driving the train. Since the Argentine is not eating grapefruit, lemon, or tomato, the Argentine must be eating kiwi.

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Food          | American | Canadian | German    | Argentine |
| Nationality   |           |          |           |           |
| Transport     | Motorbike | Roller   | Snowmobile| Train     |
|               |  Lemon    |  Kiwi    |  Grapefruit|           |

Lv1-3x4-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 5, we know the fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton. Since the fan of soul is in an even position (statement 1), the fan of soul must be in position 2 or 4.

From statement 2, we know the person watching disaster movies is the person who's sport is rowing. Since the fan of soul is in an even position, the person watching disaster movies must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

From statement 3, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since the fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in position 4.

From statement 7, we know the fan of salsa is the person watching crime movies. Since the fan of salsa is not mentioned in any other statement, we can conclude that the fan of salsa is in position 1.

From statement 6, we know the person watching horror movies is the fan of pop. Since the fan of pop is not mentioned in any other statement, we can conclude that the person watching horror movies is in position 3.

Now we have the following information:

* Position 1: fan of salsa (watching crime movies)
* Position 2: fan of soul (badminton)
* Position 3: person watching horror movies (fan of pop)
* Position 4: person who's sport is water-polo

From statement 4, we know the fan of punk is on the left or right of the person watching horror movies. Since the person watching horror movies is in position 3, the fan of punk must be in position 2 or 4.

From statement 5, we know the fan of soul is the person who's sport is badminton. Since the fan of soul is already in position 2, the fan of punk cannot be in position 2. Therefore, the fan of punk must be in position 4.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:
