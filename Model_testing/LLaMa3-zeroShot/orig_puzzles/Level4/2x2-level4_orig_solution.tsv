Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The mechanic is in an even position.
2. The teacher is the person who's hobby is collecting.

From clue 1, we know the mechanic is in either the 1st or 2nd position. Since the teacher's hobby is collecting, the teacher cannot be the mechanic. Therefore, the mechanic must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   |            |            |
| Job     |            |            |

Since the mechanic is in the 2nd position, the teacher must be in the 1st position. The teacher's hobby is collecting, so the teacher's hobby is collecting.

|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Collecting |            |
| Job     | Teacher   | Mechanic  |

The only remaining hobby is card-games, which must be the hobby of the person in the 1st position (the teacher).

|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Card-games | Collecting |
| Job     | Teacher   | Mechanic  |

Final Solution:
|         |     1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Card-games | Collecting |
| Job     | Teacher   | Mechanic  |"

1. The person who's sport is sailing is in an odd position.
This means that the person who likes sailing must be in either the 1st or 3rd position.

2. The person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person drinking coffee.
This means that the person who drinks soy-milk must be in the 1st position, and the person who drinks coffee must be in the 2nd or 3rd position.

From clue 1, we know the sailing person is in an odd position, so they must be in the 1st position. This means the person who drinks soy-milk is in the 1st position, and the person who drinks coffee is in the 2nd position.

Now, let's look at the sport preferences. We know the sailing person is in the 1st position, so the person who likes weightlifting must be in the 2nd position.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|            |    1     |       2       |
| Beverage   |  Soy-milk |    Coffee    |

1. The Canadian is in an odd position, which means they are in either the 1st or 3rd position.
2. The fan of House is on the left of the fan of Ambient, which means the order of music genres is either House-Ambient or Ambient-House.

From clue 1, we know the Canadian is in an odd position, so they can't be in the 2nd position. This means they must be in the 1st or 3rd position.

From clue 2, we know the fan of House is on the left of the fan of Ambient. This means the music genres must be in the order House-Ambient.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-2x2-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking 7up.
This means that the lemonade drinker is either in position 2 or position 1, and the 7up drinker is in position 1 or position 2, respectively.

2. The person eating mango is in an even position (4).
This means that the mango eater is in either position 1 or position 2.

1. The Dutch is in an even position.
2. The social-worker is on the right of the fisherman.

From clue 1, we know the Dutch is in an even position, which means they can be in either the 1st or 2nd row.

From clue 2, we know the social-worker is on the right of the fisherman. This means the social-worker must be in the 2nd row, since the fisherman can't be in the 2nd row (otherwise, the social-worker would be on the left of the fisherman).

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1     |       2       |

Lv1-2x2-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The people prefer 2 different types of sport: climbing, rugby
This means we have two people, each preferring one of the two sports.

2. The people use 2 different means of transport: motorbike, ship
This means we also have two people, each using one of the two means of transport.

3. The person driving the motorbike is in an even position##4
This means the person driving the motorbike is in either the 2nd or 4th position.

4. The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing
This means the person driving the ship is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person who prefers climbing is to their right.

Now, let's combine the clues:

* The person driving the motorbike is in an even position##4, so they are in the 2nd or 4th position.
* The person driving the ship is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing, so they are in the 1st or 2nd position.
* The person who prefers climbing is to the right of the person driving the ship.

The only possible arrangement that satisfies these conditions is:

#############
|             |   1   |     2     |
| Sport       | Rugby | Climbing |
| Transport   | Ship  | Motorbike |
#############

In this solution, the person driving the ship is in the 1st position, and the person who prefers climbing is in the 2nd position. The person driving the motorbike is in the 2nd position, as required."
Lv1-2x2-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The journalist is in an even position, which means they are either in position 1 or 2.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the journalist.

From clue 2, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left of the journalist. Since the journalist is in an even position, the gardening person must be in an odd position (1 or 3).

Let's fill in the table with possible combinations:

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   |             |            |
| Job     |             |            |

Since the journalist is in an even position, let's assume they are in position 2. Then, the gardening person must be in position 1.

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening |            |
| Job     | Firefighter | Journalist |

Now, we need to determine the job of the person in position 1. Since the journalist is in position 2, the person in position 1 cannot be a journalist. Therefore, the person in position 1 must be a firefighter.

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening |            |
| Job     | Firefighter | Journalist |

Finally, we need to determine the hobby of the person in position 2. Since the journalist is in position 2, they must have sudoku as their hobby.

|         |      1      |     2      |
| Hobby   | Gardening | Sudoku    |
| Job     | Firefighter | Journalist |

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|         |      1      |     2      |

Lv1-2x2-8	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the frog is in an odd position.
This means the frog owner is either in the first or third position.

2. The Australian is on the left of the Pakistani.
This means the Australian is either in the first or second position, and the Pakistani is in the second or third position.

From clue 1, we know the frog owner is in an odd position. Since there are only two positions that are odd (1 and 3), the frog owner must be in either position 1 or position 3.

From clue 2, we know the Australian is on the left of the Pakistani. This means the Australian cannot be in position 3, because then the Pakistani would be on the right of the Australian, not on the left.

Therefore, the Australian must be in position 1, and the Pakistani must be in position 2.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Australian | Pakistani |
| Pet           | Frog      | Dog      |

The Australian is in position 1, and the Pakistani is in position 2. The frog owner is in an odd position, which is position 1. The dog owner must be in position 2, which is the Pakistani."

1. The Canadian is in an even position.
2. The Electrician is on the right of the Doctor.

From clue 1, we know the Canadian is in positions 2 or 4. Since the table only has 2 positions, the Canadian must be in position 2.

From clue 2, we know the Electrician is on the right of the Doctor. This means the Doctor must be in position 1, and the Electrician must be in position 2.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############

1. The fan of folk is the person eating corn.
This means that the person eating corn prefers folk music.

2. The fan of country is in an even position##4.
This means that the person who prefers country music is in either position 1 or position 2.

Now, let's fill in the table:

| Food          |      |           |
| Music-Genre   |      |           |

From clue 1, we know that the person eating corn prefers folk music. So, we can fill in the table as follows:

| Food          | blueberry | corn      |
| Music-Genre   | country  | folk      |

From clue 2, we know that the person who prefers country music is in an even position##4. Since position 1 is odd, the person who prefers country music must be in position 2. Therefore, the person eating blueberry must prefer country music.
