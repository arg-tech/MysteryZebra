From clue 5, we know that the person drinking fanta is in an odd position. Since the electrician is on the left of the person drinking fanta (clue 13), and the electrician is on the left of the person who's hobby is camping (clue 10), the person drinking fanta must be in position 3:

| Movie-Genre   |  comedy  |  documentary|  martial-arts|  horror    |  crime    |  satire   |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 2, we know the person watching crime movies is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. From statement 9, we know the person drinking 7up is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Therefore, the person drinking 7up cannot be on the left of the person watching crime movies. This means the person drinking 7up must be in position 5 or 6.
2. From statement 4, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the person drinking water. From statement 15, we know the person drinking water is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Therefore, the person eating cauliflower must be in an even position (2 or 4).
3. From statement 12, we know the person watching comedy movies is in an even position. From statement 13, we know the person watching documentary movies is also in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), we can conclude that the person watching comedy movies is in position 2 and the person watching documentary movies is in position 4.

5. From statement 14, we know the person drinking milk is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person drinking milk must be in position 2 or 4. However, we already know the person eating cauliflower is in an even position, so the person drinking milk must be in position 2.
6. From statement 1, we know the person eating pear is between the person eating carrot and the person watching horror movies. Since the person eating pear is in position 1, the person eating carrot must be in position 3, and the person watching horror movies must be in position 5.
7. From statement 8, we know the person watching documentary movies is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 2, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 4.
8. From statement 10, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the person watching martial-arts movies is in position 3, the person eating cauliflower must be in position 2 or 4. However, we already know the person eating cauliflower is in an even position, so it must be in position 2.
9. From statement 16, we know the person eating corn is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating corn is in position 6, it must be on the far right.

| Pet        |  fish        |  goldfish  |  pony    |  hamster   |  rabbit   |  turtle    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 15, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the owner of the fish.
2. From clue 16, we know the person drinking fanta is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up. Since the person drinking fanta is in an odd position (clue 9), it must be in position 2 or 4. Let's assume it's in position 2 for now.
3. From clue 5, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the goldfish is in position 2, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 1.
4. From clue 12, we know the owner of the fish is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the fish is in position 1, the person drinking coffee must be in position 6.
5. From clue 10, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the owner of the pony. Since the pony is not in position 1, the owner of the pony must be in position 3 or 5. Let's assume it's in position 5 for now.
6. From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is skydiving. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (clue 3), and the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left or right of the person drinking fanta (clue 4), the person who's hobby is gardening must be in position 1 or 6. Let's assume it's in position 1 for now.
7. From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is gardening is on the far left or far right. Since we've already placed the person who's hobby is gardening in position 1, it must be the far left.
8. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is woodworking is in an even position. Since the person who's hobby is gardening is in position 1, the person who's hobby is woodworking must be in position 4.
9. From clue 2, we know the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking tea is in position 3, the person drinking juice must be in position 5.
10. From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking juice is in position 5, the person who's hobby is skydiving must be in position 4.
11. From clue 11, we know the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the far left or far right. Since we've already placed the person who's hobby is magic-tricks in position 1, it must be the far left.
12. From clue 14, we know the owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the turtle is not in position 1, the owner of the turtle must be in position 6.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the remaining positions:

* The person who's hobby is hiking is in position 5.
* The person who's hobby is sudoku is in position 2.
* The person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 4.
* The owner of the pony is in position 3.
* The owner of the hamster is in position 6.
* The owner of the rabbit is in position 5.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From statement 1, we know the person drinking sprite is the person who's sport is snowboarding.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 6, we know the person drinking soy-milk is the owner of the turtle. From clue 2, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person driving the bus. Since the skateboard driver is on the far left or far right (clue 9), they must be in position 1 or 6. Since the turtle owner drinks soy-milk, they must be in position 6.
2. From clue 14, we know the owner of the pony is on the far left. From clue 7, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the pony owner is on the far left, the 7up drinker must be in position 2.
3. From clue 13, we know the person driving the car is between the owner of the frog and the owner of the horse. Since the turtle owner is in position 6, the frog owner must be in position 3 or 4. From clue 1, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle, so the frog owner must be in position 3.
4. From clue 11, we know the person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the hamster. Since the frog owner is in position 3, the hamster owner must be in position 2.
5. From clue 10, we know the person drinking fanta is in an odd position. Since the hamster owner is in position 2, the fanta drinker must be in position 1 or 3. From clue 12, we know the fanta drinker is on the left or right of the hamster owner, so they must be in position 1.
6. From clue 4, we know the person drinking sprite is the person driving the subway. Since the turtle owner is in position 6, the subway driver must be in position 6.
7. From clue 8, we know the person driving the van is in an even position. Since the turtle owner is in position 6, the van driver must be in position 4.
8. From clue 5, we know the person drinking 7up is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the 7up drinker is in position 2, the bird owner must be in position 3.
9. From clue 15, we know the owner of the frog is on the left or right of the person driving the trike. Since the frog owner is in position 3, the trike driver must be in position 2 or 4. From clue 13, we know the car driver is between the frog owner and the horse owner, so the trike driver must be in position 4.

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
