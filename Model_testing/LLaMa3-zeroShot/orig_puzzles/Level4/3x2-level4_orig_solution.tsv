Lv1-3x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person driving the roller.
This means that the person who drives the roller is on the left of the person who plays skiing.

2. The mexican is in an odd position.
This means that the mexican is either in the first or third position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   |            |           |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

Since the mexican is in an odd position, let's assume they are in the first position.

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican   |            |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     |            |           |

Now, let's consider the person who drives the roller. According to clue 1, they are on the left of the person who plays skiing. This means that the person who drives the roller must be in the second position.

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican   | Colombian |
| Sport         |            |           |
| Transport     | Roller    |           |

The only remaining spot is the person who plays skiing. Since they are on the right of the person who drives the roller, they must be in the second position.

|               |     1      |     2     |
| Nationality   | Mexican   | Colombian |
| Sport         | Water-polo | Skiing    |
| Transport     | Roller    | Taxi      |

Now, let's check if the solution satisfies all the clues:

* The person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the person driving the roller: Yes, the person who plays skiing is in the second position, and the person who drives the roller is in the second position.
* The mexican is in an odd position: Yes, the mexican is in the first position.

The solution satisfies all the clues, so we can conclude that the final solution is:

Lv1-3x2-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda.
This means that the person drinking Mirinda is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The Canadian is in an even position.
This means that the Canadian is either in the 2nd or 4th position.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking Mirinda is in the 2nd or 3rd position. From clue 2, we know the Canadian is in the 2nd or 4th position. Since the Canadian is in an even position, they must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|               |    1    |     2     |     3     |     4     |
| Beverage      |         |         |         |         |
| Nationality   |         |  Canadian  |         |         |
| Transport     |         |  Train     |         | Motorbike |

Since the Canadian is in the 2nd position, the person drinking Mirinda must be in the 3rd position. The person driving the train is on the left of the person drinking Mirinda, so they must be in the 2nd position.

Now, let's determine the remaining information:

* The person driving the train is Canadian, since they are in the 2nd position and the Canadian is in the 2nd position.
* The person drinking Mirinda is not Canadian, since the Canadian is in the 2nd position and the person drinking Mirinda is in the 3rd position.
* The person drinking Sprite must be Turkish, since the person drinking Mirinda is not Canadian.
* The person driving the motorbike must be Turkish, since the person driving the train is Canadian.

Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Lv1-3x2-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person who's hobby is writing is in an even position.
This means the person who writes is either in position 1 or 2.

2. The person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person who's sport is ice-hockey.
This means the person who watches fantasy movies is either in position 2 or 3, and the person who plays ice-hockey is either in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person who writes is in an even position, so they are either in position 1 or 2.
* The person who watches fantasy movies is on the right of the person who plays ice-hockey, so they are either in position 2 or 3.
* Since the person who writes is in an even position, and the person who watches fantasy movies is on the right of the person who plays ice-hockey, the person who writes must be in position 2.

Here's the updated table:

|               |      1       |    2     |
| Hobby         |              | writing |
| Movie-Genre   |              | fantasy |
| Sport         | ice-hockey  |          |

Now, let's fill in the remaining information:

* The person who plays ice-hockey is in position 1.
* The person who watches fantasy movies is in position 2.
* The person who writes is in position 2.
* The person who doesn't play ice-hockey or watch fantasy movies must be in position 3.

Since the person who writes is in position 2, and the person who watches fantasy movies is in position 2, the person who doesn't play ice-hockey or watch fantasy movies must be in position 3.

Here's the final solution:

#############
|               |      1       |    2     |    3     |

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies.
This means that the person watching superhero movies is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the person driving the ship is in the 2nd or 3rd position.

2. The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position.
This means that the person eating pomegranate is either in the 1st or 3rd position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating pomegranate is in an odd position, so they are either in the 1st or 3rd position.
* The person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies, so the person driving the ship is in the 2nd or 3rd position.
* Since the person eating pomegranate is in an odd position, they cannot be in the 2nd position (which is even). Therefore, the person eating pomegranate must be in the 1st position.

Now we have:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3     |
| Food          | Pomegranate |         | Raspberry |
| Movie-Genre   |         | Superhero |         |
| Transport     |         | Ship     | Train    |

The person watching superhero movies is in the 2nd position, and the person driving the ship is in the 2nd or 3rd position. Since the person driving the ship is on the right of the person watching superhero movies, the person driving the ship must be in the 3rd position.

Here is the final solution:

Lv1-3x2-5	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating raspberry is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby.
This means that the person eating raspberry cannot be in the first column (since there's no one to the right of them to be rugby). So, the person eating raspberry must be in the second or third column.

2. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position.
This means that the person driving the quad-bike must be in either the first or third column (since odd positions are 1 and 3).

Now, let's combine the information:

* The person eating raspberry is in the second or third column.
* The person driving the quad-bike is in the first or third column.

We can create a possible solution table:

|             |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Food        |           |           |           |

| Transport   |           |           |           |

Since the person eating raspberry is in the second or third column, and the person driving the quad-bike is in the first or third column, we can place the quad-bike in the third column:

|             |     1     |     2      |     3      |
| Food        |           | raspberry |           |
| Sport       |           | cricket   | rugby     |
| Transport   |           |           | quad-bike |

Now, we can fill in the remaining information:

* The person eating lime must be in the first column (since they're not eating raspberry).
* The person playing cricket must be in the second column (since they're not playing rugby).

Here's the final solution table:

Clue 1: The person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person eating kiwi

This means that the person eating kiwi must be on the left of the person who sings. Let's denote the person eating kiwi as K and the person who sings as S. We can write this as:

K → S
