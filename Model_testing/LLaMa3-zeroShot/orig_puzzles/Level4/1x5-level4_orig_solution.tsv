Lv1-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The fan of house is in the middle: This means that the fan of house is in position 3.
2. The fan of disco is on the left of the fan of pop: This means that the fan of disco is in position 1 or 2, and the fan of pop is in position 2 or 3. Since the fan of house is in position 3, the fan of pop must be in position 2.
3. The fan of hip-hop is in an odd position: This means that the fan of hip-hop is in position 1, 3, or 5.
4. The fan of hip-hop is on the left of the fan of d&b: This means that the fan of hip-hop is in position 1 or 3, and the fan of d&b is in position 2 or 4.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The fan of house is in position 3.
* The fan of pop is in position 2.
* The fan of disco is in position 1 or 2, but since the fan of pop is in position 2, the fan of disco must be in position 1.
* The fan of hip-hop is in position 1 or 3, but since the fan of d&b is on the right of the fan of hip-hop, the fan of hip-hop must be in position 1.
* The fan of d&b is in position 4 or 5, but since the fan of hip-hop is in position 1, the fan of d&b must be in position 5.

Here is the final solution:

Lv1-1x5-2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the motorbike is on the left or right of the person driving the skateboard.
This means the motorbike and skateboard are adjacent to each other.

2. The person driving the train is on the far left.
This means the train is in the first position.

3. The person driving the quad-bike is in an odd position.
Since the quad-bike is in the middle (from clue 5), it must be in an odd position. The only odd positions available are 1, 3, or 5. Since the train is already in the first position, the quad-bike must be in position 3.

4. The person driving the skateboard is on the far right.
This means the skateboard is in the last position.

5. The person driving the quad-bike is in the middle.
This confirms that the quad-bike is in position 3.

Now that we have the positions of the train, quad-bike, and skateboard, we can fill in the remaining positions. The motorbike must be on the left of the skateboard, so it's in position 4. The van is the only remaining option, so it's in position 2.

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Transport   | Train | Van | Motorbike | Skateboard |
|             | 1    | 2  | 4        | 5          |
#############

The solution shows the correct order of the 5 different means of transport, with the train on the far left, the quad-bike in the middle, and the skateboard on the far right."
Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The person driving the helicopter is in an odd position##4
This means the helicopter driver is in positions 1, 3, or 5.

2. The person driving the skateboard is on the left or right of the person driving the bike##3
This means the skateboard driver is either in position 1 or 4, since the bike driver is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).

3. The person driving the bike is in an odd position##4
This reinforces the idea that the bike driver is in positions 1, 3, or 5.

4. The person driving the train is on the far right
This means the train driver is in position 5.

5. The person driving the bike is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski
This means the bike driver is in position 3 or 5, and the jet-ski driver is in position 2.

Now, let's combine the information:

* Helicopter driver: odd position##4, so in position 1 or 3.
* Bike driver: odd position##4, so in position 1, 3, or 5. But also on the right of the jet-ski driver, so in position 3 or 5.
* Jet-ski driver: in position 2.
* Skateboard driver: on the left or right of the bike driver, so in position 1 or 4. But the bike driver is in position 3 or 5, so the skateboard driver is in position 1.
* Train driver: on the far right, so in position 5.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

#############
|             |     1      |    2    |  3   |     4      |   5   |

* Bike driver in position 3
* Skateboard driver in position 4
* Train driver in position 5"
Lv1-1x5-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The architect is in an odd position, which means they are in positions 1, 3, or 5.
2. The police-officer is on the right of the bartender, which means the police-officer is in position 2, 4, or 5, and the bartender is in position 1, 2, or 3.
3. The social-worker is on the far left, which means they are in position 1.
4. The bartender is on the left or right of the social-worker, which means the bartender is in position 2 or 3.

From clue 1, we know the architect is in an odd position, so they can't be in position 2. From clue 2, we know the police-officer is in position 2, 4, or 5, and the bartender is in position 1, 2, or 3. From clue 4, we know the bartender is in position 2 or 3, so the police-officer must be in position 4 or 5.

Now, let's try to fit the remaining jobs into the table:

|       |       1       |     2     |       3        |   4    |     5     |
| Job   |               |           |                |        |           |

Since the social-worker is in position 1, the architect can't be in position 1. The architect must be in position 3 or 5. If the architect is in position 3, the writer must be in position 5. If the architect is in position 5, the writer must be in position 3.

Let's try the first option:

|       |       1       |     2     |       3        |   4    |     5     |
| Job   | social-worker | police-officer | architect    | bartender | writer    |

This solution satisfies all the clues:

* The architect is in an odd position (3).
* The police-officer is on the right of the bartender (2).
* The social-worker is on the far left (1).
* The bartender is on the left or right of the social-worker (2).

So, the final solution is:

#############
|       |       1       |     2     |       3        |   4    |     5     |
| Job   | social-worker | police-officer | architect    | bartender | writer    |

Lv1-1x5-6	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Egyptian is on the right of the Russian.
This means the Egyptian cannot be in the first or second position, so it must be in either the third, fourth, or fifth position.

2. The Canadian is in an odd position (1, 3, or 5).
Since the Canadian is in an odd position, it cannot be in the second position. It must be in either the first, third, or fifth position.

3. The Russian is on the right of the German.
This means the Russian cannot be in the first position, so it must be in either the second, third, or fourth position.

4. The German is between the Canadian and the Russian.
This means the German cannot be in the first or fifth position, so it must be in either the second or fourth position.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The Canadian is in an odd position, so it's either in the first, third, or fifth position.
* The Russian is on the right of the German, so it's either in the second, third, or fourth position.
* The German is between the Canadian and the Russian, so it's either in the second or fourth position.

From these constraints, we can deduce the following:

* If the Canadian is in the first position, the German must be in the second position, and the Russian must be in the third position. But this would mean the Egyptian is in the fourth position, which contradicts clue 1. So, the Canadian cannot be in the first position.
* If the Canadian is in the third position, the German must be in the second position, and the Russian must be in the fourth position. This satisfies all the clues, so the Canadian is indeed in the third position.

Here's the final solution:

#############
| Nationality   |    1     |   2    |    3    |    4     |  5   |
|               |          |        |         |          |      |
| Canadian     |          |        |  Canadian |          |      |
| Egyptian     |          |        |  German   |  Russian |      |
| German       |          |  German |          |  Egyptian |      |
