Lv1-4x3-3	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person eating watermelon is the person driving the train.
3. The person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird.
4. The person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train.
5. The person watching action movies is in an even position.
6. The owner of the turtle is the person eating cranberry.

From statement 1, we know the owner of the turtle is on the right of the person driving the bike. Let's call the owner of the turtle ""T"". Since the owner of the turtle is eating cranberry (statement 6), we can conclude that the person driving the bike is eating either carrot or watermelon.

From statement 2, we know the person eating watermelon is driving the train. Let's call the person driving the train ""W"". Since W is eating watermelon, W cannot be eating carrot or cranberry.

From statement 4, we know the person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and the person driving the train. Since W is driving the train, the person eating carrot must be between the person watching adventure movies and W.

From statement 5, we know the person watching action movies is in an even position. Since there are only 3 positions (1, 2, and 3), the person watching action movies must be in position 1 or 2.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Pet           |            |        |           |
| Transport     |            |        | quad-     |

Since W is driving the train, W must be in position 3. Since the person eating carrot is between the person watching adventure movies and W, the person eating carrot must be in position 2. This means the person watching adventure movies is in position 1.

Now, we know the person watching action movies is in an even position, so they must be in position 2. This means the person watching family movies is in position 3.

From statement 3, we know the person eating cranberry is on the left or right of the owner of the bird. Since the owner of the turtle is eating cranberry (statement 6), the owner of the turtle must be in position 1. This means the owner of the bird is in position 3.

Now, we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |   2    |     3     |
| Food          |  Cranberry | Carrot | Watermelon |
| Movie-Genre   | Action    | Action | Family    |
| Pet           | Turtle    | Bird   | Pony     |
| Transport     | Bike      | Quad   | Train     |
#############

The final solution is:

* The owner of the turtle is eating cranberry and is in position 1.

* The person watching family movies is in position 3.
* The owner of the bird is in position 3.
* The person driving the bike is eating either carrot or watermelon.
* The person driving the quad-bike is eating cranberry."

From statement 4, we know the italian is on the far right. From statement 6, we know the italian is on the right of the pakistani. Therefore, the pakistani must be in the second position.

From statement 5, we know the bartender is on the right of the pakistani. Therefore, the bartender must be in the third position.

From statement 3, we know the engineer is the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the engineer is not on the left or right of the person who's hobby is chess, the engineer must be in the second position.

From statement 5, we know the police-officer is on the left or right of the fan of salsa. Since the fan of pop is in position 3, the police-officer must be in position 2 or 3. However, statement 6 says the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking juice, which is in position 2. Therefore, the police-officer must be in position 3.

From statement 7, we know the Polish is in the middle. Since the German is in position 3, the Polish must be in position 2.

This means the order is: [Italian, social-worker,?] (where? is the person eating raspberry)

5. The Dutch is in an even position.
This means the Dutch person is either in the first or third position. Since the Dutch person is eating asparagus (from clue 2), and asparagus is not in the first position (because the Italian is watching western movies, and western movies are not in the first position), the Dutch person must be in the third position.

6. The Dutch is on the right of the person eating raspberry.

* The owner of the lizard is in position 1, and the person eating cabbage is in position 2 or 3.
* The owner of the horse is in position 1, and the fan of blues is in position 2 or 4.
* The Turkish is in position 1 or 3.

The only possible arrangement is:

#############
| Food          | Apricot | Cabbage | Lemon    |
| Music-Genre   | Punk    | Disco   | Blues    |
| Nationality   | Turkish | Colombian| Canadian|
| Pet           | Chinchilla| Lizard  | Horse    |
#############

Here's how the solution fits the given clues:

* The Colombian is on the right of the person eating apricot (position 2).
* The fan of punk is in an even position (position 2).
* The Turkish is the owner of the chinchilla (row 1).
* The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person eating cabbage (position 1).
* The Colombian is on the left or right of the Turkish (position 1).
* The owner of the horse is on the left of the fan of blues (position 1).
* The Turkish is in an odd position (position 1)."
Lv1-4x3-10	"Let's start by analyzing the given clues:

1. The Japanese is on the left of the person driving the roller.
2. The fan of classical is the dancer.
3. The teacher is on the left of the fan of indie.
4. The fan of classical is the Thai.
5. The person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van.
6. The dancer is in an odd position.
7. The dancer is on the left or right of the teacher.

From clue 2, we know the dancer is a fan of classical. From clue 4, we know the Thai is a fan of classical, so the dancer must be the Thai.

From clue 1, we know the Japanese is on the left of the person driving the roller. This means the Japanese cannot be the person driving the roller, as they would be in the middle. Therefore, the person driving the roller must be the freelancer (since the teacher is already accounted for).

From clue 5, we know the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the person driving the van. This means the person driving the van must be on the right of the person driving the snowmobile. Since the Japanese is already accounted for, the person driving the snowmobile must be the Japanese.

From clue 3, we know the teacher is on the left of the fan of indie. Since the dancer (Thai) is already accounted for, the fan of indie must be the freelancer.

From clue 6, we know the dancer is in an odd position. Since the dancer is the Thai, they must be in the middle position.

From clue 7, we know the dancer is on the left or right of the teacher. Since the dancer is in the middle, they must be on the right of the teacher.

Now we can fill in the table:

#############
|               |     1      |     2      |     3      |
| Job           |            |            |            |
| Music-Genre   |            |            |            |
| Nationality   |            |            |            |
| Transport     |            |            |            |
#############
| Job           | Teacher  | Freelancer | Dancer    |
| Music-Genre   |          | Indie      | Classical |
| Nationality   |          |          | Thai      |
| Transport     |          | Snowmobile | Roller    |

Note that the Japanese is not explicitly mentioned in the table, but we know they are driving the snowmobile from clue 1."
