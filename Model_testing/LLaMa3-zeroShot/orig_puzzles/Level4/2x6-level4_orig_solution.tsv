From statement 5, we know the Dutch watches mystery movies. From statement 3, we know the Dutch is on the right of the Brazilian. From statement 1, we know the person watching horror movies is on the left of the Brazilian. Therefore, the order is:

Horror, Brazilian, Dutch,?,?,?,?

From statement 4, we know the Japanese is on the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the Dutch is already placed, the Japanese must be on the right of the person watching scientific movies, which means the scientific movie person is on the right of the Dutch.

From statement 8, we know the Italian is in an even position. Since the Dutch is on the right of the Brazilian, the Italian must be in the middle.

From statement 9, we know the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the Italian. Since the Italian is in the middle, the comedy movie person must be on the left of the Italian.

From statement 6, we know the person watching satire movies is on the left or right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the scientific movie person is on the right of the Dutch, the satire movie person must be on the right of the scientific movie person.

8. The person watching action movies is on the left or right of the person watching drama movies.
9. The person driving the van is on the left of the person watching drama movies.

From statement 1, we know the boat driver is on the far right. From statement 3, we know the action movie watcher is on the far left. So, the order from left to right is:

Action,?,?,?,?, Boat

From statement 4, we know the train driver is in an even position. Since the boat driver is on the far right, the train driver must be in the 2nd or 4th position. Let's assume the train driver is in the 2nd position for now.

Action,?, Train,?,?, Boat

From statement 5, we know the skateboard driver is the family movie watcher. Since the skateboard driver is not in the 1st or 6th position, they must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Let's assume the skateboard driver is in the 3rd position for now.

Action,?, Train, Skateboard,?, Boat

From statement 6, we know the motorbike driver is on the left or right of the family movie watcher. Since the skateboard driver is in the 3rd position, the motorbike driver must be in the 2nd or 4th position. However, the train driver is already in the 2nd position, so the motorbike driver must be in the 4th position.

Action,?, Train, Skateboard, Motorbike, Boat

From statement 7, we know the scientific movie watcher is on the right of the satire movie watcher. Since the scientific movie watcher is not in the 1st or 6th position, they must be in the 3rd or 5th position. Let's assume the scientific movie watcher is in the 5th position for now.

Action, Drama, Train, Skateboard, Motorbike, Scientific

From statement 9, we know the van driver is on the left of the drama movie watcher. Since the drama movie watcher is in the 4th position, the van driver must be in the 3rd position.

Action, Drama, Train, Van, Motorbike, Scientific

From statement 7, we know the fan of Trance is on the left of the fan of Gospel.

From statement 10, we know the Turkish is on the left of the fan of Rock.

Now, let's try to fill in the table:

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| Nationality   |         |        |         |           |         |         |

We can start by placing the British on the far right, since they are the fan of disco (statement 1).

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| British      |         |        |         |           |         | Disco |

Next, we can place the Turkish on the left of the Polish (statement 2).

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| Turkish     |         | Polish |         |           |         |         |

Now, we can place the Argentine on the right of the fan of Jazz, which is the Russian (statement 3).

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| Turkish     |         | Polish |         |           |         |         |
| Argentine   |         |        | Russian |           |         |         |

Next, we can place the fan of Indie on the left of the fan of Rock (statement 4).

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| Argentine   |         |        | Russian | Indie    | Rock    |         |

Since the fan of Indie is on the far left or far right (statement 5), we can move it to the far left.

| Argentine   |         |        | Russian |           | Rock    |         |

Now, we can place the fan of Gospel in an odd position (statement 6). Since the fan of Indie is already in an odd position, we can place the fan of Gospel in the middle.

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

| Nationality   |         |        |         |           |         |         |
| British      |         |        |         |           |         | Disco |

| Argentine   |         |        | Russian |           | Rock    |         |

Finally, we can place the fan of Trance on the left of the fan of Gospel (statement 7).

| Music-Genre   |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4     |    5    |    6    |

From statement 1, we know the writer's sport is tennis.

From statement 5, we know the badminton player is on the left of the writer.

From statement 4, we know the cricket player is on the far left. Since the writer is not on the far left (because the badminton player is on the left of the writer), the cricket player must be in the first position.

From statement 8, we know the nurse is on the left of the person who's sport is tennis (the writer). This means the nurse is in the second position.

From statement 6, we know the software-developer is on the right of the engineer. Since the engineer is not on the far right (because the cricket player is on the far left), the engineer must be in the third position.

From statement 7, we know the engineer is on the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since the engineer is already in the third position, the cricket player must be in the first position.

From statement 2, we know the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the left or right of the project-manager. Since the project-manager is not on the far right (because the software-developer is on the right of the engineer), the project-manager must be in the fifth position.

From statement 10, we know the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. Since the rugby player is not on the far right (because the software-developer is on the right of the engineer), the rugby player must be in the sixth position.

From statement 9, we know the analyst is in an even position. Since the project-manager is in the fifth position, the analyst must be in the fourth position.

1. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person drinking 7up.
This means that the person drinking 7up is either in position 1 or 6.

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is the person drinking fanta.
This means that fanta is in position 2 or 4.

3. The person drinking fanta is on the right of the person drinking iced-tea.
This means that iced-tea is in position 1 or 3.

4. The person drinking iced-tea is in an even position.
This means that iced-tea is in position 2 or 4.

Combining 3 and 4, we can conclude that iced-tea is in position 2.
