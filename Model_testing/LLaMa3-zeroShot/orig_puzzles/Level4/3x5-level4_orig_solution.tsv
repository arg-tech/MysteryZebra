Lv1-3x5-4	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 5, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right.

From statement 11, we know the person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching fantasy movies is on the far right, the person watching epic movies must be on the far left.

From statement 6, we know the owner of the cat is on the left or right of the person watching epic movies. Since the person watching epic movies is on the far left, the owner of the cat must be on the far left as well.

From statement 4, we know the owner of the hamster is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the owner of the cat is on the far left, the owner of the hamster must be on the far left as well.

From statement 1, we know the person driving the car is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster. Since the owner of the hamster is on the far left, the person driving the car must be on the far left as well.

From statement 7, we know the person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the car. Since the person driving the car is on the far left, the person driving the boat must be on the second position from the left.

From statement 2, we know the person driving the subway is on the left or right of the person driving the van. Since the person driving the van is in an odd position (statement 10), the person driving the subway must be in an even position. From statement 9, we know the owner of the mouse is in an even position, so the person driving the subway must be the owner of the mouse.

From statement 8, we know the owner of the cat is on the left of the person driving the taxi. Since the owner of the cat is on the far left, the person driving the taxi must be on the third position from the left.

From statement 12, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching spy movies. Since the person watching spy movies is not yet placed, we'll come back to this statement later.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############

| Person 3     | Sports  | Hedgehog| Van    | Boat   |          |
#############

The person watching epic movies is on the far left, so Person 1 is watching epic movies. The person watching fantasy movies is on the far right, so Person 5 is watching fantasy movies. The person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person driving the car, so Person 2 is watching horror movies and driving the car.

The owner of the cat is on the far left, so Person 2 is the owner of the cat. The owner of the hamster is on the far left, so Person 2 is also the owner of the hamster.

The person driving the boat is on the right of the person driving the car, so Person 3 is driving the boat. The person driving the subway is the owner of the mouse, so Person 4 is driving the subway.

The owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching spy movies, so Person 3 is the owner of the hedgehog and watching spy movies.

The person driving the taxi is on the third position from the left, so Person 3 is driving the taxi.

The person watching sports movies is not yet placed, but we can conclude that Person 4 is watching sports movies since they are not watching epic, fantasy, horror, or spy movies.

The final solution table is:

From statement 6, we know the fan of indie is in the middle. Since there are 5 people, the middle position is the 3rd position.

From statement 7, we know the American is on the left of the Brazilian. This means the American is in the 1st position, and the Brazilian is in the 2nd position.

From statement 8, we know the person driving the airplane is on the right of the Italian. This means the Italian is in the 4th position, and the person driving the airplane is in the 5th position.

From statement 9, we know the Russian is on the far right. Since the person driving the airplane is in the 5th position, the Russian must be in the 5th position.

From statement 10, we know the Italian is on the left of the person driving the airplane. This means the Italian is in the 4th position, which we already know.

From statement 11, we know the fan of techno is the Russian. Since the Russian is in the 5th position, the fan of techno is in the 5th position.

Now, let's fill in the table:

#############
| Music-Genre | Nationality | Transport |
| d&b        | American    | Airplane  |
| indie      | Brazilian  | Train     |
| jazz       | Italian    | Ship     |

From statement 6, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking water is on the far left, the person drinking lemonade must be in the second position.

From statement 8, we know the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. This means the person drinking lemonade is in the third position.

From statement 5, we know the fan of salsa is the person driving the bike. Since the fan of ambient is not in the middle, the fan of salsa must be in the first position.
