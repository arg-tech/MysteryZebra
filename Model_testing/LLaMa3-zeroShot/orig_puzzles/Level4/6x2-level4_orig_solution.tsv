From statement 1, we know the Polish person is on the right of the asparagus eater. Let's call the asparagus eater A. Then, the Polish person is on the right of A.

Lv1-6x2-7	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The project-manager is on the left of the person watching romance movies.
2. The person eating kiwi is in an odd position (4th column).
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is the project-manager.
4. The person driving the boat is in an odd position (4th column).
5. The australian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli.

From clue 3, we know the project-manager's hobby is dancing. From clue 1, we know the project-manager is on the left of the person watching romance movies. Let's assume the project-manager is in the 1st column.

From clue 2, we know the person eating kiwi is in the 4th column. Since the project-manager is in the 1st column, the person eating kiwi must be in the 3rd or 5th column.

From clue 4, we know the person driving the boat is in the 4th column. Since the person eating kiwi is already in the 4th column, the person driving the boat must be the same person.

From clue 5, we know the australian is on the left or right of the person eating broccoli. Since the project-manager is in the 1st column, the australian must be in the 2nd or 3rd column.

Now, let's fill in the table:

Lv1-6x2-9	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The owner of the lizard is in an even position##4
This means that the person who owns the lizard is in either the 2nd or 4th position.

2. The person who's hobby is hiking is in an odd position##4
This means that the person who enjoys hiking is in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.

3. The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies
This means that the person who drives the skateboard is in a position that is one position to the left of the person who watches martial-arts movies.

4. The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the fan of metal##3
This means that the person who eats avocado is in either the 1st or 3rd position, and is adjacent to the fan of metal.

5. The fan of soul is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies##3
This means that the fan of soul is in either the 2nd or 4th position, and is adjacent to the person who watches martial-arts movies.

Now, let's combine the information:

* The owner of the lizard is in an even position##4, so they are in either the 2nd or 4th position.
* The person who enjoys hiking is in an odd position##4, so they are in either the 1st, 3rd, or 5th position.
* The person driving the skateboard is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, so they are in either the 1st or 3rd position.
* The person eating avocado is on the left or right of the fan of metal##3, so they are in either the 1st or 3rd position.
* The fan of soul is on the left or right of the person watching martial-arts movies##3, so they are in either the 2nd or 4th position.

From the above, we can deduce the following:

* The person driving the skateboard is in the 3rd position (since they are on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies).
* The person eating avocado is in the 1st position (since they are on the left or right of the fan of metal##3).

Lv1-6x2-10	"Let's start by analyzing the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is skydiving is in an even position##4
This means that the person who enjoys skydiving is either in the 2nd or 4th position.

2. The person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the mouse
This means that the person who enjoys ice-hockey is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the owner of the mouse is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

3. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the thai
This means that the person driving the airplane is either in the 1st or 2nd position, and the Thai person is either in the 2nd or 3rd position.

4. The fan of techno is the owner of the mouse
This means that the person who enjoys techno is also the owner of the mouse.

From clue 1, we know that the person who enjoys skydiving is in an even position##4. Since the person who enjoys ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the mouse (clue 2), the owner of the mouse cannot be in the 2nd position. Therefore, the owner of the mouse must be in the 3rd position.

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the airplane is on the left of the Thai. Since the Thai person is either in the 2nd or 3rd position, the person driving the airplane must be in the 1st position.

From clue 4, we know that the fan of techno is the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse is in the 3rd position, the fan of techno must be in the 3rd position.
