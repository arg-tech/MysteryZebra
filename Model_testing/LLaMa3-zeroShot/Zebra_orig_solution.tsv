Zebra_orig_3	"Let's start by using the given facts to fill in the table. We'll start with the easiest ones:

1. The Englishman lives in the red house.
2. The Norwegian lives in the first house.
3. The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.

From fact 3, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house, and from fact 15, we know the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means the blue house must be the second house.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| english	|    	|        	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	|        	|        	|        	|
| Beverage	|          	|      	|        	|        	|          	|

| Pet		|        	|        	|        	|        	|          	|

Now, let's use fact 6: The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. This means the ivory house must be the third house, and the green house must be the fourth house.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| english	|    	|        	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	|        	|

| Pet		|        	|        	|        	|        	|          	|

Next, let's use fact 9: Milk is drunk in the middle house. Since the green house is the fourth house, the middle house must be the third house. This means the ivory house is the middle house, and the person who drinks milk lives there.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| english	|    	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	|        	|
| Beverage	|          	|      	| milk		|        	|          	|
| Cigar		|          	|      	|        	|        	| parliament	|
| Pet		|        	|        	|        	|        	|          	|

Now, let's use fact 7: The Old Gold smoker owns snails. Since the Old Gold smoker is not the Ukrainian (who drinks milk), the Old Gold smoker must be the person who lives in the first house (the Norwegian).

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	|    	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|

| Pet		| snails		|        	|        	|        	|          	|

Next, let's use fact 11: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. Since the Norwegian smokes Old Gold, the Chesterfield smoker must be the person who lives in the second house.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| spanish	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	|        	|

| Pet		| snails		| fox		|        	|        	|          	|

Now, let's use fact 12: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept. Since the Spanish person smokes Chesterfields, the Kools smoker must be the person who lives in the house next to the horse.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| spanish	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	|        	|

| Cigar		| old-gold	| chesterfield	|        	| kools	| parliament	|
| Pet		| snails		| fox		| horse		|        	|          	|

Next, let's use fact 13: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Since the Lucky Strike smoker is not the Ukrainian (who drinks milk), the Lucky Strike smoker must be the person who lives in the last house.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| spanish	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	| yellow	|
| Beverage	|          	|      	| milk		|        	| orange-juice	|
| Cigar		| old-gold	| chesterfield	|        	| kools	| parliament	|
| Pet		| snails		| fox		| horse		|        	|          	|

Finally, let's use fact 14: The Japanese smokes Parliaments. Since the Japanese person lives in the last house, the Japanese person must smoke Parliaments.

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| spanish	| ukranian	|        	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	| yellow	|
| Beverage	|          	|      	| milk		|        	| orange-juice	|
| Cigar		| old-gold	| chesterfield	|        	| kools	| parliament	|
| Pet		| snails		| fox		| horse		|        	| snails	|

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:

|		|       1	|	2	|	3 	|	4	|	5	|
| Nationality	| norwegian	| spanish	| ukranian	| english	| japanese	|
| Color		| red		| blue	| ivory	| green	| yellow	|

| Cigar		| old-gold	| chesterfield	| kools	| lucky-strike	| parliament	|
| Pet		| snails		| fox		| horse		| dog		| snails	|

The final solution is:
