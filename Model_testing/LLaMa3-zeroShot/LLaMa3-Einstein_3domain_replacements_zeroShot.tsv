#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, we know the British is traveling to Venice.
2. From clue 2, we know the Swedish is the owner of the dog.
3. From clue 3, we know the Danish is the person who's hobby is photography.
4. From clue 4, we know the person traveling to Miami is on the left of the person traveling to Hannover. Since the Norwegian is on the far left (clue 9), the German must be traveling to Miami.
5. From clue 5, we know the person traveling to Miami is the person who's hobby is traveling. Since the German is traveling to Miami, their hobby must be traveling.
6. From clue 6, we know the person watching documentary movies is the owner of the bird. Since the German is not watching documentary movies (clue 13), the owner of the bird must be the Norwegian.
7. From clue 7, we know the person traveling to Nizza is the person watching western movies. Since the Swedish is not watching western movies (clue 2), the person traveling to Nizza must be the Danish.
8. From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is in the middle. Since the Norwegian is on the far left, the Danish must be in the middle, and the German must be on the right.
9. From clue 10, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since the Swedish is the owner of the dog (clue 2), they cannot be the owner of the cat. Therefore, the owner of the cat must be the Norwegian, and the person watching zombie movies must be the Danish.
10. From clue 11, we know the owner of the horses is on the left or right of the person watching western movies. Since the Danish is watching western movies (clue 7), the owner of the horses must be the German.
11. From clue 12, we know the person watching comedy movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking. Since the British is not watching comedy movies (clue 1), the person watching comedy movies must be the Norwegian.
12. From clue 13, we know the German is the person watching horror movies.
13. From clue 14, we know the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool. Since the Norwegian is already placed (clue 1), the person traveling to Liverpool must be the British.
14. From clue 15, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is reading. Since the Norwegian is not watching zombie movies (clue 10), the person watching zombie movies must be the Danish, and the person who's hobby is reading must be the Swedish.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table."
