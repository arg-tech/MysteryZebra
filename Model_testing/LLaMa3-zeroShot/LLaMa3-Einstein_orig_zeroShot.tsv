#############
| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Beverage	| Cigar	|
|---------|--------------|------|----------|--------|
| Yellow	| Norwegian	| Cat	| Water	| Dunhill	|
| Blue	| German	| Bird	| Beer	| Bluemaster	|
| Green	| Swedish	| Fish	| Coffee	| Prince	|
| Red	| British	| Horse	| Milk	| Pall Mall	|
| White	| Danish	| Dog	| Tea	| Blend	|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. From clue 9, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house, which is Yellow.
2. From clue 7, we know the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill.
3. From clue 11, we know the owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. Since the Norwegian smokes Dunhill, the horse owner must live in the Red house.
4. From clue 1, we know the Brit lives in a Red house, so the horse owner is the British.
5. From clue 8, we know the owner living in the center house drinks Milk. Since the Red house is not the center house, the Milk drinker must live in the White house.
6. From clue 3, we know the Dane drinks Tea, so the Tea drinker must live in the White house, which confirms the previous conclusion.
7. From clue 4, we know the Green house is on the left of the White house, so the Green house must be the second house.
8. From clue 5, we know the Green house owner drinks Coffee, so the Coffee drinker lives in the Green house.
9. From clue 6, we know the owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds, so the Bird owner must live in the Blue house.
10. From clue 13, we know the German smokes Prince, so the Prince smoker lives in the Green house.
11. From clue 2, we know the Swede keeps Dogs as pets, so the Dog owner must live in the White house.
12. From clue 12, we know the owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer, so the Beer drinker lives in the Blue house.
13. From clue 15, we know the owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water. Since the Blend smoker lives next to the Cat owner (from clue 10), the Water drinker must live in the Yellow house, which confirms the previous conclusion.
14. From clue 14, we know the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house, so the Blue house is the third house.
15. From clue 10, we know the owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats, so the Cat owner lives in the Yellow house.

By combining these conclusions, we can fill in the entire table."

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 9, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house. From clue 14, we know the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house, so the Blue house must be the second house.
2. From clue 1, we know the Brit lives in a Red house. From clue 8, we know the owner of the center house drinks Milk, and from clue 4, we know the Green house is on the left of the White house. Therefore, the Red house must be the fourth house.
3. From clue 3, we know the Dane drinks Tea. From clue 5, we know the Green house owner drinks Coffee. Since the Dane can't be the Green house owner (they drink Tea), the Dane must be the owner of the White house.
4. From clue 7, we know the owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill. From clue 11, we know the owner who keeps horses lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill. Therefore, the horse owner must be the Red house owner (Brit).
5. From clue 2, we know the Swede keeps Dogs as pets. From clue 10, we know the owner who smokes Blend lives next to the one who keeps Cats. Since the Swede keeps Dogs, the Swede can't be the one who keeps Cats. Therefore, the Swede must be the owner of the White house (Dane).
6. From clue 6, we know the owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds. From clue 12, we know the owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks Beer. From clue 13, we know the German smokes Prince. Therefore, the German must be the owner of the Blue house.
7. From clue 15, we know the owner who smokes Blend has a neighbor who drinks Water. Since the Blend owner lives next to the Cat owner (from clue 10), the Blend owner must be the owner of the Yellow house (Norwegian).
8. From clue 4, we know the Green house is on the left of the White house. From clue 5, we know the Green house owner drinks Coffee. Therefore, the Green house owner must be the Swedish owner (from clue 2).

By combining these deductions, we arrive at the final solution table."
