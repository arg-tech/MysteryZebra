#############
||1|2|3|4|5|
| Color	| Nationality	| Pet	| Beverage	| Cigar	|
|---------|--------------|------|-----------|--------|
| Azure	| Spanish	| Lizard	| Mirinda	| Game	|
| Aquamarine	| French	| Turtle	| Hot-chocolate	| Havana	|
| Black	| Japanese	| -	| -	| -	|
| Chestnut	| Dutch	| Ferret	| Fanta	| Davidoff	|
| Grey	| Australian	| Guinea-pig	| 7up	| Baccarat	|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

1. The Japanese likes black, so they're not drinking anything or smoking a cigar.
2. The Swedish owns the guinea-pig, which means they're not the Australian (who drinks almond-milk).
3. The Australian drinks almond-milk, so they're not the Dutch (who's on the far left).
4. The person who likes grey is on the left of the person who likes aquamarine, and the grey drinker is the one drinking 7up. This means the grey drinker is the Australian, and the aquamarine drinker is the French.
5. The baccarat-smoker owns the chinchilla, which means they're not the game-smoker (who likes azure).
6. The person drinking mirinda is in the middle, which means they're not the Dutch (far left) or the French (havana-smoker).
7. The dutch is on the left or right of the person who likes chestnut, which means they're not the Australian (grey drinker).
8. The chaman-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the ferret, which means they're not the game-smoker (who owns the lizard).
9. The owner of the turtles is on the left or right of the game-smoker, which means they're not the French (havana-smoker).
10. The davidoff-smoker drinks fanta, which means they're not the chaman-smoker (who's on the left or right of the ferret owner).
11. The french is the havana-smoker, which means they're not the game-smoker (who likes azure).

By combining these clues, we can fill in the rest of the table. The final solution is the one above."
