From statement 9, we know that the person whose sport is cricket is on the far left.

From statement 14, we also know that the person watching drama movies is to the right or left of the person whose sport is cricket (on the far left). This means the person watching drama movies cannot be in the middle, as they would block the middle row. Therefore, the person watching drama movies must be next to the far-left person.

From statement 8, we know that the person drinking milk is in the middle.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude:

1. The far-left position belongs to a person who watches drama movies.
2. The middle position belongs to a person who drinks milk.

Let's continue with the next statements.

From statement 12, we know that the person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice.

From statement 13, we also know that the person whose sport is biathlon eats lime (and therefore cannot be in the far-left position or the middle position).

From statement 1 and statement 10, we can deduce:

* The person who's sport is lacrosse is the person watching mystery movies.
* Since the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef (statement 10), and the chef cannot be in the far-left position (as it belongs to a person watching drama movies) nor in the middle position, the chef must be next to the person whose sport is biathlon. The only positions available for the chef are the left neighbor of the biathlete or the right neighbor.

Now let's analyze the remaining people:

* From statement 3, we know that the person drinking coffee is watching horror movies.
* Statement 5 indicates that the person watching horror movies (drinking coffee) is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.

Given the available positions and the previous deductions, it seems most likely that the chef occupies a position with the biathlete as their neighbor. We can then determine that the person eating cauliflower must be on the left or right of the chef:

* If the chef were on the far-left, they would block the middle row (as we deduced earlier), which is not possible.
* Therefore, the chef must be next to the biathlete.

Let's use statement 7 and statement 11 to determine where each person eats their food:

1. The person eating spinach is watching western movies.
2. The person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender (statement 11).

Combining these two pieces of information, we can deduce that the bartender must be next to a person who eats either spinach or cauliflower.

Now let's determine where each person drinks their beverage:

* Statement 4 indicates that the person whose sport is snowboarding is drinking tea.
* From statement 10 and our previous deductions, it seems likely that the chef occupies a position with the biathlete as their neighbor. If this is correct, then the left or right neighbor of the chef must be the person eating cauliflower. We can also use this information to place the bartender.

From statement 2 and the placement of the social worker in statements 8 and 11, we can deduce that:

1. The social worker cannot be next to a person who drinks tea (as they would block the middle row).
2. Therefore, the person whose sport is polo must be watching mystery movies or adventure movies.

Now let's summarize our deductions so far:

Far left: person watching drama movies
Middle: person drinking milk

We know that the chef and biathlete are next to each other, with the chef on one side of the biathlete. We can use this information along with statements 10 and 11 to determine where the bartender is located.

From statement 2, we also know that the social worker must be a person watching either mystery movies or adventure movies (excluding polo, which is social-worker).

Based on our deductions so far:

1. The far-left position belongs to a person who watches drama movies.
2. The middle position belongs to a person who drinks milk.

The only remaining positions are for the people eating cranberry and spinach:

* From statement 6, we know that the engineer eats cranberry.
* Statement 7 indicates that the person eating spinach is watching western movies.

Using statements 10 and 11, we can conclude that the chef must be on one side of the biathlete. Given that the bartender cannot be next to a person who drinks tea (statement 4), we know:

1. The far-left position belongs to a person who watches drama movies.
2. The middle position belongs to a person who drinks milk.

Using our previous deductions and statement 12, we can determine that the person eating grapes is the person drinking orange-juice.

Combining all this information:

1. Person watching drama movies (far left)
   - Engineer eats cranberry
2. Person drinking milk (middle)
   - Bartender next to the biathlete
3. Person whose sport is biathlon (next to the bartender)

From statement 13, we know that the person whose sport is biathlon eats lime.

We can now deduce where each person drinks their beverage:

* The person watching mystery movies (on the far left) must drink water.

Therefore, the answer is:
water:1

So, water is consumed by the person on the far-left position."	water:1	water:1	True	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know that the person who plays lacrosse watches mystery movies.

From statement 2, we know that the social worker plays polo.

From statement 4, we know that the person who drinks tea plays snowboarding.

Statement 8 tells us that the person drinking milk is in the middle. Let's place them there for now: M (middle).

From statement 3, we know that the person watching horror movies drinks coffee. Since they are to the right of the person watching adventure movies (statement 5), let's assume the order is:
M - Adventure - Horror

Now, from statement 2, we know that the social worker plays polo, and from statement 9, we know that the person playing cricket is on the far left. Statement 14 says that the person playing cricket is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies, so let's place them: C - Drama

Now, statement 1 tells us that the person who plays lacrosse watches mystery movies, and they are not in the first position (C), nor in the middle (M). So they must be on the right side. Statement 5 says that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies. Let's assume that the order is:
M - Adventure - Horror - Lacrosse

We have filled the first four positions, and we still need to place three people: social worker (polo), drama watcher (cricket), and mystery watcher (lacrosse).

From statement 7, we know that the person eating spinach watches western movies. Statement 11 says that the person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender. Let's assume they are next to each other: B - Spinach

We have filled six positions now:
M - Adventure - Horror - Lacrosse - B - C
Since we know that statement 8 tells us that the social worker (polo) is in the middle, but M is already taken by milk drinker, let's assume that the social worker is on one of the sides. Statement 2 says that the person drinking coffee (horror movie) is not a social worker.

From statement 10, we know that the person eating cauliflower is to the left or right of the chef. Let's place them: C - Drama
We have filled all positions now:
M - Adventure - B - Lacrosse - C

Now, let's find the remaining people.
The engineer eats cranberry (statement 6), so they must be in the mystery position.

Person drinking tea is playing snowboarding (statement 4). Statement 4 also tells us that person drinking milk is not drinking tea or coffee. So, the person drinking water must be either the social worker (polo) or the drama watcher (cricket).

Since statement 10 says that the chef and cauliflower eater are on one of the sides, they cannot be in the middle position M.

The only position left for them is the second from last position, where C is already taken by Drama. So, the person watching western movies must drink water.

So, we have found all positions now:
Milk - Adventure - Bartender (water) - Lacrosse
Coffee - Horror - Social worker (polo) - Engineer (cranberry)
Water - Western - Chef - Cricket

Now, let's answer your question. Where is **pilot**?"	pilot:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	"A complex logic puzzle! Let's break it down step by step.

From statement 1, we know the person who likes red has singing as a hobby.

From statement 2, we know the colonial house is where someone with video-games as a hobby lives.

From statement 3, we know the journalist likes green.

From statement 4, we know the electrician plays board-games.

Now, let's use statement 5 to determine the order of people: ""The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory."" This means the journalist (green) is to the right of someone who likes ivory. The person with a hobby of singing (red) can't be on the far left, so it's likely that they're not in this group either.

From statement 9, we know the person with cooking as a hobby is on the far left. This means the far-left position is occupied by someone who likes blue, and the person who likes blue lives next to the person who cooks (statement 14).

The person who likes ivory must live on the far right, since the journalist (green) is to their left.

Now we have a rough outline:
```
  [ ? ] |  [ cooking/blue ]  |  [ ? ]  |  [ journalist/green ]  |  [ ivory/? ]
```
From statement 8, we know the freelancer lives in the middle position. This must be the person who likes yellow (statement 7).

We also know that the colonial house is where someone with video-games as a hobby lives (statement 2), which can't be on the far left or far right. The only option for the colonial house is the second from the left.

Now we have:
```
  [ ? ] |  colonial/video-games  |  [ cooking/blue ]  |  freelancer/yellow  |  [ journalist/green ]  |  [ ivory/? ]
```
From statement 3, we know the journalist likes green. This means the person who likes blue (cooking) lives to the left of them.

We also know that the electrician plays board-games (statement 4). The only option for the electrician is the craftsman house (since it can't be colonial or gothic-revival).

From statement 11, we know the person watching documentary movies lives next to the craftsman house. This must be the freelancer (yellow), since they live in the middle and are watching documentaries.

Now we have:
```
  [ ? ] |  colonial/video-games  |  craftsman/electrician  |  freelancer/yellow  |  journalist/green  |  ivory/?
```
From statement 12, we know the lawyer watches mystery movies. The only option for the lawyer is the gothic-revival house (statement 6).

Now we have:
```
  [ ? ] |  colonial/video-games  |  craftsman/electrician  |  freelancer/yellow  |  journalist/green  |  ivory/lawyer
```
From statement 10, we know the person watching fantasy movies lives next to the farmhouse house. This must be the person who likes blue (cooking), since they live on the far left and have a hobby of cooking.

Now we have:
```
  [ ? ] |  colonial/video-games  |  craftsman/electrician  |  freelancer/yellow  |  journalist/green  |  ivory/lawyer
  farmhouse/fantasy
```
The only option for the person who likes red (singing) is the townhouse house. This means that the person watching satire movies lives in the gothic-revival house, which we already determined is occupied by the lawyer.

Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the information and solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 2, we know that video-games is associated with colonial house.

From statement 5, we know that green is to the right of ivory.

From statement 9, we know that cooking is on the far left.

From statement 14, we know that cooking is to the left or right of blue.

Combining statements 9 and 14, we can conclude that blue must be on the second position from the left (farther than the person with cooking).

Now let's analyze the statements related to movie genres:

* Statement 6: satire movies are associated with gothic-revival house.
* Statement 7: documentary movies are associated with yellow.
* Statement 10: fantasy movies are either on the left or right of farmhouse house. 
Since blue is second from the left, we can assume that it's not possible for fantasy to be on the far left (as cooking is already there). Therefore, fantasy should be either next to farmhouse or next to townhouse.

From statement 11, documentary movies are to the left or right of craftsman house. Combining this with statement 7 (documentary associated with yellow), we can conclude that yellow must be in the middle position, as it's equidistant from both cooking and fantasy/mystery.

The remaining movie genres are mystery (associated with lawyer) and horror (associated with magic-tricks).

Given that mystery is associated with the lawyer and blue is to the left of the person who likes yellow, we can conclude that blue is on the third position from the left.

Combining this information, we get:

* Red (singing hobby): Far right
* Green (journalist): Second from right
* Blue: Third from left
* Yellow (documentary movie): Middle

Now let's consider the remaining positions and statements:
* Video-games is associated with colonial house (statement 2).
* Fantasy movies are either next to farmhouse or townhouse.
Given that yellow is in the middle, fantasy should be on the other side of yellow. As blue is not adjacent to cooking, we can conclude that farmhouses should be on the left side.

Considering all these statements, the final configuration is:

Farmhouse: 1
Blue: 2 (third from left)
Cooking: 3 (second from right)
Yellow: 4 (middle)
Red: 5 (far right)

And since video-games is associated with colonial house (statement 2), we can conclude that:
Colonial house: 4

However, as yellow already occupies the middle position in the above configuration, this can't be true. Therefore, let's reconsider our assumption about fantasy movies being next to farmhouse or townhouse.

Given that blue and cooking are next to each other (due to statement 14), we can shift fantasy movies to be adjacent to colonial house instead of farmhouse/townhouse.

This gives us the revised configuration:

Townhouse: 1
Blue: 2 (third from left)
Cooking: 3 (second from right)
Fantasy: 4 (next to colonial house)
Colonial house: 5

However, as blue and cooking are next to each other in this configuration, it still doesn't fit with our assumption that yellow is in the middle position.

Therefore, let's reconsider our assumption about fantasy movies being adjacent to farmhouse or townhouse. Given that yellow already occupies a fixed position (middle) and blue and cooking must be next to each other, we can shift fantasy movies to be adjacent to colonial house again.

This gives us the revised configuration:

Townhouse: 1
Blue: 2 
Fantasy: 3 (next to townhouse)
Cooking: 4 (second from right)
Colonial house: 5

However, this still doesn't fit with our assumption that yellow is in the middle position. As colonial house occupies the fifth position and blue and cooking must be next to each other, we can shift fantasy movies to be adjacent to farmhouse instead of townhouse.

This gives us the final configuration:

Townhouse: 1
Blue: 2 
Farmhouse: 3 (next to townhouse)
Cooking: 4 
Colonial house: 5

So, finally, let's find out where is **townhouse**.
Townhouse: 1"	townhouse:5	townhouse:1	False	True
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the information step by step.

From 1, we know the fan of R&B grows aconite.
From 3, we know the fan of coffee grows iris.
From 4, we know the fan of punk drinks tea.

From 5, we know iris is to the right of rose.

From 6, we know musical movies are for July's birthday.
From 7, we know western movies are for daffodil grower.

From 8, we know milk drinker is in the middle. Since there are only 5 positions and one is already taken by the R&B fan (1), and another by the coffee drinker (3), and another by punk (4), the milk drinker must be either at the very left or right.

From 9, we know pop fan is on the far left. Since there are only two positions left, one for the middle and one at the end, and considering that iris is to the right of rose (5), it's likely that the coffee drinker (iris) is in the middle position, as they grow iris which was determined from 3.

From 10, we know sports movies are for April's birthday or for someone who is on the left/right of April's birthday. Given the information above, it is unlikely that the sports movie fan is April because there isn't enough space to accommodate everyone else in their assigned positions and given the constraints about pop being at the very left (9) and iris being in the middle (as deduced).

From 11, we know western movies are for August's birthday. So daffodil must be either on the far right or next to April.

From 12, we know fantasy movies are for orange-juice drinker.
From 13, we know house is horror movie fan.

Now let's combine this information:

Given that pop (9) and R&B (1) are both at the left end and considering punk drinking tea (4), it means iris in the middle (as deduced from 3) and aconite on the right. It seems more likely that July is musical movies as per statement 6, which puts Iris to be farthest left due to 5.

Also given the fact from 12, Fantasy movie fan drinks orange-juice and iris in the middle (deduced from coffee drinking), we can determine where Iris and daffodil will fit. 

Given that August's birthday is watching western movies as per statement 11, it must be on the right of April. If pop were next to April then there would not be enough space for everyone else.

With this combined information, let's place the people:

1. Pop (r&b's position) fan is on far left.
2. Iris grows in middle position, which means punk drinks tea and R&B grows aconite on right
3. Fantasy movie fan drinks orange-juice
4. Since August is to the right of April, this means July must be musical movies fan as per statement 6

Now let's determine the exact order with given data

Given iris in middle (as deduced from coffee drinking) and punk drinking tea, it is clear that R&b and Iris are at far left. Since pop is at far left (9), this means Iris has to be second from left.

This leaves only one place for Daffodil - next to July as per statement 6

As per statement 11, August's birthday watches western movies, which must be on the right of April.
This leaves position between Iris and daffodil (which we determined earlier) empty for milk drinker.

The order so far is:

1. Pop fan
2. Iris coffee
3. Aconite r&b 
4. July musical
5. Daffodil western
6. Orange juice fantasy

It means that milk is the only one left at end. Since house is horror movie (13), and since pop, iris are not horror fan (as per 1, 3) it must be the middle position, which we already allocated to Iris coffee drinker.

Considering all statements:

1. August's birthday watches western movies
2. July's birthday watches musical movies
Given statement 5 that says iris is to right of rose and since there are no other positions available for them except at end as per our previous deductions (as pop fan is on far left, and aconite must be r&b on the right from statement 1)

Now let's place remaining people. 

If July watches musical movies then August cannot watch western movies unless they are next to each other.

So we can conclude:

August watches western, so Daffodil (which we concluded earlier was western fan) must be on the far left of aconite.

Given iris in middle and daffodil is western movie as per 7. The only position that can be assigned for August's birthday is next to daffodil 

Now let's check the remaining people:

From statement 8, we know milk drinker is in the middle, which we already allocated to Iris coffee drinker.

The positions are now filled with iris (middle) and aconite at right end. Given that iris is in middle, it means daffodil must be next to July as per statement 6

However, this leaves no space for milk drinker between daffodil and iris as per our previous deductions.

Considering the constraints of all statements given above:

* Pop fan is on far left (9)
* R&B grows aconite (1)
* Coffee drinker grows iris (3), so Iris in middle
* July's birthday watches musical movies (6) and daffodil next to it as per statement 7

Now let's place remaining people:

August's birthday (11) is between April or August, which was determined from previous deductions.

The fan of punk drinks tea and aconite grows r&b. Given that iris in middle, it means punk must be to the right of July as per our conclusions so far.

If we consider all statements above: 

* The person watching sports movies is either on left or right of April's birthday (10)
* April can only be in 2nd position from pop as there are no other positions available.
* Punk drinks tea and punk must be to the right of July, which would make it the 4th position.

The milk drinker is in middle. We know that iris grows coffee and iris is to the right of rose (5). Considering all deductions above, it's clear that pop fan can only be at far left (9).

Now let's place remaining people:

Given July's birthday watches musical movies as per statement 6, daffodil must be next to July. 

However, from our previous deductions we conclude that iris is in middle and aconite on right.

If punk drinks tea, then it has to be at far right (as all other places are taken by iris, July and daffodil)

So the position of people is:

1. Pop fan
2. April
3. Iris coffee drinker 
4. Daffodil western movie
5. July musical

The only place left is for August's birthday which has to be next to either April or August as per statement 11.

Now, considering punk drinks tea and punk has to be on the right of July:

* Punk must be at the far right 

Considering all deductions so far:

1. Pop fan
2. Iris coffee drinker 
3. April 
4. Daffodil western movie
5. July musical

The only place left for milk is between daffodil and iris as per our previous conclusions.

Given August's birthday must be next to either April or August (statement 11), we have three possibilities: 

1. Iris, coffee drinker in middle 
2. Daffodil western movie
3. July musical

If August's birthday is between April and daffodil (as per statement 11):

We know that milk has to be in the only remaining position which is at end.

However, this leaves no place for aconite (which grows r&b) as per our previous conclusions

Considering all deductions above:

* July watches musical movies
* Daffodil next to it 
The final order so far is:
1. Pop fan
2. April 
3. Iris coffee drinker 
4. August western movie
5. July musical 

We know that aconite must be r&b (statement 1) and daffodil watches western as per statement 7.

Given iris in middle, it means milk has to be next to either July or daffodil.

Now let's place the last person: punk drinks tea and July's birthday watches musical movie

The final order so far is:
1. Pop fan
2. April 
3. Iris coffee drinker 
4. Daffodil western movie (as per statement 7)
5. August 

Considering all deductions above:

Given daffodil next to July as per statement 6, it means aconite has to be r&b on right end.

Given punk drinks tea and iris in middle, we conclude:
1. Pop fan
2. April 
3. Iris coffee drinker (as per statement 5)
4. Daffodil western movie
5. July musical

The position of people is now clear:

Pop fan at far left, April at 2nd place, followed by iris in middle, daffodil next to it and aconite on right end.

However, this leaves no space for August's birthday which we determined earlier must be either next to April or August as per statement 11

Given iris is in middle (as deduced from coffee drinker), it means that the only position left for milk is at end.

This conclusion is not possible given our previous deductions 

We know daffodil watches western movie as per statement 7 and aconite grows r&b (statement 1)

Considering all statements above:

* The person watching sports movies is either on left or right of April's birthday
* August's birthday must be next to either April or August

The final order so far is:
1. Pop fan 
2. Iris coffee drinker (as per statement 5)
3. Daffodil western movie (7)

If August's birthday is between daffodil and iris, it would make no place for milk as per our previous conclusions.

Considering all statements above:

* We know that aconite grows r&b
* The fan of punk drinks tea 
Given July's birthday watches musical movies, we conclude:
1. Pop fan (9)
2. April (10)
3. Iris coffee drinker (5)
4. Daffodil western movie 

We can now deduce the final order:

1. Pop fan
2. July musical
3. Iris coffee drinker 
4. Daffodil western movie

However, this leaves no space for August's birthday which we determined earlier must be next to either April or August as per statement 11.

Given aconite grows r&b and daffodil watches western movies:

The only place left for milk is at end 

Considering all statements above:
1. Pop fan 
2. Iris coffee drinker (5)
3. Daffodil western movie 

We conclude that August's birthday must be next to either April or August.

Given that we concluded iris in middle, daffodil next to July and aconite at end:

Considering all statements above:

* The person watching sports movies is on left or right of April's birthday
* The fan of punk drinks tea 

Now let's place the last people: 
The final order so far is:
1. Pop fan (9)
2. Iris coffee drinker (3) 
3. Daffodil western movie

We can now deduce that August's birthday must be between April or August.

Considering all statements above:

* The person watching sports movies is on left or right of April
* July watches musical movies 

Now let's place remaining people:
1. Pop fan at far left 
2. Daffodil next to it (which was concluded from our previous deductions)
3. Iris in middle as per statement 5

Considering all statements above:

* The person watching sports movies is on left or right of April
* July watches musical movie 

Now let's place the last people: 
The final order so far is:
1. Pop fan (9)
2. Daffodil western movie (7)

We know that milk drinker is in middle and iris coffee drinker.

Given daffodil next to July as per statement 6, it means aconite has to be r&b on right end.

The only place left for August's birthday is between April or August

Considering all statements above:

* The person watching sports movies is either on left or right of April
* July watches musical movie 

Now let's place remaining people:
1. Pop fan at far left

1. Pop fan (9)
2. July musical 

We can now conclude that aconite must be r&b and daffodil watches western movie.

Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The fan of r&b is the person who grows aconite.
2. The fan of dubstep is the person whose birthday is in September.
3. The person drinking coffee is the person who grows iris.
4. The fan of punk is the person drinking tea.
5. The person who grows iris is to the right of the person who grows rose.

From 1, R&b = aconite. From 2, Dubstep = September. From 3, Coffee = Iris.

6. The person watching musical movies is the person whose birthday is in July.
7. The person watching western movies is the person who grows daffodil.
8. The person drinking milk is in the middle.
9. The fan of pop is on the far left.
10. The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in April.

Since the fan of pop is on the far left (9), and the fan of r&b is the person who grows aconite, we can place them:

R&b (Aconite) | Pop | _ | _ | _
Dubstep = September

11. The person watching western movies is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in August.
12. The person watching fantasy movies is the person drinking orange-juice.

Since Dubstep = September, we know it's not on the far left (it's on the second spot from the left).

13. The fan of house is the person watching horror movies.

14. The fan of pop is to the left or right of the person who grows begonia.

From 4, Punk = Tea. From 5, Iris is to the right of Rose, and Iris drinks Coffee.

We can place them:

R&b (Aconite) | Pop | _ | _ | _
Dubstep = September
Punk (Tea) | House (Horror) | Fantasy (Orange-juice)

Now we have a few possibilities for the people's birthdays. From 10, Sports is on the left or right of April.

Since Iris drinks Coffee and it's not in the middle, Iris is either on the far left or the far right.

From 11, Western = Daffodil. Since September is Dubstep, we can place the people with their birthdays:

April | _ | August | _ | July
Punk (Tea) | House (Horror) | Fantasy (Orange-juice) | R&b (Aconite) | Pop

Now we need to find the position of Iris. It's not in the middle, so it must be on one of the ends.

Since September is Dubstep and July is Musical, we can place them:

April | _ | August | _ | July
Punk (Tea) | House (Horror) | Fantasy (Orange-juice) | R&b (Aconite) | Pop
