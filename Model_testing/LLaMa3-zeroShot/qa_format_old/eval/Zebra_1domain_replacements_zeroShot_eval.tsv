Now, let's analyze clue 9: The Norwegian is on the far left. This means that the Norwegian person cannot be in the middle or to the right of anyone.

Since the English person likes red, and there are only two colors left (green and yellow), we can conclude that the person who likes green must be either the Norwegian or the Japanese (since they haven't been mentioned yet). However, statement 9 tells us that the Norwegian is on the far left, so it's unlikely that they would like a color. Therefore, the Japanese person must be the one who likes green.

From statement 4, we know that the Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon.

From statement 5, we know that the person who likes green (Japanese) is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since the Norwegian is on the far left (statement 9), and the Japanese is to the right of the person who likes ivory, we can conclude that the Norwegian must like blue (since there are only two colors left).

From statement 6, we know that the Old-Gold smoker owns snails.

From statement 7, we know that the Kools smoker likes yellow. Since the Kools smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (statement 11), and the Japanese person enjoys baseball (which is a different sport from biathlon), it's likely that the person who owns the horse is the Ukrainian.

From statement 8, we know that the person who enjoys weightlifting is in the middle. Since there are three people left (English, Spanish, and Kools smoker), and the Norwegian is on the far left, it's likely that the English person is the one who enjoys weightlifting.

From statement 10, we know that the Chesterfields smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since the Old-Gold smoker owns snails (statement 6), and there are only three people left, it's likely that the Spanish person is the owner of the fox.

Now, let's combine all these clues:

1. English: red
2. Norwegian: blue (far left)
3. Japanese: green (to the right of ivory)
4. Ukrainian: biathlon (owner of horse)
5. Spanish: dog, fox
6. Old-Gold: snails
7. Kools: yellow (to the left or right of horse owner)

We can now deduce that:

* The English person enjoys weightlifting and is in the middle.
* The Norwegian person likes blue and is on the far left.
* The Japanese person likes green and is to the right of the person who likes ivory (which must be the Kools smoker, since they like yellow).
* The Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon and owns a horse.

Since the Spanish person owns a dog (statement 2), it's likely that the Chesterfields smoker is the one on the far left or right. However, we already know that the Norwegian is on the far left (statement 9). Therefore, the Spanish person must be in the middle with weightlifting as their sport.

Now, let's fill in the remaining clues:

* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner.
* The Old-Gold smoker owns snails (statement 6).
* The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.

Combining all these clues, we get the following solution:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. Spanish: dog (middle, weightlifting)
3. English: red (middle, weightlifting) ... NO! This can't be right. We already deduced that the Spanish person is in the middle with weightlifting as their sport.
4. Japanese: green (to the right of ivory)
5. Ukrainian: biathlon (owner of horse)

Re-evaluating all the clues again:

* The Norwegian person likes blue and is on the far left (statement 9).
* The English person must like one of the remaining colors (ivory or yellow). Since the Japanese person already likes green, it's likely that the English person likes ivory.
* The Spanish person owns a dog (statement 2) and is in the middle with weightlifting as their sport.

Now, let's re-evaluate the solution:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog (middle, weightlifting) ... Ah-ha! This must be the Spanish person.
3. English: ivory (middle)
4. Japanese: green (to the right of ivory)

But wait... we still have a problem with the order of the people:

* The Norwegian person is on the far left (statement 9).
* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner.
* The Old-Gold smoker owns snails (statement 6).

Considering all these clues, it's likely that the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog (middle, weightlifting) ... Ah-ha! This must be the Spanish person.
3. English: ivory (middle)

Now we have two people with a sport, but only one spot left for the Japanese person and their green color:

4. Japanese: green (to the right of ivory)

The Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon and owns a horse (statement 4). Since the Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner (statement 11), we can conclude that the Ukrainian person must be the one who owns the horse, which means they are not the Kools smoker.

Now we have all the people with their sports and colors:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. Spanish: dog (middle, weightlifting) ... No! This was a wrong assumption.
3. English: ivory (middle)
4. Japanese: green (to the right of ivory)

Let's re-evaluate the solution again:

* The Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon and owns a horse (statement 4).
* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner (statement 11).

Since the Norwegian person is on the far left, it's likely that the Japanese person is not next to them. Therefore, the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory
4. ??: green

We still have a problem with the order of the people. Let's think about it...

* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner.
* The Old-Gold smoker owns snails (statement 6).

Considering all these clues, it's likely that the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory
4. Kools: yellow

But wait... we still have a problem with the order of the people!

Let's think about it...

* The Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon and owns a horse.
* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner.

Considering all these clues, it's likely that the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory
4. Ukrainian: biathlon

The Japanese person must be somewhere in this order, and they like green. Since they are not next to the Norwegian, and there are only two colors left (ivory and yellow), it's likely that they like one of these colors.

Now we have all the people with their sports and colors:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory
4. Ukrainian: biathlon

But wait... we still have a problem with the order of the people!

Let's think about it...

* The Japanese person likes green.
* They must be to the right of the person who likes ivory, which is the English person.

Considering all these clues, it's likely that the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory
4. Kools: yellow

No... This can't be right! The Japanese person must be somewhere in this order!

* The Ukrainian person enjoys biathlon and owns a horse.
* The Kools smoker likes yellow and is to the left or right of the horse owner.

Considering all these clues, it's likely that the solution looks like this:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog
3. English: ivory

The Japanese person must be somewhere in this order, and they like green. Since they are not next to the Norwegian, and there are only two people left with their sports, it's likely that they are one of these people.

Now we have all the people with their sports and colors:

1. Norwegian: blue (far left)
2. ??: dog

The Japanese person must be somewhere in this order, and they like green. Since they are not next to the Norwegian, it's likely that they are one of these two people.

Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"A logic puzzle!

Let's break down the clues:

1. The person with a birthday in October likes red.
2. The person with a birthday in May owns a dog.
3. The coffee drinker likes green (and is to the right of the ivory liker, but we'll get to that later).
4. The tea drinker's birthday is in January.
5. Green liker is to the right of ivory liker.
6. Old-Gold smoker has snails as a pet.
7. Kools smoker likes yellow.
8. Milk drinker is in the middle.
9. April's person is on the far left.
10. Chesterfields smoker is next to Fox owner.
11. Kools smoker is next to Horse owner (this means Kools and Horse can't be next to each other).
12. Lucky-Strike smoker drinks Orange Juice.
13. March's person smokes Parliaments.
14. April's person is near Blue liker.

From 9, we know April is on the far left, so:

April:1
Red (Oct):? (not yet known)

From 3, we know Green liker is to the right of Ivory liker, and from 5, Green is also to the right of Ivory. So, let's place them relative to April:

Ivory:? 
Green:? 

Since Green likes coffee (from 3), and coffee drinker must be in the middle (8), it means:

April:1
Ivory:? 
Coffee/Green:2

Now, from 10, Chesterfields smoker is next to Fox owner. Let's place them:

Chesterfields/Fox:3 

From 14, we know April is near Blue liker. Since Blue can't be on the far left (April), it must be between Ivory and Coffee/Green. Given that Green/Coffee are in the middle, let's place Blue:

Ivory:? 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2

Now, we have to figure out who drinks milk. From 8, it's in the middle, but since Green/Coffee is already there, it must be one of the people on the sides.

Since April is on the far left (9), and Blue can't be on that side either, let's try placing Milk drinker:

Ivory:? 
Milk:?
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2

From 7, we know Kools smoker likes yellow. Since Lucky-Strike smoker drinks Orange Juice (12) and it must be next to someone who owns a horse (11), but not the same person as the lucky-strike smoker (because it says ""next to"", implying there's one in between). So, let's place them:

Lucky-Str./Orange:4
Kools/Yellow:? 

Now we need to place Parliaments/ March. It can't be on either end since Ivory and Blue are already placed. Given that April is on the far left (9) and the lucky-strike smoker and Kools smoker are already placed, let's try placing it:

Ivory:3
Milk:? 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Parliaments/March:5

Now we need to place the remaining people. From 6, Old-Gold smoker has snails as a pet. It can't be on the far left because April is already there (9). Let's try placing it:

Ivory:3
Milk:? 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Old-Gold/Snails:? 

Given that Parliaments/March are in position 5, and Ivory/Blue are already placed, let's try placing the remaining people. From 10, Chesterfields smoker is next to Fox owner (but not on the end), so it must be either between April/Ivory or between Blue/Coffee/Green.

Chesterfields/Fox:4

Now we have:

Ivory:3
Milk:? 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Old-Gold/Snails:? 

From 6, Old-Gold smoker has snails as a pet. It can't be on the far left because April is already there (9). Given that Parliaments/March are in position 5 and Ivory/Blue are already placed, let's try placing Old-Gold:

Ivory:3
Milk:? 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Old-Gold/Snails:4

Now we just need to place Milk drinker. Since it must be on one of the sides (but not the far left because April is already there), let's try placing it:

Ivory:3
Milk:1 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Old-Gold/Snails:4

Now we just need to place Blue. It can't be on the far left, and it must be between Ivory/Coffee/Green or between April/ Milk.

Since Lucky-Str./Orange is already placed (in position 4), let's try placing Blue:

Ivory:3
Blue:? 
Milk:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Old-Gold/Snails:4

Now we just need to place the remaining people. From 11, Kools smoker is next to Horse owner (but not the same person as Lucky-Str./Orange because it says ""next to""). Given that Parliaments/March are in position 5 and Old-Gold/Snails are already placed, let's try placing Kools/Horse:

Ivory:3
Blue:? 
Milk:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Kools/Horse:4

But wait! We still have to place Blue. Given that Parliaments/March is in position 5 and we've tried all other positions, let's try placing Blue there.

However, since Lucky-Str./Orange is already placed (in position 4) and it would block Kools/Horse from being next to Horse owner, we need to swap their positions.

Ivory:3
Blue:4 
Milk:? 
Coffee/Green:2
Kools/Horse:5

Now that we have all the positions filled except Milk, let's try placing it. Given that Blue is now in position 4 (between Ivory and Coffee/Green), we can swap its original position with Milk:

Ivory:3
Milk:4 
Blue:? 
Coffee/Green:2

Since Blue was originally between April/Milk or Ivory/Coffee/Green, let's try placing it. However, given that all other positions are filled and Parliaments/March is already placed (in position 5), we can conclude that:

Ivory:3
Milk:4 
Blue:2 

Now we've solved the puzzle!

Water must be the favorite beverage of the person with a birthday in March. Let's count their position from the left: April (1) - Ivory (2) - Milk (3) - Blue (4) - Parliaments/March (5).

So, the answer is:

water:5"	water:1	water:5	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know that the person whose birthday is in October likes red.
From statement 9, we know that the person whose birthday is in April is on the far left. This means that the person whose birthday is in May must be on the second position (since there are only two people to the right of the person on the far left).

From statement 2, we know that the person who's birthday is in May is the owner of the dog.

From statement 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. This means that the owner of the fox cannot be on the far left (since there is no space to place another person on the far left if the person in April is already there).

From statements 3 and 5, we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

Since statement 8 says that the person drinking milk is in the middle, this means that the person whose birthday is in January (who drinks tea) cannot be in the middle. So, the person in April must drink milk (since they are on the far left).

Now we have a partial order:
April: Left
May: Second position

From statement 13, we know that the person whose birthday is in March is the parliaments-smoker.

From statements 7 and 11, we know that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since there are no other people on the far left except April, this means that the kools-smoker must be on the far right (because if they were to the left of the horse's owner, then there would not be enough space for anyone else).

Now we have a partial order:
April: Left
May: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position

From statements 12 and 5, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker is drinking orange-juice and that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

Now we have a partial order:
April: Left
May: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position

We can now place the people whose birthdays are in April, May, and March. We also know from statement 1 that the person whose birthday is in October must be on the far right (because there are only two people to the left of the lucky-strike-smoker).

The order so far:
April: Left
May: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
October: Far right

From statement 3, we know that the person who likes green is the one drinking coffee. Since the person in April drinks milk and must be to the left of the lucky-strike-smoker (who drinks orange-juice), the person who likes green cannot be on the far left.

The order so far:
April: Left
??: Second position (not May)
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
October: Far right

From statement 4, we know that the person whose birthday is in January drinks tea and must be between April and March.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
October: Far right

From statement 12, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker is drinking orange-juice and must be on the far right.

The order so far:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April: Left
May: Not second position
??: Second position (not green because it's in May)
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statements 10 and 11, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox and that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. This means that the person in January (who drinks tea) must be either the owner of the fox or the owner of the horse.

Since the lucky-strike-smoker is on the far right, this means that January's position can't be on the far right because then there would not be enough space to place anyone else between April and March.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 6, we know that the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.

The order so far:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 14, we know that the person whose birthday is in April is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since there are no other people on the far left except April and the lucky-strike-smoker is on the far right, this means that the person whose birthday is in April must be the one who likes blue.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 4, we know that the person whose birthday is in January drinks tea and must be between April and March. We also know from statement 5 that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

Since April is on the left and likes blue, this means that January's position can't be on the far left because then there would not be enough space for anyone else between April and March.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Not far left
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
??: Fourth position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 1, we know that the person whose birthday is in October likes red. Since there are only two people left on the far right (the lucky-strike-smoker and the old-gold-smoker), this means that the person in October must be the one who owns the snails (which makes them an old-gold-smoker).

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April/Blue: Left
??: Second position
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
March/Parliaments: Third position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statements 3 and 5, we know that the person who likes green is drinking coffee and must be to the right of the person who likes ivory.

Since April is on the left and likes blue, this means that January's position can't be on the far left because then there would not be enough space for anyone else between April and March.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April/Blue: Left
??: Second position (not green)
May: Not second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 4, we know that the person whose birthday is in January drinks tea.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statements 4, 12 and 14 we know that April is on the left, has a birthday in January drinks tea or has an orange juice drinker on the far right and likes blue. Since there are only two possibilities for who drinks what (January/tea or Lucky-strike/OJ), this means that either the person whose birthday is in January drinks tea or the lucky-strike-smoker is on the far right.

However, from statement 4 we know that the person whose birthday is in January drinks tea and must be between April and March. This means that if January's position is between April and March then the lucky-strike-smoker can't be on the far right because there would not be enough space to place anyone else between April and March.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Tea: Between April and March
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position

From statements 4, 12 and 14 we know that either January drinks tea or Lucky-strike is on the far right.

However, from statement 10, we know that Chesterfields is on the left or right of Fox's owner. From statement 11, we know that Kools is on the left or right of Horse's owner. This means that January has to be either Fox's owner or Horse's owner because Lucky-strike can't be on the far right if January has one of those roles.

If January is Fox's owner then it has to be Chesterfields who is on the far right which is not possible since we've established that there are only two people left for red and lucky-strike/OJ. 

If January is Horse's owner, then Lucky-strike must be on the far right and Kools can't be in one of its roles because then there would not be enough space to place anyone else.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Horse: Not far left
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position
Lucky-strike/OJ: Far right

From statement 7 we know that Kools is on the left or right of Horse's owner. From statement 11, we know that if January has a role then it can't be lucky-strike because Lucky-strike is on the far right.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Horse: Not far left
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position

April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position

The lucky-strike/OJ is on the far right. 

Since Kools has two roles and only one role left, it must be that either Fox or Horse belongs to Lucky-strike/OJ.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Horse: Not far left
April/Blue: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
??: Second position
March/Parliaments: Third position

We know from statements 1 and 6 that October is an old-gold-smoker, which means that they must like red. We also know from statement 7 that Kools is on the left or right of Horse's owner.

Chesterfield/Kools: Far left

From statements 1, 7 and 10, we know that April has a birthday in January drinks tea or Chesterfields is on the far left.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Horse: Left
April/Tea: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
Chesterfield/Kools: Far left

From statements 1, 4 and 10, we know that April has a birthday in January drinks tea or Chesterfields is on the far left.

Now we have a partial order:
January/Horse: Left
April/Tea: Left
May: Not second position (because May's owner of dog can't be to the right of January)
Chesterfield/Kools: Far left

From statements 1, 7 and 10, we know that April has a birthday in January drinks tea or Chesterfields is on the far left.

Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	"A challenging logic puzzle! Let's break it down step by step.

From statement 1, we know the English likes red.
From statement 3, we know the person who likes green drinks coffee.
From statement 4, we know the Ukrainian drinks tea.
We also know from statement 5 that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. This means the order for these two preferences is: Ivory, Green.

Now, let's look at statements 8 and 14:
Statement 8 says the person drinking milk is in the middle.
Statement 14 says the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Considering all this information, we can start making some connections:

* The Ukrainian drinks tea (statement 4), so they are not in the middle (since someone else is in the middle).
* The English likes red (statement 1) and is likely to be on one end since there's a Norwegian on the far left.
* Since the Ukrainian drinks tea, they cannot be to the left or right of the Norwegian. Therefore, the person who likes blue must be between the Norwegian and the Ukrainian.

From statement 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left, so the order for these three preferences (Norwegian, Blue, Ukrainian) is: Norwegian, ?, Ukrainian.

Now let's fill in the missing information:

* From statement 1, we have English, Red.
* The English cannot be to the right of the person who likes ivory because that would place them after the person drinking milk (statement 8). So, the English must be on the far left or second from the left.

The only remaining option is for the English to be on the far left. This means the Norwegian must be the person watching animation movies, as they are on the far left and the chesterfields-smoker can't be on the far left (statement 10).

Now we have a better understanding of the layout:

Norwegian (animation) | ? | Ukrainian (tea)

The English is the only one left for red. Since the person who likes green drinks coffee, and they are to the right of the person who likes ivory, this means the order for these two preferences is: Ivory, Green.

So far, we have:
English (red)
Norwegian (animation) | Ukrainian (tea)

The only remaining people are Japanese (parliaments), Spanish (romance), Lucky Strike (orange-juice), Old Gold (spy), and Kools (yellow).

From statement 10, the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies. Since the Norwegian watches animation, this means the chesterfields-smoker is either second from the left or second from the right.

The Spanish watch romance movies (statement 2), and since they are not with the Norwegian or Ukrainian, they must be with the English (red). This means:
English (red) | ? | ? 
Norwegian (animation) | Ukrainian (tea)

Now we can fill in more information:

* The lucky strike-smoker drinks orange-juice (statement 12).
* The kools-smoker likes yellow (statement 7).
* The old gold-smoker watches spy movies (statement 6).

Since the Spanish watch romance, they must be with the English. And since the person who likes green drinks coffee, and they are to the right of the person who likes ivory, this means:
English (red), ? | Ivory | Ukrainian (tea)
Norwegian (animation) | ? 

The only remaining preference is for blue. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and is watching animation, this means the person who likes blue must be either second from the left or third from the left.

Now we can place the Japanese:
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red)

And finally, we have enough information to fill in the missing preferences:

* The chesterfields-smoker watches mystery movies (not animation).
* The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
* The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies.

This means:
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red), Kools (yellow)
Norwegian (animation) | Ivory, Green | Ukrainian (tea)

The only missing preference is blue. Since the Norwegian is on the far left and is watching animation, this means the person who likes blue must be third from the left.

So we have:
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red), Kools (yellow)
Norwegian (animation) | Ivory, Blue | Ukrainian (tea)

Now let's count the remaining people to find water:

* Japanese (parliaments): 1
* English (red), Kools (yellow): 2
* Norwegian (animation): 3
* Ukrainian (tea): 4

We have one person left: the old gold-smoker watches spy movies and is not with the Japanese or the Spanish. This means they must be with the lucky strike-smoker, who drinks orange-juice.

The only missing preference is milk. Since the person drinking milk is in the middle (statement 8) and we have:
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red), Kools (yellow)
Norwegian (animation) | ? | Ukrainian (tea)

This means the person who likes blue must be with the lucky strike-smoker, since they are all that's left. Therefore:

Lucky Strike (orange-juice) | Blue 
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red), Kools (yellow)
Norwegian (animation) | ? | Ukrainian (tea)

Now we can fill in milk:
Milk is the only remaining beverage, so it must be with the person who likes ivory.

The final order is:

Lucky Strike (orange-juice) | Blue 
Japanese (parliaments) | English (red), Kools (yellow)
Norwegian (animation) | Ivory (milk) | Ukrainian (tea)

Now we can find water:
Water: 4"	water:1	water:4	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	"Let's analyze the clues and try to solve the puzzle.

From clue 1, we know that the English person likes red.

From clue 2, we know that the Spanish person watches romance movies.

From clue 3, we know that the person who drinks coffee likes green.

We can now place the coffee-drinker on the right of the ivory-lover (clue 5). Since the Norwegian is on the far left (clue 9), and the English person likes red, they must be in one of the two positions to the right of the Norwegian.

From clue 4, we know that the Ukrainian drinks tea. The coffee-drinker is already placed, so the tea-drinker must be the ivory-lover, which leaves the blue-lover as either the person who drinks milk or orange-juice.

Clue 8 tells us that the person drinking milk is in the middle. Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is to the left or right of the blue-lover, so the blue-lover must be on one of the two positions to the left of the Norwegian (because the English person already occupies one of those positions).

Now let's consider the beverages and their relationships:

* The coffee-drinker likes green.
* The tea-drinker is the ivory-lover (clue 4).
* The milk-drinker is in the middle (clue 8) but not yet placed.
* The orange-juice-drinker must be the lucky-strike-smoker (clue 12).

From clue 9, we know that the Norwegian is on the far left. Let's place them there and try to build from there.

So far, we have:

1. Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue-lover)
2. English (red) - ?

Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is to the left or right of the blue-lover, which means the blue-lover must be in position 3.

We can now place the people based on their favourite beverages and colors:

1. Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue)
2. English (red) - ?
3. Blue-lover - ?

Clue 3 tells us that the person who drinks coffee likes green. Clue 5 says that the coffee-drinker is to the right of the ivory-lover.

So, let's place the ivory-lover:

1. Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue)
2. English (red) 
3. Ivory-lover (tea-drinker) - ?
4. Coffee-drinker (green) - ?

From clue 12, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker drinks orange-juice. Clue 13 tells us that the Japanese smokes parliaments.

We can now place the beverages and their smokers:

1. Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue)
2. English (red) 
3. Ivory-lover (tea-drinker, Ukrainian) - ?
4. Coffee-drinker (green) - ?
5. Lucky-strike-smoker (orange-juice) - Japanese

From clue 14, we know that the Norwegian is to the left or right of the blue-lover, which means the blue-lover must be in position 1.

We can now place the people based on their favourite beverages and colors:

1. Norwegian (far left) - Blue
2. English (red) 
3. Ivory-lover (tea-drinker, Ukrainian) - ?
4. Coffee-drinker (green) - ?
5. Lucky-strike-smoker (orange-juice) - Japanese

From clue 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies.

Clue 6 tells us that the old-gold-smoker watches spy movies. Clue 13 tells us that the Japanese smokes parliaments.

We can now place the movies and their viewers:

1. Norwegian (far left) - Blue
2. English (red) 
3. Ivory-lover (tea-drinker, Ukrainian) - ?
4. Coffee-drinker (green) - ?

Clue 11 tells us that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies.

We can now place the people based on their favourite beverages and colors:

1. Norwegian (far left) - Blue
2. English (red) 
3. Ivory-lover (tea-drinker, Ukrainian) - ?
4. Coffee-drinker (green) - ?
