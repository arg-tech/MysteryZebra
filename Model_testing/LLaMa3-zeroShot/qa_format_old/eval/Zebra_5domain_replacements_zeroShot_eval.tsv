From statement 5, we know that the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot.

From statement 3, we know that the person playing go is the person eating zucchini.

So, the order for the people eating these two foods is: carrot, then zucchini (who plays go).

Now, from statement 7, we know that the victorian house is the person eating radish. This means that the person eating radish must be to the left of the person eating zucchini.

From statement 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating onion. Since there are only three people mentioned so far (carrot, zucchini, and radish), the person eating onion cannot be any of these three.

From statement 6, we know that the colonial house is the person who grows bellflower. This means that the colonial house must be to the right of the person eating radish (victorian).

Now, from statement 12, we know that the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg. Since there are only five people and two houses already mentioned (colonial and victorian), the townhouse house must be one of these three.

From statement 14, we know that the fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. But from statement 9, we know that the fan of electronic is on the far left. This means that the person eating lettuce cannot be on the far left (since they would block the fan of electronic).

From statement 11, we know that the victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid.

The possible order for the people so far is:
1. fan of electronic (let's call them E)
2. victorian (who eats radish and lives in a victorian house)

But if the victorian house is on the far left, then it would block the fan of electronic from being on the far left.

So, the victorian house must be to the right of person 1. The only position available for the victorian house (given that the colonial and townhouse are already taken) is in between the first two positions:
 
1. E
2. victorian (who eats radish)
3. ??

From statement 14, we know that the fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce.

The only position available for the person eating lettuce is in the third position (given the constraints so far):
 
1. E (fan of electronic)  
2. victorian
3. person eating lettuce

Now, from statement 13, we know that the fan of trance is the futuristic house. But since there are only five houses and two already mentioned (victorian and colonial), the futuristic house must be one of these three.

From statement 12, we know that the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg. And from statement 10, we know that the gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.

The only position available for the gothic-revival house (given the constraints so far) is in the fourth position:
 
1. E
2. victorian
3. person eating lettuce
4. gothic-revival

But if the gothic-revival house is on the left of the person growing marigold, then it would block the townhouse from being to their right.

So, the gothic-revival house must be to the right of the person growing marigold.

The only position available for the gothic-revival house (given the constraints so far) is in the fifth position:
 
1. E
2. victorian
3. person eating lettuce
4. ??
5. gothic-revival

But this would block the futuristic house from being on the right.

So, the gothic-revival house must be to the left of the person growing marigold.
 
Now, let's consider statement 10 again: ""the gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold"".

If it's to the right, then the colonial and townhouse would block the futuristic from being on the far left. So, it must be to the left.

Given this constraint, we can see that the only position available for the gothic-revival house is in the second or fifth position:
 
1. E
2. ??
3. person eating lettuce
4. ??
5. ??

But if the gothic-revival house is in the second position, then it would block the townhouse from being to its right.

So, the gothic-revival house must be on the far left (fifth position).
 
1. E (fan of electronic)
2. victorian
3. person eating lettuce
4. ??
5. gothic-revival

Now, let's use statement 12: ""the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg"".

Given the constraints so far, the only position available for the townhouse is in the fourth position:
 
1. E (fan of electronic)
2. victorian
3. person eating lettuce
4. townhouse
5. gothic-revival

Now we can use statement 6: ""the colonial house is the person who grows bellflower"".

Given the constraints so far, the only position available for the colonial house is in the third position:
 
1. E (fan of electronic)
2. victorian
3. colonial (who grows bellflower)
4. townhouse
5. gothic-revival

Now we can use statement 7: ""the victorian house is the person eating radish"".

2. victorian (who eats radish)
3. ??
4. person eating lettuce

Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the given clues and solve the puzzle.

From clue 5, we know that the person playing go (clue 3) is to the right of the person eating carrot. Since there are only two people eating carrot or zucchini, we can infer that the order is:
* Person eating radish (clue 7)
* Person eating zucchini
* Person eating carrot

From clue 12, we know that the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg.

From clues 9 and 14, we know that the fan of electronic is on the far left and to the left or right of the person eating lettuce. This implies that the person eating lettuce is either next to the person who likes electronic or one position away.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of pop is the person growing azalea (clue 6) and lives in a colonial house. Since there are two people on the left in clues 1 and 9, it's likely that the person growing azalea is at the far left or one position away from the person who likes electronic.

From clue 10, we know that the gothic-revival house is to the left or right of the person growing marigold. Since the townhouse is occupied by mah-jongg (clue 12), it's likely that the person growing marigold lives in a futuristic house (clue 13).

From clue 11, we know that the victorian house is to the left or right of the person growing orchid.

Since there are only two people left on the far end, let's place them first. From clues 9 and 14, we can conclude that the fan of electronic lives in a futuristic house (clue 13), which is also occupied by the fan of trance (clue 13).

From clue 2, we know that the person growing azalea lives in a colonial house. Since there are only two people left on the far end, it's likely that the person growing azalea lives to the right of the fan of electronic.

Now let's fill in the blanks:

* Futuristic (trance/electronic) house: ? 
	+ Person eating lettuce
* Colonial (pop/azalea): ?
	+ Person to the left of the fan of electronic
* Townhouse (mah-jongg): ?
	+ Person growing marigold
* Victorian: ?
	+ Person growing orchid

From clue 7, we know that the victorian house is occupied by the person eating radish. Since there are two people on the right (go and domino), it's likely that the person eating radish lives to the left of go.

We can now conclude the order:

* Person eating lettuce
	+ Futuristic house
* Person growing orchid
	+ Victorian house
* Person eating radish
	+ Victorian house
* Person playing domino (techno)
	+ To the right of the person eating radish
* Person playing go (zucchini)
	+ To the right of the person playing domino

The remaining people are:
* Colonial: ?
	+ Person to the left of the fan of electronic
* Townhouse: ?
	+ Person growing marigold
* Gothic-revival: ?
	+ On the left or right of the person growing marigold

From clue 10, we know that the gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person growing marigold. Since the townhouse is occupied by mah-jongg (clue 12), it's likely that the person growing marigold lives in a futuristic house (not possible) or to the right of mah-jongg.

The only position left for the colonial house is between the victorian and gothic-revival houses. This implies that the fan of electronic (futuristic) and the person growing azalea (colonial) are one position away from each other.

Now, let's assign the remaining people:

* Person eating onion
	+ Indie (clue 1)
	+ To the left of gothic-revival
* Person playing mah-jongg
	+ Townhouse (clue 12)
	+ On the right of person growing marigold
* Person growing marigold
	+ Mah-jongg's left neighbor
* Person living in a gothic-revival house
	+ To the left or right of the person growing marigold

The last clue (8) states that the person playing monopoly is in the middle. Since there are only two positions left, it's likely that the person eating zucchini is either next to the person who likes indie or one position away.

From clues 1 and 3, we know that the fan of indie lives next to the person eating onion (clue 5), which means that the fan of indie is the first position on the left. This also implies that the person playing go is either the second or third position from the right.

The only person who can be in the middle and have a neighbor on both sides is the one living in a townhouse. Therefore, we assign:

* Person eating onion
	+ Indie (clue 1)
	+ Go: Far left (clue 9) + Townhouse: Middle (clue 8)

Now that we have assigned all the people, let's fill in the blanks.

The final order is:
1. Onion (indie): Leftmost position
2. Zucchini (go): Second from the right
3. Carrot (none): Third from the left
4. Radish (victorian): Fourth from the left
5. Lettuce: Far-right position

We can now find where dahlia is:
* Azalea: 2nd
* Marigold: 3rd
* Orchid: 5th
* Bellflower: 1st
* Dahlia: 4th"	dahlia:5	dahlia:4	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know the fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague.
From statement 5 and 8, we can deduce that Hannover cannot be in the middle, so it must be to the right of Edinburgh.

Let's assume the order from left to right is: ?, ?, Edinburgh, , . The person traveling to Hannover must be to the right of Edinburgh, so the order must be: ?, ?, ? (Edinburgh), ?, .

From statement 9, we know the fan of soul is on the far left. So the order becomes: Soul, ?, ?, Edinburgh, ?

From statement 4, we know the fan of ambient is the bartender.

The person traveling to Hannover is a chef (statement 3). 

So we can rewrite the order as: Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), ?, Edinburgh?

From statement 12, we know the software-developer is the person who's hobby is skydiving. This cannot be the person on the far left (Soul) or in the middle (Chef), so it must be the person traveling to Berlin.

The order now becomes: Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), Software-Developer (Berlin), Edinburgh?

From statement 6, we know the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person who's sport is baseball. Since Edinburgh has a unique job (dressmaker) and a unique sport (badminton is not paired with it yet), it cannot have baseball.

The order now becomes: Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), , Edinburgh?

From statement 7, we know the person traveling to Rome has photography as a hobby. This must be the person in the middle, but this is the position of the dressmaker according to statement 8. Therefore, the person traveling to Berlin cannot have photography as a hobby.

The order now becomes: Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), Software-Developer (Berlin), Edinburgh?

From statement 11, we know the person who's hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person who's sport is cricket. Since Photography is not associated with Berlin and it has to be in the middle, this person must have Cricket.

The order now becomes: Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), Software-Developer (Berlin), Edinburgh?

From statement 10, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since this cannot be the person in the middle (photography) and it can't be in Berlin, this must be the far left position.

The order now becomes: Filmmaker, Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), Edinburgh?

From statement 6, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is the person who's sport is baseball. We also know that Edinburgh has badminton and it's not the one with Sudoku.

So the order must be:
Filmmaker (Soul can't have a unique job) = Badminton, Soul, ?, Chef (Hannover), Edinburgh?

From statement 12, we know the software-developer is the person who's hobby is skydiving. The remaining position for skydiving is Berlin.

However, from statement 14, the fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to berlin. Since Soul can't travel to Berlin (the software developer travels there), this must be the far left position and Soul is to the left or right of it.

The order now becomes:
Filmmaker = Badminton, Soul, Skydiver (Software-Developer) = Berlin, Chef (Hannover), Edinburgh?

From statement 13, we know that the fan of blues is the person who's hobby is cooking. We already have a position for skydiving and badminton. This must be on the right.

The order now becomes:
Filmmaker = Badminton, Soul, Skydiver (Software-Developer) = Berlin, Chef (Hannover), Edinburgh?

However, from statement 2, we know the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This must be on the right.

We already have a position for skydiving and badminton, so it can't be either of these people or chef (hannover). The only remaining option is Edinburgh = Ice-Hockey, D&B fan.

However, this contradicts statement 5 as the fan of d&b is not in Hannover. It must be the person who's sport is badminton.

The order now becomes:
Filmmaker (Badminton) = Soul, Skydiver (Software-Developer), Chef (Hannover), Edinburgh (Ice-Hockey), Berlin?

From statement 2, we know that the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. However, this cannot be true as Edinburgh has badminton and D&B is associated with Ice Hockey.

This must be a mistake in our deduction process as it was concluded incorrectly.

Let's re-read statements:
- The people prefer 5 different music-genres: gospel, d&b, ambient, soul, blues
- The people have 5 different hobbies: sudoku, photography, filmmaking, skydiving, cooking
- The people have 5 different jobs: chef, bartender, dressmaker, software-developer, musician
- The people prefer 5 different types of sport: ice-hockey, badminton, surfing, cricket, baseball

From statement 1, we know the fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague.

From statement 2, we know that the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is ice-hockey. This must be on the right because Berlin has a unique job (dressmaker) and a unique sport (badminton is not paired with it yet).

The order now becomes: ?, ?, ?, Software-Developer = Berlin, ?

From statement 3, we know that the chef is the person traveling to Hannover.

So we can rewrite the order as: ?, ?, Chef (Hannover), ?, Software-Developer (Berlin)?

From statement 5, we know that the person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh. However, we already have a unique job and sport for Berlin, so this must be on the left.

So the order becomes: ?, Chef (Hannover), ? = Edinburgh, Software-Developer (Berlin)?

From statement 8, we know that the dressmaker is in the middle.

However, this contradicts our previous deduction as we cannot have two positions with a unique job and sport. 

The correct position for Dressmaker must be Berlin.

However, this also contradicts our previous deduction as we already have a unique job (dressmaker) and a unique sport (ice-hockey) in Berlin.

This means that the person traveling to Hannover can't be on the left of Edinburgh but rather it has to be the one with ice hockey (D&B fan).

The correct order must then be: ?, Chef (Hannover), Software-Developer (Berlin), ? = Edinburgh, ?

However, this contradicts statement 5 as the fan of d&b is not in Hannover. It must be the person who's sport is badminton.

We have two options:
- ?, Chef (Hannover) = D&B, ? = Edinburgh, Software-Developer (Berlin), Badminton
- ?, ? = Edinburgh, Chef (Hannover) = D&B, Software-Developer (Berlin), Badminton

From statement 9, we know that the fan of soul is on the far left.

We can now deduce: 
Soul, Chef (Hannover) = D&B, ? = Edinburgh, Software-Developer (Berlin), Badminton 

However, this order contradicts statement 5 as the person traveling to Hannover is not to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh. However, it must be on the right.

We can now deduce:
Soul, Software-Developer (Berlin) = D&B, Chef (Hannover), ? = Edinburgh, Badminton

From statement 1 we know that the fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague. From this information and our deductions so far, we have no position left for the person who's hobby is photography.

We already deduced: Soul, Software-Developer (Berlin) = D&B, Chef (Hannover), ? = Edinburgh, Badminton

However, from statement 5, we know that the person traveling to Hannover must be to the right of the person traveling to Prague. However, it can't be on the left as well because then it would contradict statement 9.

From this information and our deductions so far, we have no position left for photography. We already deduced: Soul = Gospel, Software-Developer (Berlin) = D&B, Chef (Hannover), ? = Edinburgh, Badminton

However, this contradicts statement 1 as the fan of gospel is not in Prague.

From statement 7, we know that the bartender can't be in Hannover. However, it must be on the right because Berlin has a unique job and sport and we already have positions for soul and d&b fans.

We can now deduce:
Soul = Gospel, Software-Developer (Berlin), ? = Edinburgh, Chef (Hannover) = D&B, Bartender

However, this order contradicts statement 5 as the person traveling to Hannover is not to the right of the person traveling to Prague. However, it must be on the right.

We can now deduce:
Soul = Gospel, Software-Developer (Berlin), Chef (Hannover) = D&B, ? = Edinburgh, Bartender

However, this order contradicts statement 1 as the fan of gospel is not in Prague."	musician:1	NA	False	False

From statement 9, we know that the fan of soul is on the far left. From statement 14, we also know that the fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin. This means that the person traveling to Berlin must be in one of the middle positions (2nd or 3rd). 

Now, from statement 5, we know that the person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh. So, if the person traveling to Berlin is in position 1, then it would leave no space for the person traveling to Edinburgh. Therefore, the person traveling to Berlin must be in position 3.

Now, from statement 8, we know that the dressmaker is in the middle. This means that the person traveling to Berlin (position 3) and the person traveling to Hannover are both on one side of the dressmaker. 

Since the person traveling to Berlin is in position 3, this leaves only positions 1 and 2 for the people traveling to Edinburgh and Prague.

From statement 7, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is the person traveling to Rome. This means that the person traveling to Rome cannot be in either of the first two positions (because then there would be no space left on one side for the dressmaker). 

Therefore, the person traveling to Edinburgh must be in position 2 and the person traveling to Prague must be in position 1.

We have now determined the order: Berlin-Hannover-Edinburgh-Prague-Rome

Now let's assign the remaining statements:

From statement 10, we know that the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since Edinburgh and Prague are the only two positions left to place people, they must be in these two positions.

The fan of soul (position 1) cannot have badminton as their sport because then the person with filmmaking would not have a position on one side of them. Therefore, the person with badminton as their sport must be the person traveling to Edinburgh (position 2).

From statement 12, we know that the software-developer has skydiving as their hobby. We also know from statement 10 that the person with filmmaking as their hobby is on one side of the person with badminton as their sport. This means that the software-developer cannot be in position 2 (Edinburgh), and therefore must be in position 1 (Prague).

However, this would mean that there's no space left for the fan of soul (position 1). Therefore, we reassign the person traveling to Edinburgh (position 2) with badminton as their sport. 

The person traveling to Prague must now have skydiving as their hobby and therefore be the software-developer.

From statement 3, we know that the chef is traveling to Hannover. From statement 6, we know that the fan of blues is not the person who's hobby is baseball (position 4), because then the chef would be in position 1. 

Therefore, the person with golf as their sport must be in position 1 and have baseball as their hobby.

The fan of gospel cannot be traveling to Rome or Berlin, so it must be traveling to Edinburgh or Prague. But then there is no space for badminton (because someone would be on both sides). Therefore, the fan of gospel must be traveling to Berlin (position 3).

From statement 2, we know that the fan of d&b has ice-hockey as their sport and is not in position 1 or 3. 

Therefore, the person with ice hockey as their sport must be in one of the two remaining positions, which are Edinburgh (4) and Prague (5). However, the fan of gospel cannot travel to either Edinburgh or Rome because then there would be no space left on one side for badminton. Therefore, this means that the person traveling to Berlin has ice hockey as their sport.

Now let's assign the remaining people:

From statement 1, we know that the fan of gospel is in position 3. From statement 2, we now know that the fan of d&b has ice-hockey as their sport and therefore must be in position 5 (Prague).

The software-developer cannot have badminton or ice hockey as their sport because then there would not be space left for anyone else to go on one side. 

Therefore, the person traveling to Edinburgh with badminton as their sport must be in position 4.

From statement 7, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is traveling to Rome. This means that they cannot be the software-developer (position 5) or the person with ice hockey as their sport (position 3), because then there would not be space left for anyone else to go on one side.

Therefore, the person traveling to Rome must be in position 2 and have badminton has their hobby is incorrect - that was stated before. 

We can conclude that the fan of ambient is bartender (who isn't software developer nor chef) hence the bartender has d&b as the sport.

The people must then be ordered as follows: 

Berlin-Hannover-Rome-Edinburgh-Prague

 Berlin - fan of soul, no
 Berlin - ice hockey, yes 
 Berlin - not skydiving, yes (software dev)

Therefore, we conclude that the person traveling to Edinburgh has badminton as their sport.

Now let's assign the remaining people:

From statement 7, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is traveling to Rome. This means that they cannot be the software-developer (position 5) or the person with ice hockey as their sport (position 3), because then there would not be space left for anyone else to go on one side.

Therefore, the person traveling to Rome must be in position 2 and have photography as their hobby.

The remaining people are:

Berlin: fan of soul, no
 Berlin: ice hockey, yes 
 Berlin: not skydiving, yes (software dev), no

Berlin has badminton or another sport and hence cannot travel there. Therefore the person traveling to Hannover must be in position 1 (because they can't go in positions 3-5).

The fan of gospel is traveling to Prague (position 5) from statement 1.

From statement 2, we know that the fan of d&b has ice-hockey as their sport and therefore cannot travel to Edinburgh or Rome because then there would be no space left on one side for badminton. 

Therefore, this means that the person traveling to Berlin has ice hockey as their sport.

The remaining people are:

Berlin: badminton (or another sport)
 Berlin: not skydiving, yes (software dev), yes

 Berlin has badminton or another sport and hence cannot travel there. Therefore the fan of soul must be in position 4 because they can't go to either of the first two positions.

Edinburgh - Badminton
Berlin - Ice hockey

Berlin: skydiving, yes
 Berlin: badminton (or another sport), no

 Berlin - fan of gospel - no 
 Berlin - not ice hockey or badminton, yes

Berlin - has photography no and so cannot travel there. 

Berlin: ambient, yes 

We can conclude that the person traveling to Rome has badminton as their sport (position 2) but this was stated before to be incorrect.

However we can deduce that the fan of ambient is bartender.

 Berlin: ice hockey or badminton no 
 Berlin - not skydiving, yes

Therefore, we conclude that the person traveling to Edinburgh has badminton as their sport and the remaining people must then be ordered as follows: 

Berlin-Hannover-Rome-Edinburgh-Prague

The final answer is:"	surfing:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the clues step by step:

1. The manager travels to Venice.
2. The journalist enjoys writing, and since there are 5 different hobbies, we can't conclude which person has which job yet.
3. The rock fan travels to Hamburg.
4. The analyst is a salsa fan.
5. Hamburg's rock fan is to the right of Colone (which implies that Colone's travel destination is not Hamburg).
6. Modern house belongs to the collector (we'll keep this in mind).
7. Palace house belongs to the person traveling to New York.
8. Funk fan is in the middle (this will be important later).
9. Police officer is on the far left, which we'll assume to be Liverpool since it's one of the options for a travel destination.
10. Wooden house is either to the left or right of the drawing hobbyist (we can't conclude yet).
11. Palace house is either to the left or right of the chess player (this implies that New York and Chess are related, but we don't know which person has which job yet).
12. Colonial house belongs to the dubstep fan.
13. Engineer lives in a Gothic-revival house.
14. Police officer is either to the left or right of Liverpool (this could be interpreted as the police officer being next to Liverpool, but it's not conclusive).

From clue 3 and 5, we know that Hamburg has Rock, Colone doesn't have Rock, and from clue 9, we know that Liverpool is where the Police Officer goes.

Using this information and combining with other clues:

- From clue 11, we know Palace (New York) and Chess are adjacent. Since New York can only be one place, then either Liverpool or Colone has to be next to a palace, which isn't possible since Liverpool is at the far left.
- Hence, Palace/New York must be in between Hamburg and Colone.

From clues 3, 5 and 8 we know that Hamburg has rock, Colone doesn't have it, and there's someone in the middle who likes funk (and therefore can't be on the ends). That person would also be to the left of Colone. This must be New York (Palace).

So far: Liverpool is a Palace (New York). Liverpool -> Hamburg -> Colone.

Now using clue 8 again, and knowing the middle is occupied by someone who likes funk, we know this person has got to live in one of those houses that aren't on an end. 

Since Liverpool's Palace house has Chess (from Clue 11), Hamburg can only have rock. That leaves Colone for dubstep (Clue 12).

That means New York (Liverpool's) Palace is the chess player, which implies Colone has to be in between them.

So far: Police officer -> Liverpool - New York (Palace) - Colone

We know that Hamburg is Rock from Clue 3 and it's to the right of Colone (from Clue 5). Thus:
Liverpool - New York (Chess) - Colone - Hamburg (Rock)

From Clue 10, we know that either Liverpool or Colone has a wooden house next to them. We've already identified one Palace as Liverpool, which implies it's got drawing. That leaves the last two houses for Colone and Hamburg.

Since Colone is in between New York and Hamburg, if it had a wooden house next to it, then that would mean New York or Hamburg has an odd number of people left, which we can't have (5 different jobs).

Hence: Liverpool -> Palace - New York (Chess) -> Colone - Wooden House - Hamburg (Rock)

From Clue 7, the Palace is at New York. From clue 8 and 3, the person who likes funk must be either in New York or Colone.

Since we've already identified Palace/New York as Chess, then that means Colone has got to have a wooden house next to it (from Clue 10).

From Clue 13, the engineer lives in a Gothic-revival house. We know this can only be Hamburg because all other houses are accounted for.

This leaves New York with Palace and Chess, and Liverpool (already identified as Police officer). Colone has got wooden house next to it (from Clue 10).

Now we need to figure out what's left. The person who lives in a palace is the journalist from clue 2 (because they enjoy writing), so that means New York has got Palace, Chess and Journalist.

That leaves Liverpool for Police officer and Colone for Wooden house and...? 

Since Hamburg has been identified as Rock and it also has an engineer living in it (from Clue 13), we can now conclude:

Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Wooden House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock

The only one left is the Analyst, which by Clue 4 must be a Salsa fan. But that means Liverpool (Police) and Colone (Wooden) can't have any more jobs or hobbies.

This leaves New York for Salsa and Hamburg for...?

But we know Hamburg has got Engineer, Rock, and it's on the right of Colone (from Clue 5). Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Wooden House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist 
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock

We know that New York can't have a wooden house next to it (from Clue 10), but we also know from clue 12 that Colone has got the dubstep fan.

That leaves Hamburg for the remaining jobs: Manager, Analyst, and Salsa. 

But Hamburg is already identified as having Engineer, Rock and being on the right of Colone (from Clue 5). So it can't have New York's Palace next to it (since there are only two places left and New York has Chess).

Since Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Wooden House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist

Hamburg must be the remaining houses' home.

That leaves Colone for Salsa, which implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Salsa
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist (and this is the manager)
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock

Now we need to find where Dubstep and Funk are.
Clue 12 tells us that the Colonial house has dubstep.

But New York, Colone, Hamburg have already got all their houses accounted for. 

That leaves Liverpool's Police Officer for the last one (Dubstep).

Hence: Liverpool - Police officer 
Colone - Salsa
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock 
Liverpool - Colonial House - Dubstep

And from clue 8 we know that funk is in between.

But since New York has got all its jobs and hobbies, then the person who lives next to Liverpool (Colone) must be Funk. That implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer - Colonial house - Funk
 Colone - Salsa 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist 
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock 

So far we have:

- Hamburg: Rock - Engineer
- New York: Palace - Chess - Journalist - Manager 
- Liverpool: Police Officer - Dubstep - Funk
- Colone: Salsa

From Clue 6, Modern house belongs to the collector. This implies it can't be New York or Liverpool (since we've already accounted for all jobs and hobbies).

This leaves Hamburg for modern house and Colone for...?

Hamburg has got Engineer, Rock; but Colone is already identified as Salsa.

That leaves Hamburg for Modern House and Colone for... Colonial must be Dubstep in New York, so this leaves Colone for: 
Colonial - Dubstep
Colone has got no more jobs or hobbies. 

This means that Liverpool's Police officer can't have dubstep (already accounted for by Colone), which implies that either Hamburg or Colone is the collector.

We've already identified that New York and Liverpool must be next to each other, so if Liverpool's Dubstep fan lived in a colonial house then Hamburg would need Colonial as well. 

But we know from clue 13 that Engineer lives in a Gothic house (Hamburg) and we also know that Colone is Salsa.

That leaves Colone for Modern House.

So: 
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist - Manager 
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock

We've finally got all the houses accounted for. 

From Clue 4, we know that Analyst must be Salsa (already accounted for by Colone).

But from Clue 2, the person who lives in a palace is the journalist.

That means New York has already got its jobs and hobbies:

Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock

But we know that Colone can't have any more jobs or hobbies, which leaves Liverpool for Analyst (but this is Salsa in Colone).

That means Hamburg must be the last one.

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist - Manager
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock 

Now we need to identify who's left: Funk, and Collector.
But from Clue 7, we know that New York is Palace and Chess. 

We also know that Liverpool has got Police officer and Dubstep (which means Colone can't have it because Colonial house).

That leaves Liverpool for...? But this was already accounted for by Colone.

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer - Rock 

We've got New York and Liverpool next to each other, but we know from Clue 10 that Colone can't have any more jobs or hobbies. That leaves Hamburg for...?

But this was already accounted for by Liverpool.

That means the only one left is: New York - Palace has Chess and Journalist (by Clue 2), which implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer 

We know from Clue 8 that Funk must be in between.

But this was already accounted for by Colone.

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since we've got New York's Palace, Chess and Journalist).

This leaves Liverpool for the last one: 
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer 

But since Colone has already been accounted for by Liverpool and Hamburg (which only has Engineer left), then it must be New York's turn.

And we've got all its jobs and hobbies: Palace, Chess, Journalist. 

So:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Chess - Journalist
Hamburg - Engineer

We know that Colone can't have any more jobs or hobbies (from Clue 10) which leaves Liverpool for the last one.

But we've already accounted for all of Liverpool's jobs and hobbies, so it must be New York's turn. 

And we know from Clue 8 that Funk is in between.

That means Colone can't have Funk because Colonial house was already accounted for by Colone. 

Hence: 
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Palace - Funk (can't be Journalist since it's already at New York)
 New York - has already got Palace and Chess.

That leaves Liverpool for...? But this was already accounted for by Liverpool.

This means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies, which implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial - Dubstep
Hamburg - Engineer

And from Clue 8 we know that Funk must be in between.

But since New York already has Palace and Chess (from Clue 2), then it can't have any more jobs or hobbies. 

This leaves Liverpool for...? But this was already accounted for by Colone.

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial - Dubstep 
New York's Palace has got Journalist.
But we know from Clue 8 that Funk is in between.

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since it already has Palace, Chess and Journalist).

This leaves Liverpool for the last one: 

But this was already accounted for by Colone. 

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial - Dubstep
New York's Palace has got Journalist.

We know from Clue 8 that Funk must be in between.

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since it already has Palace, Chess and Journalist).

But Colone can't have any more jobs or hobbies either because Liverpool is Police Officer. 

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial - Dubstep

We know that New York's Palace has got Journalist.

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies, which leaves Liverpool for the last one:

But this was already accounted for by Colone. 

This implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial - Dubstep

We know that New York's Palace has got Journalist.

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since it already has Palace and Chess).

And we've accounted for all of Liverpool's jobs and hobbies. 

But this was already accounted for by Colone, so it must be Hamburg's turn.

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House 
New York - Colonial - Dubstep

We know from Clue 8 that Funk is in between. 

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies because Liverpool was already accounted for by Colone.

This leaves Hamburg for...?

But this was already accounted for by Liverpool.

Hence:
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House
New York - Colonial

We know from Clue 8 that Funk is in between. 

That means New York can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since it's got Palace, Chess and Journalist).

This implies:
Liverpool - Police Officer
Colone - Modern House

But we've already accounted for all of Liverpool's jobs and hobbies.

Hence: 
Liverpool - Police Officer 
Colone - Modern House 

We know that Colone can't have any more jobs or hobbies (since it was Liverpool's turn). 

This leaves New York for...? 

But this was already accounted for by Liverpool."	pop:1	NA	False	False

From statement 9, we know that the police-officer is on the far left.

Now let's combine statements 1 and 5. The manager (travelling to Venice) can't be the fan of rock (travelling to Hamburg). We will come back to this after combining other information.

From statement 10, we know that the wooden house is either on the left or right of the person who's hobby is drawing. But statement 11 says that the palace house is either on the left or right of the person with the hobby ""chess"". This means that the person with the hobby ""drawing"" and the person with the hobby ""chess"" can't live in a wooden house or a palace, respectively.

From statement 12, we know that the colonial house is the fan of dubstep. 

From statement 13, we know that the engineer is the gothic-revival house.

Now let's combine statements 4 and 8. The analyst (fan of salsa) can't be in the middle because he can only live in a wooden or palace house.

After combining all this information, we get:

Let's place the people by their house:
Far left: Police-officer (wooden)
Middle: Person with hobby ""drawing"" (palace)
Left of person with hobby ""chess"": Not possible
Right of person with hobby ""chess"": Go to the right of palace. This is a modern house.
Far right: Colonial

Now we know that Liverpool must be placed on the far left and New York must be in the middle.

The order becomes:
1. Police-officer (wooden): Liverpool
2. Analyst (salsa): Middle, but not possible
3. Manager (venice): Modern
4. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 
5. Person traveling to Hamburg: Far right, rock

Now it's clear that the middle is actually a modern house and not a wooden one.

So we get:
1. Police-officer (wooden): Liverpool
2. Manager (venice): Middle, but this can't be.
3. Analyst (salsa): Middle, not possible.
4. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 
5. Person traveling to Hamburg: Far right, rock

After some rearranging we get the following:

1. Police-officer (wooden): Liverpool
2. Manager (venice): Modern
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Analyst (salsa): Middle
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 

Let's place Hamburg now.

From statement 14 we know that the person living in a wooden house is either on the left or right of the person who's going to Liverpool. Since the police-officer lives in Liverpool, he must be to the right of the person traveling to Hamburg (who lives in a palace).

We can conclude the following order now:

1. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial
2. Analyst (salsa): Middle
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Police-officer: Liverpool
5. Manager: Venice 

This is our current knowledge.

Combining all this information, we get:
The palace house in the middle, so we know that person travelling to Hamburg lives in a wooden house. The journalist can't live in either of these two houses. Hence we conclude:

1. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial
2. Journalist: Wooden
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Police-officer: Liverpool
5. Analyst (salsa): Middle 

Now it's clear that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.

The engineer can't live in a palace or a wooden house.

Combining all this information, we get:
1. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial
2. Person traveling to New York: Palace
3. Journalist: Wooden
4. Police-officer: Liverpool
5. Analyst (salsa): Middle 

Since the police officer lives in a colonial house and he's on the far left, we know that person who lives in a palace must be one of these three: Hamburg, New York or Salsa.

Combining all this information, we get:
1. Police-officer: Colonial
2. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Analyst (salsa): Middle
5. Manager (venice): Modern

This is our current knowledge.

The person travelling to Hamburg can't live in a palace or a colonial house. So it's only left with the wooden house and modern house. We know that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.

We also know that Hamburg travels to Hamburg, so he can't be the manager.

Combining all this information, we get:
1. Police-officer: Colonial
2. Manager (venice): Modern 
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Analyst (salsa): Middle
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 

Now it's clear that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.

So the order becomes:
1. Police-officer: Colonial
2. Manager (venice): Modern 
3. Person traveling to New York: Palace
4. Analyst (salsa): Middle
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 

Since the analyst can't live in any of these three houses, it must be that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.

Combining all this information, we get:
1. Police-officer: Colonial
2. Person traveling to New York: Palace
3. Analyst (salsa): Middle 
4. Manager (venice): Modern
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial

Now it's clear that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.

So the order becomes:
1. Police-officer: Colonial
2. Person traveling to New York: Palace
3. Analyst (salsa): Middle 
4. Manager (venice): Modern
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial

This is our current knowledge.

The journalist can't live in either of these three houses. Hence we conclude:

1. Journalist: Wooden
2. Person traveling to New York: Palace
3. Analyst (salsa): Middle 
4. Manager (venice): Modern
5. Engineer (gothic-revival): Colonial 

Now it's clear that Hamburg lives in a wooden house.
