Einstein_4domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know the person who grows iris is traveling to Rome.
From clue 3, we know the person who grows orchid is watching scientific movies.
From clue 4, we know the person traveling to Boston is on the left of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
From clue 5, we know the person traveling to Boston is watching drama movies.

From clue 9, we know the person who grows sunflower is on the far left.

Clue 8 tells us that the person watching horror movies is in the middle. We don't know where the other people are yet, but this gives us a starting point.

Let's combine clues 4 and 5:
Boston (drama) -> Edinburgh (??)
We need to figure out who is on the left of Edinburgh.

From clue 6, we know the pall-mall-smoker is the fan of reggae.
From clue 7, we know the person traveling to Nizza is the dunhill-smoker.

Now, let's combine clues 10 and 11:
The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the fan of funk (??)
The fan of country is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker (Nizza)

From clue 12, we know the bluemaster-smoker is watching western movies.
From clue 13, we know the person who grows balloon-flower is the prince-smoker.

Now we have a few more pieces:

Rome -> Iris
Boston -> Drama

We also know that the person on the far left grows sunflower (??)

Let's try to fit in the people and their preferences:
Sunflower (far left) -> ???
Iris (Rome) -> ???

From clue 14, we know the person who grows sunflower is on the left or right of the person traveling to Liverpool.
So, Sunflower (far left) -> Liverpool

Now we have a few more pieces:

Liverpool -> ???
Boston -> Drama
Rome -> Iris

Let's fit in the people and their preferences:
Drama -> Boston
Iris -> Rome
Liverpool -> ???

From clue 3, we know the person who grows orchid is watching scientific movies.
We also know that the person on the left of Edinburgh must be traveling to Boston (drama).

So, let's try again:

Boston (drama) -> Edinburgh (??)
Rome (Iris) -> ???
Liverpool -> ???"	classical:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_4domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.

From statement 5, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening (G) is also the person whose sport is volleyball (V). We don't have a specific name for this person yet, but we'll call them G/V.

From statement 4, we know that the person who's hobby is gardening (G) is on the left of the person who's hobby is video-games (VG). So, VG must be to the right of G/V.

Statement 9 tells us that the person eating carrot (C) is on the far left. Since the C person can't be next to G/V (because G/V is followed by VG), and VG is followed by someone else (from statement 4), C must be at position 1, with G/V at position 2.

From statement 15, we know that the person watching animation movies (A) is on the left or right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey (IH). This means A can't be in positions 3 or 4 because those would put IH in an odd-numbered position, and we know C is at position 1.

Now let's look at statement 8. The person who's sport is climbing (C) is in the middle. Since C is at position 1, this means C must be at positions 3 or 4. This confirms our suspicion from statement 15 that A and IH are not in positions 3 or 4.

From statement 10, we know that the person watching animation movies (A) is on the left or right of the owner of the cat (cat). Since C can't be at position 1 (it's already taken by the C person), it must be either at position 3 or 4. And since A and IH are not in positions 3 or 4, this means that A is actually next to C/V (because G/V is followed by VG). Let's assume C is at position 3 for now.

From statement 8, we know C is indeed at position 3. Now let's figure out the arrangement of G/V and VG. Statement 5 says the person whose hobby is gardening (G) is also the person whose sport is volleyball (V), so G/V is at position 2. Since G/V is followed by VG, this means VG is at position 4.

Now we know that:
* Position 1: C
* Position 2: G/V
* Position 3: C
* Position 4: VG

From statement 14, the person eating carrot (C) is on the left or right of the person whose hobby is puzzles (P). Since C is already at position 1, this means P must be either at position 2 or 4. But we already know G/V is at position 2 and VG is at position 4, so P can't be at those positions.

Let's assume C is indeed at position 3 for now (from statement 8). This means P would have to be at position 1. However, this conflicts with statement 9 which says the person eating carrot (C) is on the far left. It looks like we made a mistake assuming C was at position 3.

So let's go back to our assumption from earlier that A and IH are not in positions 3 or 4. This means A must be next to G/V because C can't fit between VG and P (because P is on the far left).

We know from statement 15 that the person watching animation movies (A) is on the left or right of the person whose sport is ice-hockey (IH). Since G/V is followed by VG, this means A is actually next to C (because G/V is followed by VG and P is at position 1).

Now let's analyze statement 11. The owner of the horses is on the left or right of the person watching disaster movies (D). From statement 7, we know that the person whose hobby is board-games (B) is the person watching disaster movies (D). Since D is B, this means H must be to the left or right of B.

We also know from statement 13 that the person eating peach (P) is the person watching spy movies (S). Statement 10 says that the person watching animation movies (A) is on the left or right of the owner of the cat. This means A can't be at position 1 because it would put the cat's owner at an odd-numbered position, but since C is at position 1 and G/V is at position 2, this means A must actually be next to P.

From statement 3, we know that the person eating papaya (P) is the person whose sport is handball (H). Now let's look at statement 15 again. Since A and IH are not in positions 3 or 4, this means they can't be next to each other because C would have to fit between them.

However, we know that G/V is followed by VG (from statement 4), and G/V is also the person whose sport is volleyball (V). We don't know which position V is at yet. But since P is watching spy movies (S) and A is next to P, this means S must be at position 1.

From statement 9, we know that the person eating carrot (C) is on the far left, but we've already established that C can't be at positions 3 or 4 because those would put it between VG and G/V. This confirms our earlier suspicion that A and IH are not in positions 3 or 4.

We have some remaining information to analyze. From statement 1, the person eating eggplant (E) is the person whose hobby is camping (C). We know from statement 8 that C is at position 3, but we can't yet determine its position.

From statement 7, we also know that the person watching comedy movies (M) is the owner of the bird. And from statement 6, we know that M is not G/V because G/V's sport is volleyball and not handball.

Since P is watching spy movies (S), this means S can't be at position 3 or 4 because those would put C at an odd-numbered position. But since S is next to A, this means S must actually be next to the owner of the cat.

From statement 12, we know that the person watching thriller movies (T) is the person whose sport is sailing (S). Since G/V's sport is volleyball and not handball, this means T must be at position 4 because S can't fit between VG and P.

We've established several key positions so far:
* Position 1: C
* Position 2: G/V
* Position 3: C
* Position 4: V

From statement 8, we know that the person whose sport is climbing (C) is in the middle. Since C can't be at position 1 or 4 because those are taken by the other C and the owner of the cat respectively, this means C must actually be at position 3.

This leaves us with:
* Position 1: P
* Position 2: G/V
* Position 3: V
* Position 4: T

Now let's analyze statement 5 again. We know that the person whose hobby is gardening (G) is also the person whose sport is volleyball (V). Since V is at position 3, this means G must be at position 2.

This leaves us with:
* Position 1: P
* Position 2: G
* Position 3: V
* Position 4: T

From statement 11, we know that the owner of the horses (H) is on the left or right of B. Since B's hobby is board-games and D is watching disaster movies, this means H must be at position 1.

This leaves us with:
* Position 1: H
* Position 2: P
* Position 3: G
* Position 4: V

We've established several key positions so far:
* Position 1: C
* Position 2: A (because it's next to P)
* Position 3: G/V
* Position 4: S/IH (T is at position 4, but it can't be S because that would put H at an odd-numbered position)

However, we've established that V's sport is handball and not sailing. So this leaves us with:
* Position 1: C (but that conflicts with statement 9 which says the person eating carrot is on the far left)
* Position 2: A
* Position 3: G/V
* Position 4: IH

This leaves us with:
* Position 1: P/IH (because S is next to A and V's sport is handball, not sailing)

However, this would put H at an odd-numbered position. This means C must be at position 1.

From statement 7, we know that M is the owner of the bird. From statement 10, we know that A is on the left or right of P. And from statement 9, we know that C is the person eating carrot and that it's on the far left.

So let's analyze the positions again.
* Position 1: IH (because S can't fit between VG and G/V)
* Position 2: A
* Position 3: V/G
* Position 4: T

From statement 8, we know that C is at position 3. However, this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that IH was at position 1.

We've established several key positions so far:
* Position 1: S (because it's next to A)
* Position 2: G/V
* Position 3: V
* Position 4: T

However, this would put H at an odd-numbered position. This means C must be at position 1.

So let's analyze the positions again.
* Position 1: IH (because S can't fit between VG and G/V)
* Position 2: A
* Position 3: V/G
* Position 4: T

But this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that V is at position 3.

Let's go back to statement 7. We know that the person watching comedy movies (M) is the owner of the bird. From statement 6, we know that M is not G/V because G/V's sport is volleyball and not handball. And from statement 11, we know that H must be on the left or right of B.

We've established several key positions so far:
* Position 1: C
* Position 2: A (because it's next to P)
* Position 3: G/V
* Position 4: IH/T

From statement 12, we know that T is at position 4. However, this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that V was at position 3.

Let's analyze the positions again.
* Position 1: IH (because S can't fit between VG and G/V)
* Position 2: A
* Position 3: V/G
* Position 4: C

This would put H at an odd-numbered position. This means C must be at position 1.

We've established several key positions so far:
* Position 1: IH
* Position 2: A
* Position 3: G/V
* Position 4: T

However, this conflicts with our earlier conclusion that V was at position 3.

Let's analyze the positions again.
* Position 1: S (because it's next to A)
* Position 2: IH/T
* Position 3: C
* Position 4: G/V"	fish:4	NA	False	False
Einstein_4domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 9, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon (let's call this person A) is on the far left.

From statement 14, we know that person A is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is writing (let's call this person B). This means person A must be either on the very far left or next to person B. Since there can only be one person on the far left, person A must be on the very far left.

From statement 10, we know that the fan of indie (let's call this person C) is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold (let's call this person D). This means person C and person D cannot be in the same two positions on either side. 

From statement 11, we know that the person who grows amarylliss (let's call this person E) is on the left or right of the fan of reggae (person J). Let's assume for now that person E is on the left of person J.

Since there can only be one person in the middle (statement 8), let's place person B who has writing as a hobby, in the second position from the far left. This means person A must be next to person B and person A is biathlon. 

From statement 4, we know that person G who has photography as a hobby is on the left of person F who has camping as a hobby. Since person C (fan of indie) can't be with person D (marigold), let's try placing person F in the third position and person G in the fourth position.

From statement 5, we know that person G has photography as a hobby and drinks coffee. From statement 8, we know that person K who drinks milk is in the middle. Since person B (writing) is already in the second position, there are only two options for person K: either the third or fourth position.

If person K were in the third position, then person G would be in the fourth position and person F would be on the far right. However, this contradicts statement 4 since it states that person G is on the left of person F.

Therefore, person K (drinking milk) must be in the fifth position from the far left, which means person B (writing) is in the second position, and person F (camping) is in the fourth position. 

Now let's deal with statement 5: it states that person G has photography as a hobby and drinks coffee, but this contradicts our previous conclusion about person K (drinking milk). There must be another person drinking coffee, so let's call person H (who we haven't yet assigned any hobbies or sports) to have coffee. 

From statement 5, we now know that person G is actually person H, who drinks coffee and has photography as a hobby.

Statement 4 tells us that person G (person H) is on the left of person F (camping). From this, we can deduce that person K must be drinking milk and in the fifth position from the far left. Person B (writing) is now in the second position from the far left, followed by person E who grows amarylliss.

Now let's consider statement 11: it states that person E (growing amarylliss) is on the left or right of the fan of reggae (person J). Since person B and person K are already in positions two and five, respectively, we can place person E (amarylliss) in the fourth position. However, statement 11 tells us that person E cannot be with person J.

Let's go back to statement 7: it states that person G who has gardening as a hobby is the fan of reggae. Since we've already placed person B in the second position and person K in the fifth position, this means person G (gardening) must be in one of these two positions, with either person E or person F being displaced.

However, if person G were in the third position from the far left, then person J would indeed be on the right of person E (amarylliss), so statement 11 won't hold. 

Therefore, let's put person G (gardening) in the fifth position. Now we know that person F is biathlon, and person K drinks milk.

Now let's consider statement 1: it states that the person who plays tennis has chess as a hobby. However, this can only be person A who we know to play biathlon or someone else. Let's assume there's another player with the sport of tennis (person L) and that they have chess as their hobby.

Since person F is biathlon, let's place person F in the fourth position from the far left. 

From statement 13, we know that the person who plays skiing has pop as a hobby. However, since person F (biathlon) is already on the right of person B (writing), this means person F must be on the very far right.

Now let's consider statements 2 and 12: they tell us that the person playing cricket grows azalea and that the fan of classic drinks beer. 

From statement 2, we know that person D who grows azalea is not in positions one or two from the far left because person B (writing) is already there.

Since person F is biathlon, person E must be skiing and have pop as a hobby. This means person A cannot play tennis and have chess as a hobby; it has to be either person L or someone else with biathlon as their sport.

We know from statement 9 that the person who plays biathlon (person F) is on the far left, so there can only be one player who plays cricket. 

If person D were in positions three or four, then person E could not play skiing and have pop as a hobby because they would already be with person A.

Therefore, let's put person C (fan of indie) in the fourth position from the far left, followed by person E (skating), then person F is biathlon and on the very far right. 

Person K drinks milk, and statement 8 tells us that this person is in the middle, so we can place person K in the third position.

Now let's fill out the table:


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| Biathlon | 2nd     | L   | H           | F       |
|         |         | Tennis| Coffee      |          |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             |          |
| Cricket |         | D    |             |          |

Now let's deal with the remaining statements. Statement 15 states that person C (fan of indie) is on the left or right of the person drinking water.

From statement 10, we know that person C cannot be with person D because they are both either side of marigold. However, this does not hold if person E (growing marigold) is not the fan of indie. Therefore let's try putting person D in position 3 and person K (drinking milk) in position 4.

Now we know that person C must be on one of these two positions with either person A or F being displaced.

Statement 10 states that the fan of indie (person C) is on the left or right of the person growing marigold. Since we've just placed person K (milk) in position 4 and put D in the 3rd, let's place person E (marigold) in the fourth position.

This now leaves only positions 5 for either the fan of indie (person C), who must be on one side of marigold or the person drinking water. But statement 15 tells us that person C is on one of these two sides so this places person D, growing azalea, in position 1 and displaces F.

Now let's put person L (tennis) in position 5 from the far left.


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
|         | 2nd     | L   | H           |          |
| Biathlon |         |      |             | F       |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             |          |
| Cricket | D    |      |             |          |

Now let's consider the remaining statements. Statement 15 tells us that person C (fan of indie) is on one side of water, while statement 2 tells us that person D grows azalea.

Since we've just placed D in position 3 and K in the fourth with F being displaced to be biathlon now in position 4, let's put C (growing marigold) back in the fifth position. However this places E (water) in the third position from the far left which is not possible because then it would leave no space for person B who we know must be in positions one or two.

We can fill out the rest of the table as follows:


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
|         | 2nd     | L   | H           | F       |
| Biathlon |         |      |             |          |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             | D       |
| Cricket |         | C    | A           | K       |

We've filled out the table, but it's not fully coherent with all statements so let's try to place person C in a different position.


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
|         | 2nd     | L   | H           | D       |
| Biathlon |         |      |             |          |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             | C       |
| Cricket |         | C    | A           | F       |

Now we've placed person C in a different position but this doesn't hold because then there's no space for person K (drinking milk) who must be in the middle, as per statement 8.

Therefore let's go back to our original solution and try again:


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
| Biathlon | 2nd     | L   | H           |          |
|         |         | Tennis| Coffee      |          |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             |          |
| Cricket |         | D    |             |          |

Now let's consider statement 11: it states that person E (growing amarylliss) is on the left or right of the fan of reggae. Since we've just placed person F in the fourth position, this means person G must be either E or L.

However, if person E were the fan of reggae, then statement 11 would not hold because person G could not be to the right of person E.

Therefore let's place person G (growing amarylliss) in the third position from the far left. Now we can fill out the table:


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
|         | 2nd     | L   | H           |          |
| Biathlon |         |      |             | G       |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             | F       |
| Cricket | D    | C    | A           | K       |

We've placed person G in position three, but this doesn't hold because now there's no space for person B (writing) who must be on one of these two positions.

Let's go back and try to fill out the table again.


|    | Writing | Chess | Photography | Camping |
|----|---------|------|-------------|---------|
|         | 2nd     | L   | H           |          |
| Biathlon |         |      |             | F       |
| Skiing  |         | E    |             | G       |
| Cricket | D    | C    | A           | K       |

However, this table doesn't hold because statement 2 tells us that person D grows azalea and is not in the first position from the far left.

We've tried several combinations of tables, but they don't all hold so let's try a different method to solve this problem."	bellflower:4	NA	False	False
