Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	"Let's analyze the given information and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The malaysian is the person who likes orange.
2. The italian is the owner of the goldfish.

From statement 5, we know that the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine. Since the mexican is not mentioned yet, and the coralmaster-smoker (not a nationality) has not been linked to any color yet, let's start with the malaysian: if the malaysian likes orange, then the person to his left can't like black.

From statement 4, we know that the dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade. Statement 8 tells us that the person drinking lemonade is in the middle. Therefore, the dutch must be in the middle.

Given statements 9 and 10, the german is on the far left. If he were not to the right of someone with a color (statement 5), then one of the coralmaster-smoker or baccarat-smoker has to have a color linked to them. Since the havana-smoker is also in the puzzle (linked with chestnut, statement 7) and he isn't directly related to the leftmost person yet (which is german), let's analyze what we know about coralmaster:

* The coralmaster-smoker has two conditions for their placement: 
    * They can be on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.
    * The mexican (tiparillo-smoker, statement 13) hasn't been placed yet.

Let's place the mexican first. Since he is a tiparillo-smoker and there are only 5 spots, let's put him to the far right for now.

Now we have a new constraint: since the mexican is on the far right and he has to be between the person who likes coral (statement 14) and the coralmaster-smoker (one of which must be in front of the lizard owner or behind it), this limits our possible placement options even more. 

From statement 3, we know that the person drinking cola is the person who likes black.

Considering all constraints up to now:

* The malaysian is on the left side, because he has to be to the right of someone with aquamarine (statement 5).
* The dutch is in the middle and drinks almond-lemonade.
* The german is on the far left, so the mexican can't be to his left. This means the coralmaster-smoker or baccarat-smoker has to be between them (because they can only occupy two spots: one between german and dutch and the other next to him).

Now we place havana and chestnut:
* If we look at statement 11, it says that the havana-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the mouse.
* Statement 7 tells us that the havana-smoker likes chestnut.

Since the german (statement 9) has to be on the far left and one spot before him must have someone with aquamarine (or between german and dutch), let's start placing coralmaster. Since we know coralmaster cannot go in front of the lizard owner or behind it, the mexican must be to its right (the lizard can't be at the very beginning because there isn't enough space for five people with all constraints met). This leaves only one option: 
the malaysian is on the left and coralmaster is to his right. We know that aquamarine has to be between german and dutch, so it's logical to place coralmaster between them.

Now let's place the havana-smoker:
* The havana-smoker must be next to or behind the owner of the mouse (statement 11), 
* The mexican is on the far right, 
* And since the coralmaster-smoker can't go in front of the lizard and one spot has been taken by coralmaster: this limits the remaining options even more. 

If we put havana next to the owner of the mouse (to his left), then it will be behind the coralmaster, which violates condition 10 for tiparillo.

Now we know that coral is between german and dutch because mexican is on the far right: this is confirmed by statement 14. Therefore, since there are only two remaining places and three people to place (baccarat-smoker, italian and malaysian), let's place italian next to coralmaster:
* The havana-smoker is between german and dutch.
* The baccarat-smoker is the owner of the lizard.
* The mexican is on the far right.

We now have all remaining people placed: only the owner of the mouse, the coral smoker (between german and dutch) and the baccarat-smoker left. 

Given that malaysian likes orange (1), coralmaster can't go in front or behind lizard, this limits our options even more:
* Given statement 6 we know that the fonseca-smoker owns a bird.
* The mexican smokes tiparillo and has to be on the far right. 

Considering all of these constraints:
the only remaining spot for coral is between german and dutch (statement 14), which means coralmaster-smoker must be next to the owner of the lizard or behind them.

Let's now find out where we are:

1: The malaysian likes orange.
2: Italian has a goldfish.
3: The person drinking cola is the one who likes black, so that's either italian, dutch or german.
4: Dutch drinks almond-lemonade and has to be in the middle (statement 8).
5: If we put coral next to german, it would mean coralmaster can't go behind lizard. So let's place coral between german and dutch.
6: The mexican is on the far right because he smokes tiparillo (13) and has a remaining constraint with coral.

Given that statement 8 tells us that lemonade must be in the middle, it follows logically that either italian or dutch drink lemonade. 

Since there are only 5 people left to place (german is already placed), let's try placing them:
- german has to be on the far left.
- The mexican is to his right.
- So we can place coralmaster next to the mexican.

Now, we know that coral must be between german and dutch. We have two spots remaining: one for malaysian and one for italian (because dutch drinks lemonade). 

So let's put them in order:
1. The germaan is on the far left.
2. coralmaster is next to him (because he can't be behind lizard owner).
3. Coral must be between german and dutch, which means that coral has to go before or behind coralmaster.

Given all of these constraints: 

The malaysian is to the right of coral (statement 5), therefore, we know that there are two possible solutions for coral:

Coral is either in front of coralmaster, because he can't be between german and dutch.
or
coralmaster has coral as a neighbor.

So let's analyze all these possibilities and constraints: 

* Statement 6 says the fonseca-smoker owns a bird. 
* The mexican smokes tiparillo (13).
* The baccarat-smoker drinks iced-tea (12).

Considering all of this, we find out that coralmaster can be in front of coral. And since dutch has lemonade, it follows logically that malaysian and italian have to take the remaining spots.

We have now figured out where everyone is:

* German: far left
* Coral: before coralmaster
* Coralmaster: next to mexican (behind lizard owner)
* Dutch: middle (with lemonade)
* Malysian: to the right of coral

Now we can easily determine hot-chocolate placement.

From these constraints, it's clear that coral is on the far left. We know that coralmaster must be in front of coral because he can't go between german and dutch.

So hot-chocolate has to belong to either italian or malaysian (they're next to each other), 

and the remaining spot belongs to mexican.

Therefore, we have:

- germaan: far left
- coralmaster: next to german (before coral)
- Coral: before coralmaster 
- Dutch: middle 
- Malysian: to the right of coral
- Mexican: on the far right

Italian has a goldfish and has to drink either cola or lemonade, so Italian drinks lemonade because that's what dutch drinks.

And hot-chocolate belongs to mexican."	hot-chocolate:1
Zebra_lexical_replacements_0	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and filling in the information:

1. The Malaysian is the person who likes orange.
2. The Italian is the owner of the goldfish.
3. The person drinking cola is the person who likes black.
4. The Dutch is the person drinking almond-lemonade.
5. The person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine.

From clue 9, we know that the German is on the far left.

From clue 10, we know that the Coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard. And from clue 11, the Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.

From clue 13, we know that the Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.

Let's try to fill in the positions:

**German (far left)**

* Clue 14: The German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral. So, either the coral lover is on their far left or far right.
* Clue 10: The Coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the lizard.

So, let's place the Coralmaster-smoker and the lizard:

**Coralmaster (German's left/right neighbor), Lizard**

* If the coral lover is to the left of the German, then the Coralmaster-smoker must be to the left of the lizard. But this creates a conflict with clue 11.
* So, let's place the Coralmaster-smoker to the right of the lizard.

Now we have:

**German, Coralmaster (Lizard's neighbor)**

From clue 12, we know that the Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea. Since the Coralmaster-smoker is on the left or right of the lizard, and the German is to the left or right of the person who likes coral, we can conclude that:

* The person who likes coral cannot be the owner of the lizard (because it's the Coralmaster-smoker who is next to the lizard).
* So, let's place the coral lover on the far right. Then, by clue 14, the German must be in between them and the Coralmaster-smoker.

Now we have:

**German, Coral lover, Coralmaster (Lizard's neighbor)**

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine. Since the person drinking cola is the person who likes black (clue 3), let's place them on the far right.

**German, Aquamarine lover, Coral lover**

Now we have two spots left for the people: Italian and Malaysian.

From clue 2, we know that the Italian is the owner of the goldfish. Let's place them to the left of the German.

**Italian (Goldfish), German, Aquamarine lover, Coral lover**

The only spot left is between the German and the coral lover.

By clue 14, we now have a contradiction. We already placed the German in this position, so there must be someone else on the far right.

Since the Coralmaster-smoker is next to the lizard, it cannot be on the far right (because then there would not be enough space for everyone).

So, let's place the person who likes aquamarine on the far right:

**German, Aquamarine lover, Italian (Goldfish), Coral lover**

Now we have:

* The German is in spot 1.
* The Aquamarine lover is in spot 2.
* The Italian is in spot 3.

By clue 9, we know that the person who likes black is to the right of the person who likes aquamarine. So, the Black lover must be on the far right:

**German, Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover, Black lover**

By clue 13, we know that the Mexican is the Tiparillo-smoker.

Since the Coralmaster-smoker is next to the lizard, and the Baccarat-smoker is next to the mouse, let's place them:

* The Coralmaster-smoker (Lizard's neighbor)
* The Tiparillo-smoker (Mouse's neighbor)

By clue 11, we know that the Havana-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the mouse.

We already have the Black lover on the far right. So, let's place them in spot 5.

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover (spot 3), Black lover (spot 4), Mexican (Tiparillo) = Mouse owner**

By clue 11, we now have a contradiction. We already placed the Baccarat-smoker next to the mouse.

So, let's place the Coralmaster-smoker to the left of the lizard:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover (spot 3), Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner**

Now we have a contradiction again. We already placed the Black lover on the far right.

So, let's place them in spot 4 and move the Mexican:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover (spot 3), Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner**

Now we have a contradiction again. We already placed the Coralmaster-smoker next to the lizard.

So, let's place them in spot 5 and move the Mexican:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover (spot 3), Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner**

Now we have a contradiction again. We already placed the Baccarat-smoker next to the mouse.

So, let's place the Havana-smoker to the left of the lizard:

By clue 12, we know that the Baccarat-smoker is the person drinking iced-tea.

Since the Coralmaster-smoker is next to the lizard, and the Havana-smoker is next to the mouse, let's place them:

* The Coralmaster-smoker (Lizard's neighbor)
* The Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner

Now we have a contradiction again. We already placed the Black lover on the far right.

So, let's place the Baccarat-smoker in spot 5 and move the Mexican:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Coral lover (spot 3), Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner**

We still have one contradiction. We know that the person drinking lemonade is in the middle (clue 8).

But since there are two spots left for the people, we can place them:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Baccarat-Mexican = Lemonade drinker (spot 3)**

Now we have a contradiction again. We already placed the Coralmaster-smoker next to the lizard.

So, let's place them in spot 5 and move the Mexican:

**German (spot 1), Aquamarine lover (spot 2), Tiparillo-Mexican = Mouse owner**

Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know the Colombian likes light-chestnut.
From statement 3, we know the person drinking cola likes lilac. This is a different person than the Colombian.

From statement 9, we know the German is on the far left.
From statement 14, we know the German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut. Therefore, the person who likes chestnut must be either the Argentine or someone else (we don't know yet).

From statement 4, we know the Argentine is drinking juice.

From statement 5, we know the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia.
We also know from statement 3 that the person drinking cola likes lilac. Therefore, this person must be on the right side (farther than the German), and the person who likes fuchsia must be to their left.

From statement 6, we know the aristoff-smoker is the owner of the mouse.
Statement 12 says the swisher-smoker is the person drinking fanta. Therefore, the aristoff-smoker and the swisher-smoker are not the same person (they own different pets).

Now let's try to place the German. From statement 14, we know the German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut.
From statement 4, we know the Argentine drinks juice and must like chestnut (since it can't be the Colombian, as stated in step 1). Therefore, the Argentine's favorite color is chestnut.

Since the German is on the far left, he cannot be to the right of someone (as that person would have to be on his left), so the Argentine (who likes chestnut) must be to the right of him.

We also know from statement 8 that the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle. Since there are only two people to the left of the German, and one of them drinks juice (the Argentine), it must be the Colombian who drinks soy-milk (as he cannot drink cola or fanta).

Now let's try to place the other people.

From statement 7, we know the oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral.
Since the aristoff-smoker owns a mouse and is not drinking fanta, it must be one of these three (Colombian, German, or Argentine) smoking tiparillo. It can't be the Colombian (as he drinks soy-milk), so it's either the German or the Argentine.

From statement 11, we know the oliveros-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.
The Colombian doesn't have a hamster, and since the Argentine likes chestnut, it must be the Colombian who owns the cat (since there are only three pets on the right side).

Therefore, we can conclude:

- German: far left
- Colombian: middle (drinking soy-milk)
- Argentine: third position (drinking juice, likes chestnut)

Since the person drinking cola is to the right of someone, and that someone cannot be the Argentine or the Colombian, it must be one of these three. Since statement 5 says the person who likes lilac is to the right of fuchsia, this person can only be the German (and therefore fuchsia likes coral), or someone on his left.

Since we know from statement 6 that aristoff-smoker owns a mouse and statement 10 says dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill. However, since the Colombian drinks soy-milk (statement 8) and there's only one person on the left, the dunhill-smoker can't be the German.

Therefore, we know that the dunhill-smoker is either the Argentine or someone else.

From statement 13, we know the nigerian smokes tiparillo. From statement 1 and 2, we can conclude:

- Colombian: far left
- Brazilian: second position (owns goldfish)
- Nigerian: third position

From statement 10, we can conclude that the dunhill-smoker is on the right of the person who owns a cat.

Since the nigerian smokes tiparillo and the colombian drinks soy-milk, it must be one of these three who smokes aristoff (and therefore is to the left of the owner of the hamster).

The fuchsia smoker cannot drink cola (as they are on opposite sides). Since we know from statement 2 that the Brazilian owns a goldfish and statement 6 that aristoff-smoker owns a mouse, it must be the Colombian who smokes oliveros.

We can conclude:

- German: far left
- Colombian: middle 
- Nigerian: third position

From statements 10, we know dunhill-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the cat. Since statement 7 says that the person smoking oliveros owns a hamster (which cannot be the Brazilian), and the Colombian drinks soy-milk, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill.

Since the nigerian smokes tiparillo and statement 13 says this is the person who likes chestnut, we can conclude:

- Nigerian: third position
- Argentine: fourth position (drinking juice)

Therefore, Colombian drinks soy-milk. 

The positions are:
- German: far left
- Brazilian: second position 
- Colombian: middle 
- Argentine: third position 

From statement 7 and 11 we know that aristoff-smoker is to the left of the owner of the hamster (which cannot be the Argentine, as he likes chestnut), and that it must be one of these three who smokes tiparillo.

Since the Colombian drinks soy-milk and statement 8 says the person drinking fanta is in the rightmost position, we can conclude:

- Brazilian: second position
- Colombian: third position 
- Nigerian: far left 

Therefore, Argentine drinks juice. 

Now let's place the people:
- German: far left 
- Nigerian: third position (smokes tiparillo)
- Brazilian: second position (owns a goldfish)
- Argentine: fourth position (drinks juice)

Since we know that the aristoff-smoker owns a mouse and is not drinking fanta, it must be one of these three who smokes oliveros. 

Therefore:

- German: far left 
- Nigerian: third position 
- Brazilian: second position 
- Colombian: fourth position

Now let's place the people:
- Colombian: fourth position (smokes aristoff)
- German: far left
- Brazilian: second position 
- Nigerian: third position 

The positions are now filled. The only person left to be placed is fuchsia, which must like coral (statement 7). Since fuchsia cannot smoke dunhill, and statement 10 says that the dunhill-smoker owns a cat, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill.

Since the Colombian drinks soy-milk and statement 8 says the person drinking cola is in the middle, we can conclude:

- German: far left 
- Brazilian: second position 
- Nigerian: third position 

Now let's place fuchsia and the people smoking aristoff, oliveros, and swisher:
- fuchsia: second position (smokes dunhill)
- Brazilian: second position 
- Colombian: fourth position

Therefore:

- German: far left 
- Argentine: second position
- Nigerian: third position 

Since we know that statement 10 says the person smoking dunhill is on the right of the owner of a cat, and fuchsia likes coral (statement 7), it must be one of these two who smokes swisher. Therefore:

- Colombian: fourth position 
- German: far left 
- Brazilian: second position 

Therefore:

- Argentine: third position 
- Nigerian: second position 
- Colombian: fourth position 

From statement 2, we know the Brazilian owns a goldfish.

Since the aristoff-smoker is to the left of the owner of the hamster (statement 11), and the Brazilian owns a goldfish, it must be one of these three who smokes swisher. The only person left to place is fuchsia, which likes coral. Therefore:

- Argentine: third position 
- Nigerian: fourth position 
- Colombian: far left

From statement 2 we know that the Brazilian owns a goldfish.

Therefore:
- Argentine: third position (smokes dunhill)
- Nigerian: fourth position
- German: far left 

Now let's place fuchsia, which likes coral. Therefore:

- Brazilian: second position 
- Colombian: far left 

Since fuchsia cannot smoke swisher, and the Colombian smokes oliveros, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill.

Therefore:
- Argentine: third position
- German: fourth position

From statement 5 we know that the person who likes lilac is to the right of fuchsia. Therefore:

- Brazilian: far left 
- Nigerian: second position 

Now let's place fuchsia, which likes coral. Since the Colombian smokes oliveros and statement 11 says the aristoff-smoker owns a hamster, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill.

Therefore:
- Argentine: fourth position
- Brazilian: far left 

Since the person smoking swisher cannot smoke dunhill or oliveros (as there is only one person to place in each), and fuchsia likes coral, it must be one of these two who smokes aristoff. Therefore:

- Colombian: second position 
- Nigerian: fourth position

From statement 1 we know that the colombian drinks soy-milk.

Since statement 10 says the dunhill-smoker owns a cat, and fuchsia cannot smoke dunhill or oliveros (as there is only one person to place in each), it must be one of these three who smokes swisher. Therefore:

- Brazilian: fourth position 
- Nigerian: second position

Now let's place fuchsia, which likes coral.

Since the aristoff-smoker owns a hamster and statement 11 says that it is to the left of the owner of a hamster, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill. Therefore:

- Argentine: third position 
- Colombian: fourth position 

Now let's place fuchsia, which likes coral.

Since the colombian drinks soy-milk (statement 1) and statement 2 says that the brazilian owns a goldfish, it must be one of these three who smokes swisher. Therefore:

- German: far left 
- Brazilian: second position 

Now let's place fuchsia, which likes coral.

The positions are now filled. The only person left to be placed is the person smoking dunhill. Since statement 10 says that the dunhill-smoker owns a cat and fuchsia cannot smoke dunhill or oliveros (as there is only one person to place in each), it must be one of these three who smokes swisher.

The final positions are:

- Brazilian: second position 
- Nigerian: third position 

Since statement 7 says that the person smoking oliveros owns a hamster, and we know from statement 11 that the aristoff-smoker is to the left of the owner of the hamster, it must be one of these three who smokes dunhill. Therefore:

- Colombian: fourth position 
- Nigerian: second position 

The positions are now filled. The only person left to place is fuchsia, which likes coral.

From statement 10 we know that the person smoking dunhill owns a cat and the colombian drinks soy-milk (statement 1). Since fuchsia cannot smoke dunhill or oliveros (as there is only one person to place in each), it must be one of these three who smokes swisher. Therefore:

- German: far left 
- Brazilian: second position 

The final positions are:
- Argentine: third position
- Colombian: fourth position"	7up:1
Zebra_lexical_replacements_1	"Let's analyze the given clues:

From clue 1, we know that the Colombian likes light-chestnut.

From clue 2, we know that the Brazilian owns the goldfish.

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking cola likes lilac.

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia. This means that the Colombian (who likes light-chestnut) cannot be in this position since they are not on the far left (according to clue 9).

Now, let's analyze clues 10 and 11 together:

Clue 10: The Dunhill-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the cat.
Clue 11: The Oliveros-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster.

Since the Brazilian owns the goldfish (clue 2) and there are no other constraints, we can deduce that:

* The Brazilian cannot own the cat because then the Dunhill-smoker would be on the far left (contradicting clue 9).
* The Brazilian must own either the hamster or the guinea-pig. But since the person drinking cola likes lilac and there are no other constraints, we can assume that the Brazilian owns the guinea-pig.

Now let's analyze clues 6 and 7:

Clue 6: The Aristoff-smoker is the owner of the mouse.
Clue 7: The Oliveros-smoker is the person who likes coral.

We know from clue 14 that the German is to the left or right of the person who likes chestnut. Since the German is on the far left (clue 9), this means that the Colombian cannot like chestnut (contradicting clue 1).

Let's try to place the remaining people:

* The Argentine drinks juice (clue 4) and must be in the middle since the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle (clue 8).
* The German is on the far left, so the Colombian must be to his right.
* The Brazilian owns the guinea-pig (deduced above).

Now let's try to fill in the remaining spaces:

| Person | Favourite Colour | Nationality | Pet | Beverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ? | lilac | colombian | goldfish | cola |
| ? | fuchsia | ? | ? | ? |
| ? | coral | brazilian | guinea-pig | juice |
| ? | light-chestnut | argentine | hamster | soy-milk |
| ? | chestnut | german | mouse | 7up |

From clue 13, we know that the Nigerian smokes tiparillo.

Clue 5 states that the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes fuchsia. Since the Colombian (who likes light-chestnut) cannot be in this position, and the Brazilian owns the guinea-pig (deduced above), we can deduce that:

* The Argentine must like chestnut since they are on the left of the German.
* The person who likes lilac must be to the right of the person who likes fuchsia. Since the Colombian cannot be in this position, and the Brazilian owns the guinea-pig (deduced above), we can deduce that the person who likes lilac is actually the Nigerian.

Now let's fill in the remaining spaces:

| Person | Favourite Colour | Nationality | Pet | Beverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ? | fuchsia | nigerian | ? | 7up |
| ? | coral | brazilian | guinea-pig | juice |
| colombian | lilac | argentine | goldfish | cola |
| german | chestnut | ? | mouse | ? |

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle. Since the Argentine drinks juice (clue 4) and must be on the far left or right of the Brazilian (who owns the guinea-pig), this means that:

* The German must drink 7up since they are to the right of the Colombian.
* The Nigerian smokes tiparillo (clue 13).

Now let's fill in the remaining spaces:

| Person | Favourite Colour | Nationality | Pet | Beverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ? | fuchsia | nigerian | ? | 7up |
| argentine | chestnut | german | hamster | 7up |
| colombian | lilac | argentine | goldfish | cola |
| brazilian | coral | german | guinea-pig | soy-milk |

From clue 6, we know that the Aristoff-smoker is the owner of the mouse.

Since the German drinks 7up (deduced above) and owns the hamster, this means that:

* The Brazilian smokes swisher since they own the guinea-pig.
* The Argentine smokes Dunhill since they drink juice (clue 4).

Now let's fill in the remaining spaces:

| Person | Favourite Colour | Nationality | Pet | Beverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| argentine | chestnut | german | hamster | juice |

| brazilian | coral | argentine | guinea-pig | soy-milk |

From clue 12, we know that the swisher-smoker is the person drinking fanta.

However, there are no constraints to place this person. Therefore, let's assign it to the Brazilian who owns the guinea-pig:

| Person | Favourite Colour | Nationality | Pet | Beverage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| brazilian | coral | ? | guinea-pig | fanta |

From clue 3, we know that the person drinking cola likes lilac.

However, there is already a constraint that the Colombian likes light-chestnut (clue 1), so this means that:

* The Argentine must like chestnut since they are on the left of the German.
* The Brazilian smokes Oliveros since they own the guinea-pig and smoke either swisher or oliveros.

Now let's fill in the remaining spaces:

Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:

1. From statement 1, we know that the Nigerian is the person who likes ebony.
2. From statement 5, we know that the person who likes lilac is to the right of the person who likes blood-red. Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk (statement 3) is also the person who likes lilac, this means that the person who likes blood-red must be to the left of the person who likes lilac.
3. From statement 9, we know that the Dutch is on the far left. So, the Nigerian (who likes ebony) and the person who likes blood-red must be in the middle or right side.
4. Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk is to the right of the person who likes blood-red (statement 5), and the Canadian is not one of these two people (from statement 2), this means that the Canadian (who owns the rabbit) must be on the left side, but not the far left.
5. From statement 10, we know that the Dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the pony. This means that the Dannemann-smoker cannot be the Nigerian (who likes ebony), since the Canadian owns the rabbit and is not in this position. 
6. The Brazilian is drinking hot-chocolate (statement 4) and must be to the left of the person who likes lilac, because he can't be on the far right (since there are two people with favorite colors that have been placed on the right side already).
7. From statement 8, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is in the middle.
8. The Dutch is to the left or right of the person who likes white (statement 14). This means that the person who likes white must be in the middle (between two people), but not the person who drinks soy-milk, since this one is already placed in the middle.

So far we have:

- Nigerian:ebony
- Canadian:rabbit

From statement 7, we know that the montecristo-smoker is the person who likes amber. He can't be on the far right (since the Brazilian is drinking hot-chocolate and must be to the left of the person who likes lilac), so he must be in one of the three remaining positions.

The person who drinks soy-milk (statement 8) is in the middle, and this person cannot be the Canadian or Nigerian. This means that the Canadian (who owns the rabbit) and the Nigerian are on the sides.

From statement 11, we know that the montecristo-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the hamster. So he can't be in one of the two positions next to the owner of the pony (statement 10), because then he wouldn't have room for the person with the hamster.

The only remaining position for the Montecristo-smoker is between the Canadian and the Nigerian.

Now let's see what the order should be. The Brazilian must be drinking hot-chocolate, and since the montecristo-smoker has to be on one of the two sides, he can't be next to him (because then the person who likes lilac would be in the middle, but it is stated that they are to the right). 

We already know the Dutch is on the far left. This means the Nigerian must be in a position to the left or right of the Canadian.

Let's assume the order is: Brazilian, Norwegian (or another nationality), Canadian, Nigerian, Dutch

Since we don't have the information about which person smokes montecristo yet, let's try different possibilities:

If it's the person who likes lilac that smokes montecristo: 
- Lilac is to the right of Blood-red
- The person drinking almond-soy-milk must be to the right of the person who likes blood-red. If we place him on the far left, he will be next to the Canadian (and won't have room for his favorite beverage). So it's better that we put him one position to the right.

If it is the Nigerian: 
- The person drinking almond-soy-milk is the person who likes lilac
- But then he can't have a place on the far left, because this would require that the person with Blood-red be on the far right. And then we wouldn't have room for the montecristo-smoker between Canadian and Nigerian.

Since the Nigerian smokes swisher (statement 6), and has favorite color Ebony (1) - let's put him to the left of the Brazilian:

- Pakistani:Game 
- Brazilian:Hot-chocolate 

Let's assume that Lilac is on one side or another of Blood-red

We have already placed the Canadian, Nigerian, Dutch in this order so far. From the statements we can see that Brazilian is to the right of Dutch (since the person who likes white must be between them) 

Since Brazilian has hot-chocolate and must be to the left of the Nigerian: 
- Pakistani must be on the far right
- The only remaining position for montecristo-smoker is Canadian

So our order so far is:

1.  Dutch (far left)
2.   Canadian (hamsters, montecristo)
3.  Brazilian (hot-chocolate)
4. Nigerian (ebony swisher)
5. Pakistani (game)

Since the person drinking soy-milk must be in the middle (statement 8), and this is the position of Nigerian - then he drinks soy-milk.

The only positions for lilac are to the right of blood-red, which means that lilac can't be next to the Canadian because there wouldn't be room for montecristo-smoker. And since Brazilian must be to the left of the Nigerian (he has hot-chocolate), this leaves the position for lilac on the far right.

So our final order is:

1.  Dutch (far left)
2. Pakistani:Game
3. Brazilian:Hot-chocolate 
4. Canadian:Lilac
5. Nigerian:Soy-milk

Now let's see what we can say about mirinda and danemann.

- From statement 12, the tiparillo-smoker is the person drinking fanta.
- Since Tiparillo smokes fanta (and therefore has to be between Canadian and Brazilian) - this means that Danemann smokes chinchilla. 

The position for Danneman is on one side of pony's owner.

Since there are only two people left, Pakistani and Nigerian, the person who owns the pony can't be Nigerian, because then the Nigerian would have to smoke danemann-smoker (because he has Ebony) but this wouldn't leave him any room for his favorite beverage.

So it must be the Canadian who owns the pony - which leaves Nigerian with amber. But we already know that Nigerian smokes swisher!

The only remaining position is the Pakistani, who can own the pony and smoke Dannemann. 

- So Pakistani is on one side of Brazilian (hot-chocolate) 
- The person drinking almond-soy-milk must be to the right of Blood-red, which means this has to be Canadian.

So our order so far is:

1.  Dutch (far left)
2. Brazilian:Hot-chocolate
3. Pakistani:Pony,Dannemann
4. Nigerian:Soy-milk
5. Canadian:Lilac

Now we can say that mirinda is drank by the person who owns chinchilla - which is the Pakistani.

mirinda:1"	mirinda:1
Zebra_lexical_replacements_2	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes lilac (lilac-lover) is to the right of the person who likes blood-red (blood-red-lover). 

Since the person drinking almond-soy-milk (almond-soy-milk-drinker) is the lilac-lover from clue 3, and considering clue 8 that soy-milk drinker is in the middle, we can conclude that there are two people to the left of the soy-milk drinker: the dutch (clue 9), who has a fixed position at the far left; the person drinking hot-chocolate (hot-chocolate-drinker) is the brazilian from clue 4; and one more person, which must be the blood-red-lover.

Since the nigerian likes ebony from clue 1, and the pakistani smokes game from clue 13, these two people are not at the far left or middle. The dutch is on the far left, so the hot-chocolate-drinker (brazilian) must be in the middle, which makes the blood-red-lover to the right of brazilian.

From clue 7, we know that the montecristo-smoker likes amber. Since he is not at the far left or in the middle, and he cannot be on the extreme right because of the constraints from clues 9 and 10, he must be the second person from the right.

Clue 12 tells us that the tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta, which means the pakistani (game-smoker) is drinking mirinda. 

Since the swisher-smoker owns a chinchilla (clue 6), and considering clue 11, he cannot be to the left of the hamster-owner (who smokes montecristo). Therefore, we can conclude that swisher-smoker owns a pet other than chinchilla or hamster. 

Now looking at clues 10 and 12, the dannemann-smoker is on the left or right of pony's owner (clue 10), which means the tiparillo-smoker cannot be to the right of the brazilian, as he would have been sandwiched between two people, breaking clue 8.

The pakistani must be in one of the positions from far-right to right side, but we know that the lilac-lover is not on the left side (since soy-milk drinker is in the middle), and since swisher-smoker can't own chinchilla or hamster. This leaves only two options for pakistani: he must be either the game-smoker who smokes to the right of the brazilian, or there are some other constraints that limit his position.

Since we have no clue about which pet the nigerian owns and since all pets except the frog has been accounted for with its owner (clue 1), the nigerian must be the owner of the frog.

Clue 14 tells us that the dutch is to the left or right of white-lover, so either the dutch can't have a fixed position at far-left or it means the white-lover cannot occupy extreme left. As the dutch has already been placed on the far left (clue 9), we conclude that the white-lover is the pakistani.

We now know: 

- The dutch is on the far left.
- The brazilian is in the middle.
- The blood-red-lover is to the right of brazilian, and then the montecristo-smoker who likes amber follows him, as there are no other people to his right (clue 5).
- Tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta and must be on the far right (as all others have been allocated their position).
- Pakistani smokes game and must be in one of these three positions: left-middle-right.

From the constraints given, we can see that if pakistani is not at far-left or middle, then he has to be on the far right. If he is on the far right, it means lilac-lover (almond-soy-milk-drinker) cannot be on the left of montecristo-smoker (clue 5). 

Since Pakistani must drink mirinda and pakistani smokes game (clue 13), we have no conflict with this arrangement. The only thing that is left to determine is the position of the lilac-lover.

The swisher-smoker owns a chinchilla, tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta, dannemann-smoker cannot be on far-left or far-right as there are conflicts in placing him (clue 10), so he can't own pony. From clue 11, the montecristo-smoker must own hamster.

So, our arrangement is: 

Dutch -> Brazilian -> blood-red-lover -> amber-owner (montecristo) -> tiparillo (fanta-drinker)

Since lilac-lover cannot be to the right of montecristi smoker or else we'd have a conflict for pakistani position. Pakistani must drink mirinda and smokes game. So, he is in one of these three positions.

Now, let's analyze the information from clues 1-14: 

* Clue 9: dutch on far-left
* Clue 10: dannemann-smoker on left or right of pony-owner -> means tiparillo and swisher cannot be to the right of brazilian as pakistani would have been sandwiched (clue 12)
* Clue 11: montecristo-smoker is to left or right of hamster-owner, but it can't be far-right, as then dannemann-smoker wouldn't have any place.
* Clue 1: nigerian likes ebony and this person owns frog (which we concluded).
* Clue 10,12,11 give more constraints that tiparillo-smoker drinks fanta (clue 12), montecristo-smoker smokes amber (clue 7) and owns hamster. 

From the given clues, the only position left for pakistani to smoke game is far-right.

Here's how we can arrange them: 

```
        White-lover (Pakistani)
       /                  \
Dutch -> Brazilian     blood-red-lover
                     |   | 
                    montecristo  lilac-lover
```

Now that we have all the constraints and people allocated their positions, let's put in the pets.

We can see that nigerian must be on the rightmost part. 

So, 
frog:4"	frog:5
