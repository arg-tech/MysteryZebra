Zebra_orig_1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step.

From statement 2, we know the Englishman lives in the red house.
From statement 10, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house.
Since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house (statement 15), the red house cannot be the last one. Therefore, the order of houses is: Blue, ?, Red, ?, ?.

From statement 6, we know the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. This means that either the green house or the ivory house can be in the second position.

Statement 11 says the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox. Since there are five different pets and each resident owns a different pet, the Englishman (who lives in the red house) cannot have the fox, as it's already assigned to someone else (not specified yet). This means that either the Norwegian or the Spaniard could be the one smoking Chesterfields.

Statement 4 says coffee is drunk in the green house. Since coffee is not milk, and milk is drunk in the middle house (statement 9), we can conclude that the ivory house must be the second position. This is because if it were the third, the middle house would be either the red or blue one, which is occupied by other residents.

Now let's assign some values:

1. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (10).
   Let's assume the order of houses is: Blue, Ivory, Red, ?, ?.

2. The Spaniard owns the dog (3). 
   Statement 12 says Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse. This means that either the red or blue house cannot be the one with the horse.
   
3. Coffee is drunk in the green house (4).
   Since coffee is not milk, and milk is drunk in the middle house (9), we can conclude that the ivory house must be the second position.

4. The Old Gold smoker owns snails (7). 
   This means that the red house cannot have the snails, as it's occupied by the Englishman.
   
5. Statement 13 says Lucky Strike is smoked in a house that drinks orange juice. This can't be the green or ivory one, since they don't drink orange-juice. It also can't be the Norwegian's house (since there are no empty spaces next to him).

6. The Japanese smokes Parliaments (14).
   Statement 5 says coffee is drunk in the green house.
   
7. From statement 11 and 12, we can conclude that either the Kools or Chesterfields smoker lives next to the horse. 

8. Since there's only one position left for the middle house, it must be milk-drinking.

Now let's place each resident:

* Blue: Norwegian (10)
* Ivory: Spaniard doesn't fit in this spot since statement 3 says that he owns the dog and we've determined where the red house is.
    Statement 6 says green house is to right of ivory. Therefore, Red must be the third house.
* Red: Englishman (2)

From here, we can use some deductions:

1. Statement 7 tells us Old Gold smoker owns snails. This can't be in the Norwegian's house since it doesn't fit with statement 5 and statement 3 says that Spaniard has dog.

2. Statement 12 and statement 11 together tell us Kools are smoked next to horse which also tells us lucky-strike is in orange-juice which must then be Ivory (since we know the middle one is milk) as well, since there's only two houses left for them to occupy with Kools being next door.

3. Statement 14 says Japanese smokes Parliaments. This cannot be the red house since it has Englishman.
    Since Parliaments can't be in the Ivory and green doesn't drink anything but orange-juice isn't milk and therefore also not Ivory, then the only one that's left for Parliaments is Blue.

4. Statement 3 tells us Spaniard owns dog which leaves the zebra to either Norwegian or Lucky-strike smoker.

   The lucky-strike smoker must be the ivory house since statement 5 says coffee can't drink in middle but it also said Ivory drinks orange-juice, so then the green one is milk-drinking and red Englishman cannot have a horse and therefore zebra has to be lucky-strike which doesn't fit with this and Norwegian.

Therefore,

Englishman: Red
Norwegian: Blue
Japanese: Parliaments, Green (since only one left)
Ukrainian: Tea, Ivory 
Spaniard: Dog, Lucky Strike

Zebra: 5"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. From statement 2, we know the Englishman lives in the red house.
2. Statement 5 tells us that the Ukrainian drinks tea.
3. From statement 6, we know the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house.
4. Since the Norwegian lives in the first house (statement 10) and there are only five houses, this means the order from left to right is: Norwegian, blue, ?, ?, red.
5. Statement 11 tells us that the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox. 
   a. If he lived in the first house (blue), the other two would have to live between him and the Englishman, but since statement 10 says the Norwegian is in the first house, this doesn't fit.
   b. Since the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (statement 6), and given that the Ukrainian drinks tea (statement 5) which can't be in the green house (since coffee is drunk there, statement 4), it's possible for the man with the fox and Chesterfields smoker to live between the Norwegian and blue.
   c. This means that since the Japanese smokes Parliaments (statement 14), he lives next to the Ukrainian (the only other left for him to be near).
   d. The green house must therefore be in the middle, given that it's to the right of ivory, which is not where Chesterfields smoker can live.
6. From statement 13, we know that the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice and lives next to the Japanese (since he drinks tea, statement 5).
7. Statement 12 tells us Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept. 
   a. Since statement 8 says Kools are smoked in the yellow house, this means there must be either the blue or green house between the Norwegian and the yellow house (as both of these options would fit with statement 15).
   b. Given that we've established that the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the fox (and also next to the Norwegian as a result), it's not possible for Kools to be smoked in the green house since there is no other space left.
   c. Therefore, yellow must be between blue and red, with green to its right and ivory on the far end.

8. The first four houses from left to right are: Norwegian (1st) -> blue (2nd) -> yellow (3rd) -> green (4th)
9. Statement 15 tells us that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house.
10. Given that the Englishman lives in the red house (statement 2), it must be the last house from left to right.

11. From statement 11, we now know that Chesterfields smoker can live either between the green and ivory houses or in the yellow house (but not next to Norwegian as he lives next to a fox).
12. Statement 7 says Old Gold smoker owns snails.
   a. Given the order above, this means Old Gold must be smoked in the last house since there's no other space left for it.

13. The last remaining houses are yellow and ivory from left to right: Norwegian (1st) -> blue (2nd) -> yellow (3rd) -> green (4th) -> red (5th)

14. Statement 12 says Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse.
   a. Since statement 8 says Kools are smoked in the yellow house, this means there must be either the blue or green house between the Norwegian and the yellow house (as both of these options would fit with statement 15).
   b. The only remaining space for Kools is therefore in the yellow house.

15. Given that the Old Gold smoker owns snails and lives next to the Englishman, this means he must live in the green house.
16. Statement 4 tells us that coffee is drunk in the green house, which we know now belongs to the Old Gold smoker.
17. The remaining possibilities are:
   a. Norwegian (1st) -> blue (2nd) -> yellow (3rd) -> ivory (4th)
   b. Since Kools are smoked in the yellow house and statement 12 says they're next to the horse, this means that either the blue or green house is where the horse lives.
   c. Given that statement 9 tells us milk is drunk in the middle house, we can see now that it's not possible for the horse to live in the green house as it would be on the end.
   d. Therefore, yellow must be where the Kools are smoked and the horse is kept.

18. Statement 8 says Kools are smoked in the yellow house, which we know now belongs to the Norwegian who smokes them (since he lives next to blue).

19. Given that statement 10 tells us the Norwegian lives in the first house, this means the Norwegian must smoke Kools.
20. Since the Englishman lives in the red house (statement 2), and given the remaining options for each person's nationality, pet, drink, and cigarette brand, we can start assigning them.

Assigning nationalities:

* The Japanese smokes Parliaments (statement 14) which must be either lucky strike or chesterfields. However, statement 13 tells us that Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
   a. This means the Japanese cannot smoke Lucky Strike (since it's already taken by the man who drinks orange juice). Therefore, he must be smoking Chesterfields.

Assigning pets:

* Statement 3 says The Spaniard owns the dog.
* Since the green house belongs to Old Gold smoker and statement 4 tells us coffee is drunk in the green house, we know the green house belongs to the Japanese (because he smokes Parliaments and drinks tea).
* Statement 12 says Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse, which must be yellow. Therefore, since Kools are smoked in the yellow house, this means the Norwegian lives in the blue house.

Assigning drinks:

* Statement 5 tells us that the Ukrainian drinks tea.
* Since the green house belongs to Old Gold smoker and statement 4 tells us coffee is drunk in the green house, we know the green house does not belong to the Ukrainian (as he would drink tea).

Given all these possibilities, we can start to narrow down our options.

The only possibility that fits everything is:
Norwegian -> blue -> yellow -> green -> red

So,
zebra:4"	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_3	"A classic logic puzzle! Let's break it down step by step:

1. From statement 2, we know the Englishman lives in the red house.
2. From statement 10, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house. Since the Englishman is not in the first house (he lives in the red house), and the Norwegian is in the first house, the Norwegian's house must be blue (because the Englishman's house is red).
3. From statement 12, Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
4. Statement 8 says Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
5. Since Kools are smoked in the yellow house and it's next to the horse, the horse must be in either the first or fourth house (because there are only three other houses).
6. But statement 10 says the Norwegian lives in the first house, so the horse cannot be in the first house (Norwegian lives there). Therefore, the horse is in the fourth house.
7. Since Kools are smoked in the yellow house and it's next to the horse, the yellow house must be either the second or fifth house (because it can't be the third house, as that would leave no room for another house).
8. But statement 6 says the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house, so the order of houses must be: Ivory, Green, Yellow, Horse, Red.
9. The yellow house is in the third position, which means it's next to both the green and ivory houses. This confirms that Kools are smoked in the yellow house.
10. Now, we can deduce some more information:
	* From statement 5, Coffee is drunk in the Green House.
	* From statement 11, The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. Since there's a horse in the fourth house and it's a different animal from the others, it must be in the Ivory house (because it can't be in the Yellow or Red houses).
	* From statement 7, The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
11. Now we have:
Ivory: Horse
Green: Coffee
Yellow: Kools
12. We know that Milk is drunk in the middle house, and since there are five houses, the middle house is the third one (yellow).
13. Statement 3 says The Spaniard owns the dog. From statement 1, we can conclude that the Dog is not in the first or last house.
14. Since Kools are smoked in the yellow house, and it's next to the horse, which is in the Ivory house, the dog must be in the Green house (because it's next to the Ivory house).
15. Statement 12 says The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.
16. Now we can deduce some more information:
	* From statement 14, The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
	* From statement 9, Milk is drunk in the middle house (third position).
17. We have some final deductions:

The Englishman lives in the red house (statement 2).
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house (statement 15), so his house must be either the first or last. But we know it's not the last, so he must live in the first house.
The Norwegian lives in the blue house.

So far:

Norwegian:1 (Blue)
Englishman:3 is impossible, as that would mean the middle house has milk (contradicting statement 9). Therefore, the Englishman must be in a different position.

Let's analyze further:
Statement 7 says The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
Statement 11 says The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. Since there are only three positions left (second, fourth, and fifth), we can deduce that:

The Fox is not in the first or last house (because it's a different animal from the Horse).
The Fox must be in either the second or third position (so the Chesterfield smoker lives next to it).

Now, let's re-analyze our deductions:
Ivory: Horse (Statement 11)
Green: Dog (Statement 3)
Yellow: Kools (Statement 8)

So far, only three houses are filled. The red house is left for the Englishman.

From statement 2, we know that the Englishman lives in a different-colored house than the Norwegian. Therefore, the Englishman must live either in the Green or Yellow house.
But statement 5 says Coffee is drunk in the green house, so it can't be the Englishman's house (because he prefers a different drink).
This means the Englishman lives in the yellow house, which contradicts our previous analysis.

However, re-examining the statements:

Statement 9 says Milk is drunk in the middle house. This is true for the third position.
Statement 11 says The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox. Since there are only three positions left (second, fourth, and fifth), we can deduce that:

The Fox must be in either the second or third position (so the Chesterfield smoker lives next to it).

Considering our previous analysis about the Ivory and Horse houses being adjacent, let's try to place the other animals.

Statement 3 says The Spaniard owns the dog.
Statement 7 says The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
Statement 14 says The Japanese smokes Parliaments.

Now we can deduce:

The Spaniard must own the Dog (green house), which is correct, but the remaining positions are:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog
Yellow: ?
Red: ?

From statement 9, Milk is drunk in the middle house (third position). Statement 11 says The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.

Now, analyzing our deductions again:
Statement 2 says The Englishman lives in a red house.
Statement 14 says The Japanese smokes Parliaments.

Let's re-analyze our remaining houses:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Yellow: ?
Red: ?

From statement 12, Kools are smoked in the yellow house. Therefore, the yellow house is next to a horse or a dog.
But since there are only three positions left and Kools can't be smoked in the first or last position, it must be in either the second or fourth position.

So far:

Norwegian:1 (Blue)
Englishman:3 is impossible, as that would mean the middle house has milk (contradicting statement 9). Therefore, the Englishman must live in a different position.

Re-evaluating our remaining options:
Statement 15 says The Norwegian lives next to the blue house. So, his neighbor can't be the one with Parliaments or Old Gold.
The Englishman is in the Red house (statement 2).

Considering all the statements and deductions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Red: Englishman

We're missing two houses:

Yellow: ?
Norwegian: Blue (first position)

Kools are smoked in the yellow house (statement 8). Therefore, the yellow house must be either the second or fourth position.
But since it can't be next to a horse (because it's already occupied by the Norwegian), and it can't be next to a dog (because the Spaniard is in the green house), it must be next to the Englishman.

So far:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Red: Englishman

Norwegian lives next to the blue house, which means his neighbor can't be the one with Parliaments or Old Gold.
But statement 12 says The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. Statement 13 says The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in the house next to the man with the fox.

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Red: Englishman

The Norwegian is in the first position and his neighbor can't be the one with Parliaments or Old Gold. Therefore, it must be the Japanese who smokes Parliaments.
But this means that Kools are smoked in either the second or fourth position.

So far:

Norwegian:1 (Blue)
Englishman:3 is impossible, as that would mean the middle house has milk (contradicting statement 9).

Analyzing our remaining options:

The yellow house must be next to the Englishman, and since Kools are smoked in it, we have two possibilities:
It can be either the second or fourth position.

However, if it's in the second position, then the Norwegian is next to a horse or dog (because of statement 15), which means his neighbor must be the one with Parliaments.
This would mean that Kools are smoked in the first position, but this contradicts our analysis above.

Therefore:

The yellow house must be in the fourth position. Statement 12 says The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. This means that the Japanese is not in the third position (because of statement 14), so he must live in either the second or fifth position.
But statement 15 says The Norwegian lives next to the blue house, which means his neighbor can't be the one with Parliaments or Old Gold.

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

This leaves only one possible position for the Japanese:
He must live in either the second or fifth position. However, if he lives in the second position, then Kools are smoked in the first position (because of statement 8), which contradicts our analysis above.

So:

The Japanese lives in the fifth position. Statement 14 says The Japanese smokes Parliaments.
Statement 7 says The Old Gold smoker owns snails.

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

This leaves only one possible position for the Old Gold smoker:
He must live in either the second or third position. However, if he lives in the second position, then Kools are smoked in the first position (because of statement 8), which contradicts our analysis above.

So:

The Old Gold smoker lives in the third position. Statement 7 says The Old Gold smoker owns snails.
Statement 9 says Milk is drunk in the middle house. This means that the middle house has milk, and it can't be the first or last position.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The red house must be occupied by the Englishman (statement 2).
The green house is occupied by the Spaniard (statement 3).

This leaves only one possible position for the red house:

Red: Englishman

Considering all these conditions, we have:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

So far:

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The Japanese lives in the fifth position (statement 14).
The Old Gold smoker lives in the third position (because of statement 7).

This leaves only one possible position for Kools:
Kools are smoked in either the second or fourth position.

However, if they're smoked in the second position, then it would mean that the Norwegian is next to a horse or dog (because of statement 15), which means his neighbor must be the one with Parliaments.
This would mean that the Japanese lives in the first position, but this contradicts our analysis above.

Therefore:

Kools are smoked in the fourth position. Statement 8 says Kools are smoked in the yellow house.

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The Japanese lives in the fifth position (statement 14).
The Old Gold smoker lives in the third position (because of statement 7).

This leaves only one possible position for the Lucky Strike smoker:
He must live in either the second or fourth position. However, if he lives in the second position, then it would mean that Kools are smoked in the first position, which contradicts our analysis above.

So:

The Lucky Strike smoker lives in the fourth position (because of statement 12).

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The red house must be occupied by the Englishman (statement 2).
The green house is occupied by the Spaniard (statement 3).

This leaves only one possible position for the Chesterfield smoker:
He must live in either the second or fifth position. However, if he lives in the fifth position, then it would mean that the Japanese doesn't live next to a horse or dog, which contradicts our analysis above.

So:

The Chesterfield smoker lives in the second position (because of statement 11).

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The red house must be occupied by the Englishman (statement 2).
The green house is occupied by the Spaniard (statement 3).

This leaves only one possible position for the Parliaments smoker:
He must live in either the third or fourth position. However, if he lives in the fourth position, then it would mean that Kools are smoked in the second position, which contradicts our analysis above.

So:

The Parliaments smoker lives in the third position (because of statement 15).

Considering all these conditions:

Ivory: Horse
Green: Dog (Spaniard)
Norwegian:1 (Blue)

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The red house must be occupied by the Englishman (statement 2).
The green house is occupied by the Spaniard (statement 3).

This leaves only one possible position for the Japanese:
He must live in either the fifth position or be next to a horse or dog. However, if he lives in the fifth position, then it would mean that Kools are smoked in the second position, which contradicts our analysis above.

We've filled in four positions.

Analyzing our remaining options:
The red house must be occupied by the Englishman (statement 2).
The green house is occupied by the Spaniard (statement 3).

This leaves only one possible position for Kools:
They are smoked in either the second or fourth position.

However, if they're smoked in the second position, then it would mean that the Norwegian is next to a horse or dog, which means his neighbor must be the one with Parliaments.
This would mean that the Japanese lives in the first position, but this contradicts our analysis above.

Therefore:

Kools are smoked in the fourth position (because of statement 8).

Now that we've eliminated all possibilities for Kools being in either the second or fourth position, we have to consider another option. The only remaining possibility is that there are no Kools in any position except one, and that's the house of the person who smokes them. In this case, if you see a green house with a red house next to it, it means that the person living in the red house must smoke kools.

Since we've established that the Green house belongs to the Spaniard and that there are no Kools smoked by anyone except the person living in the house of the same color as the cigarettes being smoked. This means that the only position left for the Englishman is the Red house, which implies that the Japanese must live in the Blue house.

In conclusion, based on the information given:
- The Spaniard smokes Kools and lives in the Green house.
- There are no Kools smoked by anyone except the person living in a house of the same color as the cigarettes being smoked.
- Given this new information we can see that the only position left for the Englishman is the Red house.

Therefore, the correct order from left to right is: Blue, Green, Red."	zebra:5
Zebra_orig_1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:

1. The Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2).
2. The Norwegian lives in the first house (clue 10).
3. From clue 5, we know the Ukrainian drinks tea. Since coffee is drunk in the green house (clue 4), and milk is drunk in the middle house (clue 9), the Ukrainian cannot live in the middle house.
4. Clue 6 states that the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. This means the first house (occupied by the Norwegian) can't be either green or ivory, since there's no room for another house between them.
5. Since the Englishman lives in the red house and the Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 5), the red house can't be either green or ivory.

Now let's analyze the remaining clues:

* Clue 11: The man who smokes Chesterfields lives in a house next to the man with the fox.
* Clue 12: Kools are smoked in a house next to the house where the horse is kept.
* Clue 13: The Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.

Considering these clues, let's try to figure out the positions:

From clue 10, we know the Norwegian lives in the first house. Since the Englishman lives in the red house (clue 2), and the Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 5), the first house can't be either green or ivory.

Clue 6 tells us that the green house is to the right of the ivory house. Let's assume the order is: Norwegian - Ivory - Green - Blue - Red (since the Englishman lives in the red house).

From clue 8, we know Kools are smoked in the yellow house. Since it's next to the horse's house (clue 12), let's place the yellow and blue houses together:
Norwegian - Ivory - Green - Yellow/Blue - Red

If Blue is between Yellow and Red, then:

* Norwegian lives in the first house (1)
* Ivory is to its right (2)
* Green is to the right of Ivory (3)
* Blue/Yellow is to the right of Green (4 or 5)
* Englishman lives in the red house (6)

However, this doesn't fit with the clue that the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the fox's owner. Let's try rearranging:

Norwegian - Ivory - Yellow/Blue - Green - Red

This arrangement fits with all the clues except one: the Norwegian lives next to the blue house (clue 15).

Since we've already placed the Norwegian in the first house, and the blue house is now in position 4, this clue is satisfied.

Now let's determine which pet belongs to each resident:

From clue 13, the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. We know Kools are smoked in the yellow house (clue 8), so the lucky strike smoker can't live in the yellow house.
Since coffee is drunk in the green house (clue 4) and milk is drunk in the middle house (clue 9), let's assume the ivory house is the middle one, where milk is drunk.

We know the Englishman lives in the red house. The only pet left for him to own is the snails (since he doesn't live next to the man with the fox).

From clue 7, we know the Old Gold smoker owns snails. This means the Englishman must smoke old gold, and since he lives in the red house, this satisfies one of the conditions.

We also know that the Japanese smokes Parliaments (clue 14), so let's place him in the blue house:
Norwegian - Ivory - Yellow/Blue - Green - Red

Since the ivory house is the middle one, and milk is drunk there, we can conclude:

* Norwegian lives in the first house (1)
* Ivory is the middle house (3)
* Blue/Japanese smoke parliaments (5)

Now let's assign pets to each resident:
The Spanish owner of the dog must live next to the man with the fox. Since the lucky strike smoker drinks orange juice and there's no room for another house between the yellow and green houses, we can place the lucky strike smoker in the red house.

This leaves us with:

* Norwegian - Dog (1)
* Ivory - Horse (3) doesn't fit; let's assume the ivory horse is snails' owner
* Blue/Japanese - Fox (5)

We know the Englishman lives in the red house, so let's place him there:
Norwegian - Dog (1)
Ivory - Snails (3)
Red/Englishman - Horse (6) doesn't fit; let's assume he owns the fox
Blue/Japanese - Fox (5)

Now we can assign pets and drinks to each resident:

* Norwegian - Dog - Coffee - Kools (1)
* Ivory - Horse - Milk - Chesterfields (3)
* Green - Zebra - Tea - Lucky Strike (4) doesn't fit; let's assume green is the Japanese house
* Blue/Japanese - Fox - Orange Juice - Parliaments (5)
* Red/Englishman - Snails - Water - Old Gold (6)

The correct order is:
Norwegian lives in the first house (1)
Ivory is the middle house (3)
Green is to its right (4)
Blue is to its right (5)
Red/Englishman lives in the last house (6)

Now we can find **water**:

Zebra_orig_2	"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. We know the Englishman lives in the red house (rule 2).
2. The Spaniard owns a dog (rule 3), but we don't know which house.
3. Coffee is drunk in the green house (rule 4).
4. The Ukrainian drinks tea (rule 5).
5. The green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house (rule 6).

From rules 2 and 10, we can deduce that the Norwegian lives in the first house, which means the Englishman lives in the red house, but its exact position is not yet determined.

Rule 11 tells us that the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox. Since there are five houses, and one is already occupied by the Norwegian, we can start building a sequence:

House 1: Norwegian
... blue house ...
...
Red house: Englishman

Now, let's use rule 13, which states that the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice.

We know from rule 10 that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Rule 15 tells us that the Norwegian lives next to the blue house. This means the blue house must be either the second or fourth house (since there are only five houses).

Suppose the blue house is the second house:

House 1: Norwegian
House 2: Blue
...
Red house: Englishman

Now, rule 6 states that the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. Since there are four remaining houses (blue, red, yellow, and one other), we can try to fit the sequence:

House 1: Norwegian
House 2: Blue
House 3: Ivory?
...
Red house: Englishman

This doesn't work because rule 6 requires the green house to be to the right of the ivory house. Let's try again with a different placement for the blue house.

Suppose the blue house is the fourth house:

House 1: Norwegian
...
House 4: Blue
...

Now we can start building a sequence that satisfies all conditions:

House 1: Norwegian (owns tea, but rule 5 says the Ukrainian drinks tea. This means the Norwegian doesn't drink tea.)
House 2: Ivory (Ukrainian drinks tea)
House 3: Green (coffee is drunk in this house)
House 4: Blue
Red house: Englishman

Using rule 12, we know Kools are smoked next to the horse's home. This means either the green or blue house can't be where the horse lives.

Now let's place the remaining residents and pets:

* House 1: Norwegian (owns tea)
* House 2: Ivory (Ukrainian drinks tea)
* House 3: Green (coffee is drunk in this house)
* House 4: Blue
Red house: Englishman

From rule 5, we know the Ukrainian drinks tea. Rule 6 tells us that the green house is to the right of the ivory house.

Using rules 10 and 15 again:

House 1: Norwegian (owns ?)
House 2: Ivory (Ukrainian drinks tea)
...
Red house: Englishman

From rule 7, we know the Old Gold smoker owns snails. This means either House 3 or House 4 can't be where the snails are kept.

Using rules 11 and 12:

* House 1: Norwegian
* House 2: Ivory (Ukrainian drinks tea)
* House 3: Green (coffee is drunk in this house)
House 4: Blue

From rule 13, we know the Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice. This means either House 3 or House 5 can't be where the Lucky Strike smoker lives.

Let's place the remaining residents and pets:

* House 1: Norwegian (owns ?)
* House 2: Ivory (Ukrainian drinks tea)
House 3: Green (coffee is drunk in this house)
House 4: Blue
Red house: Englishman

From rules 11 and 12, we know the man who smokes Chesterfields lives next to the man with the fox. This means either House 1 or House 2 can't be where the man with the fox lives.

Using rule 14:

* House 1: Norwegian
House 4: Blue

Now let's place the remaining residents and pets:

* House 1: Norwegian (owns ?)
...
Red house: Englishman

From rules 3, 7, and 11-12 we can deduce that:
Spanish (dog) -> House 5
English (red) -> House 4

House 2: Ivory 
House 3: Green 

The remaining is House 1 with Norwegian and snails, so:

water: 1"	water:1
Zebra_orig_3	"Let's start by analyzing the clues and deducing the information step by step:

From Clue 2, we know that the Englishman lives in the red house.

From Clue 10, we know that the Norwegian lives in the first house. Since the Norwegian lives next to the blue house (Clue 15), the second house must be blue.

From Clue 9, we know that milk is drunk in the middle house. Given that there are only five houses and the first and second houses are already occupied, the middle house can only be the third house, which must be ivory (since it's next to the green house, as mentioned in Clue 6).

From Clue 6, we know that the green house is immediately to the right of the ivory house. Therefore, the fourth house must be green.

The remaining house must be yellow, and since the Kools smoker lives in the yellow house (Clue 8), the fifth house can only be yellow.

Now, let's assign each resident to a house:

* Norwegian: First house (blue)
* Englishman: Red house (unknown number)
* Spanish: Lives next to the dog owner (Clue 3) and smokes Kools (Clue 8). Since the Kools smoker lives in the yellow house, the Spanish person must live in the red house.
* Ukrainian: Drinks tea (Clue 5), which is not found in any of the already determined houses. Therefore, the Ukrainian must live in the green house.
* Japanese: Smokes Parliaments (Clue 14) and can't live in any of the previously assigned houses. Therefore, the Japanese person must live in the yellow house.

The remaining residents and pets can be assigned as follows:

* Ivory house (middle): Milk is drunk here, so it's likely that the Norwegian lives here (since he's next to the blue house). The Norwegian drinks water.
* Green house: Ukrainian drinks tea. 
* Red house: Englishman lives here, and since Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse (Clue 12), and we know that the Spanish person lives in the red house, this is where the fox must live.
* Blue house (first): Norwegian lives here and drinks water.

We still need to assign the remaining pets:

* The Old Gold smoker owns snails (Clue 7). Since the Japanese smokes Parliaments, it can't be him. Therefore, the Spanish person who lives in the red house must own snails.
* Chesterfields are smoked next to the man with the fox (Clue 11), so this must be the Englishman.
* Lucky Strike smoker drinks orange juice (Clue 13). Since we've already assigned all other residents to their houses, this must be the Ukrainian in the green house.

Now that we have a complete assignment of residents and pets:

* Ivory house (third): Norwegian drinks water.
* Green house (fourth): Ukrainian drinks tea.
* Red house (fifth): Englishman lives here with the fox and smokes Chesterfields. 
* Blue house (first): Norwegian lives here with the zebra, and the Japanese owns the parliaments.

From Clue 3, we know that the Spaniard owns the dog. Since Kools are smoked in a house next to the horse (Clue 12) and the Spanish person smokes Kools, they must live next to the house with the horse. The Norwegian has the zebra (as assigned above), so this means the green house belongs to the Ukrainian, where he drinks tea (Clue 5). This is confirmed by Clue 7, which says that Old Gold smokers own snails.

Given all these assignments and deductions, we have determined the following:

* **water:3**

This answer corresponds to the Norwegian in the ivory house (third) drinking water."	water:1
