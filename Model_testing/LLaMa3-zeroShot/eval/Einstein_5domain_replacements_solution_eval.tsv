Einstein_5domain_replacements_0	"After analyzing the clues, I've solved the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with the correct information:

#############
| Transport	| Music-Genre	| Birthday	| House	| Job	|
|-----------|-----------|---------|-------|------|
| Subway	| Rock	| May	| Wooden	| Architect	|
| Motorbike	| Folk	| June	| Ranch-style	| Motorbikemaster	|
| Train	| Trance	| February	| Palace	| Fan of Trance	|
| Snowmobile	| Ambient	| July	| Gothic-revival	| Mechanic	|
| Quad-bike	| Reggae	| September	| Futuristic	| Bartender	|
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 2, we know the fan of reggae is born in September, so they drive the quad-bike.
2. From clue 4, we know the subway driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver. From clue 5, we know the subway driver is in the wooden house. So, the snowmobile driver must be in the gothic-revival house (since it's in the middle, according to clue 8).
3. From clue 6, we know the architect is born in May and drives the subway.
4. From clue 7, we know the mechanic drives the quad-bike.
5. From clue 10, we know the librarian is on the left or right of the person born in June. Since the motorbikemaster is born in June (from clue 12), the librarian must be in the ranch-style house (which is the motorbikemaster's house).
6. From clue 11, we know the person born in July is on the left or right of the mechanic. Since the mechanic drives the quad-bike, the person born in July must be in the futuristic house (which is the quad-bike driver's house).
7. From clue 13, we know the bartender is the fan of ambient.
8. From clue 14, we know the fan of folk is on the left or right of the motorbike driver. Since the motorbike driver is in the ranch-style house, the fan of folk must be in the wooden house (which is the subway driver's house).
9. From clue 15, we know the librarian is on the left or right of the futuristic house. Since the librarian is already in the ranch-style house, they must be on the left or right of the futuristic house.
10. From clue 1, we know the fan of trance is the train driver. From clue 3, we know the fan of rock is in the palace house. From clue 9, we know the fan of folk is in the wooden house. From clue 12, we know the motorbikemaster is in the ranch-style house. From clue 14, we know the fan of ambient is the bartender. From clue 15, we know the librarian is in the ranch-style house. The only remaining house is the gothic-revival house, which must be the snowmobile driver's house.

By combining these clues, we can fill in the entire table with the correct information."	{}	False	0	False
