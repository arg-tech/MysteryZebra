Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	"Let's start by using the given information to fill in the table. We'll work our way through the clues and try to figure out the remaining information.

From clue 1, we know the British person likes red.

From clue 2, we know the Swedish person eats strawberry.

From clue 3, we know the Danish person lives in the tower house.

From clue 4, we know the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Since the British person likes red, the person who likes green must be on the left of the British person. This means the person who likes green cannot be the Swedish person, as they eat strawberry and are not on the left of the British person. Therefore, the person who likes green must be the Norwegian person.

From clue 5, we know the person who likes green is the townhouse house. Since the Norwegian person likes green, they must live in the townhouse.

From clue 6, we know the Pall-Mall smoker eats onion. Since the Pall-Mall smoker is not the Norwegian person (who likes green), they must be the German person.

From clue 7, we know the person who likes yellow is the Dunhill smoker. Since the Dunhill smoker is not the German person (who smokes Pall-Mall), they must be the British person.

From clue 8, we know the palace house is in the middle. Since the Norwegian person lives in the townhouse, the palace house must be to the right of the Norwegian person.

From clue 9, we know the Norwegian person is on the far left. This means the palace house is the second house from the left.

From clue 10, we know the Blend smoker is on the left or right of the person eating lemon. Since the Blend smoker is not the German person (who smokes Pall-Mall), they must be the Danish person. The Danish person lives in the tower house, which is on the far right. This means the person eating lemon must be the person who lives in the palace house.

From clue 11, we know the person eating eggplant is on the left or right of the Dunhill smoker. Since the Dunhill smoker is the British person, the person eating eggplant must be the person who lives in the palace house (who eats lemon).

From clue 12, we know the Bluemaster smoker lives in the cottage house. Since the Bluemaster smoker is not the German person (who smokes Pall-Mall), they must be the Swedish person.

From clue 13, we know the German person smokes Prince. Since the German person is not the Bluemaster smoker, they must be the person who lives in the modern house.

From clue 14, we know the Norwegian person is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian person lives in the townhouse, the person who likes blue must live in the palace house.

From clue 15, we know the Blend smoker is on the left or right of the modern house. Since the Blend smoker is the Danish person, they must live in the tower house.

Now that we have all the information, we can fill in the table:
