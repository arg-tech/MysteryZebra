Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know that the person traveling to Berlin likes red.

From statement 3, we know that the architect likes green.

From statement 5, we know that the architect is to the left of the person who likes ivory (since they like green).

From statement 8, we know that the social worker is in the middle.

Since there are only 5 people, and we have already placed 2, let's try to fill in some more information. From statement 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Since the lucky-strike-smoker is the project manager (statement 12), they must be one of the remaining people.

From statement 9, we know that the person traveling to London is on the far left. Therefore, the architect and social worker cannot be on the far left, as there are two spots taken already. This means that the lucky-strike-smoker must be the project manager traveling to London (statement 12).

Let's try to fill in some more information:

* The person traveling to Berlin likes red.
* The architect is to the left of the person who likes ivory.
* The social worker is in the middle.
* The lucky-strike-smoker (project manager) travels to London.

We can now deduce that the person who likes blue must be on the far right, as they are next to the architect (statement 14). From statement 4, we know that the dancer travels to Marseilles. Therefore, the dancer is to the left of the lucky-strike-smoker (project manager) traveling to London.

Let's summarize what we have so far:

* Berlin: red
* Nizza: dog owner
* Marseilles: dancer
* London: lucky-strike-smoker/project-manager

From statement 2, we know that the person traveling to Nizza is the owner of the dog. Since there are only 5 people and 4 cities left, let's try to fill in some more information.

Let's look at statement 11: ""The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse."" We know that the person traveling to Marseilles (dancer) must be on the far left. Therefore, we can deduce that the owner of the fox must be next to the architect.

From statement 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. We also know that the lucky-strike-smoker (project manager) travels to London and the dancer travels to Marseilles. Therefore, the person traveling to Nizza must be the owner of the horse.

From statement 7, we know that the kools-smoker likes yellow. Since there are only 5 people left, let's try to fill in some more information.

Let's summarize what we have so far:

* Berlin: red
* Nizza: dog owner (horse owner)
* Marseilles: dancer
* London: lucky-strike-smoker/project-manager

From statement 2, we know that the person traveling to Nizza is the owner of the dog. We can now deduce that the person who likes yellow must be on the far right.

Let's summarize what we have so far:

* Berlin: red
* Nizza: dog owner (horse owner)
* Marseilles: dancer
* London: lucky-strike-smoker/project-manager

We are missing one city, Colone. From statement 13, we know that the person traveling to Colone is the parliaments-smoker.

From statement 6, we know that the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails. We can now deduce that the person who likes ivory must be on the far left (next to the person who likes blue).

Let's summarize what we have so far:

* Berlin: red
* Nizza: dog owner (horse owner)
* Marseilles: dancer
* London: lucky-strike-smoker/project-manager
* Colone: parliaments-smoker

We can now fill in all the missing information.

The electrician is traveling to **Colone:5**."	electrician:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the person traveling to Berlin likes red.

From statement 3, we know the architect likes green.

From statement 5, we know the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

So far, we have:
- Person in Berlin: Red
- Architect: Green (to the right of Ivory)

From statement 2, we know the person traveling to Nizza owns a dog.

From statement 4, we know the dancer travels to Marseilles.

From statement 12, we know the project-manager smokes Lucky Strike.

From statement 13, we know the Parliaments-smoker travels to Colone.

From statement 14, we know the person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

Now let's use statements 6-11:

From statement 6, the Old-Gold-smoker owns snails. 

From statement 7, the Kools-smoker likes yellow.

From statement 8, the social-worker is in the middle (not sure where yet).

From statement 9, the person traveling to London is on the far left.

From statement 10, the Chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. 

From statement 11, the Kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (this one can't be combined with other clues yet).

We can start combining some information:

* From statement 7 and 14, we know Kools-smoker is on the far left and likes yellow.
* From statement 9, the person traveling to London is on the far left. 
So, the person traveling to London must also be the Kools-smoker.

From statements 8 and 12-13:

Since the social worker is in the middle (statement 8), it can't be the person traveling to Colone (Parliaments-smoker, statement 13) or the project-manager (Lucky Strike-smoker, statement 12). 

So far:
- Person in Berlin: Red
- Architect: Green (to the right of Ivory)
- London: Kools-smoker (Yellow)

Let's finish filling in the middle row:

From statement 5, we know Green is to the right of Ivory.

Since social worker is in the middle, it must be to the left or right of both Green and Ivory. 

This means either Red or Yellow must be on the other side (far right) from the group, since they are both already assigned as far left (London).

We know the parliaments-smoker travels to Colone (statement 13). Since Colone is not mentioned yet in our partial solution we know Parliaments-smoker cannot travel to Berlin. 

This means that Red can't be on the far right, since it would then conflict with statement 1.

So, Yellow must be on the far right from the group. This makes sense because Yellows owner (Kools) is already determined to be on the far left.

* From statement 7, Kools-smoker likes yellow.
This puts the person who likes yellow on the far right.

With this information we now know:

- Person in Berlin: Red
- Architect: Green (to the right of Ivory)
- Middle row: Social-worker is somewhere between these two
- Far left: London - Kools-smoker (Yellow)

Since statement 14 said London's owner likes blue, and Kools-smokers owner doesn't like blue, the far left slot has to be filled with an existing person. We already know this is Kools-smoker so he must own a yellow pet.

With this new information we can put together:

- Person in Berlin: Red
- Architect: Green (to the right of Ivory)
- Middle row: Social-worker is somewhere between these two

From statement 2, Nizza's owner has to be on the far left but since Kools-smoker already takes that spot, and we know this person owns a dog. So let's find out who likes blue.

Since London's owner (Kools) doesn't like Blue, his owner (Blue) can't be in Berlin as statement 1 said he was Red.

So, there is a new place for the blue owner on the far left from London, which we know already has Kools-smoker. Since Nizza is the only remaining city that hasn't been assigned yet with a name, this must mean it's the home of either Parliaments or Lucky Strike smokers (as they are the ones that haven't been placed).

From statement 12, we already know the lucky-strike-smoker is the project-manager.

Since the blue owner can only be in Nizza and we know London is taken by Kools and his owner has a yellow pet, it can only mean that Parliaments-smoker lives in Colone. 

This means that Nizza's smoker must have been Lucky Strike, but there are only four remaining people for him to be: Social worker (in middle) - Red (already placed) - Green (already placed) - Ivory (already placed).

This leaves the project-manager as Blue.

We know he smokes Lucky Strike and travels to Nizza so we can put together:

- Person in Berlin: Red
- Architect: Green (to the right of Ivory)
- Middle row: Social-worker is somewhere between these two

From statement 2, Nizza's owner has to be a person that already hasn't been placed yet. So let's look at who owns which pet.

* From statement 6, Old-Gold-smoker owns snails.
* Since Parliaments-smoker travels to Colone (statement 13) it can only be one of the remaining people and since Lucky Strike-smoker lives in Nizza and is project-manager, he also has to be on the far right from Kools as statement 12 said he was the project manager. 

This leaves either Kools or Chesterfields owner with the blue pet.

But we know Kools already owns a yellow pet so this leaves only the Cheestfield-smoker for Blue owner.

* From statement 10, The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the fox owner.

We don't have enough information to place Fox yet but since Chesterfields-smoker (Blue) has been placed we can now use statement 11:

* From statement 11, the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the horse's owner."	zebra:5
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The person eating strawberry is the person who likes red.
2. The person eating lime is the owner of the dog.

From (5), we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. This means:
- If someone likes ivory, they can't be on the leftmost position
- Someone who likes green must be in one of the three middle positions

3. The person who's sport is skiing is the person who likes green.

From (4), we know that the person eating potato is the person who's sport is cycling. This means:
- The person who eats potato can't like green, as it's associated with skiing
- Someone who eats potato must have a sport different from skiing

Since the person eating lime has a dog, they are not in position 1 (far left). They also don't eat strawberry or pomegranate. So we have two possibilities for the first position:

 Position 1: Either strawberry or pomegranate
 Position 2: Lime is associated with dog ownership, so this person must be to the right of someone who owns a horse, as per (11)
 
We know that the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails. If we associate snails with lucky-strike (as per statement 12), it contradicts (3) if they have green. This leaves only parliaments for the person eating peach, and thus lucky-strike is associated with handball.

Since the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox (11), and kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse (11), we can associate:

- Chesterfields: Fox
- Kools: Horse
- Lucky-strike: Handball, associated with snails
- Old-gold: Snails

Now we know:
1. Person eating strawberry likes red
2. Person eating lime owns dog
3. Person who's sport is skiing likes green
4. Person eating potato has cycling as their sport (no association to any person yet)

Let's use statement 5, where the person who likes green is to the right of someone who likes ivory:

1. Ivory: Someone on the left side (since they're not in position 1 and must be between positions 2-4)
2. Green: Since green is associated with skiing, it must be one of the middle three positions.

Now let's put statements 10 & 11 together:

If we assign:
- Cheaterfields-smoker as fox owner (on left or right), 
then Kools-owner has horse and Lucky-strike-owning the handball-snails association, which is not possible in our current setup (as green skiing must be somewhere between positions 2 and 4)

However, this leads to a new possibility where we place:
- Old-gold: Snails
- Chesterfields: Fox 
In position 1 or 5, we know from statement (10) that chesterfield is on left or right of the fox's owner.

So now let’s put Ivory and Green in order:

- Since green skiing must be one of positions 2-4, this puts Ivory to the far left.
Thus we associate Ivory with position 1 and someone eating peach as parliaments-smoker (which is associated with a person who likes blue):

- Position 1: Ivory
- Position 2: Skiing (Green) is between positions 2 and 4.

Now let’s get into:
- The far left is occupied by Pomegranate. Therefore, pomegranate must be to the right of someone who likes blue. From statement (14), this puts peach in position 1.
- Position 3: Lime owns dog
- Position 2: Person skiing has green as their colour

This setup contradicts statement (9) that Peach's owner is on the far left, therefore let’s reverse it:
- Pomegranate eats pomegranate and likes blue.

Now we have a conflict with statement (4) where eating potato must be cycling. If this person were in position 2 or 3, they would contradict statement (10).

Given that Peach's owner is on the far left, let’s move:
- Peach to position 5

This leaves us with pomegranate and snails:
- Pomegranate eats pomegranate
- Snails are associated with old-gold and lucky-strike. As we already assigned lucky-strike handball, this puts old-gold in position 3.

So now our setup is:

1. Ivory 
2. Peach as parliaments-smoker (likes blue)
3. Old-gold-smoker
4. Skiing - Green

Since statement (8) says the person who's sport is surfing is in the middle, and lime has dog ownership, it contradicts statement 5 where the green-skier must be between positions 2-4.

Given that old-gold is associated with snails, let’s assign them to position 3:

1. Ivory
2. Parliaments-smoker (Peach) 
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Lime (Dog owner)
5. Strawberry-red

Now we have the following setup where statement (8) holds true for surfing being in the middle:
- Position 3: Skiing is not possible, and lime owns dog.
Thus the person eating strawberry likes red.

1. Ivory 
2. Parliaments-smoker (Peach) 
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Cycling - Potato 
5. Strawberry-red

The lucky-strike-smoker must be handball and can’t be a skiing person, which means:
- Handball: Lucky-strike (position 4)

This leaves only surfing for position 2. 

Given statement (9) that the pomegranate-eater is on the far left, this puts pomegranate in position 1.

Now our setup is:

1. Pomegranate
2. Surfing 
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Lucky-strike-handball
5. Peach-parliaments

Now we assign remaining positions:
- Ivory and green can’t be together, so Ivory must be at the end
Since statement (7) associates kools with yellow, it puts them in position 2. 
However, this contradicts our previous setup where surfing must go in position 2.

We need to switch the assignments of lucky-strike-handball and old-gold-snail:

1. Pomegranate
2. Lucky-strike (Handball)
3. Old-gold (snails)-cheerfully has yellow kools, but this contradicts statement (11) which puts chesterfields-smoker on left or right of the fox owner.

However, now we see that lucky-strike (handball) occupies position 2 and must be followed by old-gold-snail. Therefore this leaves only surfing for position 1:

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Kools-smoker- Yellow
5. Ivory 

Now let’s assign remaining:
- Red is associated with strawberry, and it can’t be in position 4 since kools-smoker must go there.
- This puts red in the last position.

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Kools-yelllow 
5. Strawberry-red

Given that statement (12) associates lucky-strike with handball, it can’t be an ivory or green-skier. 

Since the person who likes green is in position 3 and there are no other green-skiers:
- Lucky-strike must be in position 2.

Now we have a conflict for old-gold-snail:

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Red-strawberry 

This contradicts statement (7) which associates kools with yellow. Given that the pomegranate-eater must be on the far left, let’s switch assignments of peach-parliaments to position 5.

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Yellow-kools 
5. Peach 

This leaves only strawberry-red for position 4:

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike (handball)
3. Old-gold-snail
4. Strawberry-red 
5. Peach-parliaments

Now we need to assign remaining positions:
- Skiing must be between peach and lucky-strike in statement (14) where pomegranate’s owner is followed by someone who likes blue.
This contradicts statement (10).

However, this leaves only position 3 for skiing-green.

1. Pomegranate 
2. Peach-parliaments
3. Green-skier
4. Lucky-strike-handball
5. Old-gold-snail

Given that the handball must be lucky-strike in statement (12), it puts peach and parrliaments in position 1:

1. Peach-parliaments
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Green-skier 
4. Pomegranate 
5. Old-gold 

Since statement (7) associates kools with yellow, this contradicts our previous setup where surfing is on the left and can’t be followed by green.

Now let’s swap peach-parliaments and lucky-strike-handball:

1. Peach-parliaments
2. Lucky-strike-handball 
3. Pomegranate
4. Green-skier 
5. Old-gold 

Given statement (10), this puts pomegranate in position 4.

Now let’s swap positions of green-skier and old-gold-snail:

1. Peach-parliaments
2. Lucky-strike-handball 
3. Pomegranate
4. Old-gold 
5. Green-skier 

This contradicts statement (8) where surfing is in the middle.
- Therefore this leaves only position 2 for surfing.

1. Surfing 
2. Kools-smoker-yelllow 
3. Lucky-strike-handball 
4. Peach-parliaments
5. Old-gold-snail

Now we have a conflict:
- Given that statement (10) associates lucky-strike with handball, it must be followed by pomegranate in statement (9). This puts peach-parliaments in position 3.

1. Pomegranate 
2. Lucky-strike-handball
3. Peach-parliaments 
4. Old-gold-snail
5. Kools-yelllow 

This contradicts statement (14) where pomegranate is followed by someone who likes blue.
- This leaves only peach in position 1.

Given that the handball must be lucky-strike, it puts surfing in position 2:

1. Peach-parliaments
2. Lucky-strike-handball 
3. Pomegranate 
4. Kools-smoker-yellow
5. Old-gold-snail"	golf:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The person eating strawberry is the person who likes red.
2. The person eating lime is the owner of the dog.

From the above two statements, we can conclude that the person eating strawberry and lime cannot be the same person, because they have different pets (red for strawberry and dog for lime).

3. The person who's sport is skiing is the person who likes green.
4. The person eating potato is the person who's sport is cycling.

From statement 5, we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Combining this with statements 3 and 4, we can conclude that:

* The person eating potato (cycling) must be on the left side.
* The person who's sport is skiing (green) must be on the right side.

5. The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.
6. The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.

* The old-gold-smoker must be on one of the ends.
* The kools-smoker cannot be on one of the ends, because then there would not be enough space for all five people.

7. The person who's sport is surfing is in the middle.
8. The person eating pomegranate is on the far left.
9. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.

From statement 8, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the far left. Statement 11 says that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. We can conclude that:

* The old-gold-smoker must be on one of the ends.
* The kools-smoker cannot be on one of the ends, because then there would not be enough space for all five people.

10. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball.
11. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.

From statement 12, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker's sport is handball. Statement 13 says that the person eating peach is the parliaments-smoker. We can conclude that:

* The lucky-strike-smoker must be in one of the middle two positions.
* The parliaments-smoker (eating peach) cannot be on the far left, because then there would not be enough space for all five people.

12. The person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

From statement 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Statement 11 says that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. We can conclude that:

* The lucky-strike-smoker must be in one of the middle two positions.

Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the puzzle and find the solution.

From statement 1, we know the person eating cranberry likes red.
From statement 3, we know the person whose hobby is collecting likes green.
We can assume that this person is on the left or right of the person who likes ivory (statement 5).

Let's create a table with the colors and their corresponding hobbies:
| Color | Hobby |
| --- | --- |
| Red | - |
| Green | Collecting |
| Ivory | - |
| Yellow | - |
| Blue | - |

From statement 4, we know the person eating banana likes board-games. We can assume that this person is in the middle (statement 8).

From statement 5, we know the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

From statement 6, we know the old-gold-smoker owns snails. We can assume that this person is not on the far left (statement 9).

Let's create a table with the cigars and their corresponding pets:
| Cigar | Pet |
| --- | --- |
| Old-Gold | Snails |

From statement 7, we know the kools-smoker likes yellow.
We can assume that this person is to the right of the owner of the horse (statement 11).

Let's create a table with the cigars and their corresponding colors:

| Kools | Yellow |

From statement 8, we know the person whose hobby is photography is in the middle.

From statement 9, we know the person eating tomato is on the far left.
We can assume that this person likes blue (statement 14).

Let's update our tables:

| Red | - |
| Green | Collecting |
| Ivory | - |
| Yellow | Kools |
| Blue | Tomato |

From statement 10, we know the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.

| --- | --- |
| Old-Gold | - |
| Lucky-Strike | Skydiving |

From statement 13, we know the parliaments-smoker eats carrot.
We can assume that this person is not in the middle (statement 8).

Let's update our tables:
| Color | Hobby |
| --- | --- |
| Red | - |
| Green | Collecting |
| Ivory | - |
| Yellow | Kools |
| Blue | Tomato |

From statement 14, we know the person eating tomato likes blue.

Now we can solve for the remaining positions:

* The kools-smoker (yellow) is to the right of the owner of the horse.
* The chesterfields-smoker (owner of the fox) is on the left or right of the kools-smoker.
* The lucky-strike-smoker's hobby is skydiving.
* The parliaments-smoker eats carrot.

Let's assume that the person eating tomato is to the left of the kools-smoker (yellow).

We can now determine the final order:

1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (owner of the horse, ivory)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

The remaining person must be Lucky-Strike, whose hobby is skydiving.

We can now determine the hobbies:

* Collecting: Green
* Board-games: Banana
* Skydiving: Lucky-Strike

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (owner of the horse, ivory)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobbies:

* Red: Cranberry
* Board-games: Banana
* Collecting: Green

The person who likes red must be to the right of the person who eats cranberry (statement 1).

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. Lucky-Strike (skydiving)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Red: Cranberry
* Board-games: Banana

The person who eats cranberry likes red, and this person is to the right of the kools-smoker (yellow).

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (red, eating cranberry)
4. Lucky-Strike (skydiving)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Board-games: Banana

The person who eats banana likes board-games.

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (red, eating cranberry)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Collecting: Green

The person who likes green must be to the right of the person who likes ivory.

Since the kools-smoker (yellow) is to the right of the owner of the horse, we can assume that the owner of the horse is ivory.

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (red, eating cranberry)
4. Lucky-Strike (skydiving)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Photography: Middle

Since the person who eats banana likes board-games and this person is in the middle, we can assume that this person is the lucky-strike-smoker.

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. Lucky-Strike (skydiving)
4. ? (red, eating cranberry)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Woodworking: ?

Since the person who eats potato is the owner of the dog, we can assume that this person is to the right of the kools-smoker.

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (red, eating cranberry)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Woodworking: 3

The final order is:
1. Tomato (blue) - far left
2. Kools (yellow)
3. ? (red, eating cranberry)
4. Parliaments (carrot)
5. Old-Gold (snails)

We can now determine the remaining hobby:

* Woodworking: 3

The answer is:
**woodworking:3**

Let me know if you have any further questions!"	woodworking:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

From statement 1, we know the person eating cranberry likes red.

From statement 2, we know the person eating potato owns a dog.

From statement 3, we know the person who likes green has collecting as their hobby.

From statement 5, we can deduce that the person who likes ivory must be to the left of the person who likes green.

Statement 6 tells us that the old-gold-smoker owns snails. 

Statement 7 tells us that the kools-smoker likes yellow.

From statement 8, we know the person with photography as their hobby is in the middle.

Statement 9 puts the person eating tomato on the far left.

Statement 10 says the chesterfields-smoker is either to the left or right of the fox owner. 

Statement 11 says the kools-smoker is either to the left or right of the horse owner.

Statement 12 tells us that the lucky-strike-smoker has skydiving as their hobby.

From statement 13, we know the parliaments-smoker eats carrot.

Statement 14 puts the person eating tomato next to the one who likes blue.

Now, let's combine these clues:

1. The person eating cranberry is in a known position (far left) due to statement 9.
2. Statement 11 tells us that the kools-smoker, who likes yellow (from 7), is either to the left or right of the horse owner. This means that the lucky-strike-smoker (with skydiving hobby from 12) and the person eating carrot must be on the opposite side.
3. Statement 2 tells us that the person eating potato owns a dog, which can't be far left as it would conflict with statement 9.

From these points, we can start building our solution:

Red (eating cranberry): Far Left
Potato: To the right of Red

Given statement 11 and its implications on lucky-strike-smoker and parliaments-smoker's positions, they must be in the middle or far right. Since lucky-strike-smoker is involved with skydiving (from 12), and it cannot be on the far left (due to statement 9) nor can it be next to red (due to statement 14 putting blue adjacent to tomato, which is already established as being at the far left), we deduce the lucky-strike-smoker must be in a position that also affects kools-smoker's placement indirectly.

The middle is reserved for photography due to statement 8. 

Now, combining statements 7 and 11 with the implications from the above deductions:

- The person eating banana (board-games hobby) must be next to kools-smoker on either side.
- Chesterfields-smoker (from 10) can be on the left or right of the fox owner.

Putting these together:

- Red: Far Left
- Lucky Strike/ Skydiving: Middle cannot be due to the above deductions, but it’s clear lucky-strike-smoker is in a position affecting kools-smoker indirectly.
- Given statement 8 reserves middle for photography and statement 7 says kools-smoker likes yellow which puts them near horse owner (from 11).
- The parliaments-smoker eats carrot: Middle cannot be since lucky-strike-smoker must affect the position of others in a way that matches with clues provided.
- Given these constraints and statement 14, we have to place blue next to tomato as they are both far left or right adjacent.

Now let’s analyze from statement 10:

Chesterfields-smoker is either on the left or right of fox owner. This places chesterfields-smoker near a person who owns fox but also puts it away from lucky-strike-smoker (since it must affect kools indirectly).

Given we have parliaments, old-gold, and lucky-strike smokers in play now, with kools being yellow and having horse as its companion, this means the middle or one of the far ends can’t be a combination that satisfies all conditions.

This puzzle needs to satisfy all given conditions, meaning some placements are more constrained than others. We have not yet used statement 3 (person who likes green has collecting hobby) which must come into play when analyzing positions for green and ivory.

From these deductions:

- Red is far left.
- Lucky-strike-smoker is either in the middle or very close to it due to its impact on other placements.
- Kools-smoker is near horse owner, hence a combination that includes yellow (kools) and horse.

Now let’s consider statement 3 and 5 for green:

Statement 5 says that person who likes green is to the right of person who likes ivory. Given lucky-strike-smoker must be in close proximity to kools-smoker due to its influence on other placements, we can now think about where these can fit.

Since blue (due to statement 14) is next to tomato (far left), and red is far left as well, green’s placement is more flexible but also constrained by being next to ivory. 

Given all the constraints:

1. **Red** is on the far left.
2. The person eating potato owns a dog, which means the dog owner cannot be far left due to the tomato-eater's position (far left), so this places them near red.

Let’s try placing people with given conditions from 10 and 11:

- Chesterfields-smoker must be next to the fox owner.
- Kools-smoker is next to the horse owner.

Given all these constraints, we can place lucky-strike-smoker's position in a way that affects kools indirectly. 

Since **Red** (eating cranberry) is on the far left and given statements 10 and 11:

- The chesterfields-smoker and the person eating carrot must be near each other due to their relation with fox and horse owners from 10 and 11.
- Given statement 9 puts tomato at far left, we know blue is next to it due to statement 14.

Considering all these conditions, the arrangement seems as follows:

Red (eating cranberry): Far Left
Blue: Adjacent to Red

Given statements 3 and 5 for green and ivory:
- The person who likes green must be to the right of the person who likes ivory.
- Given blue is next to red, green can’t be in this row because there's not enough space.

Now combining all given conditions:

We know that:

1. **Red** (eating cranberry) is far left.
2. Blue is adjacent to Red due to statement 14.

Let’s analyze the positions using statements 10 and 11 together with our deductions so far:

Given the constraints, here's a revised guess for the arrangement considering all clues given in problem statement:

- **Red** (eating cranberry) - Far Left
- **Blue**: Adjacent to Red

Considering green next to ivory due to statement 5:
Green must be on one of the end positions and next to its corresponding person, as it cannot fit between red and blue without conflict.

Combining all clues given:

From statements 10 and 11 we know chesterfields-smoker is either to left or right of fox owner and kools-smoker is to the left or right of horse owner. 

Given old-gold-smoker owns snails, lucky-strike-smoker does skydiving hobby from statement 12, and parliaments-smoker eats carrot (from 13), we can now combine these pieces into an arrangement.

The arrangement seems as follows considering all statements:

1. **Red** (eating cranberry): Far Left
2. **Blue**: Adjacent to Red
3. The person eating banana is next to kools-smoker, which means they must be in the middle or very close to it due to their relation with horse owner.
4. Old-gold-smoker owns snails and can't conflict with any other statement.

Putting all pieces together now:

Given the constraints from statements 10 and 11 on chesterfields-smoker and kools-smoker, we have a placement for each of them which satisfies given conditions without contradiction.

With lucky-strike-smoker's influence over others being key to satisfying all conditions given in problem statement:

Combining red, blue, and green placements with other pieces we get an arrangement that can satisfy all conditions stated in the problem."	zebra:5
