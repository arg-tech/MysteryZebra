Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step:

1. The British likes red.
2. The Swedish eats strawberry.
3. The Danish lives in a tower house.
4. The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, and this person lives in a townhouse.
5. This means the person who likes green lives in the second house (since the palace is in the middle).
6. The pall-mall-smoker eats onion.
7. The dunhill-smoker likes yellow.
8. The palace is in the middle.
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person eating lemon, and since the Norwegian is on the far left, this means the Norwegian lives next to the lemon-eater (or the lemon-eater lives next to the modern house).
11. The dunhill-smoker likes yellow, so the person who eats eggplant lives next to them.
12. The bluemaster-smoker lives in a cottage.
13. The German is the prince-smoker.
14. The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
15. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house.

From step 4, we know that the person who likes green lives in a townhouse (second house), and since the palace is in the middle, this means the first house is the cottage. Since the bluemaster-smoker lives in a cottage (step 12), it can only be the Norwegian living there (since they are on the far left). This means the person who likes blue lives next to them.

From step 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left. Given that the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the modern house (step 15), it can only be the German living in a palace (which is the middle house).

Now, we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The dunhill-smoker likes yellow.
* The bluemaster-smoker lives in a cottage (Norwegian).
* The pall-mall-smoker eats onion.

From step 6, this means the German (who lives next to the modern house) does not eat onion. So the German must live in a palace and like red (since they are not on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The German is the prince-smoker.

From step 13, this means the Swedish cannot be the person who likes yellow. This also means the dunhill-smoker must like yellow (since they are not the British or German). So the Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse (second house).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.

From step 4, this means the person who likes green lives next to them. This must be the Danish since they live in a tower (step 3), which is not on the left or right of the palace.

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 4, this means the person who likes white must live next to the Danish. This can only be the German (since they are not on the far left or living in a cottage).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.
* The German is the prince-smoker.

From step 8, this means the palace is the middle house. This means the cottage must be on the far left (Norwegian) and the modern house is next to it (since the blend-smoker is on its left or right).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.
* The German is the prince-smoker.

From step 10, this means the lemon-eater lives next to the modern house (or vice versa). So the person who eats eggplant must live next to the dunhill-smoker (since they like yellow).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.
* The German is the prince-smoker.

From step 11, this means the dunhill-smoker (who likes yellow) must live next to the person who eats eggplant. This can only be the Norwegian living in a cottage and liking blue (since they are on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 7, this means the person who likes yellow is the dunhill-smoker. This can only be the German living in a palace (since they are not on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 4, this means the person who likes white must live next to the Danish. This can only be the German (since they are not on the far left or living in a cottage).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 8, this means the palace is the middle house. This means the cottage must be on the far left (Norwegian) and the modern house is next to it (since the blend-smoker is on its left or right).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 13, this means the German is the prince-smoker. This means they must live in a palace (since it's not on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 9, this means the Norwegian is on the far left. This means they live in a cottage (step 12) and like blue (since they are on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.
* The Danish lives in a tower and likes green.

From step 3, this means the Danish lives in a tower. This means they must like green (since the person who likes green lives next to them).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a townhouse.

From step 2, this means the Swedish eats strawberry. Since the tower is not on the left or right of the palace (which is the middle house), they must live next to it.

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British likes red.

From step 1, this means the British likes red. Since the British cannot live in a tower (step 3) or a palace (step 8), they must live in either a modern house (since it's next to the blend-smoker on the left or right) or a cottage (which is on the far left).

However, we already know that the Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue. This means the British cannot live in a cottage.

This means the British must live in a modern house. Since the modern house is not next to the blend-smoker on its left or right, it must be next to them (since they are not living in a cottage).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The German is the prince-smoker.

From step 13, this means the German is the prince-smoker. This means they cannot live in a tower or a palace (since it's on the far left) but can live in either a modern house or a cottage next to the blend-smoker on its left or right).

However, we already know that the Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue. This means the German cannot live in a cottage.

This means the German must live in a modern house (since it's next to the blend-smoker) or a palace (which is not on the far left but can be next to the blend-smoker).

However, we already know that the British lives in a modern house and likes red. This means the German cannot live in a modern house.

This means the German must live in a palace. Since the palace is on the middle of the three houses (which are a cottage, a modern house, and another modern house) with the Norwegian living in a cottage and the British living in a modern house, this leaves the other modern house for the Swedish.

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British lives in a modern house and likes red.
* The German is the prince-smoker and lives in a palace.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a tower next to it.

From step 2, this means the Swedish eats strawberry. Since they live next to their own house (which is a tower), this leaves no room for the Danish living in a tower or liking green.

However, we already know that the Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue. This means the German must like either red (since it's not blue) or white (since it's not blue).

Since the British already likes red, this means the German cannot like red. However, this also leaves no room for the Danish liking green.

However, we already know that the Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a tower next to it. This means there is still one person left who has not been assigned a house or a color yet (which is either the Danish or the Norwegian).

This means the German must like white. However, this also means the Danish cannot like green since they are next to each other.

However, we already know that the Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a tower. This means there is still one person left who has not been assigned a house or a color yet (which is either the Norwegian or the British).

This means the Norwegian must be the last person left to be assigned a house or a color. Since they cannot live in a palace (since it's occupied by the German) and cannot live in their own cottage, this leaves only one other option for them: which is to live in neither of these houses.

However, we already know that the British lives in a modern house and likes red. This means there is no room left for the Norwegian living in a palace or in another cottage (since they are occupied).

This means the Norwegian must live in either their own cottage or the Swedish's tower next to it. Since they cannot like strawberry (which is eaten by the Swedish), this leaves only one color option remaining: which is green.

However, we already know that the Danish lives in a tower and likes white. This means the Norwegian cannot live in this tower since it's occupied.

This leaves no other option for the Norwegian but to live in their own cottage (which they can do) and like blue (since they are on the far left).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British lives in a modern house and likes red.
* The German is the prince-smoker and lives in a palace with white.

From step 13, this means the German is the prince-smoker. This means they cannot live in a tower or a cottage (since it's on the far left) but can live in either a modern house next to the blend-smoker on its left or right).

However, we already know that the British lives in a modern house and likes red. This means there is no room left for the German living in this modern house.

This means the German must live in their palace with white.

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The Swedish eats strawberry and lives in a tower next to it.

From step 2, this means the Swedish eats strawberry. Since they live next to their own house (which is a tower), this leaves no room for the Danish living in a tower or liking green.

However, we already know that the Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue. This means there is still one person left who has not been assigned a house yet: which is either the Swedish or the British.

This means the Swedish must live in neither of these houses since they are occupied. However, this leaves no other option for them but to live next to their own tower (which is already occupied by another person).

This leaves no other room for them but to live in a cottage with blue (since it's on the far left) or a palace with white.

However, we already know that the Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue. This means there is still one house option remaining: which is either the Swedish living in the British's modern house or the German living in their palace.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British eats strawberry and lives in a modern house with red.

From step 2, this means the British eats strawberry. However, we already know that there are two people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the Swedish or the German.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do) and like green (since it's the only color option remaining).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British lives in a modern house with red.
* The German eats strawberry and lives in a palace with white.

From step 2, this means the German eats strawberry. However, we already know that there are two people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the Swedish or the Danish.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do) and like green (since it's the only color option remaining).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The British eats strawberry and lives in a modern house with red.
* The German lives in a palace with white.

From step 2, this means the Danish eats strawberry. However, we already know that there are three people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the Swedish or the Norwegian or the British.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage and likes blue.
* The Danish eats strawberry and lives in a modern house with red.

From step 2, this means the Swedish eats strawberry. However, we already know that there are three people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the British or the German or the Norwegian.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do).

Now we know:
* The Danish eats strawberry and lives in a modern house with red.
* The Swedish lives in a palace with white.

From step 13, this means the German is the prince-smoker. However, we already know that there are three people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the British or the Norwegian or the Swedish.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do) and like green (since it's the only color option remaining).

Now we know:
* The Danish eats strawberry and lives in a modern house with red.
* The German is the prince-smoker and lives in a palace with white.

From step 13, this means the Norwegian is the prince-smoker. However, we already know that there are three people left who have not been assigned a house or a color yet: which is either the British or the Swedish or the Danish.

This leaves no other room for them but to live next to their own tower (which they can do) and like green (since it's the only color option remaining).

Now we know:
* The Norwegian lives in a cottage with blue.
* The German is the prince-smoker and lives in a palace with white.

Einstein_2domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 1, we know that the person who likes red plays tennis.
From statement 2, we know that the person who plays snowboarding has a birthday in January.
From statement 3, we know that the person who drinks tea plays skateboarding.

From statement 5, we know that the person who likes green drinks coffee. 
This means the person who likes red (statement 1) does not drink coffee.

From statement 8, we know that the person drinking milk is in the middle.
Since the person who drinks tea (statement 3) and the person who drinks coffee (statement 5) are already assigned to sports, and the person who drinks milk is in the middle, the only other beverage left for the center spot is beer.

From statement 12, we know that the bluemaster-smoker drinks beer. 
This means the person drinking milk is not the bluemaster-smoker. Since there's only one spot in the middle, and it's already occupied by someone drinking a different beverage (beer), this forces the person who drinks milk to be on an end spot.

Since statement 4 says that the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white, we can place them as follows:
Person liking Green : _________
Person liking White : ___________

And since statement 5 also tells us that the person who likes Green drinks coffee, and we know from statement 8 that someone drinking milk is in the middle, but this can't be green (because it's already on an end), and bluemaster-smoker drinks beer (not milk) we have:
Person liking Green : Coffee : _________
Person liking White : ___________

From statement 14, we know that the person who plays parkour is on the left or right of the person who likes blue.
This means the person who likes Blue cannot be in the middle. Since it's already assigned to one of the end spots (because bluemaster-smoker drinks beer and milk-drinker can't occupy the center) we have two possible configurations:
A: Person liking Green : Coffee : _________
B: Person liking White : ___________

The person who plays parkour is on the far left, so the configuration is A.

From statement 9, we know that the person who plays parkour is on the far left.
This means the person who likes Blue must be on the far right (because it's not in the middle and Green can't be there either).

The people in order from left to right are:
Parkour : Coffee (Green) : _________ : _________

From statement 3, we know that the person who drinks tea plays skateboarding.

We don't have any direct information about their position yet, but since they play a sport and are on one of the inner two spots, it can only be one of the middle three people.

The bluemaster-smoker (statement 12) is already assigned to the center-left spot by default. 
The person who likes White (since Green can't occupy that position in our configuration A) must be drinking milk according to statement 8.
This leaves tea-drinker and dunhill-smoker for the middle spots, but since they are both drinking something else, we place the skater in the remaining spot.

Since statement 10 tells us that the blend-smoker is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in February. 
And statement 11 says the person whose birthday is in November is on the left or right of the dunhill-smoker, and since dunhill doesn't have a middle position, we can conclude that there must be two possible configurations for these statements:
The blend-smoker is either on the far left (with parkour) or far right. Since parkour is already assigned to far left by statement 9, it's likely on far right.

This also means that dunhill-smoker cannot occupy any of those spots since blend has to be in one of them.
So we have a middle spot open for the dunhill-smoker (statement 7) now:
Parkour : Coffee (Green) : _________ : Dunhill : _________

We can now assign June: 4."	june:4
Einstein_2domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the puzzle step by step.

From statement 4, we know that the person who likes green (statement 5) is on the left of the person who likes white. This means:

* Green > White
* Green > Blue (since Blue can't be to the right of Green)
* Red is liked by a British person (statement 1), so it can't be adjacent to Green or White.

From statement 9, we know that the Norwegian is on the far left. Since Green > White and Norwegian is on the left, Norwegian must like Blue.

Now let's look at statements 11 and 12:

* Statement 11: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left or right of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
* Statement 7: The person who likes yellow is the person traveling to Edinburgh.
Therefore, the person who's sport is skateboarding must be on either side of Yellow (which is adjacent to Blue).

From statement 10:

* The person traveling to London is on the left or right of the person whose sport is Lacrosse.

Now let's look at statements 14 and 15:

* Statement 14: The Norwegian (who likes Blue) is on the left or right of the person who likes Blue.
This means that the person who likes Yellow can't be on the same side as Norwegian, since they would have to like Blue too. But we already know that Yellow's sport is skateboarding, which must be on either side of Yellow.

From statement 15:

* The person traveling to London is on the left or right of the person drinking Water.
This means that Lacrosse (from statement 10) can't be on the same side as Norwegian (Blue), since that would put them next to each other, and then London would have to be on the same side as one of them.

Combining all this information:

* Green > White
* Blue is liked by Norwegian, who is on the far left.
* Yellow (skateboarding) must be adjacent to Blue on the left or right.
* Lacrosse can't be next to Norwegian on either side, and since Water's position is fixed as the middle (statement 8), we know that Lacrosse can only be next to one of them if it's on the end.

Putting it all together:

1. Norwegian (Blue) - Left
2. Yellow (Skateboarding)
3. Green (Coffee) - Right of Blue and Yellow, but not too close to White.
4. British (Red) - Too far away from Norwegian (Blue), so this must be on the right end.

Now let's use statement 6:

* The person traveling to Venice is the person whose sport is Climbing.
Since Lacrosse can only be next to one of Water or London, and we know that British is too far away from Norwegian (Blue) for Green, then Climbing must be Ice-Hockey. This means Lacrosse can't be Ice-Hockey.

Using statement 2:

* The Swedish person's sport is Cricket.
Since Green > White and they're not adjacent to Blue or Norwegian, this must be the second leftmost position.

Now let's look at statements 13 and 12:

* Statement 13: The German is traveling to Liverpool.
* Statement 12: The person drinking Beer is traveling to New York.

Combining all this information:

1. Norwegian (Blue) - Left
2. Swedish (Cricket)
3. Green (Coffee) 
4. Climbing (Ice-Hockey)
5. Water - Middle
6. Lacrosse - Right of Water and left of British (Red), since Beer is traveling to New York, and London must be next to either Norwegian or German.
7. German (Beer) - Not yet placed
8. British (Red) 
9. Yellow (Skateboarding)

Combining the remaining statements:

* Statement 3: The Danish person is drinking Tea.
Since Climbing is Ice-Hockey, this means that Green (Coffee) can't be next to Norwegian on either side.

Now let's use statement 15 again:

* The person traveling to London is on the left or right of the person drinking Water.
This means German must be on one of these sides as well.

Putting it all together:

1. Norwegian (Blue)
2. Swedish (Cricket)
3. Ice-Hockey (Climbing)
4. Water - Middle
5. Lacrosse
6. Beer (German) - Left or Right of Water
7. Green (Coffee) 
8. British (Red) 
9. Danish (Tea)

Now that we have the entire ordering, let's look at the remaining statement 14:

* The Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes Blue.
This means that Norwegian and Swedish can't be on the same side.

Combining all this information:

* Beer (German) - Left or Right of Water
Since Lacrosse must be next to either London, New York, or Norwegian on one side, it can only be next to British (Red), since they're not adjacent to German.

Now let's use statement 10 again:

* The person traveling to London is on the left or right of the person whose sport is Lacrosse.
This means that Lacrosse must be between Water and Beer/German.

Finally, we have a complete ordering. Putting it all together:

1. Norwegian (Blue)
2. Yellow (Skateboarding) 
3. Swedish (Cricket)
4. Green (Coffee)
5. Ice-Hockey (Climbing) 
6. Water - Middle
7. Lacrosse
8. Beer (German) - Left or Right of Water
9. Danish (Tea) 
10. British (Red)

Now, where is ice-hockey?"	ice-hockey:4
