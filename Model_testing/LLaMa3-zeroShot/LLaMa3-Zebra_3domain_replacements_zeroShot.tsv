Zebra_3domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the clues, I've solved the puzzle. Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

1. From clue 1, the person driving the quad-bike is the person who's birthday is in May, so the quad-bike driver is in position 5.
2. From clue 2, the person driving the ship is the owner of the dog, so the ship driver is in position 2.

4. From clue 4, the person driving the van is the person traveling to Berlin, so the van driver is in position 2.
5. From clue 5, the person who's birthday is in January is to the right of the person who's birthday is in July, so the January birthday person is in position 1, and the July birthday person is in position 2.
6. From clue 6, the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails, so the old-gold-smoker is in position 3.
7. From clue 7, the kools-smoker is the person who's birthday is in June, so the kools-smoker is in position 5.
8. From clue 8, the person traveling to Venice is in the middle, so the Venice traveler is in position 3.
9. From clue 9, the person driving the helicopter is on the far left, so the helicopter driver is in position 1.
10. From clue 10, the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox, so the chesterfields-smoker is in position 2 or 3. Since the fox owner is in position 2, the chesterfields-smoker is in position 2.
11. From clue 11, the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse, so the kools-smoker is in position 5, and the horse owner is in position 4.
12. From clue 12, the lucky-strike-smoker is the person traveling to Colone, so the lucky-strike-smoker is in position 4.
13. From clue 13, the person driving the skateboard is the parliaments-smoker, so the skateboard driver is in position 5.
14. From clue 14, the person driving the helicopter is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in September, so the helicopter driver is in position 1 or 3. Since the September birthday person is in position 3, the helicopter driver is in position 1.

From statement 10, we know the Chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person playing billiard. Since the Chesterfields-smoker is not the Norwegian person, it must be the person in position 2 or 4.

From statement 11, we know the Kools-smoker is to the left or right of the person playing domino. Since the Kools-smoker is in position 4, the person playing domino must be in position 3 or 5.

From statement 14, we know the Norwegian person is to the left or right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the Norwegian person is in position 1, the person who's sport is surfing must be in position 5.
