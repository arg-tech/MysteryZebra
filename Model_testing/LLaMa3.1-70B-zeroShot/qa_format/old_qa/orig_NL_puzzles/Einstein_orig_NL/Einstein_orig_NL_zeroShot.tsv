Einstein_orig_NL_1	"After analyzing the given clues, I'll provide the solution to the puzzle.

First, let's establish some positions and relationships based on the clues:

* The Norwegian is on the far left (Clue 9).
* The person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white (Clue 4), and they are also the coffee drinker (Clue 5). This means Green/Coffee is in the second position, as Norwegian cannot be in the second position due to Clue 4.
* The British person likes red and must be separated from the person who likes green by at least one other person (due to Clues 1 and 4), placing them likely on the right side but not immediately next to Green/Coffee.

Now, let's assign positions for each clue:

1. **Norwegian**: Far left
2. **Green/Coffee** (second position)
3. The milk drinker is in the middle, which means they are third.
4. The blend-smoker is on the left or right of the cat owner (Clue 10), and also near the water drinker (Clue 15). Given their placement flexibility, we'll keep them aside for now.
5. **British/Red** must be separated from Green/Coffee by at least one person.

Given these clues and constraints:

* The German is the Prince-smoker (Clue 13).
* The Swedish owns a dog and isn't specified to be near any particular color or drinker yet.
* Pall-mall smokes bird, which doesn't directly relate to our known positions but gives us another piece for later.

Now let's deduce more:

- Norwegian cannot like green due to the position of Green/Coffee (second). Given Clue 14 (Norwegian is on the left or right of Blue), and since they can only be on the far left, **Blue must be second or third**.
- However, given that Green/Coffee is in the second position, Norwegian cannot like blue directly. Thus, Blue likely corresponds with the person drinking beer (Clue 12) and might fit the first or a non-second/third position scenario more appropriately when considering all clues about beverage preferences.

Considering these points:

* Yellow/Dunhill smoker is also a concern since it must be near the horse owner but isn't directly mentioned in terms of being next to any specific color or drinker we've solidified.
- If Green/Coffee is second, and given that White's position relative to Green (Clue 4), and knowing British/Red can't be immediately next to Green due to Clue 1 implications combined with Clue 4:
  * Blue could potentially fit the Norwegian, which contradicts our need for a direct connection between Norwegian and another color (as per Clue 14) but aligns well considering beverage placements.

Let's attempt to solidify positions further:

- **Norwegian/Blue/B**eer is far left, as it allows the Norwegian to be next to Blue while also adhering to Clue 12 about beer.
- This leaves us with:
  - Norwegian/Blue (1)
  - Green/Coffee (2)
  - Milk drinker (3) as per Clue 8
  - Yellow/Dunhill and Horse owner, along with White’s placement needs careful consideration around the British/Red due to color constraints.

Given all these clues:

- The German must smoke Prince, and their position isn't directly stated but can be inferred later.
- Pall-mall/Bird doesn’t fit neatly yet without more direct connections.
- Blend-smoker's flexibility (Clue 10 and 15) means they could potentially fit near either end.

A possible arrangement considering the given clues:

1. **Norwegian/Blue/Beer** 
2. Green/Coffee
3. Milk drinker (likely White or another color not specified by direct clue yet)
4. British/Red cannot be directly next to Norwegian due to Clue 1 and the established positions, making it difficult without a clear color fit for position 3 that aligns with all other clues.
5. Yellow/Dunhill likely takes one of the remaining spots, possibly near the horse owner.

Given these complexities, let's consider where Fish might fit:

- **Fish**: Given the constraints around colors and beverages not directly specified for fish, it must be placed in a manner that respects all given positions and doesn't conflict with any clues. Since the direct connections to colors and drinks are mostly established, and considering no clue directly prohibits or specifies the position of fish relative to other pets:

Considering the constraints and clues:
- The owner of **Fish** isn’t specified by a unique color preference, drink choice, or cigar brand, but given that most positions are somewhat defined or constrained by other clues.

Given this complexity, let's solve for Fish based on process of elimination and clue implications rather than direct specification:

Considering the arrangement and constraints:
- **Fish:4**

**Note**: The exact reasoning for placing fish at position 4 involves understanding that it cannot be in a position that directly conflicts with specified color preferences (e.g., red, green), beverage choices (e.g., coffee, milk), or cigar brands/pets not yet solidified. Given the constraints around other positions and without direct clues about fish’s owner, its placement respects all given information.

Keep in mind, logic puzzles like this require iterative deduction based on the provided clues. This explanation simplifies some steps for clarity but involves deducing relationships between multiple pieces of information to arrive at a solution that fits all given conditions."	fish:4
Einstein_orig_NL_2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break it down step by step based on the clues provided:

1. The British likes red.
2. The Swedish owns a dog.
3. The Danish drinks tea.
4. Green is to the left of White.
5. The person who likes green drinks coffee.
6. The Pall-Mall smoker owns a bird.
7. The person who likes yellow smokes Dunhill.
8. Milk drinker is in the middle.
9. Norwegian is on the far left.
10. Blend smoker is next to cat owner.
11. Horse owner is next to Dunhill smoker.
12. Bluemaster smoker drinks beer.
13. German smokes Prince.
14. Norwegian is next to person who likes blue.
15. Blend smoker is next to water drinker.

Given these clues, let's deduce the positions:

- From (9), Norwegian is on the far left.
- Since Green is to the left of White (4) and Norwegian is on the far left (9), we can assume Norwegian does not like green or white. Given that British likes red (1), Swedish likes dog (2) which doesn't give us color info, Danish drinks tea but no color preference given (3), and German's cigar brand is known but color preference isn't directly mentioned until later clues, let's pair nationalities with colors using other clues.

- Norwegian being on the far left and next to someone who likes blue (14) means Norwegian likely does not like blue since there's a person to their right they are next to. Given this, we can speculate that Norwegian might like green or yellow based on elimination, but (5) tells us green drinks coffee, which hasn't been directly linked to any nationality yet.

- Since the milk drinker is in the middle (8), and assuming each preference set (color, nationality, beverage, cigar, pet) corresponds to one person, there are 5 sets of preferences. 

Let's create a potential layout based on given information:

1. Far Left: Norwegian - ? - Green/Coffee (since Green has to be on the left of White)
   
   Given that Norwegian is next to someone who likes blue (14), let's assume for now Norwegian doesn't like green but rather could like yellow or another color not yet placed.

2. From (4) and assuming Norwegian isn't the one who likes green, we place Green/Coffee second from the left if Norwegian were to like another color.

3. Middle: Milk drinker - Given no specific nationality linked directly to milk in initial clues, this remains open for now.
   
   However, knowing British likes red (1) and that doesn't give us direct placement yet but it does help eliminate some possibilities since Green is already placed on the left side of our potential arrangement.

4. Based on (7), Dunhill smoker likes yellow. If we consider Norwegian might not like green or white based on their leftmost position, and they are next to someone who likes blue, let's assume for now that Yellow/Dunhill could be a separate entity from Norwegian but still early in the sequence given Yellow isn't directly linked to being far right.

5. From (11), Horse owner is next to Dunhill smoker. Given our layout so far, this clue and others about pets, beverages, or cigar brands don't yet give us a direct link to finalize positions based solely on initial clues provided without making educated guesses.

**Deducing Fish's Position:**

Given the lack of direct information linking any specific nationality or preference set directly to ""Fish"" within the first 15 clues and focusing on solving for where fish could potentially fit, we realize that our direct deductions can't pinpoint exactly where fish is based solely on provided clues without making several assumptions. However, if we were to solve this using traditional logic puzzle methods involving trial and error or further deductive reasoning not immediately apparent from the given clues, we might need additional steps or insights.

Given the nature of the puzzle and typical strategies for solving such logic puzzles, it's common to have a step-by-step elimination process that requires making educated guesses based on given information. However, with the provided clues alone, without further deductions or eliminating possibilities through trial and error, pinpointing the exact location of ""Fish"" directly from these initial steps is challenging.

Thus, a precise answer following the requested format ""**fish:Num**"" cannot be accurately determined based solely on the given instructions and initial deductive reasoning process outlined. The solution for fish's position would typically require additional analysis or deductions not immediately apparent from the provided clues alone.

However, I'll proceed with an approach that might lead to a potential placement:

Assuming we need to place all other pets (cat, bird, dog, horse) based on clues and using elimination:

- Swedish owns a dog (2), but without direct placement next to a color or drinker.
- The Pall-Mall smoker owns a bird (6).
- Horse owner is next to Dunhill smoker (11).

Without explicit connections of these pets to specific colors, nationalities, or other preferences that directly help place ""Fish,"" we must acknowledge the complexity and potential need for additional steps in solving this puzzle accurately.

Given the traditional approach and without further information or deduction steps beyond what's provided here, determining an exact position for ""fish"" based on initial clues would be speculative. Thus, a precise answer like ""**fish:Num**"" cannot be confidently provided following the outlined logic steps alone."	fish:4
Einstein_orig_NL_3	"After solving the puzzle, I found that the positions are as follows:

1. Norwegian - Yellow - Water - Cat - Bluemaster
2. British - Red - Milk - Horse - Dunhill
3. German - Blue - Beer - Fish - Prince 
4. Danish - Green - Coffee - Bird - Pall-mall
5. Swedish - White - Tea - Dog - Blend

Therefore, the answer is: **fish:3**"	fish:4
