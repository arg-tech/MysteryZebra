Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 9, we know the person traveling to London is on the far left.

Clue 14 states that the person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since there is no one to the left of the person traveling to London (as they are on the far left), the person who likes blue must be second from the left.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the dog travels to Nizza. This can't be the person on the far left or second from the left (since they travel to London and like blue respectively). 

From clue 7, we know the kools-smoker likes yellow. Clue 11 states that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.

We can't place the person who travels to Berlin yet as there isn't enough information about their preferences relative to others.

Now let's look at the people in the middle and on the far right:

From clue 8, we know the social-worker is in the middle. Clue 3 states that the architect likes green, and from clue 5, they are to the right of the person who likes ivory. This means the social-worker can't like green or ivory (since they would then be on the far left or far right).

From clue 10, we know the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. Clue 12 states that the lucky-strike-smoker is the project-manager.

Clue 6 states that the old-gold-smoker owns snails, and clue 13 says the person traveling to colone smokes parliaments. 

Now let's look at the colors:
Red (Berlin), Green (architect), Ivory (unknown), Yellow (kools-smoker), Blue (second from left)

Let's put this together:

1. London: blue
2. ?: yellow (as it must be next to someone)
3. ?: ivory 
4. Marseilles: green 
5. ?: red 

From clue 7, the person who likes yellow smokes kools.

Now let's look at jobs:
Architect (green), dancer (Marseilles), social-worker (middle), project-manager (lucky-strike-smoker), electrician (?, unknown)

And pets:
Dog (Nizza), fox (chesterfields-smoker), zebra, horse (next to yellow smoker), snails (old-gold-smoker)

Now let's fill in the gaps:

1. London: blue 
2. ?: yellow (kools-smoker) - next to this is either the person with the dog or the person with the fox
3. ?: ivory (social-worker)
4. Marseilles: green (architect, dancer - from clue 4)
5. Berlin: red 

The electrician must be the one with the remaining pet that hasn't been assigned yet.

Let's see which one is left out:
- Dog goes to Nizza
- Fox goes next to chesterfields-smoker 
- Zebra and horse are left (horse goes next to yellow smoker)

This means zebra must go with either the electrician or old-gold-smoker. As there aren't enough slots for both, we need to find out who smokes old-gold.

Let's try and place chesterfields-smoker:
If they smoke on the right of the fox owner (as in clue 10), that would be next to the person with blue (on far left) which doesn't fit. So chesterfields-smoker is to the left of the fox owner.

So this must mean old-gold-smoker owns snails and goes next to chesterfields-smoker.

Looking at jobs:
- architect is green
- dancer is Marseilles 
- social-worker (middle)
- project-manager smokes lucky-strike

The only remaining slot for electrician would be on the right. This means zebra must go with either fox or old-gold smoker. And it can't be old-gold-smoker since they own snails.

Now we need to work out where colone goes:
From clue 13, person traveling to colone smokes parliaments.
Given this is on the right and electrician hasn't been assigned a slot yet, that means either the dancer or architect (green) can't be on the far right. That would mean either social-worker or project-manager must go next to them.

As chesterfields-smoker goes next to fox, they are unlikely to be in the middle (where social-worker is). So electrician must travel with zebra and smokes parliaments in colone.

Zebra_2domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue carefully and make deductions step by step.

From clues 1 and 9, we know that the person traveling to Berlin likes red and is not on the far left (since they're in a different position than London). From clue 14, since the person traveling to London is to the left or right of the person who likes blue, we can infer the order for these two: London - Blue.

Given clue 8 (the social-worker is in the middle), and considering there are five positions, this means our arrangement looks like _ _ Social-Worker _ _. The person going to Marseilles (dancer) cannot be on the far left (London's position) or immediately next to the social worker without violating other conditions, so they're likely on one end.

Clue 5 tells us that Green is to the right of Ivory. Since the architect likes green and given the positioning we have so far, it's possible that Ivory is in a position adjacent to the Social-Worker but not directly next to them due to clue constraints (this would place Green/Ivory on one side of the social worker).

From clue 10 (Chesterfields-smoker is left or right of the owner of the fox), and clue 11 (Kools-smoker is left or right of the horse's owner), we need to figure out where these animals are in relation to our established sequence. Given the middle spot is taken by a social worker, it’s hard for both chesterfields and kools smokers to be on opposite ends without conflicting with the placement of other clues.

Considering clue 4 (Marseilles - Dancer), if we place Marseilles on one end as per inference from earlier steps, it leaves us little room for other placements, especially considering Berlin must like red and is not London. 

The tricky part now is integrating all these clues with the animals, colors, and jobs to determine where exactly each item fits.

Given clue 13 (Colone - Parliaments), this person can't be in any of the already established end positions for various reasons including but not limited to the fact that Berlin likes red and Marseilles is taken by a dancer.

Here's one possible arrangement based on deductions from clues:

- London (Blue, ?, ?)
- Nizza (Dog, Yellow, Kools) 
- Social-Worker (Ivory, ?, ?)
- Marseilles (Red, Fox/Chesterfields OR Horse/Kools, Dancer) seems unlikely due to color conflicts
- Colone (Parliaments, Green, Architect)

However, realizing that:
- Red is in Berlin, not Marseilles.
- Blue has to be next to London but cannot be on the far left itself.

Upon re-evaluation and correcting based on all clues:

1. The person who likes **blue** must be next to the one going to London but can't be them (London - ?), considering clue 14.
2. Given Berlin likes red, Marseilles is taken by a dancer, and our current setup for social-worker and green, we have:
   - Blue cannot be far left; hence it’s on the right side of the first person or in another position where it can still satisfy being next to London without violating other conditions.

**Final deduction:**
Considering all clues again with the aim to place animals correctly:
- The only pet not directly mentioned as having its owner in a specific city is the **zebra**.
- Given that Nizza has a dog, and Marseilles cannot be Berlin (which likes red), we deduce other positions by exclusion.

**Placing Zebra:**
Since there’s limited space and each person must have a unique combination of pet, color, cigar brand, city, and job without direct contradictions from the clues:

Given all constraints, **zebra’s placement becomes evident through process of elimination rather than direct clue alignment.**

Considering all clues carefully:
- The kools-smoker (yellow) has to be next to horse but not necessarily in that order.
- Old-gold-snail owner can’t directly give us zebra’s position.

**Zebra:** Given the dancer is in Marseilles, social worker in the middle, and direct placements from clues for dog (Nizza), we place other elements like colors and animals by deduction. If London's neighbor likes blue, Berlin must be red, leaving Marseilles to potentially house a different pet due to color conflicts mentioned.

However, it seems there was an oversight in directly connecting clues for a precise zebra placement through step-by-step elimination without making assumptions beyond the provided information.

Given this, let’s correct and clarify: Without explicit clues tying zebra's position directly or indirectly (through a process of direct deduction from given statements), I proceeded with an analysis that aimed to use all provided information efficiently. 

**Correcting my approach for clarity:**
Since we have specific placements and exclusions based on colors and pets, re-evaluating the steps reveals that while I outlined a general strategy for placement, there was an omission in explicitly solving for the zebra’s location through clear deduction from given clues.

However, without directly tying the clues to the zebra's position and acknowledging this puzzle requires step-by-step logical deductions not fully realized here, it becomes apparent that:

**Given Clues Do Not Directly Solve For Zebra’s Position**
In a normal scenario, we would solve for each element by carefully applying each clue in sequence. Since I missed directly solving for the zebra through these clues and my explanations inadvertently skipped over explicitly tying down its position through logical deductions from provided statements, it becomes clear that without explicit clue connections to deduce the zebra's owner or direct placement, one cannot accurately place the zebra based solely on information given.

**In Conclusion:**
Given the misstep in directly solving for zebra’s position and acknowledging an error in explicitly applying all clues towards its direct placement:

A correct step-by-step logical analysis adhering strictly to provided clues without inferential leaps beyond them is necessary. However, due to the oversight in directly addressing each clue's relevance to the zebra's placement within the confines of this explanation, I inadvertently failed to provide a clear, deductive path specifically for the zebra.

**Zebra Placement Requires Direct Clue Deductions**
To accurately place the zebra, one must meticulously apply all given clues without omission or assumption beyond provided information. The initial approach aimed at deduction based on elimination and direct clue application seems to have fallen short in explicitly addressing how each clue ties into placing the zebra.

Given this realization:
- Without an explicit step-by-step deduction for the zebra's position directly from provided clues, acknowledging a mistake in not providing such clarity is essential."	zebra:5
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	"Based on the given information, we can deduce the following:

From 9: The person eating pomegranate is on the far left.

From 14: The person eating pomegranate is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
Since pomegranate is already on the far left, it must be next to the person who likes blue. This means the person who likes blue is second from the left.

From 5: The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
This means ivory must be before green in the sequence.

We know that surfing is in the middle (8), so let's assume the order for now:

pomegranate, blue, ?, surfing, ?, ?

The next step is to figure out where golf is. We have not yet found any information directly linking golf to a specific position or color.

From 4: The person eating potato is the person who's sport is cycling.
From 6: The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails (not related to golf)
From 7: The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow (not related to golf)

Looking at the remaining clues:
11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
12. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball (not related to golf)
13. The person eating peach is the parliaments-smoker.

And then we find a crucial one:
10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
However, this information alone doesn't help us much without knowing where fox is in relation to other clues.

Considering all other given statements again:
- We have 1 and 3 linking strawberry to red and skiing to green but don't tell us about their position relative to golf directly.
- Statement 2 links lime and dog; statement 5 provides additional information on green, which does not relate to our current analysis for the placement of golf.

Given that all clues except statements directly involving blue have been exhausted or do not provide any new information regarding the placement of golf in relation to other elements like color preference, food, sport type, or cigar brands:

Since we can't pinpoint where **golf** is from the remaining clues without making a logical connection between those statements and **golf**, it appears there might have been an oversight in analyzing clues for a more direct link.

However, after re-examining all clues carefully again:
I realized I may have overlooked directly linking certain information together regarding placement of sports. Unfortunately, with provided logic steps I didn't reach the exact position where golf should be using a logical approach from those statements given; without making an incorrect assumption or skipping any potential connections between clues that might be there but aren't immediately clear to me.

In a normal situation, one would continue combining these conditions and re-evaluating them. However, after my detailed analysis of the given information I couldn't find **golf** in this problem description."	golf:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the clues step by step:

From clue 9, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the far left.

From clue 14, we know that this person is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since they are already on the far left, the person who likes blue must be second from the left.

From clue 8, we know that the person whose sport is surfing is in the middle. This means there are two people to the left and right of this person. Let's assume the order so far is: Pomegranate (far left), Blue (second from the left), Surfing (middle).

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since the surfing person is in the middle, let's place the green-liking person third from the left and the ivory-liking person second from the right.

The order so far is: Pomegranate (far left), Blue (second from the left), Surfing (middle), Green (third from the left), Ivory (second from the right).

From clue 3, we know that the skiing person likes green. So, the skiing person must be third from the left.

The order so far is: Pomegranate (far left), Blue (second from the left), Surfing (middle), Skiing/Green (third from the left), Ivory (second from the right).

From clue 4, we know that the potato-eating person's sport is cycling. This person can't be second from the left or third from the left since those spots are already taken.

The order so far is: Pomegranate (far left), Blue (second from the left), Surfing (middle), Skiing/Green (third from the left), Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Ivory (second from the right).

From clue 7, we know that the Kools-smoker likes yellow. From clue 11, this person is to the left or right of the horse owner.

Since there's only one spot left, let's place the Kools-smoker/Yellow second from the right and the Horse owner on the far right.

The order so far is: Pomegranate (far left), Blue (second from the left), Surfing (middle), Skiing/Green (third from the left), Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Yellow/Kools (second from the right), Ivory (no, wait!), Horse (far right).

From clue 10, we know that the Chesterfields-smoker is to the left or right of the fox owner. This means the ivory-liking person can't be second from the right.

The correct order for the last two spots must be: Yellow/Kools (second from the right), Fox/Chesterfield (no!), wait! Ivory must go between yellow and horse. Chesterfields-smoker is to the left or right of fox owner, so that means fox owner goes with Chesterfields!

The correct order for the last three spots is: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Yellow/Kools (no!), wait! Ivory must go between yellow and horse. Fox can't be second from the right since it's to the left or right of chesterfield smoker. 

Let's correct this mistake:
The order for the last three spots is: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Yellow/Kools (second from the right, no!), wait! Fox/Chesterfield (no!). Ivory goes between yellow and horse.

Corrected:

Ivory can't be second from the right. The correct order for the last three spots must be: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Yellow/Kools (no!), that's because Ivory is between Kools-smoker and horse owner! So fox goes with chesterfields. It means Fox/Chesterfield can't go second from the right since it has to be next to ivory!

Corrected:

Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Chesterfield/Fox (no!), Ivory (second from the right), Horse/Kools is wrong! 

Corrected:
The correct order for the last three spots must be: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Kools/Yellow (no!) , wait!

Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Fox/Chesterfield is wrong because it's not next to ivory. So we have Ivory between Kools-smoker and horse owner. That means: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Horse/Kools (no!), that's correct because kools is next to yellow who likes horse! but where is fox? 

Corrected:
The order for the last three spots must be: Cycling/Potato (fourth from the left, or right of middle), Ivory (that means it has to be between Kools-smoker and Horse owner!), Fox can't go with chesterfields on second from the right because it's not next to ivory. Chesterfield smoker is on the left or right of fox owner.

Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	"## Step 1: Analyze clues related to colors and foods
From clue 1, we know the person eating cranberry likes red.
From clue 2, the potato eater owns a dog.
From clue 9, the tomato eater is on the far left.

## Step 2: Analyze clues related to hobbies and pets
From clue 3, the collector likes green.
From clue 4, the banana eater plays board-games.
From clue 8, the photographer is in the middle.
From clue 6, the old-gold smoker owns snails.
From clue 12, the lucky-strike smoker goes skydiving.

## Step 3: Analyze clues related to smoking habits and pets
From clue 5, the person who likes green is to the right of the ivory fan.
From clue 7, the kools smoker likes yellow.
From clue 10, the chesterfields smoker is next to the fox owner.
From clue 11, the kools smoker is next to the horse owner.

## Step 4: Analyze clues related to specific locations
The tomato eater (far left) and the photographer (middle) give us some anchors.
Given that the person eating tomato is on the far left and from clue 14, this person must be next to the person who likes blue.

## Step 5: Combine information for a possible arrangement
Since there are many variables, we start by fixing positions we can:
- Tomato eater (far left), which means the blue fan must be second.
- Photographer is in the middle, so third.
Given these fixed points and the clues about smoking habits and pet ownership, we piece together the rest.

## Step 6: Finalize positions based on available information
Considering all clues and knowing that each person has a unique combination of preferences (color, food, hobby, pet, and smoke), we deduce:
- Tomato eater is far left, which means they also like blue (from clue 14).
- Given the restrictions on smokers and pets, the lucky-strike smoker (skydiving) can't be near the photographer or at the ends.
- The woodworking hobby isn't directly linked to any specific position except that it's not mentioned in direct relation to most clues.

## Step 7: Determine the location of woodworking
Given all other positions are somewhat accounted for with specific hobbies, foods, and pets, we find woodworking by elimination. Knowing that collecting (green), board-games (banana), photography (middle), skydiving (lucky-strike), and the arrangement of smokers and pets leave few options.

## Step 8: Placement by elimination
Given the restrictions on placements for specific hobbies, foods, smoking habits, and considering woodworking wasn't directly mentioned in relation to a specific position, it's logical that woodworking fits into one of the less restrictive positions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{4}$"	woodworking:1
Zebra_2domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 9, we know that the person eating tomato is on the far left.

From clue 14, we know that the person eating tomato is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the tomato-eater is on the far left, the blue-liker must be second from the left.

From clue 2, we know that the person eating potato is the owner of the dog.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating cranberry is the person who likes red.

We can start building a table with this information:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | Blue | ? |

From clue 4, we know that the person eating banana is the person who's hobby is board-games.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is in the middle. Since there are 5 positions, the middle position is 3.

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | Blue | ? |
| 3 (middle) | ? | ? | Photography |

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is the person who likes green. Since the middle position is occupied by photography, the collector (green-liker) must be at position 4 or 5.

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | Blue | ? |
| 3 (middle) | ? | ? | Photography |
| 4 | ? | Green | Collecting |
| 5 | ? | Ivory | ? |

From clue 11, we know that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the middle position is occupied by photography, the kools-smoker must be at position 2 or 4.

However, from clue 7, we know that the kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow. From the table above, we can see that position 4 is already occupied by the green-liker (collector). Therefore, the kools-smoker (yellow-liker) must be at position 2.

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | Yellow | Kools |

From clue 14, we know that the person eating tomato is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the tomato-eater is on the far left, and the yellow-liker is at position 2, the blue-liker must be at position 3 (middle).

However, from clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is photography is in the middle. Therefore, the blue-liker cannot be at position 3.

Let's re-evaluate the information:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | Yellow | Kools |

From clue 14, we know that the person eating tomato is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the tomato-eater is on the far left, and the yellow-liker is at position 2, it's possible that the blue-liker is actually at position 1 (far left).

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | Blue | ? |

From clue 6, we know that the old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.

From clue 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. However, there's no direct information about the position of the chesterfields-smoker.

Let's focus on finding the zebra:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

We know that the person eating cranberry is the person who likes red (clue 1).

From clue 12, we know that the lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's hobby is skydiving.

However, there's no direct information about the position of the zebra. Let's use the process of elimination:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | Blue | ? |

From clue 2, we know that the person eating potato is the owner of the dog.

From clue 13, we know that the person eating carrot is the parliaments-smoker.

Since there are only 5 positions, and some pets have already been assigned (dog, snails), we can try to find a position for the zebra:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | Blue | ? |

Assuming that the person eating cranberry is not at position 5 (since there's no direct information), and using the process of elimination, we can try to find a possible arrangement:

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | Blue | ? |
| 2 | ? | Yellow | Kools |
| 3 (middle) | Banana | ? | Board-games, Photography |
| 4 | Cranberry | Red | ? |
| 5 | ? | Ivory | Old-Gold, Snails |

Now we need to find a position for the fox and the horse:

From clue 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.

From clue 11, we know that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since the kools-smoker is at position 2, the horse must be at position 1 or 3. However, position 1 is already occupied by the tomato-eater (blue-liker), so the horse must be at position 3.

| Position | Food | Color | Pet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 (far left) | Tomato | Blue | ? |
| 2 | ? | Yellow | Kools, Fox |
| 3 (middle) | Banana | Green | Board-games, Photography, Horse |
| 4 | Cranberry | Red | ? |
| 5 | ? | Ivory | Old-Gold, Snails |

Now we need to find a position for the zebra:

Since the horse is at position 3, and the kools-smoker (yellow-liker) is at position 2, the zebra must be at position 4 or 5.

However, position 5 is already occupied by the old-gold-smoker (ivory-liker, snails owner), so the zebra cannot be there.

Therefore, the zebra must be at position 4.

But wait! Position 4 is already occupied by the person eating cranberry (red-liker). This means that the red-liker and the zebra-owner are actually the same person!

So, the final answer is:

**zebra:4**
