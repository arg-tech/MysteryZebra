Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we need to analyze each clue and figure out how they relate to each other.

From clues 9 and 14, we know that cricket is on the far left, and it's next to drama. So, the first two people are:

1. Cricket (Drama)

Clue 2 tells us that polo is the social-worker. Clue 4 says that snowboarding drinks tea. We don't know their positions yet.

From clue 6, we know that cranberry is the engineer.

Clue 7 says that spinach watches western movies.

Clue 8 says that milk is in the middle, which means there are two people on either side of it.

From clues 10 and 11, we can conclude that cauliflower is next to the chef, and spinach (western) is next to the bartender. Since milk is in the middle, these pairs must be on either side of milk:

1. Cricket (Drama)
2. ? (?)
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender
5. ?

Clue 12 says that grapes drink orange-juice.

From clue 13, biathlon eats lime.

Now we can use the movie genres to figure out some positions:

* Clue 1 says that lacrosse watches mystery movies.
* Clue 3 says that coffee drinks horror movies.
* Clue 5 says that horror is to the right of adventure.

So, we have a possible order for the last three people:

... , Adventure, Horror, ...

From clue 1 and clue 6, we can now place lacrosse (mystery) and cranberry (engineer):

1. Cricket (Drama)
2. Lacrosse/Mystery
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender
5. ?

Now we know that coffee drinks horror movies, which means coffee is not in the middle (clue 8). So, coffee must be on the right:

... , Adventure, Coffee/Horror

From clue 10 and clue 11, we can now place cauliflower (chef) and spinach (western):

1. Cricket (Drama)
2. Lacrosse/Mystery
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender
5. Polo/Social-worker doesn't fit here, so it must be in one of the first two spots.

We know that polo is not cricket (clue 9), and polo is not lacrosse (clue 1). So, polo must be in the second spot:

1. Cricket (Drama)
2. Polo/Social-worker
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender
5. ?

Now we have two possible orders for the last three people:

* ... , Adventure, Coffee/Horror
* ... , Snowboarding/Tea, ...

From clue 4, snowboarding drinks tea, which means snowboarding is not in the middle (clue 8). So, snowboarding must be on the right or left of milk. But we already have two people next to milk:

1. Cricket (Drama)
2. Polo/Social-worker
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender

So, snowboarding must be in one of the first two spots. But polo is already in the second spot, so snowboarding must be in the first spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Polo/Social-worker
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef or Spinach/Bartender

Now we know that biathlon eats lime (clue 13). We also know that cauliflower is next to the chef, and spinach is next to the bartender:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Polo/Social-worker
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

From clue 12, we can place grapes and orange-juice:

* Grapes/Orange-juice is not biathlon/lime.
* Grapes/Orange-juice is not snowboarding/tea (clue 4).
* Grapes/Orange-juice is not polo/social-worker.

So, grapes/orange-juice must be the chef or the bartender. But cauliflower is already next to the chef:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Polo/Social-worker
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

Grapes/orange-juice must be in one of the first two spots, but snowboarding is already in the first spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Grapes/Orange-juice
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

Now we can place spinach and western movies:

* Spinach/Western is not snowboarding/tea.
* Spinach/Western is next to the bartender.

So, spinach/western must be in one of the first two spots, but grapes/orange-juice is already in the second spot. Therefore, spinach/western must be on the left or right of grapes/orange-juice:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Grapes/Orange-juice
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

Since cauliflower is next to the chef, spinach/western must be on the left of grapes/orange-juice:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Spinach/Western
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

Now we can place adventure and horror movies:

* Coffee/Horror is to the right of Adventure.
* Coffee/Horror is not biathlon/lime.

So, coffee/horror must be in one of the last two spots. But cauliflower/chef is already in the fourth spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Spinach/Western
3. Milk
4. Cauliflower/Chef
5. Biathlon/Lime

Adventure must be in the third or fourth spot, but milk is already in the third spot. So, adventure must be in the fourth spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Spinach/Western
3. Milk
4. Adventure
5. Coffee/Horror

Now we can place lacrosse and mystery movies:

* Lacrosse/Mystery is not snowboarding/tea.
* Lacrosse/Mystery is not spinach/western.

So, lacrosse/mystery must be in one of the last two spots. But coffee/horror is already in the fifth spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Spinach/Western
3. Milk
4. Adventure
5. Coffee/Horror

Lacrosse/Mystery must be in the fourth or fifth spot, but adventure is already in the fourth spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Lacrosse/Mystery
3. Milk
4. Adventure
5. Coffee/Horror

Finally, we can place water:

* Water is not snowboarding/tea.
* Water is not spinach/western.
* Water is not milk.
* Water is not adventure.
* Water is not coffee/horror.

So, water must be in the second spot:

1. Snowboarding/Tea (Cricket)
2. Water
3. Milk
4. Adventure
5. Coffee/Horror

**water: 2**

However this solution doesn't satisfy all conditions and was created by mistake.
After reevaluating I found correct positions of people.

Here is correct answer:

1. Cricket/Drama
2. Lacrosse/Mystery
3. Milk 
4. Cauliflower/Chef, Spinach/Bartender, Water or Biathlon/Lime (any order)
5. Snowboarding/Tea 

Biathlon can not be in position 1 as it conflicts with other positions of people.
Therefore correct answer is:

**water: 4**"	water:1
Zebra_4domain_replacements_0	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the person who prefers cricket
From clue 9, we know that the person whose sport is cricket is on the far left.

## Step 2: Identify the movie genre associated with the person who prefers cricket
Using clue 14, we understand that the person who prefers cricket is to the left or right of the person watching drama movies. Given cricket is on the far left, drama must be second from the left.

## Step 3: Place the social-worker based on their sport preference
From clue 2, we know that the person whose sport is polo is a social-worker. This does not directly tell us the position but gives us an association to remember for later steps.

## Step 4: Identify the positions of horror and adventure movie fans relative to each other
Clue 5 tells us that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching adventure movies.

## Step 5: Determine the beverage preference of the horror movie fan
From clue 3, we know the person drinking coffee watches horror movies. This doesn't give a direct position but another association for later use.

## Step 6: Position the snowboarding sport enthusiast based on their beverage preference
Clue 4 states that the person whose sport is snowboarding drinks tea. Like previous steps, this gives us an association to remember.

## Step 7: Place lacrosse and mystery associations
From clue 1, we know that the person who prefers lacrosse watches mystery movies. This association doesn't give a direct position yet but will be useful later.

## Step 8: Position the engineer based on their food preference
Clue 6 tells us that the person eating cranberry is an engineer. This does not directly tell us the position but gives another piece of information to use in conjunction with other clues.

## Step 9: Determine the positions of western and spinach associations
From clue 7, we know that the person eating spinach watches western movies. This association will help in further steps.

## Step 10: Position milk as a beverage in the middle
Clue 8 directly tells us that the person drinking milk is in the middle. This gives us a fixed point to start placing other associations around.

## Step 11: Associate cauliflower with either side of the chef
From clue 10, we know that the person eating cauliflower is on the left or right of the chef. This helps to narrow down positions for the chef and cauliflower eater.

## Step 12: Position spinach relative to the bartender
Clue 11 tells us that the person eating spinach is to the left or right of the bartender, giving another association to consider in placing individuals.

## Step 13: Match grapes with orange-juice and lime with biathlon
From clues 12 and 13, we have specific associations for food items with beverages and sports but no direct positions yet.

## Step 14: Compile all associations into possible arrangements
Considering the fixed points (cricket on the far left, milk in the middle) and other associations, we can start to piece together a possible arrangement. However, without explicit step-by-step logic leading directly from these clues to a specific position for the pilot, we recognize that solving this puzzle requires making connections between all given information and using process of elimination.

## Step 15: Deduce the pilot's position through elimination
Given the complexity and the instructions provided, it seems there was an oversight in directly deducing the pilot's position step-by-step from the clues without assuming or inferring additional information not explicitly stated. Normally, one would use a grid or table to organize the clues and systematically eliminate possibilities to find the pilot's job.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"	pilot:5
Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 9, we know that the person with the hobby ""cooking"" is on the far left.

From clue 14, we know that this person is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.

From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is singing is the person who likes red. This can't be the cooking person (far left), so let's place them second from the left.

So far, we have:
 Cooking (?) | Singing (Red) | ?

From clue 8, we know that the freelancer is in the middle, so they must be third or fourth. Let's place them third for now.

Now we have:
 Cooking (?) | Singing (Red) | Freelancer (?) | ? | ?

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. Since the cooking person can't like green (clue 3), they must like ivory or another color.

From clue 4, we know that the electrician's hobby is board-games. This can't be the freelancer (middle), so let's place them fourth for now.

Now we have:
 Cooking (?) | Singing (Red) | Freelancer (?) | Electrician (Board-Games) | ?

From clue 11, we know that the person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house. From clue 7, we know this person likes yellow.

Since the cooking person can't like yellow (clue 14), they must be to one side of the documentary person, and the craftsman house must be between them.

From clue 10, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left or right of the farmhouse house. This person can't be in the far left cooking position, so let's place them fifth for now.

Now we have:
 Cooking (?) | Singing (Red) | Freelancer (?) | Electrician (Board-Games) | Fantasy (?)

The only color left for the cooking person is blue, which satisfies clue 14. The freelancer must like green (clue 3). The electrician can't be a journalist (clue 4), so they must have another job.

Now we have:
 Cooking (Blue) | Singing (Red) | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?) | Fantasy (?)

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is video-games lives in a colonial house. This can't be the freelancer (middle), so let's place them first or last.

The only house left for the cooking person is the townhouse. The farmhouse must be next to the fantasy person, who likes yellow (clue 7).

Now we have:
 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Singing (Red) | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Fantasy (Yellow): Farmhouse

From clue 6, we know that the satire person lives in a gothic-revival house. This can't be the electrician or fantasy person, so let's place them second.

The only job left for the electrician is librarian. However, this contradicts our previous assumption about the electrician's job. Let's correct this:

 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Satire: Gothic-Revival | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Fantasy (Yellow): Farmhouse

From clue 12, we know that the mystery person is a lawyer. This can't be the freelancer or electrician, so let's place them second.

Now we have:
 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Mystery (Lawyer): Gothic-Revival | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Fantasy (Yellow): Farmhouse

The only job left for the electrician is indeed the magician's rival, but that would be too simple. Let's try to place the magician instead.

From clue 13, we know that the horror person has a magic-tricks hobby. This can't be the fantasy or mystery person, so let's place them fifth.

Now we have:
 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Mystery (Lawyer): Gothic-Revival | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Magic-Tricks (Horror): Farmhouse

The only job left for the electrician is actually... no, wait! The last house is craftsman. We can now place it:

 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Mystery (Lawyer): Gothic-Revival | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Magic-Tricks (Horror): Craftsman

Now we have the correct sequence of houses.

From clue 3, we know that the journalist likes green. This is already satisfied by the freelancer.

The only job left for the electrician is actually the magician's rival, no... just kidding!

Let's review what we have:
 Cooking (Blue): Townhouse | Mystery (Lawyer): Gothic-Revival | Freelancer (Green, Journalist) | Electrician (Board-Games, ?): Colonial | Magic-Tricks (Horror): Craftsman

Since the magician is fifth, and there are only two jobs left (librarian and electrician), the librarian must be... second to last!

So, after reordering the houses according to the people:
 
 Townhouse | Gothic-Revival: Mystery (Lawyer) -> incorrect
 Colonial | Farmhouse | Craftsman 

Let's reorder correctly.

 Farmhouse: Fantasy (Yellow)
 The person watching documentary movies is to the left or right of the craftsman house. So, it can be the farmhouse.
 Colonial | Townhouse 
 Now let's check again.
 Video-games is in colonial house

 Colonial: Video-Games

Zebra_4domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing all 14 clues, I came up with a solution:

Here is the arrangement from left to right:
1. Cooking (Blue), Yellow (Documentary) - Craftsman
2. Board-games (Ivory), Electrician 
3. Freelancer, Green (Journalist) - Farmhouse
4. Video-games, Colonial
5. Magic-tricks/Horror (Red, Singing), Gothic-revival

The only possible position for Townhouse is between the 2nd and 3rd house:
Cooking (Blue), Yellow (Documentary) - Craftsman
Board-games (Ivory), Electrician - Townhouse
Freelancer, Green (Journalist) - Farmhouse

Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"To solve this, we'll analyze each clue step by step:

1. R&B fan grows aconite.
2. Dubstep fan's birthday is in September.
3. Coffee drinker grows iris.
4. Punk fan drinks tea.
5. Iris grower (coffee drinker) is to the right of rose grower.
6. Musical movies fan's birthday is in July.
7. Western movies fan grows daffodil.
8. Milk drinker is in the middle.
9. Pop fan is on the far left.
10. Sports movies fan is next to April birthday person.
11. Western movies fan (daffodil grower) is next to August birthday person.
12. Fantasy movies fan drinks orange-juice.
13. House fan watches horror movies.
14. Pop fan is next to begonia grower.

Given the clues, we can deduce positions:

- Far left: Pop fan
- Since pop fan must be next to begonia grower (clue 14), and there's no direct clue linking another hobby directly with pop or its immediate neighbors, let's first fill in what we know:
  - Pop doesn't match aconite (R&B), iris (coffee), daffodil (western movies), so it must relate to begonia.
- Middle: Milk drinker
- We know the coffee drinker grows iris and is to the right of rose (clue 5). Given this, if pop fan on the far left is also next to begonia grower, we have a possible order for some:
  - Pop/begonia, ?, ?, milk drinker, ?

Given the positions:

- The person who grows daffodil watches western movies and must be next to August birthday (clue 11). Since pop fan can't watch sports or western due to other clues, this likely places western movies watcher in the second position.
  
Thus, a partial order:
- Far left: Pop/begonia
- Second: Western/daffodil/August

The R&B fan grows aconite (clue 1), but we don't have enough information yet to place them directly. However, considering coffee drinker (iris grower) must be to the right of rose (clue 5), and given the positions so far:

- We can deduce that since pop fan is next to begonia grower on the left, and considering the other clues about drinks, birthdays, and movie preferences:
  
The order becomes clearer with more deductions but we directly address water's position by process of elimination. 

Given the final puzzle solution (without a visual table due to format constraints), focusing on deducing where 'water' is among the preferences:

- **Pop fan** grows begonia.
- Western/daffodil/August birthday person follows, linked to September not directly but by association in clues.
- Middle: Milk drinker.
  
Considering all clues about music genres, flower varieties, movie genres, and drinks, without a step-by-step breakdown for each due to complexity:

**The position of 'water'** can be inferred as being associated with the person whose preferences aren't directly outlined by other clues or must fit within the constraints not explicitly mentioned. Given this logic puzzle's structure, every detail about water's placement is tied to the process of elimination based on what we know about other placements.

Thus, focusing on where 'water' could logically fit:

- With house fan watching horror movies and their drink not specified among the given clues directly linking drinks to hobbies (except for coffee with iris grower), tea with punk fan, milk in the middle, orange-juice with fantasy movies, and considering pop fan's position:
  
**Water** must be associated with either R&B or house since those are the music genres left without a specified drink preference directly linked to them.

However, given R&B is tied to aconite (clue 1) but not explicitly to a drink other than through the association process:

**The direct placement of water** considering all clues would likely place it with either R&B fan or house fan based on process of elimination. But since specific positions aren't fully solved here, and focusing solely on where 'water' could logically fit without a complete breakdown for every preference due to complexity:

We acknowledge that the puzzle's constraints make direct placement challenging without explicit clue-to-preference associations.

Given this logic puzzle's format and focusing strictly on deducing water's position:

**Water:5**

This answer reflects the process of elimination based on given clues, acknowledging the puzzle requires a comprehensive analysis for accurate positioning."	water:1
Zebra_4domain_replacements_2	"After analyzing the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.

From clue 9, we know that the fan of pop is on the far left. Clue 14 states that the fan of pop is to the left or right of the person who grows begonia, so the person growing begonia must be second from the left.

From clue 13, we know that the fan of house is the same as the person watching horror movies. From clue 5, we know that the person growing iris is to the right of the person growing rose. Clue 3 states that the person drinking coffee is the person who grows iris, so the order for these three people must be: ?, rose, iris.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of r&b is the same as the person who grows aconite. From clue 2, we know that the fan of dubstep's birthday is in September.

Now let's summarize what we have so far:

 Left to Right:
- Fan of pop (far left) - ?, begonia
- ?, rose, iris

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking milk is in the middle. Since there are five people, the middle one must be third from either side.

Now let's analyze some more clues:

- Clue 10: The person watching sports movies is on the left or right of the person who's birthday is in April.
- Clue 11: The person watching western movies (daffodil) is to the left or right of the person who's birthday is in August.

From clue 6, we know that the person watching musical movies has a birthday in July. 

Combining these clues and our current state, let's try to fill some gaps:

 Left to Right:
- Fan of pop - begonia
- ?, rose, iris (milk)
- ?, daffodil

From clue 12, we know that the person drinking orange-juice watches fantasy movies.

Now, using all these clues together and our current state:

The final arrangement is (left to right):
 
pop-begonia-april-milk-february-dubstep-september
r&b-aconite-july-iris-august-house

So **february:3**"	february:5
