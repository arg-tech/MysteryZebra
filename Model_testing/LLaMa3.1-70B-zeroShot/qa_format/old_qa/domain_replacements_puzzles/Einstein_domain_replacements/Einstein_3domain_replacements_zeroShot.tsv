Einstein_3domain_replacements_0	"## Step 1: Start by placing the Norwegian on the far left as per clue 9.
We know from clue 9 that the Norwegian is on the far left.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the person traveling to Miami and Hannover based on clue 4.
From clue 4, we understand that the person traveling to Miami must be to the left of the person traveling to Hannover. Given the Norwegian's fixed position, we can place the person going to Miami second from the left.

## Step 3: Identify the British person's travel destination as Venice based on clue 1.
Clue 1 tells us that the British person is traveling to Venice, but we don't know their exact position yet.

## Step 4: Place the Swedish person and their dog based on clue 2.
We are informed in clue 2 that the Swedish person owns a dog. However, without further information about their travel destination or hobby, we can't pinpoint their exact location.

## Step 5: Determine the hobby of the Danish person as photography from clue 3.
From clue 3, it's clear that the Danish person enjoys photography.

## Step 6: Analyze clues to find a pattern for hobbies and pets.
By analyzing clues 2, 3, 12, we can start making connections between nationalities, hobbies, and pets but still need more information to place them accurately.

## Step 7: Use clue 5 to identify the person traveling to Miami's hobby as traveling.
Clue 5 tells us that the person going to Miami has a hobby of traveling. This matches with our earlier deduction from clue 4.

## Step 8: Place the person watching documentary movies and their bird based on clue 6.
From clue 6, we know this person owns a bird but lack specific information about their travel destination or nationality.

## Step 9: Identify the person going to Nizza as a fan of western movies from clue 7.
Clue 7 links Nizza with western movies. Without direct connections to hobbies or pets, we must wait for more deductions.

## Step 10: Determine the hobby of fishing is in the middle based on clue 8.
From clue 8, we know that the person who enjoys fishing is centrally located but lack specifics about their nationality or travel destination.

## Step 11: Analyze clues to find connections between hobbies and movie genres.
Clues 6, 7, 12 give us some insight into hobbies and movie preferences but require more specific information to accurately place individuals.

## Step 12: Use clue 10 to link the zombie movies fan with the cat owner.
From clue 10, we understand that the person who watches zombie movies is near the cat owner. This starts forming a picture of relationships between hobbies, pets, and movie genres.

## Step 13: Connect the horses' owner with the western movies fan based on clue 11.
Clue 11 places the horse owner next to the fan of western movies, giving us another piece of the puzzle.

## Step 14: Identify the German person's preference for horror movies from clue 13.
From clue 13, we learn that the German person enjoys horror movies but still need to figure out their travel destination and hobby.

## Step 15: Use clues 14 and 15 to further connect nationalities with hobbies and pets.
Clue 14 places the Norwegian near Liverpool, and clue 15 links the zombie movie fan with reading. These connections start solidifying positions.

## Step 16: Start building a table or matrix to organize information.
Given the complexity of interconnected clues, organizing them into a table or matrix becomes essential for accurate placement.

## Step 17: Fill in the gaps using deductive reasoning and elimination.
With all clues considered and some positions fixed, use logic to fill in the remaining gaps. The Norwegian is on the far left (clue 9), near Liverpool (clue 14). Given the British person goes to Venice (clue 1) but isn't specified as being on an end, they can be placed centrally or right of center, considering the fixed positions and connections.

## Step 18: Determine the position of fish.
Given the constraints and deductions from previous steps, we need to directly address where ""fish"" fits in. Without a direct clue specifying the owner of the fish's travel destination, nationality, hobby, or movie preference that hasn't been mentioned before, we deduce based on elimination.

The final answer is: **fish:4**"	fish:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the given clues, I have solved the puzzle and found the correct placement for each person. Here are the results:

1. New-York: Red, February, Pall-Mall, Dancer
2. San-Francisco: Yellow, May, Dunhill, Librarian
3. Venice: Blue, July, Prince, Nurseerman
4. Prague: White, November, Bluemaster, Nurse
5. Nizza: Green, March, Blend, Dressmaker

According to the solution, **nurse** is in position 4.

So, the final answer is:
**nurse:4**"	nurse:4
Einstein_3domain_replacements_2	"To solve this puzzle, let's break down the information into categories and apply them step by step.

### Step 1: Months and Music Genres
- April: Metal (1)
- September: Dog (2), no music genre specified yet.
- June: Tea drinker (3), no specific birthday or music genre mentioned yet.

### Step 2: Apply the Given Clues
From clue 9, July is on the far left. 
Clue 4 indicates that Country and Salsa fans are next to each other, but since we don't know their positions relative to others yet, let's keep this in mind for later.
Clue 13 tells us December is the Police-officer, no music genre mentioned.

### Step 3: Analyze Jobs and Pets
- The musician owns a bird (6).
- The fan of soul is the photographer (7), with implications for pet ownership or beverages not directly stated yet.

### Step 4: Beverages and Their Implications
- Country fan drinks coffee (5), implying this person might be in June, but since June's birthday drink tea (3), we must place them elsewhere.
- The teacher drinks beer (12).

### Step 5: Pet Ownership
- September owns a dog (2).
- Paramedic is near the cat owner (10), and also near someone who drinks water (15).

### Step 6: Constructing Order Based on Available Clues
Since July is far left, let's start placing people:
- Far Left (July): No direct clues yet for music genre or job, but this person must be next to the indie fan (14) and can't drink milk since that's in the middle (8).
- Next to Country (right of July due to 4, assuming country is not far left as it would contradict with salsa being right of country), we know this person drinks coffee.
- The tea drinker (June) might fit a gap where their birthday isn't conflicting with other information.

Given these steps and clues:
- **Ordering Months:** We have July on the far left. Assuming April (metal fan) can be placed considering other clues like pet ownership and beverages, we start building around July.
- Given the person in September owns a dog, and considering police-officer is December, we fill gaps based on jobs, pets, and drinks.

### Final Step: Placement Based on Remaining Clues
- Since paramedic must be near cat (10) and water drinker (15), this influences where we place some individuals. Considering these are constraints rather than direct placements, we deduce possible positions.
- The person in the middle drinks milk (8), influencing our central placement.

**Given All Steps Above:**
The ordering process involves combining clues for a solution that respects all conditions. Directly solving for fish without explicit clues requires understanding its non-exclusion from any position not directly mentioned against another pet or characteristic.

Assuming we place individuals based on given constraints, and noting the lack of direct information about fish's placement except through exclusion or indirect hints:

**Placing Fish:**
Considering paramedic is near water drinker (15) and cat owner (10), and given the other clues that might indirectly hint at positions but do not explicitly state where fish should be placed, we infer based on exclusions and available slots.

Given the constraints and steps, without explicit information for fish's placement or direct contradictions, let's analyze remaining positions considering all provided hints:

Since we cannot precisely place fish without breaking down each possible arrangement given (and since I must follow your format but lack space to detail every combination here), let's consider typical logic puzzle resolution strategies that involve trial and error with the given clues.

Given this complexity, a direct answer requires assuming some placements based on process of elimination which hasn't been detailed step-by-step due to format constraints. 

However, typically in such puzzles:
- We'd start by fixing knowns (e.g., April for Metal, September for Dog owner) and iteratively apply other clues.
- Considering the paramedic's placement near water drinker and cat owner, and given no direct clue contradicts fish being owned by someone not otherwise specified against another pet...

**Answer Format:**
Given the detailed steps weren't fully elaborated due to complexity and format constraints but following your request for a solution in **fish:Num** format where Num represents the position from left (1) to right (5), without direct calculation shown here:

Assuming process of elimination with given clues, and acknowledging we've not directly solved each placement through explicit steps due to space and format:

The final answer is: **fish:3**"	fish:4
