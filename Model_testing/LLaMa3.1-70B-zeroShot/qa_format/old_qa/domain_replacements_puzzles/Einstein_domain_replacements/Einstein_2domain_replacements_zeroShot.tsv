Einstein_2domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we need to carefully apply each piece of information to narrow down the possibilities for each house and its occupant's preferences.

1. The British person likes red.
2. The Swedish person eats strawberry.
3. The Danish person lives in a tower house.
4. The green liker is left of the white liker, and from (5), the green liker is in a townhouse.
5. This implies the townhouse is to the left of the white liker but doesn't specify if it's immediately next or has one house between them.
6. The pall-mall smoker eats onion.
7. The yellow liker smokes dunhill.
8. The palace house is in the middle, making the order something like: ?, ?, Palace, ?, ?.
9. The Norwegian is on the far left.
10. The blend smoker is next to someone eating lemon.
11. The eggplant eater is next to the dunhill smoker (yellow liker).
12. The bluemaster smoker lives in a cottage.
13. The German smokes prince.
14. The Norwegian is next to someone who likes blue, which can't be determined yet due to multiple possibilities.
15. The blend smoker is also near the modern house.

Let's try to organize what we know:

- Far left: Norwegian (color unknown)
- Next to Norwegian: Blue liker or another color that isn't green (since green is in a townhouse, and there's no indication it's next to Norwegian directly).
- Since the palace is in the middle, let's assume the order for now without specifics is:
  - Norwegian, ?, Palace, ?, ?
- Given the constraints, let's try placing what we can with certainty:
    - The Danish person lives in a tower house (3). This could be any of the houses except for townhouse and cottage.
    - The Swedish person eats strawberry but has no specific location yet.
    - The green liker is in the townhouse (5), which is to the left of the white liker (4).
    
Considering all constraints, we can't directly solve lime's position without making some educated guesses. However, we need to remember that each clue must be applied carefully.

Given these clues and after organizing them:

- The Norwegian (far left) cannot like green because they are next to someone who likes blue (14), but since the British likes red (1), it suggests that either the Norwegian or the person next to them could potentially like blue, which doesn't immediately help without further deduction.
- The person eating lime must be placed considering all other constraints. Since direct placement from given clues is challenging without making some assumptions, let's address the knowns more clearly:
    - The British (red) and Swedish (strawberry) are not directly next to each other due to the middle palace house acting as a divider in the sequence.
    - Given the townhouse is to the left of the white liker (4 & 5), and if we consider the palace's central position, it might look something like this: ?, Townhouse, Palace, ?, ?.

However, without directly deducing lime's placement through given information alone due to the complexity of overlapping clues, let's try a more analytical approach based on exclusions:

- If the green liker is in the townhouse and to the left of white (and considering other constraints), we have limited options for placing the others.
- The Swedish person eats strawberry but isn't directly placed. However, knowing their placement isn't as crucial without direct connections to lime.

Given these deductions and acknowledging the puzzle's complexity:

To place lime correctly without making assumptions beyond provided clues is challenging. Direct clues leading to lime are absent or indirectly mentioned through other preferences (like the blend smoker being near lemon). 

Considering the lack of a direct clue tying any specific house, color, or cigar brand directly to lime with certainty from the given statements and acknowledging an oversight in my detailed step-by-step deduction process for a precise placement based on provided clues:

I would recommend re-examining clues 4 through 15 more closely to deduce the exact placement of lime without assuming positions not explicitly stated. However, given the information and typical logic puzzle constraints, each element must be considered against others for accurate placement.

Given this complexity and my failure to directly derive lime's position without potential assumptions:

A detailed re-examination is necessary for a precise answer following the format requested."	lime:4
Einstein_2domain_replacements_1	"Let's solve this puzzle step by step:

From (9), we know that parkour is on the far left.

From (4), green is to the left of white, and from (5), green drinks coffee.

Combining these facts with (14), we get:
parkour | green (coffee) | ... | ... | ...

From (8), milk is in the middle. We don't know who likes milk yet, so let's leave it for now.

From (2), snowboarding is born in January, and from (1), tennis likes red. Since parkour is on the far left, snowboarding cannot be next to parkour (otherwise, they would both have extreme sports). Therefore, we can place snowboarding as follows:
parkour | green (coffee) | ... | snowboarding | ...

From (3), skateboarding drinks tea.

From (6), pall-mall is born in April. Since blend-smoker is on the left or right of February (10), and November is next to dunhill-smoker (11), we can conclude that June is not next to parkour, green, or snowboarding. Therefore, June must be on the far right.

From (12), bluemaster drinks beer. We don't know who smokes bluemaster yet, but we'll come back to it later.

Now, let's look at the colors:
- Green is already placed.
- White is next to green (4).
- Red likes tennis (1), and parkour is on the far left (9). Therefore, red must be next to parkour or snowboarding. Since yellow smokes dunhill (7) and November is next to dunhill-smoker (11), we can conclude that red must be next to parkour.
- Blue is either on the far left with parkour (14) or on the right side of green.

After trying different combinations, I found a possible solution:
parkour (blue) | green (coffee) | soccer (milk) | snowboarding | skateboarding

Now we can fill in the remaining information:

* Red likes tennis, so red must be next to parkour. Blue is already taken by parkour, so blue cannot be on the right side of green.
* Dunhill-smoker likes yellow and is next to November (11). Therefore, dunhill-smoker must be snowboarding's neighbor, which means snowboarding drinks water.

With this information, we can fill in the remaining gaps:
parkour (blue) | green (coffee) | soccer (milk) | skateboarding (tea) | snowboarding (water)

Cigar brands:
- Bluemaster drinks beer and cannot be parkour or soccer. Bluemaster must be either green or snowboarding, but bluemaster-smoker is not mentioned as being next to any other specific person. Therefore, bluemaster-smoker must be skateboarding.
- Pall-mall is born in April (6) and must be on the left side of February (10). Pall-mall cannot be soccer or snowboarding. Therefore, pall-mall-smoker must be green.
- Dunhill likes yellow (7) and is next to November (11). Since November is not mentioned as being next to any specific sport or color, we can conclude that dunhill-smoker must be skateboarding's neighbor, which means dunhill-smoker is snowboarding.
- Prince smokes soccer (13).
- Blend-smoker is on the left or right of February (10) and drinks water. However, since blend-smoker is also next to the person drinking water (15), we can conclude that blend-smoker must be parkour.

Finally:
parkour (blue, blend) | green (coffee, pall-mall) | soccer (milk, prince) | skateboarding (tea, bluemaster) | snowboarding (water, dunhill)

June is the person who likes white and drinks beer. However, since June's birthday is not mentioned as being next to any specific sport or color, we can conclude that June must be on the far right side of the list.

Einstein_2domain_replacements_2	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left.

Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is on the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is already on the far left, the person who likes blue must be second from the left.

Clue 4 states that the person who likes green is on the left of the person who likes white. Clue 5 says the person who likes green is drinking coffee.

So far, we have:

Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue) - ? (green/coffee) - ?

From clue 8, we know the person drinking milk is in the middle. This means our current order has a gap between the second and third positions for the milk drinker.

Clue 2 tells us that the Swedish person likes cricket, but we don't have enough information to place them yet.

Now let's use clue 1: the British person likes red.

From clue 3, we know the Danish person drinks tea. Clues 10 and 15 mention London, which is next to a person who likes lacrosse or water. We can't determine their positions yet.

Clue 7 says the person traveling to Edinburgh likes yellow, and clue 11 places skateboarding on either side of this person.

Now we know:

Norwegian (far left) - ? (blue) - ? (green/coffee) - Milk drinker - ?

Clues 6 and 12 tell us that someone travels to Venice for climbing and someone else goes to New York for beer. We can't determine their positions yet.

From clue 13, we know the German person travels to Liverpool, but not where they are in the order.

Now let's try to place ice-hockey:

Since the Swedish person likes cricket (clue 2), and none of the other clues directly relate to ice-hockey, we need to look for a gap that doesn't contradict any existing information. Considering all the constraints, ice-hockey must be at position 5.

The final order is not entirely determined due to missing direct connections between some variables, but given the available data:

ice-hockey:5"	ice-hockey:4
