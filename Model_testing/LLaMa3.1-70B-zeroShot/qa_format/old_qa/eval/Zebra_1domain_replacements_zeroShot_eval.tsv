Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left.

Clue 14 tells us that the Norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue. Since the Norwegian is already on the far left, the person who likes blue must be to their right (second position).

Clue 1 says the English is the person who likes red.

Clue 5 states that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. We don't know where they are yet, but we'll keep this in mind.

Clue 8 tells us that the weightlifter is in the middle (third position).

Now let's look at clues 6 and 10. The Old-Gold smoker owns snails and must be paired with either the fox or horse owner due to clue 10 being a separate statement and clue 11 involving different cigars and pets.

From clue 4, we know the Ukrainian is the person who does biathlon.

We also know from clue 3 that baseball corresponds to green. From clue 5, green must be after ivory (third or fourth). Weightlifting is in the middle (third), so green can only fit on the right of weightlifting.

Clue 7 says Kools smoker likes yellow and must be near horse (not necessarily next).

Given that blue comes second, let's try fitting some pieces around it:

Blue:2

English (red) and Spanish (dog) don't have fixed positions yet. Japanese (Parliaments) also doesn't fit anywhere concrete.

Norwegian:1 -> Blue:2

Clue 11 tells us the Kools smoker is to the left or right of the horse owner, but yellow hasn't been assigned a position yet. The only place that allows for either left or right placement of Kools near a pet while not interfering with established positions (including middle weightlifting) would put Kools at either end.

Given Old-Gold is taken by snails and has to be paired with fox due to lack of options, we can deduce the Chesterfields smoker must own the horse because clue 10 gives it two options that are already accounted for by other clues indirectly. Thus:

Kools (yellow) cannot fit at either end since they must be next to the horse, placing Kools third doesn't allow for this condition unless placed with weightlifting, but this is impossible as middle has a different sport.

So far, we can say: 
- Weightlifter is in the middle.
- Green follows ivory (baseball).
- Blue is second.

Considering all positions and clues given:

Let's fit the remaining sports into their respective positions based on color, pet, cigar preferences:

Norwegian:1
Blue:2 -> Must have a sport. Can't be weightlifting. Not baseball because of green after ivory.

English must like red (clue 1), but English isn't specified to any end or a particular position.

Given blue is second and weightlifting in the middle, let's deduce based on pet clues and remaining sports:

Norwegian (handball doesn't fit due to lucky strike) -> Blue:2
This means parkour fits nowhere else except 5th. Given English (red), Spanish (dog), and Japanese are left, they must occupy positions around weightlifting considering other fixed locations.

Final position for **parkour** without revealing all combinations is:
**parkour:5**

Keep in mind that a full solution requires figuring out the exact arrangement of all preferences which would require more deductions based on given clues."	parkour:1	parkour:5	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_0	"To solve this puzzle, we will break down each piece of information and use a step-by-step approach.

1. The english is the person who likes red.
   - **English:** Red (color)

2. The spanish is the owner of the dog.
   - **Spanish:** Dog (pet)

3. The person who's sport is baseball is the person who likes green.
   - Baseball: Green (color)

4. The ukranian is the person who's sport is biathlon.
   - Ukrainian: Biathlon (sport)

5. The person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory.
   - ? : Ivory, ? : Green

6. The old-gold-smoker is the owner of the snails.
   - Old-Gold: Snails (pet)

7. The kools-smoker is the person who likes yellow.
   - Kools: Yellow (color)

8. The person who's sport is weightlifting is in the middle.
   - Middle: Weightlifting

9. The norwegian is on the far left.
   - Norwegian (far left)

10. The chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox.
    - ? : Fox, Chesterfields (or vice versa)

11. The kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.
    - Kools: Yellow, ? : Horse (or vice versa)

12. The lucky-strike-smoker is the person who's sport is handball.
    - Lucky-Strike: Handball

13. The japanese is the parliaments-smoker.
    - Japanese: Parliaments

14. The norwegian is to the left or right of the person who likes blue.
    - Norwegian, ? : Blue (or vice versa)

Given these clues and without a clear way to directly place each item with just the provided information in a single pass, we must deduce through elimination and direct placement.

**Direct Placements:**

- Norwegian is on the far left. Given clue 14, the person who likes blue can't be Norwegian (as they are already placed at one end), so they must be next to them.
- Japanese smokes Parliaments but there's no direct pet or color information for them yet.

**Elimination:**

Since we don't have a straightforward way to place everyone without guessing, let's look at what we can conclude with certainty:

1. **English:** Red
2. **Spanish:** Dog
3. Baseball: Green (but who smokes and what pet?)
4. Ukrainian: Biathlon (no direct info on color or pet yet)
5. Weightlifting is in the middle.
6. Old-Gold: Snails
7. Kools: Yellow, and near Horse
8. Norwegian: Far Left, next to Blue
9. Japanese: Parliaments

Given these points and knowing we have to place Zebra somewhere without direct clues about it or its smoker's preferences, let's look at the pets:

- Dog: Spanish
- Snails: Old-Gold
- Fox and Chesterfields are paired but not directly placed.
- Horse is near Kools (Yellow).
- **Zebra** doesn't have a match yet.

Given all clues, we can start placing based on elimination and adjacency:

1. Norwegian (Blue) - far left
2. ? (with Blue)
3. Weightlifting is in the middle, so 3rd position.
4. We don't know who's at the end yet, but we have to fit:
   - English (Red),
   - Ukrainian (Biathlon, no color or pet yet directly linked),
   - Japanese (Parliaments, no direct pet or color info),
   - Spanish with Dog,
   - The rest of pets and colors.

To find Zebra's position without a clear link from the clues, we must look at the remaining options:

- If Norwegian is on the far left and next to Blue, one option could be:
  - Norwegian (Blue), then ? for weightlifting doesn't fit here as it's not in the middle.
  
Given the constraints, we have to consider positions based on elimination. Without direct information linking Zebra or its owner to a specific sport, color, or being directly next to someone, and considering the middle is taken by Weightlifting, let's look at potential gaps:

- If we assume Norwegian (Blue) starts, followed by an unknown, then Weightlifting in the middle, the rest must fit around them. Given we can't place Zebra directly from clues, it seems like a logical step to consider placement based on remaining options.

However, there isn't enough information provided or inferred through elimination to accurately determine the position of **Zebra** without making assumptions beyond what's given in the clues. My previous approach attempted to logically deduce the placement but hit a roadblock due to the complexity and indirect nature of some clues regarding Zebra's placement.

To directly answer your question with an admission: based on the information provided, I cannot accurately determine the position of **Zebra** without making speculative leaps that aren't justified by the given clues. Thus, I must refrain from providing a specific number for Zebra's position."	zebra:5	NA	False	False
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"I will solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 9, we know that the person whose birthday is in April is on the far left.
From clue 14, this person is to the left or right of the person who likes blue, but since they are already on the far left, the person who likes blue must be second from the left.

Using clue 1 and 5, we can conclude that the person whose birthday is in October (who likes red) cannot be next to the person who likes green (since green's neighbor likes ivory), so they must be fourth or fifth. Since green is to the right of ivory (clue 5), green must be at least third.

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking milk is in the middle (third).

The only remaining position for the person who likes green (and drinks coffee) is the fourth position (since red is already in either the fourth or fifth position). This also means that ivory is on their left (third), which matches with the person drinking milk.

We can now construct a partial solution:

April: ??? (left)
?: blue
Milk/ivory: ???
Coffee/green: ???
?: red

From clue 13, we know that the parliaments-smoker's birthday is in March. Since green's neighbor likes ivory, and there are no other positions available for a person whose favorite color hasn't been mentioned yet, this person must like yellow (clue 7). This also means that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse.

The only remaining position for the parliaments-smoker (March) is fifth. 

We can now add some more information:

April: ??? (left)
?: blue
Milk/ivory: ???
Coffee/green: ???
March: yellow

From clue 11, we know that the kools-smoker is to the left or right of the owner of the horse. Since March already has a favorite color assigned (yellow), this means that May cannot be in either of these positions (since May's birthday belongs to the dog owner). The only available position for the horse owner is fourth, which means that the kools-smoker must be third.

We can now update our solution:

April: ??? (left)
?: blue
Kool/yellow: milk/ivory
Coffee/green: horse
March: yellow

From clue 3 and 5, we know that green is to the right of ivory. Since coffee is already assigned to green's favorite color, this means that milk must be the beverage belonging to the person who likes ivory.

April: ??? (left)
?: blue
Kool/yellow: milk/ivory
Coffee/green: horse
March: ???

From clue 10, we know that the chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the owner of the fox. This means that either May (the dog owner) or April must be a neighbor to the fox owner.

Since October's birthday belongs to the person who likes red (clue 1), and their position hasn't been assigned yet, this means that they cannot be in a neighboring position with the chesterfields-smoker. Therefore, the chesterfields-smoker must be on the left side of the sequence, making it impossible for them to be next to the fox owner.

The only remaining option is that May (the dog owner) is on the right side of the chesterfields-smoker, which means April's neighbor is the fox owner. 

Since January's birthday belongs to a tea drinker (clue 4), this means they must be in either of the two unassigned positions. We can now complete our solution:

April: fox/Chesterfield
January: blue/tea
May: dog/Kool/yellow/milk 
October: horse/Coffee/green
March: zebra/Lucky-strike/orange-juice 

Now that we have all other beverages assigned to specific positions, the only remaining beverage (water) must be in a position not yet taken. This means water belongs to either January or April.

But since April's birthday is on the far left and they like neither tea nor coffee (which are assigned to other months), it cannot belong to them.

Water: 2"	water:1	water:2	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_1	"Let's start analyzing the clues:

From clue 9, we know that April is on the far left.

From clue 1 and 14, we can infer that October (red) is not on the far left or right, and Red is to the right of Blue. Also, from clue 5, Green is to the right of Ivory.

Using clues 8 and 9, Milk is in the middle, and April is on the far left.

From clue 10, Chesterfields-smoker is next to the owner of the fox. From clue 11, Kools-smoker (yellow) is next to the owner of the horse.

Combining these clues, we can start forming a possible arrangement:

April: ?, ?, ?, ?, ?

Since January (tea) and March (parliaments) are not on the far left, they must be in the middle or right. October (red) is not on the far left, so it's likely to be second from the left.

May (dog) can't be next to April (clue 9), so May is likely third from the left.

Using clue 3, Coffee (green) is to the right of Ivory. So, we have:

April: ?, Red (October), ?, ?, ?

From clue 4, January (tea) is not on the far left or right. This means January must be second from the right.

March (parliaments) can't be next to April (clue 9). Since May is third from the left, March must be fourth from the left.

So, we have:

April: ?, Red (October), Dog (May), Parliaments (March), ?

Now, let's look at the drinks and colors. From clue 2, May (dog) can't like green (coffee). Since January is second from the right, it must be drinking tea (clue 4).

From clue 12, Orange-juice is lucky-strike-smoker.

Using clues 5 and 6, Green is to the right of Ivory. Old-gold-smoker likes snails and is likely on one end. Since Chesterfields-smoker is next to fox (clue 10), it's unlikely to be on the far left or right.

Now we can try filling in some gaps:

April: ?, Red (October, blue?), Dog (May, yellow?), Parliaments (March, ?), ?

From clue 7, Kools-smoker likes Yellow. So May must like yellow.

Using clues 10 and 11, Chesterfields-smoker is next to fox, and Kools-smoker is next to horse. Since Kools-smoker likes yellow, it's likely that Chesterfields-smoker likes blue.

April: ?, Red (October), Dog (May, Yellow), Parliaments (March, ?), ?

From clue 5, Green is to the right of Ivory. So we can fill in some gaps:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails), Red (October), Dog (May, Yellow), Parliaments (March, Blue?), ?

Now, let's look at the remaining pets and colors. From clue 1, October likes red.

From clue 5, Green is to the right of Ivory. So we can place green next to ivory:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails), Red (October), Dog (May, Yellow), ?, ?

The only pet left for March is zebra or horse. But Kools-smoker likes yellow and is next to horse (clue 11). Since May likes yellow, it's unlikely that March also has a horse.

So, we can conclude:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails), Red (October, coffee, green?), Dog (May, Yellow), Parliaments (March, blue, zebra?), ?

Now let's fill in some remaining gaps. From clue 3, Coffee likes green. So October must like green.

From clue 12, Orange-juice is lucky-strike-smoker. This means January can't be drinking orange-juice. Since January drinks tea and is second from the right, we have:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails), Red (October, coffee, green?), Dog (May, Yellow), Parliaments (March, blue, zebra?), ?

January must drink tea and can't like red or yellow. This means January likes either ivory or horse.

From clue 11, Kools-smoker is next to the owner of the horse. Since May drinks milk (not orange-juice) and January doesn't have a dog, we conclude that January has a horse and drinks tea:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails), Red (October, coffee, green?), Dog (May, Yellow), Parliaments (March, blue, zebra?), Horse (January, tea)

The only pet left is fox. Since Chesterfields-smoker is next to the owner of the fox, we can conclude:

April: Old-gold (Ivory, snails, water), Red (October, coffee, green?), Dog (May, Yellow, milk), Parliaments (March, blue, zebra?), Horse (January, tea, Chesterfields)

So the answer is:
**Zebra:**3"	zebra:5	zebra:3	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the Norwegian and the color they like.
The Norwegian is on the far left (from clue 9). Since the English is the person who likes red, and there's no direct information linking the Norwegian to a specific color yet, we'll come back to this later.

## Step 2: Place the Ukrainian based on their drink preference.
The Ukrainian drinks tea (clue 4), but there's no immediate positioning from this clue alone.

## Step 3: Establish the position of the person who likes green and their relationship with ivory.
The person drinking coffee is the person who likes green, and they are to the right of the person who likes ivory (from clues 3 and 5). This gives us a relative positioning but not absolute positions yet.

## Step 4: Position the English based on color preference.
The English is the person who likes red (clue 1), but we don't have an immediate position for them in relation to others except they can't be Norwegian.

## Step 5: Identify the Spanish's movie genre preference.
The Spanish watches romance movies (clue 2). This doesn't immediately give us a position, but it fills out one of the preferences.

## Step 6: Determine the Old-Gold smoker's movie genre preference.
The Old-Gold smoker watches spy movies (clue 6). Like the Spanish, this clue gives us a preference without an immediate position.

## Step 7: Place the Kools smoker based on their color and relative positioning to horror movies.
The Kools smoker likes yellow (clue 7) and is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies (clue 11). This still leaves flexibility but starts building connections.

## Step 8: Position the Chesterfields smoker in relation to animation movies.
The Chesterfields smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation movies (clue 10). Another clue that helps with relative positioning rather than absolute placement.

## Step 9: Identify the drinker of milk and their position.
The person drinking milk is in the middle (clue 8). This gives us a central point but doesn't specify nationality, color preference, or any other details.

## Step 10: Analyze clues for direct connections to water.
Upon reviewing all clues given, there's no direct information about who drinks water. Therefore, we'll need to deduce based on elimination and relative positioning from the clues provided.

## Step 11: Eliminate beverages already assigned.
- Coffee is linked with green (clue 3).
- Tea is linked with Ukrainian (clue 4).
- Milk's position is known but not its drinker's nationality or other preferences (clue 8).
- Orange juice is linked with the Lucky Strike smoker (clue 12).

## Step 12: Combine clues for positioning.
Given the clues, we can start building a table or chart to organize the information. However, without direct clues linking specific nationalities, colors, or movie genres to water, we must look at the process of elimination and known positions.

The final answer is: $\boxed{water:3}$"	water:1	water:3	False	True
Zebra_1domain_replacements_2	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the Norwegian and the color they like.
From clue 9, we know the Norwegian is on the far left. We also need to find out which color they like. Since the English likes red (clue 1) and is not necessarily on the left, and there's no direct information linking the Norwegian to a specific color yet, we'll come back to this later.

## Step 2: Place the person who drinks milk.
From clue 8, the person drinking milk is in the middle. This means the order so far is _ _ Milk _ _, with the Norwegian on the far left (from step 1).

## Step 3: Find out where the person who likes green and the one who likes ivory are positioned.
Clue 5 states that the person who likes green is to the right of the person who likes ivory. However, we don't know their exact positions relative to the middle yet.

## Step 4: Identify the position of the English.
From clue 1, the English likes red, but without a direct clue about their position, we'll need to infer this later.

## Step 5: Place the Ukrainian and their beverage preference.
Clue 4 tells us the Ukrainian drinks tea. However, without knowing their exact position relative to others (except that they're not necessarily on the left or right end due to other clues), we can't place them precisely yet.

## Step 6: Identify the person who likes yellow and their position relative to horror movies.
From clue 7, the Kools-smoker likes yellow. Clue 11 states this person is to the left or right of the person watching horror movies, but we don't know exactly where they are in relation to others yet.

## Step 7: Place the Spanish and their movie preference.
Clue 2 says the Spanish watches romance movies. This information doesn't directly inform their position relative to the other clues about positions (left, right, or middle) yet.

## Step 8: Find out where the person who drinks coffee is positioned.
From clue 3, the person drinking coffee likes green. Since we know from step 2 that the milk drinker is in the middle and from step 3 that green is to the right of ivory, but without a direct link to the positions determined so far, this needs further integration with other clues.

## Step 9: Determine the position of the person watching animation movies.
Clue 10 mentions the Chesterfields-smoker is on the left or right of the person watching animation. Without knowing the exact placement of the Chesterfields-smoker yet, we can't place the animation fan precisely.

## Step 10: Place the Japanese and their cigar brand preference.
From clue 13, the Japanese smokes Parliaments, but without a direct clue about their position or how this relates to the other preferences, we'll integrate this later.

## Step 11: Use the Old-Gold smoker's information to find out where spy movies are watched.
Clue 6 states the Old-Gold-smoker watches spy movies. This is crucial for integrating with other movie genres and cigar brands to determine positions.

## Step 12: Piece together all clues about positions, colors, beverages, cigars, and movies to find a coherent arrangement.
Given the complexity and interdependence of the clues, solving this puzzle requires careful integration of all steps, focusing on fixed points like the Norwegian's leftmost position, the milk drinker in the middle, and then filling in the gaps with information from other clues.

## Step 13: Determine the placement of mystery movies within the integrated solution.
After placing all other elements according to their clues, the remaining slot(s) will indicate where the person watching mystery movies is positioned. Since we're looking for **mystery:Num**, this final step identifies the specific position of mystery within the arrangement.

The final answer is: $\boxed{3}$"	mystery:5	mystery:3	False	True
