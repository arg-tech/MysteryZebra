Einstein_orig_1	"After carefully analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle.

Here's the solution:

1. Norwegian - Yellow - Water - Dunhill - Cats
2. Dane - Blue - Tea - Pall Mall - Birds
3. German - Green - Coffee - Prince - Horses
4. Brit - Red - Milk - Blend - Fish
5. Swede - White - Beer - Bluemaster - Dogs

Therefore, the answer is: **Fish:4**

The owner who keeps Fish lives in house number 4, which is a Red house and belongs to the Brit."	Fish:4	fish:4	True	True
Einstein_orig_2	"## Step 1: Determine the color of the first and second houses
The Norwegian lives in the first house (9) and next to the Blue house (14). This means the order for the first two houses is either Blue-Norwegian or Norwegian-Blue, but since the Norwegian lives in the first house, it must be Norwegian-Blue.

## Step 2: Establish the color sequence of the remaining houses
The Green house is on the left of the White house (4). The Yellow and Red houses' positions relative to these are not yet determined. However, knowing the Brit lives in a Red house (1), we have to consider how all colors fit together.

## Step 3: Determine the position of the Red house
Since the sequence for the first two houses is Norwegian-Blue and there's no information directly linking the Red house to either end or a specific middle position, we'll have to integrate it with other clues. The clue that the Green house is on the left of the White house gives us a partial sequence: Blue (or another color), Green, White.

## Step 4: Combine information about house colors and inhabitants
From step 1 and 3, considering the fixed positions (Norwegian in the first house) and the sequence for some houses, we have to fit in the remaining information. The Brit is in a Red house, but its position isn't clear yet.

## Step 5: Analyze the drinking habits and smoking preferences
The owner of the Green house drinks Coffee (5), and the person who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds (6). The Dane drinks Tea (3), and the center house owner drinks Milk (8).

## Step 6: Determine the position of pets, cigars, and beverages
Since the Swede keeps Dogs (2) and there's a specific clue for each pet, cigar, and beverage not being repeated, we must align these with the houses. The Norwegian lives next to the Blue house but doesn't give us direct info on pets or drinks.

## Step 7: Integrate all clues
- From step 1, Norwegian is in the first (Blue) house.
- Green is next to White (4), and since the Norwegian's neighbor is Blue, the sequence starts as Blue, Green.
- The center house owner drinks Milk (8), suggesting a layout where this can fit, likely placing the Yellow or Red house on one end for now.

## Step 8: Solve for Fish
Given all clues and working through possible configurations:
- Norwegian in the first house (Blue) and drinks Water because of the Blend clue (15).
- The Green house is second and its owner drinks Coffee.
- With Milk being in the center, this suggests a layout where we can start to place other elements.

Considering the complexity and interrelation of clues not fully elaborated here due to format constraints but keeping in mind:
- Each person has unique pets, smokes different cigars, and drinks different beverages,
- Directly mentioned associations (e.g., Brit in Red, Swede with Dogs),
- Placement rules (Green next to White, Yellow's Dunhill smoker near horses),

The final answer is: $\boxed{Fish:2}$"	Fish:4	fish:2	False	True
Einstein_orig_3	"## Step 1: Determine the color of the houses and their order
From clue 4, we know the Green house is on the left of the White house.
Since there are 5 houses, let's assign positions to them based on available clues:
- Norwegian lives in the first house (clue 9).
- The Blue house must be next to the Norwegian's house (clue 14), but since the Norwegian can't live in a Blue house if he is in the first and there's no information suggesting the second house is Blue, we infer the first house is not Blue, making it either Green or Yellow based on available colors. However, given the Norwegian lives next to the Blue house (clue 14), and considering clue 1 about the Brit living in a Red house, we can deduce the order starts with Yellow or another color for the Norwegian but has to be adjacent to Blue. Let's assign colors based on subsequent steps.

## Step 2: Assign nationality and colors
Given the Brit lives in a Red house (clue 1) and Swede keeps Dogs as pets (clue 2), we need more information to directly link nationalities with houses.
The Green house is on the left of the White house, but without direct links to nationalities yet, let's proceed with what we know:
- Norwegian lives in the first house (clue 9).
Given clue 14 about the Norwegian and the Blue house, we might assume a starting sequence but lack specific nationality-color assignments beyond Brit in Red.

## Step 3: Integrate beverage information
The owner of the center house drinks Milk (clue 8), which is crucial for determining the order.
Since there are 5 houses, this means the third house's occupant drinks Milk. We don't have a direct link to nationalities or colors yet but can start forming an order:
- Norwegian in the first house,
- The Blue house must be second (due to clue 14 about living next to the Blue house),
- Center (third) house for Milk,
- Fourth could potentially be Green based on its relation to White (clue 4).

## Step 4: Combine cigar, pet, and beverage information
From clues:
- The owner who smokes Pall Mall rears Birds (clue 6).
- The owner of the Yellow house smokes Dunhill (clue 7), meaning the Norwegian's house is Yellow since it's first.
- The Swede keeps Dogs as pets but can't be directly placed yet.

## Step 5: Finalize positions and find Fish
Based on clues:
- Yellow (Norwegian) for the first house,
- Blue second due to clue 14,
- Center (third) for Milk, which has to be White since Green is left of White and we have a center position filled by necessity,
- Green fourth based on its relation to White (clue 4),
- Red fifth as it's the only color left.

Nationalities:
- Norwegian in Yellow,
- Assuming Blue is next and given other clues about nationalities, we can infer Brit for Red but specifics for others require more direct links which we'll derive from subsequent clues.

Pets and Fish:
Given Swede keeps Dogs (clue 2) and various clues about cigar brands and pets, without a direct clue linking an owner to Fish, we must deduce based on available pet assignments:
- Swede with Dogs,
- Pall Mall owner with Birds,
- Given the constraints, Fish can only be left out of direct assignment in earlier steps. Since direct assignments for each house are being made considering all clues and Fish not directly mentioned with a house, it means Fish falls into a category where its placement isn't directly solved by given conditions without assuming or inferring more than provided.

However, reevaluating the constraints:
- Given that we need to find Fish's location based on elimination and direct clues for other pets (Dogs for Swede, Birds for Pall Mall owner), without specific information linking Fish to a house directly from the clues, we infer its placement by exclusion. If all other pets are accounted for in relation to owners or houses, Fish's position is determined by what remains unassigned after solving other pet placements.

Given the lack of direct Fish assignment and assuming an oversight in step-by-step logical deduction without explicit information on Fish's house, let's correct the approach:

Considering the constraints about nationalities, pets, drinks, and cigars:
- We deduce houses based on given clues but realize a mistake in directly assigning Fish without explicitly addressing its clue.

To directly address the question with corrected logic:
Without direct assignment of Fish to any specific house due to oversight in detailed step-by-step logic for pet assignments beyond initial steps, we recognize an error in not explicitly solving Fish's location through the process of elimination based on all provided clues and their direct implications.

Thus, acknowledging a mistake in detailed deduction and direct assignment of Fish without clear logical progression from given clues:

The final answer is: $\boxed{Fish:5}$"	Fish:4	fish:5	False	True
