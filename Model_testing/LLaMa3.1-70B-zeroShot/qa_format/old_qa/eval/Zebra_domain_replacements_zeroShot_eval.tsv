From clue 9, we know that the fan of electronic is on the far left.
From clue 14, we know that the fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce.
So, the person eating lettuce must be either in position 2 or not present (since there's no one to the left of the far-left house).

From clue 13, we know that the fan of trance is the futuristic house.
This doesn't give us much information yet.

From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person eating onion.
We don't have any more information about this person's position yet.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of pop is the person who grows azalea.
Again, no positional information yet.

From clue 3, we know that the person playing go is the person eating zucchini.
And from clue 5, we know that the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot.
So, we have a partial order: ... Carrot -> Zucchini (go) ...

From clue 6, we know that the colonial house is the person who grows bellflower.
No positional information yet.

From clue 7, we know that the victorian house is the person eating radish.
And from clue 11, we know that the victorian house is to the left or right of the person who grows orchid.
We also know that the victorian house can't be on the far left (since the fan of electronic is there).

From clue 8, we know that the person playing monopoly is in the middle.
Since there are 5 houses, this means that the person playing monopoly must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know that the gothic-revival house is on the left or right of the person who grows marigold.
We don't have any more information about their positions yet.

From clue 12, we know that the townhouse house is the person playing mah-jongg.
No positional information yet.

Now, let's try to piece together some possible orders:

* We know the fan of electronic (far left) is eating either lettuce or not present. Let's assume they're eating lettuce for now: Electronic (Lettuce)
* The fan of indie is eating onion, but we don't have any positional information yet.
* The person playing go (zucchini) is to the right of the person eating carrot. We can add this to our order: ... Carrot -> Zucchini (go) ...
* Since the person playing monopoly is in position 3, we can add them to our order as well: Electronic (Lettuce) | ? | Monopoly | ? | ?
* The victorian house is eating radish and must be next to the person growing orchid. We also know they're not on the far left.
* The gothic-revival house is next to the person growing marigold.

Now, let's try to combine these orders:
Electronic (Lettuce) | Carrot -> Zucchini (go) | Monopoly | ? | ?

The only remaining positions are for the victorian and gothic-revival houses. We know they're not on the far left or right. The only possible order is:

Electronic (Lettuce) | Victorian (Radish, Orchid) | Monopoly | Gothic-Revival (Marigold) | Futuristic (Trance)

We still need to add the indie fan eating onion and the person growing azalea.

The person playing domino (techno) must be next to the person eating carrot or zucchini. Since the person eating carrot is already occupied by the victorian house, we'll place them next to the zucchini:
Electronic (Lettuce) | Victorian (Radish, Orchid) | Monopoly (Mah-jongg) | Gothic-Revival (Marigold) | Futuristic (Trance)
... Carrot -> Zucchini (go) Domino ...

Now, let's add the indie fan eating onion. The only remaining position is next to the carrot:
Electronic (Lettuce) | Indie (Onion, Colonial Bellflower) | Victorian (Radish, Orchid) | Monopoly (Mah-jongg) | Gothic-Revival (Marigold)
... Carrot -> Zucchini (go) Domino ...

We're almost done! The only remaining house is the townhouse playing mah-jongg. Since they can't occupy the middle position, we'll swap them with the person growing marigold:
Electronic (Lettuce) | Indie (Onion, Colonial Bellflower) | Victorian (Radish, Orchid) | Monopoly (Gothic-Revival Marigold) | Townhouse Mah-jongg
... Carrot -> Zucchini (go) Domino ...

The final order is:

1. Electronic (Lettuce) - Azalea Pop
2. Indie (Onion) - Bellflower Colonial
3. Victorian (Radish, Orchid)
4. Gothic-Revival (Marigold) - Monopoly
5. Townhouse Mah-jongg - Trance Futuristic

As for the position of chess:
Chess is not explicitly mentioned in any of the clues. However, based on the information provided, we can deduce that chess must be played by the person eating carrot.

So, **chess: 3**"	chess:1	chess:3	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_0	"Let's start by analyzing the given clues and making deductions:

From clue 9, we know that the fan of electronic is on the far left.

Clue 14 states that the fan of electronic is to the left or right of the person eating lettuce, so the person eating lettuce must be either second from the left (if the fan of electronic is on the very left) or on the far left (if the fan of electronic is second from the left). 

Since we already know the fan of electronic is on the far left, the person eating lettuce must be second from the left.

We also know that the person playing monopoly is in the middle (clue 8), and there are 5 houses/people. So, the order is:

Fan of Electronic | Person eating Lettuce | Person playing Monopoly | ?? | ??

From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie eats onion. Since onion hasn't been placed yet, it can be either on the far right or fourth from the left.

Clue 5 states that the person eating zucchini is to the right of the person eating carrot, so their order must be: Carrot | Zucchini

From clue 3, we know that the person playing go eats zucchini. Clues 6 and 12 also give us some fixed positions:

Colonial (bellflower) 
Victorian (radish)
Townhouse (mah-jongg)

Considering all these constraints, let's try to construct a possible order:

Fan of Electronic | Person eating Lettuce | Person playing Monopoly | ?? | Fan of Indie

If we assume that the person eating lettuce is second from the left and that they play either domino or chess, then the fan of electronic (far left) can't be playing either of these games.

Clue 4 tells us that the fan of techno plays domino. If the fan of electronic is on the far left and the fan of techno isn't next to them, we can place the person eating carrot in the middle, so it doesn't conflict with clue 5:

Fan of Electronic | Person eating Lettuce (Mah-Jongg or Chess) | Person eating Carrot | ?? | Fan of Indie

We now have some fixed positions:

Colonial (bellflower)
Victorian (radish)

If we place victorian on the far right, then from clue 11, orchid can be either next to it or second from the left. But since dahlia's position is still unknown and needs to be determined relative to these positions, let's consider both possibilities.

Case 1: If orchid were on the far right with victorian:

 Fan of Electronic | Orchid (far left) doesn't work since it conflicts with clue 14

Case 2: If orchid were second from the left:

 Fan of Electronic | Person eating Lettuce | Person eating Carrot (or monopoly, but carrot makes more sense considering clue 5)

Given this structure and looking at other clues:
- The gothic-revival house must be next to marigold
- Dahlia has no restrictions yet

If we try placing the remaining flowers:

1. Azalea - pop fan
2. Marigold - gothic-revival (left or right)
3. Bellflower - colonial
4. Orchid - victorian's neighbor
5. Dahlia - unknown

We can now place Dahlia in a position that doesn't conflict with other clues.

Looking at the houses and flowers, we have some fixed positions:

- Colonial is bellflower.
- Victorian is radish (clue 7) 
- Townhouse is mah-jongg (clue 12)
- The remaining house is futuristic, which belongs to trance fan.

The gothic-revival must be next to marigold and considering it can't be the far left or right:

 Fan of Electronic | Orchid | Monopoly | Marigold | Fan of Indie

Considering the people eating zucchini (go) and carrot, they should be in order. From clue 5:

 Carrot | Zucchini | Go (Zucchini)

Given this setup and that we've considered gothic-revival's possible placement next to marigold, let's position it with marigold.

Since the fan of indie eats onion, placing zucchini-go in between doesn't conflict. Dahlia remains without a fixed house or music-genre yet but is limited by available slots:

1. Electronic (Fan on far left)
2. ???
3. Monopoly 
4. Marigold (Gothic-revival) | Zucchini (go) | Carrot
5. Indie

Considering the person eating lettuce and available spaces, the possible remaining flowers and houses can be arranged without conflicts.

For dahlia's position: Since we have gothic-revival next to marigold and given that dahlia has no other restrictions:

 Dahlia must be second from the left (if we follow the order so far constructed)

So **dahlia:2**"	dahlia:5	dahlia:2	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing and solving the logic puzzle, I found the following solution:


| City        | Music       | Hobby      | Job           | Sport     |
|-------------|-------------|------------|---------------|-----------|
| Berlin      | Soul        | Sudoku     | Software-Dev  | Baseball  |
| Prague      | Gospel      | Skydiving  | Chef          | -         |
| Edinburgh   | Blues       | Cooking    | Musician      | Badminton |
| Hannover    | Ambient     | Filmmaking | Dressmaker    | Cricket   |
| Rome        | D&B         | Photography| Bartender     | Ice-Hockey|

Since the question asks for the position of **musician**, I'll format the answer as follows:


musician:3"	musician:1	musician:3	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_1	"After analyzing the clues, I'll provide the solution:

1. The fan of gospel is the person traveling to Prague.
2. The fan of d&b is the person whose sport is ice-hockey.
3. The chef is the person traveling to Hannover.
4. The fan of ambient is the bartender.
5. The person traveling to Hannover is to the right of the person traveling to Edinburgh.
6. The person whose hobby is sudoku is the person whose sport is baseball.
7. The person whose hobby is photography is the person traveling to Rome.
8. The dressmaker is in the middle.
9. The fan of soul is on the far left.
10. The person whose hobby is filmmaking is on the left or right of the person whose sport is badminton.
11. The person whose hobby is photography is to the left or right of the person whose sport is cricket.
12. The person whose hobby is skydiving is the software-developer.
13. The fan of blues is the person whose hobby is cooking.
14. The fan of soul is to the left or right of the person traveling to Berlin.

From these clues, we can deduce:

* Soul is on the far left (9) and has a connection with Berlin (14), so it's likely that Soul is paired with Berlin.
* Photography is paired with Rome (7).
* The chef is going to Hannover (3), which means they are not in the middle. Given the constraints, the person traveling to Edinburgh must be on the left of the dressmaker (8). Since the soul fan is already placed on the far left, it's likely that Soul-Berlin and Photography-Rome are adjacent.
* The ambient fan is a bartender (4), but we don't have more information about their location. However, since the person going to Hannover is a chef, it's possible that the bartender-ambient fan might be on the opposite side of the list.

Using these connections, let's create an initial ordering:

Soul-Berlin - ? - Dressmaker - ? - Chef-Hannover

Now we can add more information:

* D&b is paired with ice-hockey (2). Since it doesn't have a direct connection to any city or hobby yet, we'll set it aside for now.
* Gospel is paired with Prague (1), which must be placed on the opposite side of Hannover due to clue 5.

Considering this information and adding more clues:

* Skydiving-software developer (12) can't be in the middle (dressmaker). It's likely on one end, perhaps near Soul-Berlin or Chef-Hannover.
* Blues-cooking (13) must be placed. Cooking doesn't have a strong connection to any location yet.
* Sudoku-baseball (6) and filmmaking-badminton (10) can be used to complete the hobbies.

Combining all this information, here's one possible arrangement:

1. Soul-Berlin - Skydiving-software developer
2. Blues-cooking - Filmmaking-badminton 
3. Dressmaker - Sudoku-baseball 
4. Gospel-Prague - Photography-Rome 
5. Ambient (Bartender) - D&b (ice-hockey) - Chef-Hannover

This solution provides a possible ordering:

1. Soul-Berlin - Skydiving-software developer
2. Blues-cooking - Filmmaking-badminton 
3. Dressmaker - Sudoku-baseball 
4. Gospel-Prague - Photography-Rome 
5. Ambient (Bartender) - D&b (ice-hockey) - Chef-Hannover

Given this ordering and focusing on surfing:

* Surfing is paired with Edinburgh, which was previously mentioned in clue 5.

So the answer is: **surfing:2**

(Note that there are some assumptions made during the process due to incomplete information, but based on these deductions, we get the above result)"	surfing:5	surfing:2	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"## Step 1: Determine the position of the Police-Officer and the person traveling to Liverpool
From clue 14, we know that the police-officer is to the left or right of the person traveling to liverpool. Since the police-officer is on the far left (clue 9), the person traveling to liverpool must be second from the left.

## Step 2: Determine the position of the Manager
From clue 1, we know that the manager is the person traveling to venice.

## Step 3: Determine the positions of the Journalist and the person whose hobby is writing
From clue 2, we know that the journalist is the person whose hobby is writing. However, their exact position is not yet known.

## Step 4: Determine the position of the fan of rock and the person traveling to hamburg
From clue 3, we know that the fan of rock is the person traveling to hamburg. From clue 5, we also know that this person is to the right of the person traveling to colone.

## Step 5: Determine the positions of the Analyst and the fan of salsa
From clue 4, we know that the analyst is the fan of salsa. However, their exact position is not yet known.

## Step 6: Determine the position of the Modern house and the person whose hobby is collecting
From clue 6, we know that the modern house belongs to the person whose hobby is collecting. However, their exact position is not yet known.

## Step 7: Determine the positions of the Palace house and the person traveling to new-york
From clue 7, we know that the palace house belongs to the person traveling to new-york. From clue 11, we also know that this person is to the left or right of the person whose hobby is chess.

## Step 8: Determine the position of the fan of funk
From clue 8, we know that the fan of funk is in the middle (third from the left).

## Step 9: Analyze all the information gathered so far and try to find a pattern or possible arrangement.
Given:
- Police-officer on the far left.
- Person traveling to liverpool second from the left.
- Manager travels to venice but exact position unknown.
- Fan of rock (hamburg) is to the right of colone's traveler.
- Palace house (new-york) has specific placement relation to chess hobbyist.

## Step 10: Attempt a more detailed analysis with remaining clues
Given:
- The wooden house clue related to drawing and its positioning near either side.
- Colonial house being dubstep fan but exact position unknown.
- Engineer lives in gothic-revival house, also with unknown position.
Considering the clues about positions relative to each other (e.g., hamburg's traveler is to the right of colone), we need to place these individuals and their preferences/music genres/houses/hobbies accordingly.

## Step 11: Combine all known positions to form a solution
Given:
- Police-officer is on the far left.
- The person traveling to liverpool must be second from the left because they are next to the police-officer (clue 14).
- Since manager travels to venice, and given that we don't have enough information yet to place them directly, let's keep this in mind for later steps.
- Fan of rock is third from the left or further right but must be after colone based on clue 5.

## Step 12: Finalize positions with specific clues
We still need to determine where pop fits. Considering all other genres have been assigned or have some form of restriction, and knowing that each person has a unique combination of job, travel destination, house type, music genre, and hobby, we should look for the slot that doesn't conflict with any given information.

## Step 13: Directly solving for pop's position
Considering all other genres and positions are somewhat restricted or assigned, let's directly place pop. Given the complexity of direct clues leading to a straightforward answer isn't feasible without combining multiple steps' logic into a singular deduction based on elimination and placement rules provided.

The final answer is: $\boxed{pop:5}$"	pop:1	pop:5	False	True
Zebra_5domain_replacements_2	"After analyzing the given clues, I have found a solution for the logic puzzle.

The final arrangement is as follows:

1. Police-officer (colonial house, dubstep, puzzles) - traveling to Liverpool
2. Engineer (gothic-revival house, funk, drawing) 
3. Analyst (wooden house, salsa, collecting)
4. Journalist (modern house, rock, writing) - traveling to Hamburg
5. Manager (palace house, pop, chess) - traveling to New-York and also to Venice

From the given solution we can see that **puzzles:1**"	puzzles:5	puzzles:1	False	True
