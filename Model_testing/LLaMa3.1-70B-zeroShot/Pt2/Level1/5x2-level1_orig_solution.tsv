Lv1-5x2-1	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


##################
|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |  Cola     | Lemonade |
| Job         | Freelancer| Paramedic|
| Pet         | Rat       | Mouse    |
| Sport       | Baseball  | Skiing   |
| Transport   | Jet-ski   | Train    |
##################


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 4, we know the freelancer drinks cola, so that goes in column 1.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking cola is on the left of the person driving the train. Since the freelancer drinks cola, they must be driving a jet-ski (because if they drove a train, there would be no one to their right).

Clue 3 tells us the paramedic owns a mouse. We don't know yet which column they're in, but we can fill in the pet for now.

From clue 1, we know the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the freelancer is already in column 1, and they drink cola, the paramedic (who drinks lemonade) must be in column 2.

Now that we have the paramedic in column 2, we can fill in their job and pet.

Finally, we know the freelancer doesn't like skiing (because they're not on the right of the person who likes skiing), so they must like baseball. And since the paramedic is already associated with skiing, we can fill that in too.


Let me know if this solution looks correct to you!"
Lv1-5x2-2	"Based on the clues, I'll solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the person driving the roller is on the far right:

| Transport   |           |       Roller  |

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the ferret is drinking sprite:

| Beverage    | Soy-milk  |      Sprite   |

| Sport       |           | Skateboarding|
| Transport   |           |       Roller  |

From clue 3, we know that the owner of the ferret is also the person who's sport is skateboarding:

| Sport       | Lacrosse  | Skateboarding|
| Transport   |           |       Roller  |

| Sport       | Lacrosse  | Skateboarding|
| Transport   |           |       Roller  |

Now we can fill in the remaining job as librarian:

Clue 3: The fan of electronic is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.
Since the person eating grapes is on the far left, and the fan of electronic is also on the left, we can conclude that the fan of electronic must be the same person.

#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 3, we know the Italian is drinking mirinda, so column 1 is filled in for Beverage and Nationality.

From clue 4, we know the Italian (column 1) is to the left of the scientist, so column 2's Job is scientist.

From clue 1, we know the coach is a fan of country music. Since the coach can't be on the right (scientist), the coach must be in column 1.

Clue 2 tells us the Italian (column 1) is to the left of the person who likes swimming. This means the person in column 2 must like swimming, and the person in column 1 must like cycling.

Finally, we know from clue 1 that the coach likes country music, so folk music must be in column 2.

| Sport         | volleyball  | soccer     |

 

Here's how the puzzle was solved:

From statement 4, we know that the fan of reggae is on the far left. So, music-genre for person 1 is reggae.

From statement 2, we know that the person drinking cola is on the far right. So, beverage for person 2 is cola.

From statement 1, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the fan of reggae is already assigned to person 1, this means that person 1 must have the hobby of skydiving and the sport of volleyball.

Statement 3 tells us that the person whose sport is volleyball (person 1) is on the left of the person watching western movies. This means that person 2 watches western movies.

The only remaining movie-genre is comedy, which must be assigned to person 1.

Similarly, the only remaining hobby and sport can be assigned as card-games for person 2 and soccer for person 2.

Finally, the only remaining beverage is 7up, which must be assigned to person 1.

* Clue 2: The person eating pepper is on the far right. This confirms that Pepper is in column 2.
* Clue 3: The owner of the lizard is on the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since Lizard can't be in column 2 (because Pepper is there), it must be in column 1, and Rugby must be in column 2.
