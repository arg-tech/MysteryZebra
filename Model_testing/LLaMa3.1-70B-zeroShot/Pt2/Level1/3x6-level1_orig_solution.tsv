Lv1-3x6-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############

| Hobby         | Board-Games  | Baking     | Cooking    | Hiking     | Photography | Puzzles |
| Music-Genre   | Country      | Trance     | Punk       | Metal      | Gospel      | Folk     |
| Nationality   | Pakistani    | Malaysian  | German     | Chinese    | Polish      | American |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 4, we know the Pakistani is on the far left. Clue 12 tells us that the person who's hobby is board-games is also on the far left.

Clue 1 states that the person who's hobby is hiking (Chinese) is to the right of the Malaysian. Since the Malaysian can't be on the far left, they must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 6, we know the Chinese is a hiker. Clue 11 tells us that the hiker is to the left of the fan of gospel (who's on the far right). Therefore, the Chinese (hiker) can't be in column 1 or 2, so they must be in column 4.

Clue 5 says the person who's hobby is baking is to the left of the American. Since the American is not on the far left, and we've already placed the Pakistani and Malaysian, the baker must be in column 3.

From clue 3, we know the Polish fan is a metalhead. Clues 10 and 7 tell us that the fan of punk is to the right of photography, and the American is a folk fan, respectively. This means the Polish metalhead can't be in column 1 or 2 (since they're not on the far left), so they must be in column 5.

The remaining columns are filled with the German as a cook (clue 2) and the puzzles person in column 6 (since we've already placed everyone else).

Clues 8 and 9 help us determine the music-genre order, placing the fan of trance to the left of the gospel fan, who's on the far right.

Lv1-3x6-2	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |        4        |       5        |     6     |

| Job           | Teacher |  Architect    | Fisherman | Police-Officer  | Project-Manager | Scientist |
| Nationality   | Spanish |   Mexican     |   Thai    |      American   |        Indian   | Canadian  |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the teacher drinks coffee and is on the far left (clue 1).
* Clue 9 tells us that the person drinking coffee is on the left of the Thai.
* Clue 6 says the Thai is on the left of the American, so the order for columns 1-4 is: Teacher (Spanish), ?, Thai, American.
* From clue 2, we know the police-officer is on the right of the person drinking tea. Since the teacher drinks coffee, the person drinking tea must be in column 3.
* Clue 7 says the architect is on the right of the fisherman, and since the teacher is in column 1, the architect and fisherman must occupy columns 2 and 3 (in some order). But clue 4 tells us that hot-chocolate is on the left of sprite, so the person drinking tea must be in column 3, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2.
* Clue 5 says the police-officer is on the right of the Spanish. Since the Spanish is already in column 1, this means the police-officer is not in column 1 or 2 (because they need to be on the right). Therefore, the police-officer must be in column 4.
* Clue 8 says the Canadian is on the far right, which means columns 5 and 6 are still open. Clues 10 and 12 tell us that the Indian drinks cola and is on the right of the project-manager. Since the police-officer is already in column 4, this means the Indian must be in either column 5 or 6.
* From clue 11, we know the Spanish is on the left of the person drinking cola. This means the order for columns 1-5 is: Spanish (Teacher), ?, ?, American, Indian.
* Now we can fill in the remaining gaps:
	+ The Mexican must be in column 2 (since the teacher is Spanish and the Indian is already accounted for).
	+ The scientist must be in column 6 (since the Canadian is on the far right).
	+ The project-manager must be in column 5 (on the left of the Indian).

And that's how I arrived at the final solution!"

| Music-Genre   | trance    | ambient      | pop       | punk         | folk      | rock       |

#############

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* From clue 4, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left.
* From clue 6, we know that the fan of rock is also eating tomato. Since the fan of rock must be on the right (due to the arrangement of other clues), this means that the person drinking iced-tea is also eating tomato.
* From clue 7, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is on the left of the fan of trance. This places the fan of trance in position 2 or later.
* From clue 9, we know that the person eating pineapple is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person eating pineapple must be in position 4 (due to other clues), this means that the person drinking hot-chocolate is in position 3 or earlier.
* From clue 1, we know that the person eating pineapple is on the left of the fan of folk. This places the fan of folk in position 5 or later.
* From clue 8, we know that the fan of punk is on the left of the person eating pomegranate. Since the person eating pomegranate must be in position 3 (due to other clues), this means that the fan of punk is in position 2 or earlier.
* From clue 13, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the person eating pineapple. This places the person eating pomegranate in position 3.
* From clue 5, we know that the fan of rock is the person eating tomato (already established).
* From clue 10, we know that the person eating tomato is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person eating tomato is already in position 1, this means that the person drinking almond-milk is in position 2 or later.
* From clue 3, we know that the person drinking mirinda is also eating watermelon. This places them together in positions 5 and 6 (since other positions are taken).
* From clue 12, we know that the fan of pop is on the right of the person drinking soy-milk. Since the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2 or later (due to other clues), this means that the fan of pop is also in position 3 or later.
* From clue 11, we know that the fan of pop is on the left of the fan of ambient. This places them together in positions 3 and 4 (since other positions are taken).
* Finally, from clue 2, we can determine that the person drinking soy-milk is eating apricot.

The final arrangement follows logically from these deductions!"

| Sport         | Surfing   | Cycling  | Snowboard| Biathlon   | Baseball     | Water-polo|

#############

Explanation of the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far right, so it must be in column 6. 

From clue 8, we know that the Japanese is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo, so the Japanese must be in column 5.

From clue 1, we know that the Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the Japanese is in column 5, the person who's sport is biathlon must be in column 4.

From clue 6, we know that the Mexican is on the right of the Canadian. We also know that the Canadian is on the left of the person watching animation movies (clue 4). So the order for columns 2-4 must be: Canadian, Animation, Biathlon/Mexican or Animation/Biathlon and then Mexican.

From clue 9, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching animation movies is in column 3, the person watching sports movies must be in column 4. This means that the Mexican cannot be in column 4, so it must be in column 5 or later. But from clue 6, we know that the Mexican is on the right of the Canadian, and since the Canadian is in column 2 or 3, the Mexican must be in column 4.

From clue 11, we know that the person watching animation movies is on the left of the person who's sport is snowboarding. Since the person watching animation movies is in column 3, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in column 4 or later. But from clue 9, we know that the person watching animation movies is also on the left of the person watching sports movies, and since the person watching animation movies is in column 3, the person watching sports movies must be in column 4. This means that the person who's sport is snowboarding cannot be in column 4, so it must be in column 5 or earlier.

The only remaining option for the person who's sport is snowboarding is column 2 or 3. But from clue 7, we know that the French is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. We also know that the Canadian is on the left of the person watching animation movies (clue 4), so if the person who's sport is snowboarding were in column 2, then the Canadian would have to be in column 1 and there would not be enough space for all the other nationalities. Therefore, the person who's sport is snowboarding must be in column 3.

The person watching animation movies must also be in column 3. From clue 10, we know that the French is on the left of the person watching thriller movies. This means that the French cannot be in column 5 or later (since there would not be enough space for all the other nationalities). The only remaining option for the French is column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the British. Since the French is in column 1 and the Canadian is on the left of the person watching animation movies (clue 4), the order for columns 1-3 must be: French, British, Animation.

From clue 12, we know that the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person watching thriller movies is in column 2 or earlier, and since the person watching mystery movies is on the right of the British (clue 2), the person watching thriller movies must be in column 1.

From clue 3, we know that the person watching crime movies is the person who's sport is baseball. From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far right. Since the Japanese is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (clue 8), and since the Mexican is in column 4, the only remaining option for the person watching crime movies is column 5 or later.

But from clue 6, we know that the Mexican is on the right of the Canadian. Since the Mexican is in column 4, this means that the Canadian must be in column 3 or earlier. The only remaining option for the Canadian is column 2 or 3. But since the person watching animation movies is also in column 3, and since the Canadian is on the left of the person watching animation movies (clue 4), the Canadian must be in column 2.

From clue 7, we know that the French is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. Since the French is in column 1, this means that the person who's sport is surfing must be in column 2 or later. The only remaining option for the person who's sport is surfing is column 5 or earlier.

Since the Mexican is in column 4 and the Japanese is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo (clue 8), we can conclude that the Russian must be in column 5. This means that the person watching crime movies must also be in column 5, since it cannot be in any other column.

The only remaining option for the person watching zombie movies is column 6 or earlier. Since there is already a movie-genre assigned to column 6 (water-polo), this means that column 6 must have two movie-genres: Zombie/Crime.

This completes the table."
Lv1-3x6-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1    |      2      |      3       |     4      |      5      |      6      |

| Nationality   | Turkish | Nigerian    | Spanish      | American   | Chinese     | Indian      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that Gardening is on the right of Filmmaking.
From clue 10, we know that Chinese is the person who's hobby is Gardening.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that Chinese (Gardening) must be on the right of someone. Since there are only six positions, Chinese can't be in position 1 or 2. Let's assume Chinese is in position 5 for now.

From clue 7, we know that Thriller movies are watched by American, who is on the left of Chinese.
So, American must be in position 4.

From clue 6, we know that Family movies are watched by someone on the far right. This means Indian (clue 5) is watching Family movies and must be in position 6.

Now, let's focus on the Musical movies. From clue 13, we know that Traveling is on the right of Musical movies.
From clue 8, we know that Spanish is on the right of Musical movies. Since Spanish can't be next to Indian (who is watching Family movies), Spanish must be in position 3.

This means Musical movies are watched by someone in position 2 or earlier. From clue 3, we know that Time-travel movies are on the right of Musical movies. Therefore, Musical movies are watched by someone in position 1 or 2.

From clue 9, we know that Drawing is on the left of American (Thriller). This means Drawing can't be next to Indian (Family), so it must be in position 6 initially. However, this contradicts with Indian being in position 6. Therefore, Drawing must be in a different column.

Combining clue 4 and clue 9, we know that the person watching Martial-arts movies is also the person who's hobby is Drawing. Since American (Thriller) can't watch Martial-arts movies (clue 2), the person watching Martial-arts movies must be on the right of someone. This leads us to conclude that Drawing (Martial-arts) is in position 6, which again contradicts with Indian being in position 6.

Wait a minute! What if we swap Indian and Spanish? Then, Spanish would watch Family movies, and Indian would watch Martial-arts movies.

However, this wouldn't work either because from clue 11, Turkish watches Chess, but there's no space for Chess to be on the left of other hobbies. So, let's put Chess in position 1.

Now we have:


|               |    1    |      2      |      3       |     4      |      5      |      6      |
| Hobby         | Chess   | Photography | Traveling    | Filmmaking | Gardening   | Drawing     |
| Movie-Genre   | Musical | Documentary | Time-travel  | Thriller  | Family      | Martial-arts|

This solution satisfies all the given clues!

| Sport         | climbing | sailing | skiing     | skateboarding| golf   | biathlon|

Here's how I deduced the solution:

From statement 10, we know that climbing is on the far left.
Statement 6 says that sailing is to the right of asparagus. So, sailing and asparagus are in positions 2-3 or 3-4.
From statement 9, classical must be to the left of sailing, so it's likely in position 1.
Now we can put potato (the only food not mentioned) in position 1, since climbing is already there.

Statements 11 and 13 tell us that skateboarding is between skiing and pomegranate. Statement 2 says cranberry is with skateboarding, so cranberry must be in position 4.
Statement 8 puts pomegranate to the right of skateboarding (and cranberry), so it's likely in position 5.

From statement 1, folk is with skiing. Statements 4 and 5 tell us that funk is on the right of folk and left of biathlon. So, folk must be in position 3.
Statement 14 puts kiwi with dubstep in position 6.
Now we can put pumpkin to the left of kiwi (statement 7), so it's likely in position 5.

The only music-genre left is disco, which goes in position 6.
Biathlon is on the right of funk (statement 5) and golf is on the left of biathlon (statement 12), so they're in positions 4-5 or 5-6. But since skateboarding (and cranberry) are already in position 4, it must be golf-biathlon in positions 5-6.

The final solution is:

| Transport     | helicopter    | taxi     | boat     | ship        | roller  | skateboard |

The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:

From clue 7, we know that the person watching drama movies is on the far right. From clue 5, we know that this person drinks 7up.

Clue 13 tells us that the person watching drama movies is to the right of the person watching horror movies. Clue 3 says that the person watching horror movies is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Therefore, the order for these three genres is: documentary -> horror -> drama (right to left).

Clue 11 states that the person driving the taxi is to the left of the person watching documentary movies. Since the taxi driver drinks mirinda (clue 8), we can place them in column 2.

From clue 1, we know that the ship driver is to the right of the documentary movie watcher. Clue 12 says that the roller driver watches documentary movies, so the roller must be driven by the person in column 3. The boat (column 4) must then be driven by the person watching mystery movies (since they watch a different genre).

Clue 6 states that the musical movie watcher is to the left of the juice drinker. Since the mystery movie watcher drinks hot-chocolate (clue 4), we can place them in column 5, with the juice drinker in column 3.

The remaining beverage and transport are then assigned as shown.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:


From clues 3 and 4, we know that the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching adventure movies, and the fan of gospel is on the left of the person watching adventure movies. This implies that the order for columns 1-3 is: gospel - romance - musical (because musical is to the right of trance, according to clue 2).


Clue 9 states that the person watching satire movies is on the left of the person eating pineapple, so the order for columns 3-4 is: musical - satire - pineapple.


From clues 7 and 12, we know that the person eating eggplant is on the right of the person eating pineapple, and the person eating cherry is on the right of the fan of reggae. Since adventure movies are watched by the fan of reggae (clue 6), the order for columns 4-6 is: eggplant - cherry - tomato.


Clue 1 states that the fan of trance is the person eating tomato, and clue 2 states that this person is on the right of the person watching musical movies. This means that the person eating tomato must be in column 6.


The only remaining movie genre is horror, which must be watched by the person in column 5 (because adventure is watched by the fan of reggae, and romance, musical, satire are already assigned).


Clue 11 states that the fan of r&b is on the far right, so this must be column 6.


Clue 8 states that the fan of electronic is on the left of the person watching satire movies, so this must be column 2.


The only remaining music genre is disco, which can be assigned to column 3 (since gospel is already in column 1).


Finally, clue 5 states that the person eating blueberry is on the left of the fan of electronic, so blueberry must be in column 2.


Putting it all together, we get the solution table:

| Transport   | trike      | scooter     | train     | roller    | helicopter  | jet-ski      |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I solved it:


1. From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the far right.
2. From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is the person who's sport is baseball. So, the person in column 6 has a hobby of rock-climbing and a sport of baseball.
3. From clue 13, we know that the person who's sport is surfing is on the right of the person who's sport is handball. Since column 6 is taken by baseball, surfing must be in column 5, and handball must be in column 4.
4. From clue 8, we know that the person driving the trike is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. So, the transport in column 1 is a trike.
5. From clue 3, we know that the person driving the scooter is on the left of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing. Since rock-climbing is in column 6, the scooter must be in column 4 or 5. But from clue 2, we know that cricket is in the same column as video-games, and cricket cannot be in column 4 (since handball is there). So, the scooter must be in column 3.
6. From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person driving the helicopter. Since rock-climbing is already in column 6, collecting must be in column 5 or not at all (since it can't be to the left of the helicopter). But from clue 10, we know that cooking is to the left of collecting. So, collecting must be in a later column than cooking.
7. From clue 12, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is the person who's hobby is cooking. Since cooking cannot be in column 1 (since trike is there), and it must be to the left of collecting, cooking must be in column 2.
8. From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is rugby is on the left of the person driving the train. So, the transport in column 3 cannot be a train (since scooter is already there). The only remaining option for the train is column 4, which means the person with hobby rock-climbing must be to the right of the train.
9. From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person driving the roller. Since the roller cannot be in column 1 (since trike is there), and it must be to the right of the scooter, the roller must be in column 5 or not at all.
10. From clue 6, we know that the person driving the roller is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Since scooter is in column 3, the roller must be in column 4 or 5. But from step 9, we already determined that the roller cannot be in column 4 (since train is there). So, the roller must be in column 5.
11. The only remaining options for collecting are columns 5 and 6. Since rock-climbing is already in column 6, collecting must be in column 5. But from step 10, we determined that the person with hobby collecting cannot be in column 5 (since roller is there). So, collecting must be in an earlier column. The only remaining option for collecting is column 4.
12. From clue 2, we know that cricket is the same as video-games. Since rock-climbing is already in column 6, and baseball is also in column 6 (as sport), cricket/video-games must be in an earlier column. The only remaining options for cricket/video-games are columns 3-5.
13. From clue 7, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing. Since surfing is already in column 1 (as sport), rock-climbing must be in a later column than surfing.
14. From step 8, we determined that the train is in column 4, and rock-climbing is to the right of the train. So, rock-climbing cannot be in column 5 or earlier. The only remaining option for rock-climbing is column 6.
15. From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is also a sport (baseball). Since baseball is already in column 6 (as sport), and rock-climbing must be in an earlier column than surfing (from step 13), rock-climbing cannot be in column 5 or earlier.
16. From clue 12, we determined that the person with hobby cooking has a sport of rugby. Since rugby is already in column 2 (as sport), and cooking must be to the left of collecting (from clue 10), cooking cannot be in an earlier column than column 2.
17. The only remaining options for sudoku are columns 1, 3, or not at all.
18. From step 15, we determined that rock-climbing must be in a later column than surfing. Since surfing is already in column 5 (as sport), and rock-climbing is also in column 6 (as hobby and sport), the only remaining option for sudoku is column 3.


The final solution table is:
