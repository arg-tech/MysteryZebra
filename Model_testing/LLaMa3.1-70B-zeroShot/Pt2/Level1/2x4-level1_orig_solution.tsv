Lv1-2x4-1	"Based on the given clues, I will solve the puzzle and provide the completed table:


|               |     1     |      2      |   3    |    4    |
| Food          |           |             |        |         |
| Nationality   |           |             |        |         |

Let's analyze the clues:

* Clue 2: The person eating mango is Turkish.
* Clue 4: The person eating pepper is on the left of the Turkish.

This implies that the Turkish person cannot be in column 1, since there needs to be someone eating pepper to their left. Therefore, the Turkish person must be in either column 3 or 4.

However, clue 3 states that the Thai is on the right of the Chinese. This means that the Thai person cannot be in column 1 or 2, since they need to be to the right of the Chinese. The only possible position for the Thai person is in column 4.

* Clue 5: The person eating raspberry is on the left of the Chinese.
* Clue 1: The Egyptian is on the left of the Chinese.

This implies that the Egyptian and the person eating raspberry must be in columns 1 and 2, respectively. However, this would mean that there is no one to the left of the Turkish person eating pepper, which contradicts clue 4. Therefore, the correct order for these two clues must be:

* Column 1: Egyptian
* Column 2: Person eating raspberry (which cannot be Turkish, so it must be Chinese)

With this information, we can now fill in the table:

Lv1-2x4-2	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know that woodworking and soccer are paired.

From clue 2, camping is on the far right (column 4).

From clue 3, cooking is to the right of woodworking.

From clue 4, woodworking is to the right of swimming.

From clue 5, soccer is to the left of parkour.

Let's start by placing the pairs:

* Woodworking and soccer can be in columns 1 or 2 (since they need to be next to each other).
* Cooking must be to the right of woodworking, so it can only be in column 3.
* Camping is on the far right (column 4).

Now let's fill in the sports:

* Swimming must be to the left of woodworking (clue 4), so it can only be in column 1 or 2. But since soccer is already paired with woodworking, swimming must be in column 1.
* Parkour is to the right of soccer (clue 5), and since soccer is paired with woodworking, parkour can only be in column 3.

The final table looks like this:

| Movie-Genre   | Crime   | Mystery | Time-Travel | Drama         |

Let's go through the clues to verify:


1. The person watching mystery movies (column 2) is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies (column 3).
2. The person who's hobby is fishing (column 1) is the person watching crime movies.
3. The person watching drama movies (column 4) is indeed on the far right.
4. The person watching time-travel movies (column 3) is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing (column 2).
5. The person who's hobby is traveling (column 3) is on the left of the person watching drama movies (column 4).

Lv1-2x4-4	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The person who's sport is sailing is the person watching western movies.
This means Western is paired with Sailing.

2. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing.
3. The person watching disaster movies is on the left of the person watching action movies.
From these clues, we know that Disaster must be on the left side, and Action must be to the right of Disaster. Since Western is paired with Sailing (from clue 1), and Disaster is to the left of Action (from clue 3), the order for Movie-Genre so far is: ?, Disaster, Action, ?

4. The person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching western movies.
This means Western must be to the left of Disaster, filling in the first column.

5. The person who's sport is basketball is on the far right.
Given that Sailing is paired with Western (from clue 1), and Basketball is on the far right, we can start pairing Sports with Movie-Genres:

|               |    1    |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Movie-Genre   |  Western | Disaster | Action  |            |
| Sport         |  Sailing |          |          | Basketball |

Now, let's figure out the remaining pairings. We know that Disaster is to the left of Surfing (from clue 2), so Surfing must be paired with Drama (since it can't be Action, which we already have). This means Tennis must be paired with Action.

The final table looks like this:

Lv1-2x4-5	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that Cucumber is to the left of Cauliflower.

From clue 3, we know that Pineapple is to the left of Pony.

Now, let's try to place Hedgehog and Hamster using clues 2 and 4. Since the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of Kiwi (clue 2), and the owner of the hamster is on the right of the hedgehog (clue 4), we can deduce that:

Kiwi - Hedgehog - Hamster

Now, let's combine all the information:

Cucumber - Cauliflower
Pineapple - Pony
Kiwi - Hedgehog - Hamster

Since there are only four positions, we can start filling in the table. Let's place Pineapple and Pony first:

|        |     1     |  2   |    3     |      4      |
| Food   | Pineapple |      |          |             |
| Pet    |           | Pony |          |             |

Now, let's add Kiwi, Hedgehog, and Hamster:

|        |     1     |  2   |    3     |      4      |
| Food   | Pineapple | Kiwi |          |             |
| Pet    |           |      |Hedgehog | Hamster |

Finally, let's add Cucumber and Cauliflower:

|        |     1     |  2   |    3     |      4      |
| Food   | Pineapple | Kiwi |Cauliflower| Cucumber |
| Pet    |           | Pony |Hedgehog | Hamster |

Wait, that's not correct! According to clue 1, Cucumber should be to the left of Cauliflower. Let's swap them:

|        |     1     |  2   |    3     |      4      |
| Food   | Pineapple | Kiwi |Cucumber | Cauliflower|
| Pet    |           | Pony |Hedgehog | Hamster |

Now, let's add the final pet, Dog:

|        |     1     |  2   |    3     |      4      |
| Food   | Pineapple | Kiwi |Cucumber | Cauliflower|

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-2x4-6	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know the pakistani is on the left of the nigerian.


From clue 4, we know the owner of the fish is on the left of the nigerian.


Combining these two clues, we can deduce that the order is: pakistani, ?, nigerian (where ? represents a nationality and possibly another pet).

The only person who could be between the pakistani and nigerian is the dutch, so the order is: pakistani, dutch, nigerian.


From clue 5, we know the owner of the mouse is on the right of the owner of the goldfish.


Since there's already a pet in column 2 (gold), this means that column 1 must be the owner of the goldfish. This also means the pakistani owns the goldfish.


Now, from clue 3, we know the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the frog.


The only place for the owner of the frog to be is in column 4, and since the mexican is on the far right (clue 1), this means that the mexican owns the frog. 


Column 3 must be the nigerian, so the dutch can't own a mouse (because it would need to be to the left of the nigerian's column). Therefore, column 2 belongs to the dutch and they have no pet in common with anyone else.


From clue 4 again, we know that the owner of the fish is on the left of the nigerian. So, either column 1 or column 2 must be the owner of the fish. Since column 1 has a goldfish already, it can't also have a fish (that would be two pets for one person), so column 2 belongs to the dutch and they own the fish.


The only pet left is the mouse which therefore belongs to the nigerian in column 3.

 
Here's the solution:

Lv1-2x4-7	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.

From clue 1, we know that the mouse owner is on the far left, so column 1 will have ""mouse"" as the pet.

From clue 3, we know that the fan of indie is also on the far left, so column 1 will have ""indie"" as the music-genre.

From clue 5, we know that the fan of electronic is on the left of the owner of the rat. Since column 1 already has indie and mouse, this must mean that column 2 will have ""electronic"" as the music-genre.

Lv1-2x4-8	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 5, we know that the person driving the car is on the far left, so the first column is:


|             |      Car     |           |          |          |
| Job         |              |           |          |          |
| Transport   |              |           |          |          |

From clue 3, we know that the designer is on the right of the chef. Since the car driver can't be the chef (because the chef would then be on the far left), the second column must contain the chef:


|             |      Car     | Chef      |          |          |
| Job         |              |           |          |          |
| Transport   |              |           |          |          |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the designer. Since the designer can't be in the first column (because it's already occupied by the car driver), and can't be in the second column (because the chef would then not be on the far left among the remaining columns), the designer must be in the third column:


|             |      Car     | Chef      | Designer |          |
| Job         |              |           |          |          |
| Transport   |              |           |          |          |

Now, from clue 1 again, we know that the person driving the trike is on the right of the designer. So, the fourth column must contain the trike driver:


|             |      Car     | Chef      | Designer | Trike    |
| Job         |              |           |          |          |
| Transport   |              |           |          |          |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the trike is the musician:


|             |      Car     | Chef      | Designer | Trike    |
| Job         |              |           |          | Musician|
| Transport   |              |           |          |          |

Finally, from clue 4, we know that the entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the entrepreneur can't be in the first column (because it's already occupied by the car driver), and can't be in the fourth column (because there would then be no one to drive the quad-bike), the entrepreneur must be in either the second or third column.


However, if the entrepreneur were in the third column, they would not be on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Therefore, the entrepreneur must be in the second column:


|             |      Car     | Entrepreneur| Designer | Trike    |
| Job         |              | Chef       |          | Musician|
| Transport   |              | Quad-Bike  |          |          |

Now we have a problem: where to put the quad-bike? If it's in the third column, the entrepreneur will not be on its left. So, the quad-bike must be in either the second or fourth columns.


However, if the quad-bike were in the fourth column, there would be two transport methods in that column (quad-bike and trike). Therefore, the quad-bike must be in the second column:


|             |      Car     | Entrepreneur| Designer | Trike    |
| Job         |              | Chef       |          | Musician|
| Transport   |      Car     | Quad-Bike  | Tram      | Trike    |

We now have only one transport method left: the tram. We can put it in either of the remaining columns.


However, we know from clue 4 that the entrepreneur is on the left of the person driving the quad-bike. Since the quad-bike is already in the second column, the entrepreneur must be in the first or second columns. However, if they were in the first column, there would be two transport methods in that column (car and tram). Therefore, the entrepreneur must be in the second column, and the tram can only go in the third column.

From clue 1, we know that the bus driver is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate is already listed in column 3, the bus driver must be in column 4.

| Transport   |      |       |               | Bus     |

From clue 2, we know that the person drinking milk is to the right of the person drinking cola. This means cola must be in column 1 or 2, and milk must be in column 2 or 3. But since hot-chocolate is already in column 3, milk cannot be there. So, cola is in column 1, and milk is in column 2.

|             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |

From clue 3, we know that the tram driver is to the left of the train driver. Since there are only two columns left (1 and 2), the tram driver must be in column 1, and the train driver must be in column 2.

Wait, but column 1 already has cola, and column 2 already has milk! This means we need to swap the transport columns with the beverage columns. Let's do that:

|             |  1   |   2   |       3       |   4    |

| Transport   | Tram | Train |               | Bus     |

Now, let's fill in the beverage column. We already know cola is in column 1 and milk is in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that the taxi driver is to the right of the person drinking milk. This means the taxi driver must be in column 3 or 4, but since bus is already in column 4, the taxi driver must be in column 3.
