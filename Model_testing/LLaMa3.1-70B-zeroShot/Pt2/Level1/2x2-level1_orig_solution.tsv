Lv1-2x2-1	"Let's analyze the puzzle:


From statement 1, we know that the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person driving the subway.

Since there are only two people ( columns 1 and 2), this means that the person watching epic movies must be in column 1.


Now, let's look at the movie-genres. We have epic and musical. Since the person in column 1 watches epic movies, the person in column 2 must watch musicals.


Next, we have the transport options: subway and trike. From statement 1, we know that the person driving the subway is to the right of the person watching epic movies (who is in column 1). Therefore, the person driving the subway is in column 2.


The only remaining option for column 1 is the trike.


So, here's the final solution table:


#############
|               |   1   |    2    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic  | Musical |
| Transport     | Trike | Subway  |

Lv1-2x2-2	"Let's analyze the given information:


Since the person eating kiwi is to the right of the person whose sport is skateboarding, we can conclude that:


* The person with skateboarding as their sport must be in column 1.
* The person eating kiwi must be in column 2.


Now, let's fill in the table with this information:


|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    |               |              |
| Sport   | Skateboarding | Snowboarding |
 


Since there are only two types of food and two types of sport, we can infer that:


* The person eating eggplant must be in column 1 (since kiwi is already assigned to column 2).
* The person with snowboarding as their sport must be in column 2.


Here's the completed table:


#############
|         |       1       |      2       |
| Food    | Eggplant     | Kiwi        |
| Sport   | Skateboarding | Snowboarding|

Lv1-2x2-3	"Based on the given information:


Since the person drinking milk is to the right of the person eating spinach, and there are only two columns (1 and 2), it means the person eating spinach must be in column 1.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |
| Food       | spinach  | orange |


Since there are only two types of food and two favourite beverages, this solution is unique.


Here is the final solution table with '#############' around it:


################
 
|            |    1     |   2    |
| Beverage   | soy-milk | milk   |

Lv1-2x2-4	"After analyzing the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |    1    |     2      |
| Nationality   | French | Indonesian|
| Sport         | Cycling | Parkour  |
#############


Here's my reasoning:

* The first clue states that ""the indonesian is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling"". This means that the person who likes cycling must be in position 1, and the Indonesian person must be in position 2.
* Since there are only two nationalities (French and Indonesian), the French person must be in position 1.
* The only remaining option for the sport of the Indonesian person is Parkour.

Therefore, the final solution table is as above."
Lv1-2x2-5	"Let's analyze the given information:


We have two favourite beverages: Hot-Chocolate and Sprite.
We have two movie-genres: Crime and Horror.


From clue 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the left of the person watching crime movies. This means the person drinking hot-chocolate cannot be paired with the crime genre.


Now let's fill in the table:


|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Hot-Chocolate| Sprite|
| Movie-Genre   |     Horror    | Crime |

 

So, the final solution is:


#############
|               |       1       |   2    |
| Beverage      |  Hot-Chocolate| Sprite|

Lv1-2x2-6	"Based on the given information, here's a possible solution:


|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Apple      | Asparagus|
| Transport   | Helicopter | Taxi    |

 

However, according to statement 1, ""the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person eating asparagus"". Since in this table, the person with taxi (on the right) is paired with asparagus (on the right), it doesn't match the statement.

Let's try swapping them:


|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Asparagus | Apple|
| Transport   | Taxi       | Helicopter |

But again, this table still doesn't satisfy the condition since taxi is on the left of asparagus. So we need to swap the foods while keeping taxi on the right:


|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Asparagus | Apple  -> swapped with the other food
| Transport   | Helicopter| Taxi    |

 Swapped the food:
 
|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Apple      | Asparagus|
| Transport   | Helicopter| Taxi    |

 
And now we can put '#############' around it:

#############
|             |     1      |   2   |
| Food        | Apple      | Asparagus|

Lv1-2x2-7	"Based on the given information, I'll solve the puzzle and provide the final solution.


From statement 1, we know that the person who writes is to the right of the person drinking almond milk.


Let's assume:

| Beverage   | Almond-milk | Soy-milk |
| Hobby      |             |          |

Since the writer is to the right of the almond milk drinker, the hobby for person 2 must be writing. Person 1's hobby can only be dancing.


Here's the final solution:

Lv1-2x2-8	"Based on the given information, I will try to solve the puzzle.

From clue (1), we know that ""the writer is on the right of the person drinking Mirinda"". This means that the person drinking Mirinda must be in column 1, and the writer must be in column 2.


Here's the initial setup:


|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |  Mirinda    |        |
| Job        |             | Writer |

Now, let's look at the remaining options. The person in column 1 is drinking Mirinda, and we have two jobs left: firefighter and writer (which is already assigned to column 2). So, the job for column 1 must be firefighter.


Here's the updated table:


|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |  Mirinda    |        |
| Job        | Firefighter | Writer |

Now, we have only one beverage left: Cola. It must be assigned to column 2.


Here's the final solution:


#############
|            |      1      |   2    |
| Beverage   |  Mirinda    | Cola  |

Lv1-2x2-9	"After analyzing the given information, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |     2     |
| Nationality   | Colombian | Brazilian |
| Pet           | Ferret    | Mouse     |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that ""the brazilian is on the right of the owner of the ferret"". This means that the Brazilian must be in column 2, and the owner of the ferret must be in column 1.

Since there are only two nationalities (Brazilian and Colombian), the person in column 1 must be Colombian. And since there are only two pets (Ferret and Mouse), the pet in column 1 must be the Ferret.

This leaves us with the Brazilian in column 2, who must own the Mouse.

Therefore, the final solution is as shown above."

Since the person drinking tea is to the right of the person whose hobby is card-games, we can start by placing card-games in column 1 and leaving column 2 for hiking.


The beverage associated with column 1 cannot be tea, so it must be 7up. This leaves tea for column 2.


Now we have:


|            |     1      |   2    |
| Beverage   | 7up        | Tea    |
