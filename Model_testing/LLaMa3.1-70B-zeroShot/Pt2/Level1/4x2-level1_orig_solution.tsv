Lv1-4x2-1	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is traveling is on the far right, so:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               |           |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   |               |           |

From clue 3, we know that the designer is on the far right. Since there can only be one person on the far right, this means that:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               |           |
| Transport   |               |           |

Now, let's look at clue 2. The person who's sport is soccer is on the right of the person driving the jet-ski. This means that:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski      |           |

Since there are only two types of transport, the person on the right must be driving a bike:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       |               | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski      | Bike |

Now, let's look at the hobbies. Since there are only two hobbies and traveling is already filled in, the person on the left must enjoy writing:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Writing     | Traveling |
| Job         |               | Designer  |
| Sport       |               | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski      | Bike |

Finally, let's look at the jobs. Since there are only two jobs and designer is already filled in, the person on the left must be a social worker:


|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Writing     | Traveling |
| Job         | Social Worker| Designer  |
| Sport       |               | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski      | Bike |

The only sport left is volleyball, which must be on the left:


#############
|             |       1       |     2     |
| Hobby       | Writing     | Traveling |

| Sport       | Volleyball  | Soccer    |
| Transport   | Jet-Ski      | Bike     |

Lv1-4x2-2	"After analyzing the clues, I think I have found the solution:


#############
|               |      1       |      2      |
| Beverage      | Lemonade    | Almond-milk |
| Job           | Entrepreneur| Lawyer      |
| Movie-Genre   | Time-travel | Action      |
| Sport         | Snowboarding| Surfing     |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the entrepreneur is on the far left, so they must be in column 1.
* From clue 3, we know the person watching action movies is on the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the entrepreneur is already placed, this means lemonade must be in column 1 and action movies must be in column 2.
* From clue 1, we know the person watching action movies (column 2) is on the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding. This means snowboarding must be in column 1.
* The only remaining option for the beverage in column 2 is almond-milk.
* Similarly, the only remaining option for the movie-genre in column 1 is time-travel.
* Finally, the only remaining option for the sport in column 2 is surfing.

I hope this solution is correct! Let me know if you have any questions or concerns."
Lv1-4x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution that satisfies all the conditions:


#############
|               |    1     |     2     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea | soy-milk  |

| Music-Genre   | ambient  | country   |
| Transport     | taxi     | quad-bike |
#############"
Lv1-4x2-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |       1        |    2     |
| Beverage      | iced-tea      | soy-milk |
| Food          | papaya        | lemon    |
| Job           | security-guard| nurse    |
| Music-Genre   | punk          | techno   |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the fan of punk is on the far left, so music-genre for person 1 is punk.

From clue 2, we know the nurse is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. This means person 1 must be drinking iced-tea, and person 2 is the nurse.

From clue 3, we know the person drinking soy-milk is eating lemon. Since person 1 is already drinking iced-tea, person 2 must be drinking soy-milk and eating lemon.

The only food left for person 1 is papaya.

Finally, since person 1 is a punk fan and not a nurse (who is person 2), person 1's job must be security-guard."
Lv1-4x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby         | skydiving | video-games   |
| Music-Genre   | classical | country       |
| Sport         | sailing   | skateboarding|
| Transport     | roller    | quad-bike     |

Here's my reasoning:

* From clue 1, the fan of classical music is on the far left, so we can place ""classical"" in column 1.
* From clue 2, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since the roller is a transport method, it must be in column 1 (on the left). This means skateboarding must be in column 2.
* From clue 3, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person driving the roller. Again, since the roller is in column 1, video-games must be in column 2.
* With video-games in column 2 and skateboarding already placed there, we can infer that country music (the only remaining genre) must also be in column 2.
* The only hobby left is skydiving, which must go in column 1. Similarly, sailing (the only remaining sport) goes in column 1 as well.
* Finally, the only transport method left is quad-bike, which goes in column 2.

Lv1-4x2-6	"Based on the clues provided, I will attempt to solve the puzzle.

From clue 1: The fan of techno is on the left of the person drinking mirinda
This means that Techno and Mirinda cannot be in the same column (since one is left of the other), so we can start by placing Techno in column 1. Let's also place Milk in column 2, since there are only two beverages.

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | Milk      | Mirinda      |
| Movie-Genre   |           |               |
| Music-Genre   | Techno    |               |
| Sport         |           |               |

From clue 2: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching animation movies
This means that Animation and Skateboarding cannot be in the same column (since one is right of the other), so we can place Animation in column 1.

|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | Milk      | Mirinda      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation |               |
| Music-Genre   | Techno    |               |
| Sport         |           | Skateboarding|

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks. The only music-genre left is Trance, so it must be paired with Mirinda (since Techno is already paired with Milk).

The only movie-genre left is Scientific, which must be paired with Mirinda.

Finally, the only sport left is Soccer, which must be paired with Animation and Techno.

Here is the completed table:

#############
|               |     1     |       2       |
| Beverage      | Milk      | Mirinda      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation | Scientific    |
| Music-Genre   | Techno    | Trance        |
| Sport         | Soccer    | Skateboarding|
#############

I hope this solution is correct!"
Lv1-4x2-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |    2    |
| Food          | Banana   | Nectarine|
| Music-Genre   | Hip-Hop  | R&B      |
| Sport         | Baseball | Cycling  |
| Transport     | Bus       | Tram     |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person driving the tram is on the right of the person eating nectarine. This means that the person eating nectarine must be in column 1.

Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the tram is on the far right, so the transport method for column 2 is indeed Tram.

Now, from clue 1, we know that the fan of hip-hop is on the left of the person who's sport is cycling. Since cycling must be in column 2 (because nectarine is in column 1), the fan of hip-hop must be in column 1 as well. This means that the music genre for column 1 is Hip-Hop.

The only remaining music genre, R&B, must then go to column 2.

Finally, we can assign the sport and food items to their respective columns based on the constraints. The person eating banana (column 1) is more likely to be a baseball fan, while the person eating nectarine (column 1) cannot have cycling as their sport, so it must go to column 2.

The final solution table above satisfies all the given clues!"
Lv1-4x2-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |         1          |      2       |
| Hobby         | board-games        | reading     |
| Job           | software-developer | entrepreneur|
| Movie-Genre   | thriller            | zombie      |
| Transport     | trike              | jet-ski    |

#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching thriller movies is on the far left. Therefore, column 1 must have ""thriller"" in the Movie-Genre row.

Clue 2 states that the person watching zombie movies is the entrepreneur. Since the entrepreneur can't be on the far left (because of clue 3), they must be on the right, which means column 2 must have ""zombie"" in the Movie-Genre row and ""entrepreneur"" in the Job row.

Clue 1 states that the person driving the jet-ski is to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games. Since we already know the entrepreneur is on the right, the person driving the jet-ski must be in column 2 as well, which means column 1 must have ""trike"" in the Transport row.

The only remaining combination for hobbies is that column 1 has ""board-games"", and column 2 has ""reading"".

Finally, we know that the software-developer can't be on the right (because of clue 2), so they must be on the left, which completes the Job row."
Lv1-4x2-9	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know the teacher is on the left of the person eating cucumber.


From clue 2, we know the person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee.


From clue 3, we know the teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess.


Combining these clues, we can start building the table:

| Beverage   |             |           |

| Hobby      |             |           |
| Job        | Teacher    |           |

Now, let's fill in the beverage for person 2. From clue 2, we know the person eating spinach is on the left of the person drinking coffee. Since person 1 is a teacher and can't be eating spinach (from clue 1), person 1 must be eating cucumber. Therefore, person 2 must be eating spinach and drinking coffee.


|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |             | Coffee    |

| Hobby      |             |           |
| Job        | Teacher    |           |

Now, let's fill in the hobby for person 2. From clue 3, we know the teacher is on the left of the person who's hobby is chess. Therefore, person 2 must have chess as their hobby.


|            |      1      |     2     |
| Beverage   |             | Coffee    |

| Job        | Teacher    |           |

Finally, let's fill in the job for person 2. The only remaining job is scientist.
