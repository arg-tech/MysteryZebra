| Sport         | volleyball | surfing    | ice-hockey| swimming   | climbing   | cricket    | snowboarding |

 
 Notes:
The first step is to place the people who's sport is cricket, because it says they are on the far left. Then we know that the australian and the person eating kiwi are also on the far left. Next, we can place the nurse, manager and dancer using clues 3, 9 and 11. After that, we can use clue 1 to place the pumpkin eater. Clue 7 says that the banana eater is on the right of the designer so we know that the person eating kiwi is not the designer. We also know that the musician eats watermelon (clue 21). Now we have placed a few people and we can continue with the rest using the remaining clues.

#############

Here's the explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 2, we know that soccer is on the left of video-games. From clue 21, we know that video-games corresponds to handball.

From clue 13, we know that the security-guard is in the middle (position 4). Clue 22 tells us that the engineer is on the left of the security-guard. Clue 24 tells us that biathlon corresponds to the engineer.

Clue 25 tells us that the photographer is on the far right (position 7).

From clue 1, we know that the train is on the left of the librarian. Since the train can't be in position 1 or 2 (because it would be too close to the security-guard), it must be in position 3.

Clue 5 tells us that the motorbike is on the left of the entrepreneur. Clue 8 tells us that the entrepreneur is on the left of sudoku. Since the entrepreneur can't be in position 6 or 7 (because it would be too close to the photographer), it must be in position 6.

Clue 3 tells us that the train is on the right of family movies. This means that family movies must be in position 2, and romance movies must be in position 1 (since action movies are already taken by clue 23).

From clue 9, we know that writing is on the right of sudoku. Clue 10 tells us that writing is also on the right of the boat.

Clue 14 tells us that comedy movies are on the right of action movies. This means that action movies must be in position 1 (which we already knew from clue 23).

From clue 17, we know that climbing is on the left of disaster movies. Clue 4 tells us that climbing corresponds to the security-guard.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place using the remaining clues.

2. Clue 22 places the person drinking 7up to the right of the person driving the van.
3. Clue 11 puts the person watching action movies to the left of the person drinking iced-tea.
4. From clue 8, we know that the turkish is on the left of the person watching crime movies, and from clue 13, we also know that the person eating zucchini is on the right of the person watching crime movies.
5. Clue 17 places the van to the right of the person drinking 7up and eating radish (from clue 5).
6. From clues 16 and 26, we know that the person drinking sprite is to the left of the person eating tomato and on the far right.

| Nationality   | malaysian | italian    | argentine           | polish        | british   | german       | american    |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 14, the person eating kale is on the far left. From clue 10, the person who's hobby is cooking is the person eating kale, so the malaysian (clue 13) is on the far left.

From clue 9, the person eating watermelon is on the left of the software-developer. The person eating papaya (clue 15) has a hobby that comes after cooking (clue 16), so papaya must be in position 3 or later. But if papaya were in position 6 or 7, then salsa would be to the right of pomegranate (contradicting clue 2). So papaya is in position 3.

From clue 8, the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the polish. From clue 4, the person eating apple is the polish, so pomegranate is in position 6 and apple is in position 4.

From clue 11, the person eating apple is on the left of the photographer. So the photographer must be in position 5 or later. But if the photographer were in position 7, then pop would be to the right of cherry (contradicting clue 18). So the photographer is in position 5.

From clue 6, the person eating kale is on the left of the pilot. The pilot must be in position 5 or later, but it can't be in position 7 because then pop would be to the right of cherry (contradicting clue 18). So the pilot is in position 5.

From clue 12, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the person who's hobby is fishing. The person who's hobby is cooking (malaysian) has a job that comes before designer (clue 17 and 21), so the malaysian must be in position 1 or 2. So dancing is in position 5.

From clue 19, the fan of metal is on the right of the software-developer. From clue 20, the software-developer is on the right of the fan of folk. The fan of gospel (clue 17) has a hobby that comes after filmmaking (clue 21), so gospel must be in position 7.

From clue 5, the person eating pomegranate is on the left of the writer. So the writer is in position 6 or later. But if the writer were in position 7, then salsa would be to the right of pomegranate (contradicting clue 2). So the writer is in position 6.

From clue 1, the german is on the right of the british. From clue 25, the italian is on the left of the fan of salsa. The argentine is in the middle (clue 3), so it must be in position 3 or 4. But if the argentine were in position 4, then apple would be to the right of polish (contradicting clue 8). So the argentine is in position 3.

Now we can fill in the rest of the table using the remaining clues.
