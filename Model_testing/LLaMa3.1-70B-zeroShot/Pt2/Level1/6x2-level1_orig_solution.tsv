Lv1-6x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:

| Food          | pepper    | avocado      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 2, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person eating pepper. This means that the person eating avocado must be on the right.
* Clue 1 tells us that the owner of the cat is on the left of the person whose hobby is baking. Since the person baking can't be on the left, they must be on the right. Therefore, the person writing must be on the left.
* Clue 3 states that the Egyptian is on the left of the person whose sport is biathlon. This means that the Colombian must be on the right.
* The remaining information (movie genre and pet) can be filled in accordingly.


Please note that there might be multiple possible solutions, but this one satisfies all the given clues.

Lv1-6x2-4	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the skydiver is to the left of the cook.


From clue 1, we know that the ferret owner is to the left of the bartender.


Since there are only two columns, the ferret owner must be in column 1 and the bartender in column 2. The skydiver can't be in column 1 because then the cook would have to be in a non-existent third column. So, the skydiver is also in column 2, and since they are to the left of the cook (clue 2), they must be below the bartender.


Now we know that the ferret owner is in column 1, row 1, and the bartender is in column 2, row 1. The skydiver is in column 2, row 2.


From clue 4, we know that the gospel fan is on the far right, which means they are in column 2, but not necessarily row 2 since it's possible to be ""on the far right"" and still have someone below you. However, since there's already a person (the skydiver) in column 2, row 2, the gospel fan must be in column 2, row 1 or column 2, row 3.


However, we've established that the bartender is in column 2, row 1, so the gospel fan can't be there. And since we don't have a third row yet for column 2, let's create one and put the gospel fan there:


Now we know the ferret owner is in column 1, row 1, the bartender in column 2, row 1, the skydiver in column 2, row 2, and the gospel fan in column 2, row 3.


From clue 3, we know that the soy-milk drinker is to the right of the snowboarder. This means that the snowboarder can't be in column 2 (because then there would be no one to their right), so they must be in column 1. Also, since the ferret owner is already in column 1, row 1, the snowboarder must be below them.


We can now add a third row for column 1 and put the snowboarder there:


Now we know that the soy-milk drinker is to the right of the snowboarder (clue 3), which means they are in column 2. However, since the skydiver is already in column 2, row 2, and the gospel fan is in column 2, row 3, the soy-milk drinker must be in column 2, but we don't have any empty rows left for them.


This means that one of our previous conclusions was incorrect. However, there's a possibility that we didn't consider yet: What if the snowboarder is not below the ferret owner? We previously assumed that because the snowboarder had to be in column 1 and the ferret owner was already there, but what if they're actually above the ferret owner?


Let's swap them:


Now the soy-milk drinker can be to the right of the snowboarder (in column 2, row 3), but that would mean the gospel fan isn't on the far right as stated in clue 4. So this doesn't work either.


Wait a minute... We were looking at it from the wrong perspective!


We assumed that ""on the far right"" means being in the last possible position (in terms of rows) for column 2, but what if we look at it differently?


What if ""on the far right"" simply means being in the last column? Then the gospel fan can indeed be on the far right without necessarily being in the last row.


So let's go back to our original arrangement:


and swap the soy-milk drinker and the gospel fan (but keep the gospel fan in column 2):


This satisfies all conditions!


We now have a complete solution for one of the persons:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | juice        |            |
| Hobby         | skydiving    |            |
| Job           |              | bartender|
| Music-Genre   | indie        | gospel     |
| Pet           | ferret       |            |
| Sport         | snowboarding | volleyball |

However, we still need to figure out the remaining fields.


From clue 3, we know that the soy-milk drinker is on the right of the person whose sport is snowboarding. So the soy-milk drinker must be in column 2.


Since there's only one music genre left (indie), it must go with the person who prefers juice (in column 1). This means the person in column 1 is an indie fan and drinks juice.


The remaining beverage is soy-milk, which we've established goes to column 2. We also know that this person's sport is not snowboarding (since they are on the right of the snowboarder), so it must be volleyball.


We can now fill in most of the gaps:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | juice        | soy-milk   |
| Hobby         |              |            |
| Job           |              | bartender|
| Music-Genre   | indie        | gospel     |
| Pet           | ferret       |            |
| Sport         | snowboarding | volleyball |

The remaining hobby is cooking, which must go to the person who drinks soy-milk (in column 2), since their sport is already established as volleyball.


However, we know that the skydiver is on the left of the cook (clue 2), so this can't be correct!


We previously assumed that the skydiver was in column 2 because they had to be on the left of the cook, but what if they're actually above the cook?


Wait a minute... This means we were looking at it from the wrong perspective again!


The skydiver is indeed on the left of the cook, not necessarily above or below them.


Let's look at our current solution:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | juice        | soy-milk   |
| Hobby         |              |            |
| Job           |              | bartender|
| Music-Genre   | indie        | gospel     |
| Pet           | ferret       |            |
| Sport         | snowboarding | volleyball |

The cook can indeed be on the right of the skydiver, but this means they're not in column 2. They must be in column 1!


But that's impossible since we've already established that the person who drinks juice (in column 1) is a fan of indie music.


Unless... What if the person drinking juice isn't actually the one with the hobby skydiving?


We previously assumed that because the skydiver had to be on the left of the cook and the ferret owner was already in column 1, but what if they're not connected at all?


Let's try swapping the hobbies:


|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | juice        | soy-milk   |
| Hobby         | cooking      | skydiving  |
| Job           |              | bartender|
| Music-Genre   | indie        | gospel     |
| Pet           | ferret       |            |
| Sport         | snowboarding | volleyball |

However, we still need to figure out the remaining fields.


From clue 1, we know that the owner of the ferret is on the left of the bartender. So the ferret must be in column 1.


We also know that the cook can't be a bartender (since they're on the right of the skydiver), and since there's only one job left (firefighter), it must go to the person who drinks juice (in column 1).


The remaining pet is a snake, which goes to the person in column 2.


Here's our final solution:


#############
|               |      1       |     2      |
| Beverage      | juice        | soy-milk   |

Lv1-6x2-5	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the solution:

| Sport         | baseball      | parkour    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know that asparagus is on the right of Mexican.
* From clue 3, dancer is on the left of asparagus, so dancer must be in column 1 and asparagus in column 2.
* Clue 4 states that musical movies are on the right of pepper. Since asparagus is already in column 2, pepper must be in column 1.
* From clue 1, parkour is on the right of rock-climbing. Given the previous deductions, parkour must be in column 2 and rock-climbing in column 1.
* The remaining options are fantasy movies (left) and Chinese nationality (right).

Please find the final solution table below:

Lv1-6x2-6	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:


From clue 4, we know that the person eating potato is on the left of the person watching adventure movies (who is the manager, according to clue 3).


Since there are only two types of food, spinach must be eaten by the person who is not eating potato. Therefore, the person eating spinach must be the manager.


From clue 1, we know that the person whose hobby is hiking is on the left of the Polish person.


Clue 2 states that the Malaysian is on the left of the fan of hip-hop music. This means that the Polish person cannot be a fan of hip-hop music, as they are on the right side of the person with hiking as their hobby. Therefore, the Malaysian must be on the left of the Polish person.


Now we can start filling in the table:

Lv1-6x2-7	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle:


From clue 2 and 4, we know that the person on the far left is watching documentary movies and drinking almond-milk.


From clue 5, we know that the police-officer is on the far right.


From clue 3, we know that the person eating pumpkin is the police-officer, so the person on the far right eats pumpkin.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |      1      |       2        |

From clue 1, we know that there are two different favourite beverages: almond-milk and coffee. Since the person on the far left drinks almond-milk, the person on the right must drink coffee.


Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 1, we know that there are two different types of food: blueberry and pumpkin. Since the person on the far right eats pumpkin, the person on the left must eat blueberry.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |      1      |       2        |

From clue 1, we know that there are two different hobbies: cooking and filmmaking. Since the person on the far right is a police-officer, the person on the left must have one of these hobbies.


From clue 3, we know that the person eating pumpkin (police-officer) is on the far right, so the person eating blueberry (on the left) cannot be the police-officer. Also, from clue 1, we know that the owner of the hamster is on the left of the person who's hobby is filmmaking.


Let's assume the person on the left has a hobby other than filmmaking. Then, the person with the filmmaking hobby must be on the right, which would mean the person on the far right (police-officer) has the filmmaking hobby, but this contradicts our assumption.


Therefore, the person on the left must have the cooking hobby, and the person on the right (police-officer) cannot have the filmmaking hobby.


Now, let's fill in the table:

| Pet           |             |                |

From clue 1, we know that the person with the filmmaking hobby is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the person on the left has the cooking hobby and cannot have a pet other than the chinchilla (because the person on the far right is a police-officer), the person on the left must own the chinchilla.


Now, let's fill in the table:

From clue 1, we know that the person with the filmmaking hobby is on the right of the owner of the hamster. Since the person on the left owns a chinchilla and not a hamster, the person on the right must own a hamster.

Lv1-6x2-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


####################
|               |     1      |       2       |
| Beverage      |  Juice    |  Fanta       |
| Food          |  Asparagus|  Carrot      |
| Hobby         |  Card-games|  Puzzles     |
| Job           |  Designer  |  Social-worker|
| Music-Genre   |  Techno    |  Reggae      |
| Sport         |  Handball  |  Ice-hockey  |
####################


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking Fanta is the one whose hobby is Puzzles. Since the puzzle enthusiast is on the far right (clue 3), Fanta must be on the right.

Clue 1 tells us that the fan of Reggae is to the right of the Designer. This means that the Designer cannot be on the right, so they must be on the left.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of Techno eats Carrot. Since Fanta is on the right, and the person eating carrot has techno as their music genre, carrot must be on the left, and Asparagus must be on the right.

Clue 4 tells us that the person who's sport is Handball is the one eating Asparagus. This means that Handball must be on the right.

Finally, from clue 1, we know that the fan of Reggae is to the right of the Designer. Since the Designer is on the left, and Fanta (and therefore Puzzles) is on the right, Reggae must also be on the right.

The only job left for the right side is Social-worker. The remaining hobby is Card-games, which must go on the left.

Ice-hockey is the only sport left, so it goes on the right with Fanta and Puzzles."
Lv1-6x2-9	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 4, we know the chef is on the far left, so we can start by filling in that information:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Job           | Chef   |               |
| Movie-Genre   |         |               |

| Pet           |         |               |

From clue 1, we know the chef is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the chef is already on the far left, this means the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 2:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |
| Job           | Chef   |               |

| Nationality   |         |               |
| Pet           |         | Chinchilla |

From clue 3, we know the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the fan of funk. This means the person watching mystery movies must be in column 1:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |

| Nationality   |         |               |
| Pet           |         | Chinchilla |

From clue 2, we know the Nigerian is on the right of the person drinking 7up. Since there are only two columns, this means the person drinking 7up must be in column 1:


|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      | 7up     |               |

| Music-Genre   | Funk   |               |
| Nationality   |         |               |
| Pet           |         | Chinchilla |

Now we can start filling in the remaining information. The only job left is social-worker, so it must be in column 2:

Lv1-6x2-10	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1      |      2       |
| Beverage      | tea        | mirinda     |
| Food          | pineapple  | pomegranate |
| Job           | accountant | videographer|
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel | romance     |
| Music-Genre   | trance      | metal       |
| Transport     | motorbike  | bike         |
#############


Explanation:

From clue 3, we know the person drinking mirinda is on the far right, so mirinda goes in column 2.

From clue 1, we know the videographer is on the far right, so videographer goes in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike is already assigned to column 1, pomegranate must go in column 2.

Now, let's look at clue 2. The fan of metal is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies. We know the videographer (column 2) can't be a fan of time-travel movies because they are already assigned to romance (the only other movie-genre). Therefore, time-travel must go in column 1.

The remaining music-genre is trance, which goes in column 1.

Similarly, the remaining food item is pineapple, which goes in column 1.

Finally, we assign the remaining job, beverage, and transport to column 1.


Please let me know if this solution is correct!"
