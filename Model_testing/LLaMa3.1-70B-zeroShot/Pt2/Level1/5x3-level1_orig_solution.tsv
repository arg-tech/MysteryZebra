Lv1-5x3-1	"Let's analyze the clues step by step:

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is in the middle.

From clue 2, we know that the security-guard is also in the middle. Therefore, the security-guard must be driving the snowmobile.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the scooter is the teacher.

From clue 8, we know that the person watching time-travel movies is the teacher. Since the teacher is driving the scooter, they cannot be on the far right (because the fan of ambient and the person drinking iced-tea are both on the far right).

Therefore, the teacher must be in position 1.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of ambient is on the far right. From clue 7, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is also on the far right. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea and the fan of ambient are the same person.

From clue 3, we know that the journalist is the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking iced-tea is already in position 3, the journalist must be in position 2 or 1. But the teacher is already in position 1, so the journalist must be in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            | juice          | iced-tea    |
| Job           | teacher    | journalist     |             |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel|                |             |
| Music-Genre   |            |                | ambient     |
| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     |             |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the teacher is watching time-travel movies and is in position 1, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2. Therefore, the journalist is watching thriller movies.

The only movie-genre left for position 3 is action.

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            | juice          | iced-tea    |
| Job           | teacher    | journalist     |             |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel| thriller       | action      |
| Music-Genre   |            |                | ambient     |
| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     |             |

The only job left for position 3 is security-guard, but we already know that the security-guard is driving the snowmobile and is in the middle. Therefore, this must be a mistake.

Wait! We made an incorrect assumption earlier. The fan of ambient and the person drinking iced-tea are indeed the same person, but they don't have to be on the far right. They can be on any position that satisfies all the other clues.

Let's re-evaluate:

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. From clue 2, we know that the security-guard is in the middle. Therefore, the person watching thriller movies must be in position 1 or 2. But the teacher is already in position 1 and is watching time-travel movies, so the person watching thriller movies must be in position 2.

The fan of techno must be in position 3.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of ambient is on the far right. From clue 7, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is also on the far right. Therefore, the person drinking iced-tea and the fan of ambient are the same person.

The only beverage left for position 2 is juice, so the journalist must be in position 2. The security-guard must be driving the snowmobile, which leaves the airplane as the transport method for position 3.

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            | juice          | iced-tea    |
| Job           | teacher    | journalist     |             |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel| thriller       | action      |
| Music-Genre   |            |                | ambient     |
| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     | airplane    |

The only job left for position 3 is security-guard. But we already know that the security-guard is driving the snowmobile and is in the middle, so this must be a mistake.

Wait! We made another incorrect assumption earlier. The fan of ambient and the person drinking iced-tea don't have to be on the far right as long as the clues are satisfied.

Let's re-evaluate again:

The security-guard must be driving the snowmobile and is in the middle, so they must be in position 2.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the scooter is the teacher. The teacher is watching time-travel movies (clue 8), so they must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know that the journalist is the person drinking juice. Since the security-guard is already in position 2, the journalist must be in position 3.

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |                | juice        |
| Job           | teacher    | security-guard| journalist   |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel|                |              |
| Music-Genre   |            |                |              |
| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     |              |

From clue 1, we know that the fan of techno is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. The only movie-genre left for position 2 is thriller.

The only music-genre left for position 3 is pop (because ambient and techno are already taken).

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            |                | juice        |
| Job           | teacher    | security-guard| journalist   |
| Movie-Genre   | time-travel| thriller       |              |
| Music-Genre   |            | techno         | pop          |
| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     |              |

The only beverage left for position 2 is almond-milk.

From clue 6, we know that the fan of ambient is on the far right. But we already have a person in position 3. This means that the ""far right"" must be relative to the techno fan (clue 1).

Therefore, the fan of ambient is actually in position 2.

Now we have:

|               |     1      |       2        |      3      |
| Beverage      |            | almond-milk    | juice        |

| Transport     | scooter    | snowmobile     | airplane    |

The only beverage left for position 1 is iced-tea.

Finally, we have:

| Sport         | Snowboarding| Golf      | Skateboarding|
#############


Let me walk you through the steps to arrive at this solution:

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is snowboarding is on the far left. From clue 6, we also know that the librarian is on the far left. Therefore, the librarian's sport must be snowboarding.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is golf. Since the librarian (snowboarding) is already on the far left, the person with the hobby ""reading"" must be in the second column.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is skateboarding has a hobby of chess. From clue 1, we also know that the owner of the snake is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Therefore, the person with the hobby ""puzzles"" must be in the second column.

From clue 5, we know that the fan of house is on the left of the owner of the rabbit. Since the fan of electronic (rabbit) can't be on the far left (because of the librarian), the fan of house must be in the first column.

Now we have:

| Hobby         | Reading    | Puzzles   | ???        |
| Job           | Librarian | ???      | ???        |

| Pet           | ???       | Snake     | Rabbit       |
| Sport         | Snowboarding| Golf      | Skateboarding|

From clue 4, we know that the scientist is on the far right. From clue 2, we also know that the owner of the rabbit is a fan of electronic music.

Now we have:

Lv1-5x3-5	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following result:


|               |         1          |   2    |     3     |
| Food          | cabbage          | cherry | blueberry |
| Hobby         | hiking           | sudoku | reading    |
| Job           | software-developer | lawyer | scientist |
| Nationality   | brazilian        | american | dutch      |
| Transport     | motorbike       | car    | jet-ski    |


Here's how I arrived at the solution:


From clue 7, we know the person driving the motorbike is the software-developer.


From clue 3, the lawyer is on the right of the software-developer. Since the software-developer is in column 1 (driving a motorbike), the lawyer must be in column 2.


Clue 6 tells us that the person eating cherry is in the middle. Therefore, the person eating cherry is in column 2.


From clue 5, we know the brazilian is driving the jet-ski. Clue 4 says the dutch is on the left of the person eating blueberry, and since the person eating blueberry can't be in column 1 (brazilian), it must be in column 3. Therefore, the dutch is in column 2 or 1.


From clue 1, we know the scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking. If the person with the hobby hiking were in column 1, then there would be no space for the scientist (as columns 2 and 3 are already occupied by other jobs). Therefore, the person with the hobby hiking must be in column 1.


Now we can start filling out the table:


|               |         1          |   2    |     3     |
| Food          | ?                | cherry | blueberry |
| Hobby         | hiking           | sudoku | reading    |
| Job           | software-developer | lawyer | scientist |
| Nationality   | brazilian        | american | dutch      |
| Transport     | motorbike       | car    | jet-ski    |


The only food left is cabbage, so it must be in column 1.


We can now confirm that the person eating blueberry is in column 3 (as per clue 4) and their hobby is reading. The dutch is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku (clue 2), but since we already know the hobbies, this must mean the dutch is indeed in column 3.


Therefore, the final solution is:

Lv1-5x3-6	"Here's the solution:


#############
|               |     1      |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | lemonade   | coffee    | soy-milk  |
| Food          | potato     | nectarine | avocado   |
| Nationality   | american   | brazilian | egyptian  |
| Pet           | rat        | pony      | bird      |
| Transport     | subway     | skateboard| trike     |
#############


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. From clue 6, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the owner of the pony. This means the pony cannot be in column 1 (since there is no one to its left). So, the pony must be either in column 2 or 3.

2. From clue 4, we know the person eating nectarine is driving a skateboard. Since the pony is already placed in either column 2 or 3, and it can't be on the right of the subway (clue 6), the nectarine-skateboard combination must be in column 2.

3. From clue 2, we know the person drinking coffee is to the right of the brazilian. Since the pony is already placed in either column 2 or 3, and it can't be on the right of the subway (clue 6), the brazilian-coffee combination must have the brazilian in column 1 and coffee in column 3.

4. From clue 1, we know the person eating avocado is the brazilian. Since the brazilian is already placed in column 1, avocado goes with it.

5. From clue 5, we know the egyptian drinks soy-milk. Soy-milk cannot be in column 1 (already occupied by lemonade, clue 3), so the egyptian must be either in column 2 or 3. But since the brazilian is already in column 1 and coffee is in column 3, the egyptian-soy milk combination must go to column 3.

6. From clue 3, we know lemonade is in the middle (column 2). This leaves only potato for column 1.

7. The remaining pet-bird goes with the remaining person-american (in column 1).

8. Finally, from clue 7, we know the person eating potato is to the right of the owner of the rat. Since the american is already in column 1 and eating potato, the rat must be the pet of the brazilian.

9. The remaining transport-trike goes with the remaining person-american (in column 1), but since it's already occupied by subway, we know that american drives a subway.

10. This leaves only trike for column 3, which is driven by the egyptian."
Lv1-5x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled out the table with the solution:


#############
|               |      1      |      2       |     3      |
| Food          | Nectarine   | Lime         | Banana     |

| Music-Genre   | R&B         | Disco        | Metal      |
| Nationality   | Chinese     | Malaysian    | Brazilian  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:

* Clue 7 places the entrepreneur in the middle, and clue 8 places the person who's hobby is filmmaking in the middle. This means the entrepreneur must be the same person as the filmmaker.
* Clue 1 states the Brazilian is a fan of metal, so they can't be on the left (clue 5). Therefore, the Chinese is on the far left, and the Malaysian is in the middle (by process of elimination).
* Clue 6 places the fan of disco to the right of the fan of metal. Since the Brazilian is a fan of metal, this means the fan of disco must be the person in column 2 or 3.
* Clue 4 states the entrepreneur (column 2) is left of the fan of disco. This means the person in column 3 must be the fan of disco.
* Clues 2 and 3 state that the person eating banana and the card-games hobbyist are on the far right, so this is column 3.
* Clue 9 places the coach to the left of the person eating nectarine. Since the banana-eater is in column 3, the nectarine-eater must be in column 1, making them a coach.
* The remaining food (lime) and hobby (photography) are assigned by process of elimination.

Lv1-5x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Music-Genre   | Trance    | Gospel    | House      |
| Sport         | Sailing   | Cricket   | Skiing     |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know the fan of trance is on the far left, so Music-Genre for column 1 is Trance.
* Clue 4 tells us that the fan of gospel is on the right of the fan of trance, so Music-Genre for column 2 is Gospel.
* Clue 5 says the software-developer is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Since the software-developer can't be in column 1 (due to clue 7), they must be in column 3. This means Sport for column 2 is Sailing, and Job for column 3 is Software-developer.
* Clue 6 states that the person who's sport is cricket is on the left of the person eating peach. Since the peach-eater can't be in column 1 (due to clue 7), they must be in column 2. This means Sport for column 1 is Cricket, but we already determined it's Sailing. However, clue 6 also implies that the cricket-lover is on the left of the peach-eater, so Sport for column 1 must actually be Cricket. This contradicts our earlier conclusion, so let's revise: Sport for column 2 is indeed Cricket.
* Clue 3 tells us the person eating potato is watching zombie movies. Since we already have a cricket-lover in column 2, and clue 6 says they're on the left of the peach-eater, the potato-eater must be in column 1. This means Food for column 1 is Potato, and Movie-Genre for column 1 is Zombie.
* Clue 8 states that the person watching thriller movies is on the right of the entrepreneur. Since we already have a software-developer in column 3, the entrepreneur can't be there. Therefore, Job for column 2 must be Entrepreneur, which makes Movie-Genre for column 2 Thriller.
* Finally, clue 1 says the entrepreneur is on the left of the person eating peach. We already determined that the entrepreneur is in column 2, so Food for column 2 is Peach. The only remaining option is Papaya for column 3.

With these conclusions, we can fill in the rest of the table to get the final solution above."

From statement 2, we know that the person eating potato is on the far left.


From statement 3, we know that the person eating potato is the same as the person whose hobby is magic-tricks.

| Transport     |              | Tram    |             |


From statement 6, we know that the person driving the subway is on the far right.


|               |      1       |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |              | Water   |             |
| Food          | Potato      |          |             |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks| Video-Games|           |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |             |
| Transport     |              | Tram    | Subway    |


From statement 4, we know that the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of d&b.


Since the person eating potato (and doing magic-tricks) is already in position 1, and there's no space to the left of them for another food item, the person eating pumpkin must be in position 3.


|               |      1       |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      |              | Water   |             |
| Food          | Potato      |          | Pumpkin    |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks| Video-Games|           |
| Music-Genre   |              |          | D&B        |
| Transport     |              | Tram    | Subway    |


From statement 5, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.


Since the fan of d&b must be in position 2 (to satisfy the pumpkin clue), the person drinking lemonade must be in position 3.


However, wait! The person eating pumpkin is already in position 3!


So, the statement ""the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of d&b"" actually means that the fan of d&b is in position 2, and the person eating pumpkin is in position 3 (on their right).


And since the fan of d&b is in position 2, and the person drinking lemonade is to their right, it must be the case that the person drinking lemonade is not in a numbered column.


The only other beverage left is 7up, which must be in the remaining column (position 1)!


Also, from statement 5, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.


But since the person eating pumpkin is already in position 3, and the person drinking lemonade cannot be in a numbered column, it must be the case that the fan of dubstep (from statement 7) is actually in position 1!


So, we have:


|               |      1       |    2     |      3      |
| Beverage      | 7up         | Water   | Lemonade  |
| Food          | Potato      | Avocado| Pumpkin    |
| Hobby         | Magic-Tricks| Video-Games| Baking    |
| Music-Genre   | Dubstep     | D&B     |            |
| Transport     | Boat        | Tram    | Subway    |

 Wait!


From statement 7, we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of dubstep.


So, it must be the case that the fan of folk (the only remaining music genre) is actually in position 3!


And since the person eating pumpkin (in position 3) has a hobby, and baking is the only remaining hobby, it follows that the person eating pumpkin enjoys baking as their hobby!


Here's the final solution:
