Lv1-4x6-3	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |    4     |        5        |     6      |
| Hobby         |             |            |            |          |                 |            |
| Job           | Teacher     | Journalist | Engineer   | Project-Manager | Musician       | Writer      |
| Music-Genre   | Classical   | Gospel     | Soul       | Reggae    | Trance        | Hip-Hop     |
| Pet           | Dog         | Bird       | Hedgehog  | Mouse     | Rat           | Lizard      |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know that the fan of classical is on the far left.
* Clue 6 tells us that the engineer is on the right of the fan of classical, and since the teacher is on the left of the engineer (clue 16), we can place the teacher in column 1.
* From clue 5, the fan of gospel is on the left of the journalist, so the journalist must be in column 2. The person with the hobby filmmaking is on the right of the project-manager (clue 3), but since the project-manager owns the mouse (clue 13) and the fan of reggae owns the mouse (clue 4), we know that the project-manager is not in columns 1 or 2. Therefore, the journalist must be followed by the engineer.
* Clue 8 tells us that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the owner of the mouse. Since the owner of the mouse owns reggae (clue 4), we can place the fan of hip-hop in column 6.
* From clue 9, we know that the fan of soul is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games. Clue 2 tells us that the fan of trance is on the right of the journalist, and since the fan of gospel is on the left of the journalist (clue 5), we can deduce that the person with the hobby card-games must be in column 3.
* The only remaining music-genre for column 4 is reggae. Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, and since the person with the hobby puzzles owns the lizard (clue 15), we can place the owner of the hedgehog in column 3.
* From clue 11, we know that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the left of the owner of the bird. Clue 12 tells us that the fan of trance is on the left of the person who's hobby is collecting, so we can place the fan of trance in column 5. This means that the person with the hobby collecting must be in column 4.
* The only remaining job for column 6 is writer.
* Finally, clue 1 tells us that the person who's hobby is woodworking owns the rat, and since the owner of the rat must be in column 6 (because of the constraints from clues 2 and 12), we can conclude that the hobby woodworking corresponds to the job writer.

Please note that this solution assumes a left-to-right orientation for the columns.

#############

Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 17, we know the egyptian is on the left of the british.
From clue 7, we know the colombian is on the far left.
From clue 10, we know the colombian watches action movies.

From clue 9, we know the colombian owns a ferret.
From clue 15, we know the project-manager is on the right of the dressmaker. Since the colombian is already placed, this means the dressmaker must be in position 1 (colombian), and the egyptian or british could be the project-manager.

From clue 14, we know the project-manager is on the left of the person watching epic movies.
From clue 16, we know the british owns a rabbit. Since the colombian watches action movies and the colombian's pet is a ferret, this means the egyptian cannot own a rabbit (as it would conflict with clue 1). Therefore, the egyptian must be in position 2.

From clue 4, we know the owner of the rabbit (british) is on the left of the owner of the snake. From clue 13, we know the project-manager is british.

Now that we have the first three nationalities placed, let's consider the remaining clues:

From clue 12, we know the chinese is on the right of the person watching epic movies.
From clue 5, we know the person watching epic movies is on the left of the person watching sports movies.
From clue 8, we know the person watching scientific movies owns a horse.

Since the egyptian watches scientific movies (clue 2), they own a horse. From clue 1, we know the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person watching epic movies.

The only remaining spots for the chinese and pakistani are positions 4 and 6. Since clue 11 states that the pakistani is on the right of the person watching sports movies, this means the pakistani must be in position 6.

From clue 2, we know the accountant is chinese. From clue 3, we know the dancer watches romance movies.
From clue 16, we know the british owns a rabbit.
The only remaining job for the colombian is dressmaker.

Now that all jobs are assigned, let's assign pets to the remaining nationalities:

- The owner of the chinchilla must be in position 5 or 6 (clue 6), so it belongs to either the pakistani or japanese. However, since the pakistani watches sports movies and there is no information linking sports to chinchillas, we can assign the fish pet to the pakistani instead (no conflicts arise).
- The remaining pets for the colombian, egyptian, british, chinese, and japanese are ferret (colombian), horse (egyptian), rabbit (british), snake (chinese), and chinchilla or fish (japanese). Since the colombian watches action movies and has a ferret as pet, we can assign the remaining pets to their corresponding nationalities.

The final solution table is:

Lv1-4x6-5	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to fill in the table with the correct information. Here is the solution:


|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |      4      |   5    |         6          |

Here's how I solved it:


From clues 2 and 4, we know the software-developer is on the far right, and they are on the right of the person eating apple. So, the person eating apple must be in column 5.


From clue 1, we know the person driving the van is on the left of the person eating grapefruit. Since the person eating apple is already in column 5, the person eating grapefruit must be in column 2 or 3. But from clue 17, we know the firefighter (who eats strawberry) is on the right of the person eating grapefruit. So, the person eating grapefruit must be in column 2.


From clue 8, we know the fan of house is the person eating grapefruit. From clue 16, we know the fan of electronic is on the right of the teacher. And from clue 13, we know the fan of folk is on the left of the software-developer. So, the music-genres must be in this order: dubstep (column 1), house (column 2), disco (column 3), folk (column 5), ambient (column not yet determined), electronic (column 6).


From clue 10, we know the person eating nectarine is on the left of the fan of folk. Since the person eating apple is in column 5, and the fan of folk must be in column 5 or 6, the person eating nectarine must be in column 4.


From clue 15, we know the firefighter (who eats strawberry) is in column 3. From clue 17, we know they are on the right of the person eating grapefruit. And from clue 18, we know the electrician is on the left of the doctor. So, the jobs must be in this order: electrician (column 1), doctor (column 2), firefighter (column 3), manager (column not yet determined), teacher (column 5 or 6), software-developer (column 6).


From clue 14, we know the fan of ambient is the person eating nectarine. And from clue 6, we know the fan of electronic is on the left of the person driving the helicopter.


Now, we can use process of elimination to fill in the remaining blanks:


* The only job left for column 4 is manager.
* The only music-genre left for column 1 is dubstep (which matches with clue 9).
* The only food left for column 6 is strawberry (which matches with clue 15).
* The only transport left for column 6 is helicopter.

| Sport         | handball   | skateboarding| swimming | biathlon      | parkour  | sailing  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 5, we know that the person whose sport is handball is on the far left. From clue 3, we know that the analyst is the person whose sport is skateboarding.

From clue 6 and 2, we can deduce that the order of jobs from left to right is: electrician, bartender, engineer.

Clue 8 tells us that the person whose sport is skateboarding (the analyst) is also a fan of classical music. Clue 4 says that the fan of folk is on the far right, and clue 13 says that they are on the right of the person whose sport is biathlon.

Using clues 9, 1, and 16, we can determine the order of jobs from left to right: electrician (dancer), bartender, engineer (musician).

Now, let's look at the food. From clue 11, we know that cranberry is on the right of broccoli. Clue 10 says that apple is on the right of the engineer, so it must be in column 4. Clue 7 tells us that cherry is on the right of the fan of dubstep (column 1). Mango is on the left of the person whose sport is parkour (column 5).

With all these clues combined, we can fill out the rest of the table to get the final solution.

* Clue 11 places the person driving the roller to the right of the cabbage (at position 1).
* Clues 5 and 13 indicate that carrot is at position 2 and drives a roller.
* Clues 3 and 15 imply that eggplant is at position 3, with the tram driver to its left.
* Clue 4 places potato at position 4, and clue 8 reveals it's the fan of disco.
* Clue 6 puts pakistani to the left of canadian (at position 4).
* Clues 9 and 1 put avocado at position 5, with the subway driver to its right.
* Clue 16 identifies british as the scooter driver, which is now at position 2. However, clue 15 indicates that the tram driver is to the left of eggplant (position 3), so the scooter must be at a different position. Given the other clues, it's more likely that scooter is at position 6.
