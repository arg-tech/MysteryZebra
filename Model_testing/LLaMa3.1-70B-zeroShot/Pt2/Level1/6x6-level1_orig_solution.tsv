Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* First, I used clues 9 and 24 to place the person who drives the roller on the far left (1) and determine their hobby is skydiving.
* Next, I used clues 13 and 20 to place the person whose sport is skateboarding on the far left (1) and determine their sport.
* Using clue 14, I placed the person watching western movies in position 2 or 3. Clue 8 revealed that they eat cranberry, but since pumpkin must be on the right of them (clue 6), I placed them in position 5.
* Clues 10 and 16 told me that the person driving the quad-bike eats mango and watches sports movies. Since sudoku is to their left (clue 23), I placed them in position 4.
* Clue 3 placed the person whose hobby is traveling on the far right (6).
* Clues 1 and 7 revealed that the social-worker's hobby is sudoku, and they eat orange. Since the mechanic is to their left (clue 2), I placed them in positions 3-4.
* Using clue 5, I placed the person driving the airplane on the right of the person watching western movies, which put them in position 6.
* Clues 11 and 26 helped me place the person whose hobby is card-games between the person eating apple and the person driving the boat. Since the teacher eats orange (clue 7), I placed the teacher in position 3.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps, with a focus on job placement (using clues 21-22) and ensuring that each column had unique values.

Please note that this solution assumes there are no duplicate entries or contradictory clues. If you have any questions or concerns about my approach, feel free to ask!"
