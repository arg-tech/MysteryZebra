Lv1-4x5-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've constructed the solution table:


|               |      1      |     2      |      3       |      4       |     5      |
| Food          | watermelon | lettuce    | cucumber   | kiwi        | artichoke |
| Job           | scientist  | architect | dressmaker | photographer| accountant|
| Movie-Genre   | documentary| family     | adventure  | martial-arts| animation |
| Nationality   | spanish    | russian    | indonesian | mexican     | argentine |

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 4, the person watching documentary movies is on the far left. Since the person eating kiwi is also watching documentary movies (clue 8), and the Russian is eating kiwi (clue 9), we can place the Russian in column 2.
* Clue 12 tells us that the person eating lettuce is to the left of the Mexican, so we can place the Mexican in column 4. Since the Mexican watches animation movies (clue 2), we can also determine their movie genre.
* From clue 1, the photographer is to the right of the Argentine. Clue 10 places the person eating cucumber in the middle, and since the photographer is not eating cucumber, they must be in column 5. The Argentine is therefore in column 4.
* Clue 13 places the person eating watermelon to the left of the Argentine, so we can place them in column 1. Since the scientist is to the left of the person watching adventure movies (clue 7), and there's no other space available for the scientist, they must be in column 1 as well.
* Clue 6 places the dressmaker to the right of the person watching documentary movies, which means the dressmaker is in column 3. The only remaining job is the accountant, who can be placed in column 5.
* Finally, clue 11 tells us that the person eating artichoke watches martial-arts movies, and since they're not already assigned a movie genre, we can place them in column 5.

I hope this solution table meets your requirements!"

Lv1-4x5-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:


#################
|               |      1      |     2      |   3    |    4    |     5     |

| Transport     | bike        | taxi       | van    | car      | ship      |
#################


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that horror movies are on the left of country music. From clue 3, we know that gospel is paired with horror movies. So, column 3 must be horror/gospel.

Clue 2 tells us that drama is to the right of papaya. Clue 4 pairs country with drama, so column 2 must be papaya/drama/country.

From clue 5, scientific movies are to the right of pop music. Clue 9 puts pop on the left of kale, so column 3 (horror/gospel) can't be on the left of pop. Therefore, column 4 must be zucchini/pop/scientific.

Clues 7 and 8 give us car and van in columns 4 and 3, respectively. Since car is to the right of time-travel movies (clue 7), and van is in the middle (clue 8), we can place them as follows: column 1 must be bike/time-travel/techno (from clue 12).

The remaining columns fall into place:

Column 5 must be plum/superhero, since it's the only combination left.

Column 2 has taxi driving papaya/drama/country (from clue 4 and column 2 deduced above).

Column 3 is van/horror/gospel, which we established earlier.

Column 4 is car/zucchini/pop/scientific, as established from clues 5 and 9.

And finally, column 1 has lemon/time-travel/techno on the left of zucchini (clue 11), with bike being its transport mode.

Voil√†! The final solution."
Lv1-4x5-5	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 2, we know the mechanic's sport is sailing. From clue 1, we know the fan of d&b is also the person who's sport is sailing. So, the mechanic is the fan of d&b.


From clue 3, we know the security-guard is on the left of the fan of d&b (mechanic). Since the security-guard can't be in column 1 (there's no one to their left), they must be in column 2 or 3. But if they're in column 3, there wouldn't be room for someone to the right of them and the mechanic. So, the security-guard is in column 2.


From clue 4, we know the person eating potato is on the right of the person eating asparagus. From clue 10, we know the person eating potato is on the far right (column 5). Therefore, the person eating asparagus must be in column 3 or 4.


From clue 9, we know the person eating cauliflower is on the left of the fan of d&b (mechanic). Since the security-guard is already in column 2, the person eating cauliflower must be in column 1.


Now, let's look at the remaining columns. We have:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   |         | asparagus |              | potato     |
| Job           |                | security-guard|           |              |             |
| Music-Genre   |                |          |           |              |             |
| Sport         |                |          |           |              |             |


From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person eating potato. So, they must be in column 4.


We also know that the fan of d&b (mechanic) is not in column 1 or 5. Therefore, they must be in either column 2, 3, or 4. But since the security-guard is already in column 2, and we need to fit in someone eating asparagus in column 3 or 4, the mechanic (fan of d&b) must be in column 3.


Now, let's look at the remaining columns again:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   |         | asparagus |              | potato     |
| Job           |                | security-guard| mechanic |              |             |
| Music-Genre   |                |          | d&b       |              |             |
| Sport         |                |          | sailing   |              |             |


From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person eating asparagus. So, they must be in column 4.


We also know that the designer is the person who's sport is parkour (clue 6). Since there's no one left to put in column 1, the designer must be in column 1.


Now, let's look at the remaining columns again:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   |         | asparagus |              | potato     |
| Job           | designer      | security-guard| mechanic |              |             |
| Music-Genre   |                |          | d&b       |              |             |
| Sport         | parkour       |          | sailing   | water-polo  |             |


From clue 11, we know the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the fan of funk. Since there's no one left to put in column 2 or 4, the fan of funk must be in column 1 (but that's already taken by the designer) or column 3 (but that's already taken by the mechanic). So, the person eating pumpkin must be in either column 2 or 5. But since the potato is already in column 5, the person eating pumpkin must be in column 2.


Now, let's look at the remaining columns again:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   | pumpkin  | asparagus |              | potato     |
| Job           | designer      | security-guard| mechanic |              |             |
| Music-Genre   | funk          |          | d&b       |              |             |
| Sport         | parkour       |          | sailing   | water-polo  |             |


From clue 8, we know the fan of rock is in the middle (column 3). But that's already taken by the mechanic. So, the fan of rock must be in column 2 or 4.


However, from clue 7, we know the fan of country is on the right of the photographer. Since there's no one left to put in column 2 or 4, the photographer must be in column 1 (but that's already taken by the designer) or column 3 (but that's already taken by the mechanic). So, the fan of country must be in either column 2 (but that's already taken by the person eating pumpkin), column 4, or column 5. But since the potato is already in column 5, the photographer and the fan of country must be in columns 3 and 4 respectively.


Wait, what? That can't be right!


Let me rethink this... 


 Ah-ha! I've got it!

However, from clue 7, we know the fan of country is on the right of the photographer. Since there's no one left to put in column 1 or 5, the photographer and the fan of country must be in columns 2 and 3 respectively (no, wait...), or columns 3 and 4 (but that would mean the mechanic is not in column 3, which we already established), or columns 4 and 5. But since the potato is already in column 5, the photographer and the fan of country must be in either columns 2 and 3 respectively (no...), or columns 3 and 4.


Hmm...


Let me rethink this again...

From clue 7, we know the fan of country is on the right of the photographer. Since there's no one left to put in column 1 or 5, the photographer must be in either column 2, 3, or 4.


If the photographer is in column 2, then the fan of country would be in column 3 (but that's already taken by the mechanic), so that can't be right.


If the photographer is in column 3, then the fan of country would be in column 4. But then where would the skiing person go?


Hmm...


 Ah-ha! I've got it!


The skiing person must be the firefighter!


From clue 12, we know the person who's sport is skiing is on the left of the person eating potato. So, they must be in column 4.


Now, let's look at the remaining columns again:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   | pumpkin  | asparagus |              | potato     |
| Job           | designer      | security-guard| mechanic | firefighter|             |
| Music-Genre   | funk          |          | d&b       |              |             |
| Sport         | parkour       |          | sailing   | skiing     |             |


From clue 7, we know the fan of country is on the right of the photographer. Since there's no one left to put in column 1 or 5, and the skiing person is already in column 4, the photographer must be in either column 2.


So, the photographer is in column 2!


The fan of country must be in column 3, but that's already taken by the mechanic. However, we can swap the positions of the fan of rock (who is still not assigned) and the mechanic!


Now, let's look at the remaining columns again:


|               |       1        |    2     |     3     |      4       |      5      |
| Food          | cauliflower   | pumpkin  | nectarine |              | potato     |

Lv1-4x5-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |     5     |

| Transport     | Train      | Airplane | Boat       | Tram        | Trike      |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the person eating raspberry is in the middle (column 3).
* Clue 7 tells us the Dutch is also in the middle, so they must be eating the raspberry.
* Clue 10 states the Egyptian is on the right of the person eating raspberry, which places them in column 4.
* Clue 6 says the Egyptian is on the left of the person driving the airplane, but we already know the Dutch (in column 3) can't be driving an airplane. So, the airplane must be driven by someone in column 2.
* Clue 8 indicates the person eating lettuce is on the left of the pilot. Since the pilot is in column 4 (to the right of the Egyptian), the person eating lettuce must be in column 1 or 2.
* However, clue 9 says the person driving the boat is on the left of the engineer. If the engineer were in column 2, there would be no one to their left. Therefore, the engineer can't be in column 2, and the pilot (also from clue 8) must be in column 4.
* The rest of the clues fall into place:
	+ Clue 1: The pilot is on the right of the person eating banana, so the person eating banana is in column 3 or 5. But since column 3 has raspberry, and column 5 has cherry (clue 11), banana must be in column 4.
	+ Clue 2: The freelancer drives the train, which must be in column 1 (since train is not driven by anyone else).
	+ Clue 13: Artichoke is on the right of the train driver, so it's in column 2 or 3. But since column 3 has raspberry, artichoke must be in column 1.
* With all the other clues considered, this arrangement becomes the only possible solution.

Lv1-4x5-8	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table.


From clue 3, the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left.

|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |

| Pet           |            |            |         |               |          |
| Sport         | baseball   |            |         |               |          |

From clue 1, the person who's sport is baseball drinks 7up.

|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |

| Pet           |            |            |         |               |          |
| Sport         | baseball   |            |         |               |          |

From clue 9, the german is the person who's sport is cricket.

From clue 14, the person who's sport is skateboarding is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.

Since the turkish is in the middle (clue 10), we can start filling in the nationalities.

|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      | 7up        |            |         |               |          |
| Nationality   |            | turkish    | german  |               |          |
| Pet           |            |            |         |               |          |
| Sport         | baseball   |            | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 2, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the american.

Since the american can't be on the far left (baseball), they must be in position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 2, the person drinking coffee would be in position 3, which is already occupied by the german. So, the american must be in position 1.


However, this contradicts our current table, so let's correct that:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         |               |          |
| Nationality   | american   | turkish    | german  |               |          |
| Pet           |            |            |         |               |          |
| Sport         | baseball   | skateboarding| cricket |       |          |

Now, we can fill in the sport for position 1.


From clue 8, the person who's sport is basketball is on the left of the person drinking coffee.

Since the german drinks coffee (clue 2), the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 3 or to the left. However, position 3 is already occupied by the german, so the person who's sport is basketball can't be on the left of the german. Therefore, the person who's sport is basketball must be in position 2.


From clue 4, the german is on the right of the nigerian.

So, the nigerian must be in position 1 or to the left of the german. But we already have someone in position 1 (the american), and the german can't be in position 1. Therefore, the nigerian must be in position 2.


However, this contradicts our current table again, so let's correct that:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         |               |          |
| Nationality   | american   | nigerian   | german  | turkish       | egyptian |
| Pet           |            |            |         |               |          |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 5, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking fanta.

Since we already have a lot of information filled in, let's focus on the remaining clues.


From clue 6, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the owner of the hamster.

From clue 7, the owner of the hamster is on the far right.

So, the person drinking fanta must be in position 4.


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         | fanta        |          |

| Pet           |            |            |         |               | hamster  |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 13, the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person who's sport is cricket.

This means the german must drink coffee.


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         | fanta        |          |

| Pet           |            |            |         |               | hamster  |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 1, the person who's sport is baseball drinks 7up.


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      | 7up        |            |         | fanta        |          |

| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 5, the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person drinking fanta.


So, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 5.


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      | 7up        |            |         | fanta        | lemonade |
| Nationality   | american   | nigerian   | german  | turkish       | egyptian |
| Pet           |            |            |         |               | hamster  |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 11, the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the turkish.


So, the owner of the goldfish must be in position 3 or to the left. However, the german is already in position 3, so the owner of the goldfish must be in position 2 or to the left of the turkish.


However, this contradicts our current table again, so let's correct that:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         | fanta        | lemonade |
| Nationality   | american   | nigerian   | german  | turkish       | egyptian |
| Pet           | goldfish   |            |         |               | hamster  |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 9, the person who's sport is not yet filled in must be on the left of the german.


However, this contradicts our current table again, so let's correct that:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |
| Beverage      |            |            |         | fanta        | lemonade |
| Nationality   | american   | nigerian   | german  | turkish       | egyptian |
| Pet           | goldfish   | snake      | ferret  |               | hamster  |
| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

From clue 12, the person who's sport is not yet filled in must be on the left of the german.


However, this contradicts our current table again, so let's correct that:


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |

| Sport         | baseball   | basketball | cricket | skateboarding |          |

We can finally fill in the remaining beverage for position 3.


The german drinks coffee.


The nigerian must drink iced tea.


|               |     1      |     2      |    3    |       4       |    5     |

Lv1-4x5-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1      |     2      |     3      |      4       |     5      |
| Beverage      | water       | iced-tea   | tea        | 7up          | juice      |
| Hobby         | woodworking | filmmaking | gardening  | magic-tricks | card-games |
| Music-Genre   | electronic  | soul       | country    | folk         | r&b        |
| Transport     | airplane    | scooter    | skateboard | bike         | quad-bike  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 9, the person with woodworking as their hobby is on the far left (column 1).
* From clue 4, the person with woodworking as their hobby also drives an airplane.
* From clue 6, the fan of electronic music drives an airplane, so they must be in column 1.
* From clue 7, the person drinking water is the fan of electronic, so they must also be in column 1.
* From clue 2, the person who's hobby is filmmaking drinks iced-tea and must be in column 2.
* From clue 10, the person driving a quad-bike drinks juice and must be in column 5.
* From clue 13, the person driving a bike is on the left of the person driving a quad-bike, so they must be in column 4.
* From clue 12, the person driving a scooter is on the right of the person with woodworking as their hobby, so they must be in column 2 or 3. But since the person with filmmaking as their hobby is already in column 2, the scooter driver must be in column 3.
* From clue 14, the person drinking tea is on the right of the person driving a scooter, so they must be in column 4 (but we already have the bike driver there), or in column 1 or 2. But since columns 1 and 2 are already occupied, the tea drinker must actually be in column 3.
* From clue 11, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is the fan of folk music and must be on the right of the person driving a skateboard (clue 8). Since the scooter driver is in column 3, the skateboard driver must be in column 2 or 4. But we already have the filmmaking/iced-tea person in column 2, so the skateboard driver must be in column 4.
* From clue 5, the fan of r&b music is on the right of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the magic-tricks person is in column 3 (based on previous deductions), the r&b fan must be in column 4 or 5. But we already have the bike driver and quad-bike drinker in those columns, so the r&b fan must actually be in column 4.
* From clue 1, the fan of soul music has gardening as their hobby, which means they can't be in column 3 (since that's the magic-tricks person). Therefore, the soul fan must be in column 2, and the country fan must be in column 5 (based on clue 3).
* From clue 8, the skateboard driver is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since the magic-tricks person is in column 3, the skateboard driver must actually be in column 2.

And that's it! The final solution table should match the one above."
Lv1-4x5-10	"Here's my attempt to solve the puzzle:


|               |     1     |    2     |     3     |    4    |    5    |
| Food          | cranberry |  peas    |  pumpkin  |  onion   | cabbage |
| Movie-Genre   | romance   | fantasy  | mystery   | disaster | drama   |
| Nationality   | british   | dutch    | italian   | pakistani| russian |
| Transport     | bus       | tram     | boat      | jet-ski  | taxi    |

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 4 and 11, we know that cranberry and romance are on the far left. We also know from clue 1 that cabbage is on the far right.

Clue 5 tells us that dutch watches fantasy movies, so dutch can't be on the far left (since romance is already there) or far right (since cabbage is already there). Therefore, dutch must be in either position 2 or 4. 

From clue 3, we know that peas are to the left of dutch. Since dutch can only be in positions 2 or 4, peas must be in either position 1 or 3.

But wait! We already have cranberry in position 1 (from clues 4 and 11). Therefore, peas must be in position 3, which means dutch is in position 2.

Clue 8 tells us that italian eats pumpkin. Italian can't be on the far left (since cranberry is there) or far right (since cabbage is already there), so italian must be either position 2, 3, or 4. But we already have dutch in position 2 and peas in position 3. Therefore, italian must be in position 4.

From clue 10, pakistani drives the jet-ski, which is on the right of the person driving the bus (clue 7). Since there's no room for a bus between pakistani and the far right, pakistani must be in either position 3 or 4. But we already have peas in position 3 and italian can't drive the jet-ski (since they eat pumpkin), so pakistani must be in position 4... wait! Italian is already there!

This means that our previous assumption about italian being in position 4 was incorrect. We need to re-evaluate the positions.

Let's try again: From clue 8, italian eats pumpkin. Since italian can't be on the far left or right, and peas are in position 3 (left of dutch), italian must be either position 2 or 4. But dutch is already in position 2! Therefore, italian must eat pumpkin in position 5... no! Italian must be in either position 2 or 3.

Wait a minute... What if italian eats pumpkin in position 3? This would put peas to the left of dutch (clue 3), which means peas are in position 1... no!

Italian eating pumpkin in position 3 also means that dutch is not in position 2. From clue 5, we know that dutch watches fantasy movies, so dutch must be either position 4 or 5 (since peas can't watch fantasy).

Clue 13 tells us that disaster movies are to the left of the pakistani driving the jet-ski. Since pakistani is not on the far right, disaster movies must be in position 3.

From clue 7, we know that boat is to the right of bus. Clue 2 tells us that onion eats tram, so boat can't be in positions 1 or 5 (far left and right). This means that bus must be either position 1 or 4.

But wait! Cranberry is already on the far left (clues 4 and 11), which means romance movies are also there. Since disaster movies are in position 3, mystery movies can't be there. From clue 6, we know that cabbage eats drama movies, so mystery movies must be either position 2 or 5.

Clue 1 tells us that cabbage is on the far right (position 5). Clue 9 says taxi is on the far right... which means russian drives taxi! 

Clue 12 confirms this: russian drives the taxi. So we know that cabbage eats drama movies in position 5, and russian drives taxi.

From clue 6, disaster movies are to the left of jet-ski (driven by pakistani). Since mystery movies can't be in position 3 (disaster is there), mystery movies must be either position 2 or 4. But dutch watches fantasy movies! 

Since dutch can only watch fantasy movies in positions 2 or 4, we know that dutch watches fantasy movies in position 2.

From clue 8, italian eats pumpkin. Since peas are to the left of dutch (clue 3), italian must eat pumpkin in position... 3! No!

Italian eating pumpkin means that onion can't be there. Clue 2 says onion eats tram, which is either position 1 or 4.

Now we have a bus-tram-boat configuration: bus must drive the person watching mystery movies (either dutch or italian can't), and boat must be driven by someone who's not on the far left or right. Bus can't be in position 5 (cabbage is there). 

Therefore, bus drives someone who watches romance movies (position 1).

Here's our final solution:
