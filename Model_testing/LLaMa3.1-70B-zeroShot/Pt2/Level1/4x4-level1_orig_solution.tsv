Lv1-4x4-1	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 1, we know the photographer's hobby is board-games.
From clue 7, we know the photographer owns a cat.

So, we can start filling in some information:


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  |          |         |            |
| Job           | photographer |          |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |            |
| Pet           | cat          |          |         |            |

From clue 4, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the photographer.
So, the person who's hobby is fishing must be in column 3.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  |          | fishing |            |
| Job           | photographer |          |         |            |
| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |            |
| Pet           | cat          |          |         |            |

From clue 9, we know the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the owner of the frog.
So, the owner of the frog must be in column 4.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  |          | fishing |            |

| Music-Genre   |              |          |         |            |
| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 8, we know the fan of house is on the right of the owner of the frog.
But since there's no column to the right of column 4, this must mean that the fan of house is in column 3 or 2. However, from clue 6, we know the fan of country is on the left of the fan of house, so they cannot be in the same column as the frog (column 4). Therefore, the fan of house must be in column 2.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  |          | fishing |            |

| Music-Genre   |              | house    |         |            |
| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 6, we know the fan of country is on the left of the fan of house.
So, the fan of country must be in column 1.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  |          | fishing |            |

| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 5, we know the scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
This means that the person who's hobby is camping must be in column 1 or 2. However, from the information we already have, the only available spot for the person who's hobby is camping is column 2.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  | camping  | fishing |            |

| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 5, we know the scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
So, the scientist must be in column 3 or 4. However, from the information we already have, the only available spot for the scientist is column 4.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Hobby         | board-games  | camping  | fishing |            |

| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 3, we know the fan of r&b is the designer.
We can now try to find a spot for the designer. The only available spot for the designer is column 2.


However, from the information we already have, this would mean that the person who's hobby is camping is also the designer and the fan of house. This would be a contradiction since we know that the fan of country (column 1) is on the left of the fan of house (column 2). Therefore, our previous assumption about the person who's hobby is camping must have been incorrect.


Let's go back to clue 5: ""the scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping"".
We can now see that this means that the person who's hobby is camping must be in column 3.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |

| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 5, we know the scientist is on the right of the person who's hobby is camping.
So, the scientist must be in column 4.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |

| Pet           | cat          |          |         | frog       |

From clue 8, we know the fan of house is on the right of the owner of the frog.
This means that the owner of the frog cannot be in column 4.


Let's go back to clue 9: ""the person who's hobby is fishing is on the left of the owner of the frog"".
We can now see that this means that the owner of the frog must be in column 2 or 3. However, from the information we already have, the only available spot for the owner of the frog is column 2.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |

| Pet           | cat          | frog     |         |            |

From clue 3, we know the fan of r&b is the designer.
We can now try to find a spot for the designer. The only available spot for the designer is column 1.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |

| Pet           | cat          | frog     |         |            |

From clue 2, we know the fan of trance is on the left of the owner of the fish.
This means that the owner of the fish must be in column 3 or 4.


However, from the information we already have, this would mean that the person who's hobby is camping (column 3) is also the owner of the fish. But we know that the person who's hobby is fishing (column 3) is on the left of the owner of the frog (column 2), and we also know that the fan of trance (column ?) is on the left of the owner of the fish.


This means that column 1 must be the fan of trance, and column 3 must be the person who's hobby is fishing.


|               |      1       |    2     |    3    |     4      |

| Pet           | cat          | frog     | fish    |            |

We can now fill in the last spot.

Lv1-4x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | sprite     | cola       | iced-tea | tea        |
| Food          | papaya     | kiwi       | orange   | broccoli  |
| Music-Genre   | indie      | folk       | soul     | dubstep   |
| Sport         | volleyball | water-polo | baseball | ice-hockey|

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul is also a fan of baseball.
* Clue 5 tells us that the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of dubstep. Since there are only four positions, this means that the fan of soul must be in position 3 and the fan of dubstep must be in position 4.
* Clue 9 states that the person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo. This means that baseball (soul) must be in position 3, and water-polo must be in position 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person eating broccoli is on the far right, so broccoli must be in position 4.
* From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person drinking cola. This means that volleyball must be in position 1, and cola must be in position 2 or 3. However, since water-polo is already in position 2, cola must be in position 3. But wait! We already have baseball (soul) in position 3. So, this means that cola must actually be in position 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that the fan of folk is on the left of the person drinking iced-tea. Since folk can't be in position 1 (volleyball), it must be in position 2 or 3. However, since cola is already in position 2, folk must be in position 1 or 3. But we already have volleyball in position 1, so folk must actually be in position 3. No, wait! We already have baseball (soul) in position 3. So, this means that iced-tea must actually be in a later position, and folk is not in position 2 or 3. Therefore, folk must be in position 1.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking sprite is the fan of indie. Since indie can't be in position 4 (dubstep), it must be in one of the earlier positions. Given the constraints above, indie must actually be in position 1.
* From clue 3, we know that the person eating orange is on the right of the person drinking cola. This means that orange must be in position 3 or 4. However, since broccoli is already in position 4, and baseball (soul) is already in position 3, orange must actually be in a later column of the food row than we previously thought.
* Clue 4 tells us that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the left of the person eating kiwi. Since volleyball is already in position 1, kiwi must be in position 2 or later. However, since cola (and folk) is already in position 2, and baseball (soul) is already in position 3, kiwi must actually be in a later column of the food row than we previously thought.
* Now that we have most of the positions filled in, we can make some educated guesses to fill in the remaining blanks. Given the constraints above, papaya must be in position 1 (food), and tea must be in position 4 (beverage).

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like more clarification on any of the steps."

| Pet           | mouse         | hedgehog    | lizard     | pony        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person drinking tea is the owner of the pony. From clue 2, we know mirinda is on the far right. Clue 3 tells us that musical movies are also on the far right, so columns 3 and 4 must be swapped.

Clue 4 gives us the relative positions of mouse and hedgehog owners. Clue 5 tells us 7up is to the right of adventure movies. Clue 6 gives us the order of adventure and horror movies. Clue 7 places the electrician relative to horror movies.

Now, we can start filling in the table:

* Column 4: mirinda (clue 2) and musical movies (clue 3)
* Column 1-3: from clue 6, adventure movies must be on the left of horror movies. From clue 5, 7up is to the right of adventure movies.
* Column 1: mouse owner (clue 4)
* Column 2: hedgehog owner
* Column 3: tea and pony owner (clue 1)

The jobs can now be filled in using clues 8 and 10.

Lv1-4x4-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


#################

|               |     1      |     2      |     3     |      4      |
| Job           | Bartender  | Scientist | Firefighter| Engineer    |
| Music-Genre   | Electronic | Funk       | D&B        | Ambient     |
| Nationality   | Thai       | Dutch      | Turkish    | Australian  |
| Pet           | Ferret     | Cat        | Guinea-pig | Horse       |

#################


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

From clue 1, we know that the Thai is on the left of the bartender. So, the Thai must be in position 1.

Clue 7 tells us that the scientist is on the right of the bartender. This means the scientist must be in position 2 or 3. But from clue 4, we know that the scientist is on the left of the owner of the cat, so the scientist can't be in position 3 (since there would be no one to the right). Therefore, the scientist is in position 2.

Clue 8 tells us that the Australian is on the far right, which means they must be in position 4.

From clue 9, we know that the Turkish person owns a guinea-pig. Since the Thai is already in position 1, and the Australian is in position 4, the Turkish person can only be in position 3.

Clue 6 tells us that the fan of funk is on the right of the engineer. Since the scientist (in position 2) can't be a fan of funk (because they're not to the right of the engineer), and the Australian (in position 4) can't be a fan of funk either, we conclude that the firefighter (in position 3) is not the fan of funk. This means that the firefighter must be in position 3, which also satisfies clue 2.

The only remaining job is the bartender's, which goes to position 1.

Now, let's fill in the music genres:

From clue 5, we know that the fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of D&B. Since the fan of ambient is on the far right (clue 3), and the Australian is already there, the fan of ambient must be in position 4.

Clue 6 tells us that the fan of funk is on the right of the engineer. The only remaining person who can be a fan of funk is the Dutch person (in position 2).

The fan of D&B must be to the left of the fan of ambient, so they're in position 3.

Finally, we fill in the music genres for positions 1 and 2: electronic and funk, respectively.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed explanation!"

| Sport         | biathlon | handball   | basketball    | cycling      |
#############


Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 3, we know that biathlon is on the far left (1).
From clue 1, we know that spy movies are also on the far left (1), which matches with the teacher.

Clue 6 tells us that handball is Thai, and from clue 5, we know that Turkish is to the right of handball. This means that Thai must be in position 2.

From clue 4, Indian is to the left of French, so Indian must be in position 1 (we already knew this) and French in position 3.

Clue 7 tells us that French is to the left of drama movies, which puts drama movies in position 3. Clue 9 then places the teacher on the left of drama movies, but we already knew that teacher was in position 1.

From clue 2, basketball is to the right of analyst, so analyst must be in either position 1 or 2. Since position 1 is taken by teacher and Thai (handball) is in position 2, analyst must be in position 3. But we already knew that drama movies were in position 3, so this means that social-worker (from clue 8) must be in position 4.

The remaining positions can now be filled:

- Romance movies are with the person to the left of social-worker (clue 8), which is analyst.
- Superhero movies are with videographer.
- Cycling sport is with the only remaining person, videographer."

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 9, we know the doctor is on the far left. Clue 7 tells us the owner of the mouse is to the right of the doctor, so the pet for column 1 must be the mouse.

Clue 8 states that the person watching fantasy movies is to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the accountant watches fantasy movies (clue 3), and the writer watches scientific movies (clue 5), we can conclude that the writer is in column 2 or 3, and the accountant is in column 2.

From clue 6, we know the person eating orange is to the left of the person eating blueberry. Clue 1 states that the person eating orange watches fantasy movies, so this must be the accountant in column 2. The pet for column 2 cannot be the mouse (already taken), horse, or fish (clue 10), so it must be a frog.

Now we know the accountant eats oranges and watches fantasy movies. Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the horse is the person eating banana, which means the person in column 4 eats bananas.

Clue 2 states that the person eating banana watches mystery movies. We've already established that the person in column 4 eats bananas, so they must watch mystery movies.

The only remaining food is pomegranate, which must be eaten by the doctor in column 1. The only remaining job is dancer, which must be assigned to the person in column 4 (who eats bananas).

Finally, clue 10 states that the owner of the fish is to the left of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating blueberry is in column 3, the owner of the fish must be in column 2 or 1. However, the pet for column 2 is already assigned to a frog, so the owner of the fish must be in column 3.

This completes the solution!"
Lv1-4x4-7	"Let's break down the clues and start filling in the table.

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking coffee is on the far left. Clue 9 tells us that this person is also on the left of the person drinking fanta. So, the first two columns are:

|             |   1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta      |

Now, let's look at clue 10. The person driving the airplane is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the person driving the scooter is also the owner of the bird (clue 7), we can infer that the person driving the airplane must be in column 1. Clue 2 tells us that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta, so the person driving the taxi cannot be in column 1. Therefore, the person driving the airplane is in column 1.

|             |   1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta      |
| Transport   | Airplane |           |

Now, let's look at clue 7 again. The owner of the bird is also the person driving the scooter. Clue 5 tells us that the person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the owner of the pony. Clue 1 tells us that the owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is cooking. Therefore, we can conclude that the owner of the pony is in column 2.

|             |   1    |     2     |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta      |
| Transport   | Airplane |           |
| Pet         | Bird    | Pony       |

Now, let's look at clue 3. The person drinking iced-tea is on the right of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Clue 6 tells us that the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Therefore, we can conclude that the person drinking iced-tea must be in column 4.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |
| Beverage    | Coffee | Fanta      |           | Iced-Tea |

Now, let's look at clue 4. The owner of the frog is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. Clue 6 tells us that the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. Therefore, we can conclude that the owner of the frog must be in column 2 or 3.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |

| Pet         | Bird    | Pony/Frog | Frog/Pony   |

Now, let's look at clue 5 again. The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the owner of the pony. We already know that the person who's hobby is cooking is the owner of the bird. Therefore, we can conclude that the owner of the frog must be in column 3.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |

| Pet         | Bird    | Pony       | Frog        |

Now, let's look at clue 2 again. The person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking fanta. We already know that the person driving the airplane is in column 1, and the person driving the scooter is the owner of the bird. Therefore, we can conclude that the person driving the taxi must be in column 3.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |

| Transport   | Airplane | Scooter    | Taxi        |
| Pet         | Bird    | Pony       | Frog        |

Now, let's look at clue 6 again. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the left of the person who's hobby is woodworking. We already know that the person drinking iced-tea is in column 4. Therefore, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in column 3.

| Hobby       |          |            | Sudoku     |

Now, let's look at clue 1 again. The owner of the bird is the person who's hobby is cooking. We already know that the owner of the bird is in column 1.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |

| Hobby       | Cooking |            | Sudoku     |

The only beverage left is Mirinda, which must be in column 3. The person who's hobby is baking must be in column 2.

|             |   1    |     2     |      3      |    4    |

From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing drinks tea. Since the person drinking coffee is on the far left (clue 3), and the person drinking lemonade has a hobby of video-games (clue 4), which is not rock-climbing, the only position for the person drinking tea is in column 2.

| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  |          |             |
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian |          |             |
| Sport         |            |               | Biathlon |             |

From clue 9, the argentine is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. This means that the person with volleyball as their sport must be in column 3 or to the left of the argentine.


However, since we've already placed biathlon in column 3, and the egyptian is also there (from clue 5), it means that volleyball cannot be in column 3. Therefore, volleyball must be in a column to the left of the argentine, which can only be column 2 or 1. Since rock-climbing is already in column 2, volleyball must be in column 4 or 1.


However, coffee is already in column 1 (clue 3), so volleyball cannot be there. Therefore, volleyball must be in column 4.


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         |          |             |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  |          |             |
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian | Argentine  |             |
| Sport         |            |               | Biathlon | Volleyball |

From clue 2, the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since we've already placed biathlon and volleyball in columns 3 and 4, respectively, this means that badminton must be in column 1 or 2.


However, coffee is already in column 1 (clue 3), so badminton cannot be there. Therefore, badminton must be in column 2.


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         |          |             |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  |          |             |
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian | Argentine  |             |
| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

Now we know the person who's hobby is rock-climbing drinks tea (clue 8) and has badminton as their sport in column 2. Therefore, the person with drawing as their hobby must be to the right of badminton.


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         |          |             |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  | Drawing  |             |
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian | Argentine  |             |
| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

From clue 7, the malaysian is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing.


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         |          |             |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  | Drawing  |             |
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian | Argentine  | Malaysian|
| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

From clue 1, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person drinking juice. Since lemonade is already taken by video-games (clue 4), this means that the person drinking juice must be in column 3 or to the left of the person with video-games.


However, since we've already placed drawing and biathlon in columns 3, the only place for juice is in column 1. But coffee is already there (clue 3). Therefore, juice cannot be in column 1. The only other possibility is that juice is not a beverage in this table, which means it must be lemonade's counterpart.


Since lemonade is already taken by video-games (clue 4), and the person drinking coffee is on the far left (clue 3), the only place for video-games (which drinks lemonade) is in column 4. This also satisfies clue 1 since juice cannot be a beverage in this table.


|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         | Juice   | Lemonade |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  | Drawing  | Video-Games|
| Nationality   |            |              Egyptian | Argentine  | Malaysian|
| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

The only nationality left is indian. We can place it in column 1.

| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         | Juice   | Lemonade |
| Hobby         |            | Rock-Climb  | Drawing  | Video-Games|

| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

Finally, the only hobby left is traveling. We can place it in column 1.

|               |     1      |       2       |    3     |      4      |
| Beverage      | Coffee    | Tea         | Juice   | Lemonade |
| Hobby         | Traveling | Rock-Climb  | Drawing  | Video-Games|
| Nationality   | Indian    |              Egyptian | Argentine  | Malaysian|
| Sport         |            | Badminton   | Biathlon | Volleyball |

The only sport left is sailing, but there's no column for it. However, we can deduce that the person in column 1 has sailing as their sport since badminton is already taken by column 2.
