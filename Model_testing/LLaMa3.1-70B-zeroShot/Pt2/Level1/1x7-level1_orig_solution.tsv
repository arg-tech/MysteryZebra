Lv1-1x7-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know the teacher is in column 7.

From clue 2, we know the analyst is in column 1.

From clue 3, we know the manager is to the right of the analyst.

From clue 4, we know the entrepreneur is to the right of the manager.

So far, we have:


|       |    1    |    2    |      3       |   4   |     5     |   6    |    7    |
| Job   | analyst | manager | entrepreneur |       |           |        | teacher |

From clue 5, we know the librarian is to the right of the nurse.

From clue 6, we know the doctor is to the left of the teacher.


Considering all the clues, we can deduce:


* The nurse must be in column 4 or 5 (since the librarian needs to be on its right).
* The doctor must be in column 6.
* The librarian must be in column 5.

So, the final solution is:

Lv1-1x7-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution for the logic puzzle:


#############
| Hobby   | Woodworking  | Card-games  | Drawing  | Rock-climbing | Board-games | Sudoku    | Fishing |
|         |               |             |        |         |             |            |         |

Here's how each clue led to the final solution:

1. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   -> This tells us that Card-games can't be in the last position (since Fishing needs to be to its right).

2. The person who's hobby is drawing is in the middle.
   -> There are 7 positions, so the middle one must be position 4 or 3/4. Since it's more likely to be a single position, I'll assume it's position 4.

3. The person who's hobby is fishing is on the far right.
   -> This confirms that Fishing goes in the last position (7).

4. The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
   -> Woodworking must be to the left of Card-games.

5. The person who's hobby is board-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is rock-climbing.
   -> This pair can go in positions 4-6 or 5-7, but since Drawing occupies position 4, they'll fit better in positions 5 and 6.

6. The person who's hobby is sudoku is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.
   -> Sudoku must be to the right of Board-games, which puts it in position 7 if we were considering the 4-6 or 5-7 spots for Board-games and Rock-climbing. However, since Fishing occupies position 7, Sudoku will have to go in a different spot (position 6), forcing Board-games into position 5.

Considering all these clues together led me to this final arrangement:


#############
| Hobby   | Woodworking  | Card-games  | Drawing  | Rock-climbing | Board-games | Sudoku    | Fishing |

| Nationality   | Spanish |          |            |         |          | Italian | Mexican |

From clue 2, we know the Egyptian person is on the left of the Australian:
Since there are no restrictions on the Canadian and British persons yet, let's place them temporarily. We'll remove them later if needed.

| Nationality   | Spanish | Canadian | Egyptian  | British | Australian| Italian | Mexican |

From clue 5, we know the British person is in the middle. Since there are an odd number of positions (7), the middle position must be either 4 or a bit to the left/right of it.

Considering the other clues and the restrictions, let's try placing the British person at position 4:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7    |
| Nationality   | Spanish | Canadian | Egyptian  | British | Australian| Italian | Mexican |

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions. The only one left is the position between the Egyptian and the British.
We can't place the Canadian there because then the Canadian would be to the right of the Egyptian, but we need the Australian to be to the right of the Egyptian.

So, we'll place the Australian at position 5:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7    |
| Nationality   | Spanish | Canadian | Egyptian  | British | Australian| Italian | Mexican |

Now, let's place the Canadian at position 2:
|               |    1    |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7    |

From clue 1, we know the person with photography is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. This means writing must be in position 2 or later.

Lv1-1x7-7	"Based on the given clues, here's the step-by-step solution:

From clue 3, we know that grapes are on the far left:

From clue 5, we know that lemon is on the right of lettuce. Since pepper is in the middle (clue 6), and lemon is on the left of pepper (clue 2), we can place lettuce, lemon, and pepper:
|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |   4    |   5   |   6    |     7      |
| Food   | grapes | lettuce | lemon | pepper |       |        |            |

From clue 4, we know that apple is on the left of banana. We also know that grapefruit is on the right of banana (clue 1). Since there are only two spots remaining on the right side, banana must be in spot 5 or 6. If banana were in spot 6, grapefruit would have to be in spot 7, but we don't have enough room for apple. Therefore, banana is in spot 5, and grapefruit is in spot 6:
|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |   4    |   5   |   6    |     7      |
| Food   | grapes | lettuce | lemon | pepper | banana | grapefruit | apple |

Wait, no! Apple can't be in spot 7. From clue 4, we know that apple is on the left of banana. Therefore, apple must be in spot 2:
|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |   4    |   5   |   6    |     7      |
| Food   | grapes | apple   | lettuce | pepper | banana | grapefruit |            |

The only food left is the one that can go in spot 7, which is the one that wasn't mentioned in any other clue: none! Just kidding, it's lettuce... no, wait, that was already placed. It's actually the remaining fruit that wasn't eaten by anyone else: the solution doesn't make sense without this last piece of food being placed. Given all the previous clues and placements, there is only one logical placement for our final food item.

|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |   4    |   5   |   6    |     7      |
| Food   | grapes | apple   | lettuce | pepper | banana | grapefruit |            |

We already had the person eating lemon on the right of the person eating lettuce; however, this does not make sense with the final placement (given that lettuce would have to be in spot #3). Let's try the other way around and place our last food item:

|        |   1    |    2    |   3   |   4    |   5   |   6    |     7      |

Lv1-1x7-8	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the order as follows:


From clue 2, we know that Sports is in the middle, so it must be at position 4.

From clue 4, Horror is to the right of Sports, so it must be at position 5.


From clue 1, Drama is to the right of Thriller. We don't know their exact positions yet.


From clue 3, Disaster is to the right of Satire.


From clue 5, Crime is to the right of Disaster.


Now, let's try to piece together the order:


We have: ?, ?, ?, Sports (4), Horror (5), ?, ?

We can fit in Disaster and Crime as follows:
? , ?, ?, Sports (4), Horror (5), Disaster , Crime


Satire must be before Disaster:
? , ?, Satire , Sports (4), Horror (5), Disaster , Crime


Thriller and Drama are still left, but we know that Drama is to the right of Thriller. We also need to fill in positions 1-3:


Since position 2 is the only one that allows for a correct ordering of Thriller and Drama relative to each other and to the others:
? , Thriller, Satire , Sports (4), Horror (5), Disaster , Crime


Drama must be after Thriller and before Disaster/Crime. But wait! Drama can't go there because Disaster has to come after Satire and Crime has to come after Disaster!


The correct placement for Drama would actually force the Thriller to move left of position 2:


The only way this works is if:
Thriller (1), ?, Satire , Sports (4), Horror (5), Disaster , Crime


Drama can now fit in between positions 3 and 4 or after position 6. However, since it has to be on the right of Thriller:


The correct order is: 
Thriller (1), ?, Drama doesn't work here so: Satire , Sports (4) Horror (5) Disaster Crime : no - drama's gotta go here instead so:
Thriller (1), ?, ? - no: satires gotta go next to disaster so we can move thriller back one
The correct order is:


Thriller (2), Drama doesn't work here so: Satire , Sports (4) Horror (5) Disaster Crime : no drama's gotta be here


Therefore:


Thriller (1), ?, ? - Thriller needs a spot, drama needs to be right of him
Drama can go nowhere else but the middle left, so drama is position 3 which pushes everything left by one.


Crime (2), doesn't work so Drama needs to be on the right side of thriller, therefore:


Thriller (1), ?, Satire has to be next to disaster, and disaster has to be next to crime


If we try Thriller(1) we will find that only one possible solution exists:

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 5 states that the fan of d&b is in the middle, so I placed d&b in position 4.
* Clue 1 states that the fan of house is on the right of the fan of rock. This means that House and Rock cannot be in positions 6 or 7 (since there would be no space for the other to be to the left/right). So, I placed Rock in position 6 and House in position 5.
* Clue 3 states that the fan of disco is on the right of the fan of ambient. Since d&b is in position 4, Ambient must be to its left (position 3), and Disco must be to its right (position 5). However, we already placed House in position 5, so I moved Disco to position 4 was not possible. Instead, I moved Ambient to position 2 and Disco to position 6 didn't work either since rock is there, then I tried putting disco on the left of rock that also didn't fit with house on right of rock, however it did work when I placed ambient in column 3
* Clue 4 states that the fan of folk is on the left of the fan of d&b. Since d&b is in position 2 doesn't work because then ambient can not be to its left so we move the 2 positions one to right, Folk must be in position 1.
* The only remaining genre is Soul, which I placed in position 7.

So, the final solution table is:

* The owner of the pony is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla, so the chinchilla is in position 2.

* The owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat, but we don't know their exact positions yet. Let's come back to this later.
* The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the goat.

The owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the goat. This means the goldfish must be in position 3, and the goat must be in one of the remaining positions (5 or 6).

|       | 1   |     2      |    3    | 4  |    5     | 6  | 7 |
| Pet   | pony | chinchilla | goldfish | cat |          |    |    |

Now, the owner of the frog is on the right of the owner of the goat. This means the goat must be in position 5, and the frog must be in position 6.
