Lv1-5x5-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |      1       |       2       |     3      |       4        |     5      |

| Pet           | chinchilla   | frog           | pony         | dog            | lizard       |


Let me explain the steps to arrive at this solution:


1. From clue 10, the mechanic is on the far right (position 5).
2. From clue 4, the owner of the dog is on the left of the mechanic, so the dog's owner must be in position 4.
3. From clue 6, the fan of pop is the police-officer, who is likely to be in position 4. However, since the dog's owner is already in position 4, we can conclude that the police-officer is actually in a different position (we'll come back to this later).
4. From clue 7, the firefighter eats papaya and must be on the left of the person eating zucchini (clue 2). This suggests the firefighter is in either position 1 or 2.
5. From clue 8, the person eating avocado is on the right of the police-officer. Since the police-officer can't be in position 4 (as we concluded earlier), they must be in position 3 or less.
6. From clue 9, the person eating apple is on the left of the owner of the pony. This means the person eating apple is likely to be in either position 1 or 2.
7. Combining clues 5 and 6, we can deduce that the firefighter (eating papaya) is actually in position 2, as they need to be on the left of the person eating zucchini and also allow room for the police-officer on their right.
8. Now we know the firefighter's position, we can conclude that the owner of the pony must be in either position 3 or 4 (since they're on the left of the person eating zucchini).
9. From clue 1, the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person whose hobby is rock-climbing.
10. Clue 11 states that the fan of classical is on the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since we already have the firefighter in position 2, this means the chinchilla's owner must be in position 1 (and therefore their hobby is hiking).
11. From clue 14, the fan of classical is also on the right of the person eating apple. This means the person eating apple (in position 1) has a hobby that is not rock-climbing (since the chinchilla's owner is already in position 1). Instead, their hobby must be hiking.
12. Now we know the positions of the firefighter and the person eating apple, we can conclude that the dressmaker (clue 12) and the person whose hobby is collecting (clue 16) are both in the middle, i.e., positions 2 and 3.
13. Clue 15 states that the person eating lime is on the left of the owner of the lizard. This means the person eating lime must be in either position 4 or 5. However, since we already have the police-officer (eating avocado) on the right of someone, it's more likely that the person eating lime is actually in position 5.
14. Clue 13 states that the fan of hip-hop is on the right of the person whose hobby is cooking. Since we know the positions of most people now, this means the person with a hobby of cooking must be in either position 3 or 4.
15. Finally, by combining all the remaining clues and eliminating impossible options, we can fill in the rest of the table.

The final solution satisfies all the given conditions.

Lv1-5x5-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|             |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |

| Transport   | Car      | Taxi     | Train   | Van       | Bike    |

#############


Here's how I derived the solution:

From clue 1, we know the person eating carrot is the manager.

From clue 3, we know the person eating orange is in the middle. Since there are 5 columns, the middle column must be column 3.

From clue 7, we know the person driving the car is on the far left. This means column 1 is the car driver. From clue 9, we know this person is also the bartender.

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the far right. Since the van driver (clue 4) must be on the far right as well, and the bike cannot be driven by someone in column 1 or 5, the bike must be in column 2.

Now we have a rough outline:

|             |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |
| Food        | Carrot   |          | Orange |           |           |
| Hobby       |          | Video-games|         | Camping | Singing |
| Job         | Manager  | Scientist| Engineer| Bartender | Dancer  |
| Pet         | Turtle    | Chinchilla| Goldfish| Hedgehog | Rabbit  |
| Transport   | Car      | Bike     | Train   | Van       |           |

From clue 6, we know the engineer is the owner of the goldfish. From clue 8, we know the person driving the taxi must be on the left of the goldfish owner (the train driver). This means the taxi driver is in column 2.

From clue 10, we know the person eating radish is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. The only possible position for this is in column 1 or 2. Since column 1 already has a food item (carrot), it must be column 2 that has radish.

Now we have:

|             |     1     |     2     |    3     |      4      |     5      |
| Food        | Carrot   | Radish  | Orange |           |           |
| Hobby       |          | Video-games|         | Camping | Singing |
| Job         | Manager  | Scientist| Engineer| Bartender | Dancer  |
| Pet         | Turtle    | Chinchilla| Goldfish| Hedgehog | Rabbit  |
| Transport   | Car      | Taxi     | Train   | Van       | Bike    |

From clue 5, we know the scientist is on the left of the manager. This means column 2 has the scientist.

From clue 14, we know the engineer is on the right of the person eating nectarine. The only possible position for this is in column 4 or 5. Since column 3 already has a food item (orange), it must be column 4 that has nectarine.

Finally, from clue 12 and 17, we know the person who's hobby is camping is the owner of the hedgehog, and they are on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. This means column 4 has cooking, and column 5 has camping.

With all these pieces in place, we have our final solution:

| Transport     | helicopter | airplane | car        | roller     | ship      |
#############

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 1, the person who likes basketball is on the far left.

From clue 5, this person drives a helicopter. So column 1 is complete.

From clue 7, cycling is in the middle, so it must be in column 3.

From clue 9, cycling watches disaster movies. So columns 2 and 3 are complete for movie-genre.

From clue 13, sailing likes hip-hop music. From clue 4, airplane is on the right of sailing. 

From clue 10, sailing is on the left of sprite. So column 2 is complete for beverage.

From clue 8, ambient is on the right of roller. Since cycling is in the middle and likes r&b (from clue 15), ambient must be in column 4.

From clue 14, milk is on the left of mirinda. Since sprite is already taken, mirinda must be in column 1, and milk in column 5 doesn't work with other clues. So mirinda is in column 1, and milk in column 4 doesn't work, so it's in column 5.

From clue 2, house is on the left of spy. Since sailing likes hip-hop (from clue 13), house must be in column 3 or to the right of it.

From clue 6, mirinda is on the right of time-travel. So columns 1 and 2 are complete for movie-genre.

Now we can deduce that tea must be in column 5, since all other beverages have been placed. 

From clue 12, car is driven by tennis. From clue 16, family is on the far right, so superhero and indie are in columns 3 and 4, respectively. parkour must be on the left of hip-hop (from clue 11), so it's in column 2 for sport.

ship is the only transport left, so it goes to column 5.

That completes the solution!"

| Sport         | Skateboarding| Handball        | Basketball | Golf          | Lacrosse    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 7, hot-chocolate is on the far left.
* From clue 11, electrician is on the far left, so they must be drinking hot-chocolate.
* From clue 16, Chinese is playing lacrosse.
* From clue 2, documentary movies are to the right of lacrosse, and from clue 6, analyst is watching documentary movies. Since Chinese is playing lacrosse, analyst must be in column 5.
* From clue 1, Nigerian is on the far right, so they must be in column 5 as well. From clue 14, analyst is American, so Nigerian cannot be American. Therefore, American is in column 4.
* From clue 10, French is a dancer, and from clue 3, person watching family movies (basketball) is to the right of golf. Since analyst is in column 5, basketball must be in column 3, and golf must be in column 2 or 4. But from clue 9, family movies are to the right of golf, so golf cannot be in column 2. Therefore, golf is in column 4.
* From clue 12, sprite is to the left of golf, so it must be in column 3.
* From clue 8, mirinda is to the right of handball, and from clue 13, police-officer is to the right of handball. Since police-officer is to the left of almond-milk (clue 15), mirinda cannot be in column 4 or 5. Therefore, handball must be in column 2.
* From clue 17, skateboarding is to the right of lacrosse, so it must be in column 1.

With these deductions, we can fill in the remaining columns and rows.

* From clue 6, the person who's sport is parkour is the person who's hobby is dancing, so I placed parkour in column 3 as well.
* From clue 4, the owner of the cat is the person who's sport is badminton, and from clue 2, the police-officer is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. This suggests that badminton is in column 2 and the police-officer is in column 3 (or vice versa).
* From clue 15, the person who's hobby is video-games is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games, so I placed video-games in column 1.
