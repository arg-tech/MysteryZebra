Lv1-1x4-1	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The fan of ambient is on the left of the fan of soul.
This means that Ambient can't be in position 4, and Soul can't be in position 1.

2. The fan of country is on the right of the fan of r&b.
This means that Country can't be in position 1, and R&B can't be in position 4.

3. The fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of country.
This means that Ambient can't be in position 1, and Country can't be in position 3 or 4 (since Ambient would have to be to its right).

Combining these clues, we get:

|               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   |     |         |         |      |

The only possible order is:
 Country - R&B - Ambient - Soul (since Ambient is to the right of Country and left of Soul, and Country is to the left of R&B)

So, the final solution table is:


#############
|               |  1  |    2    |    3    |  4   |
| Music-Genre   | country | r&b      | ambient | soul |

| Transport   | roller |      |         | van |

The person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the van (clue 3). This means the jet-ski must be in position 3, since it can't be to the right of the van. We have:

1. The person watching animation movies is on the far right.
2. The person watching animation movies is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies.
3. The person watching martial-arts movies is on the right of the person watching musical movies.

From clue 1, we know the person watching animation movies is in column 4.

From statement 3, we know that the jet-ski is to the right of the trike.


From statement 2, we know that the tram is to the right of the jet-ski.


So, we have: Trike -> Jet-ski -> Tram


Statement 1 tells us that the skateboard is on the far left. Since there are only 4 means of transport and the skateboard is on the left, it must be on position 1.


Now, let's combine all the information:


Skateboard (1) -> Trike (2) -> Jet-ski (3) -> Tram (4)

1. The person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the bike.
2. The person driving the car is on the far right.
3. The person driving the motorbike is on the far left.

We can deduce the following order:

- Motorbike (on the far left): 1
- Since the bus driver is to the right of the bike driver, and the car is on the far right, bike must be in position 2.
- Bus cannot be next to motorbike; therefore, it has to be after bike: 3
- Car being on the far right means it takes the last spot: 4

The final solution table:
