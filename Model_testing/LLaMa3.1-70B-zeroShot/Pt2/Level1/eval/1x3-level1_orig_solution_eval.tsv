Lv1-1x3-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The engineer is on the far left, so Job 1 must be the engineer.
2. The bartender is on the right of the librarian, which means the librarian cannot be on the far right (Job 3). Therefore, the librarian must be in Job 2, and the bartender must be in Job 3.

Here is the final solution table:


#############
|       |    1     |     2     |     3     |
| Job   | Engineer | Librarian | Bartender |

Since the dancer is on the far left and the photographer is on the far right, we can fill in the jobs as follows:

| Job   | Dancer | Doctor | Photographer |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-1x3-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

* The person whose hobby is baking is on the far left, so we can fill in column 1:
 
|         |   1    |    2    |      3      |
| Hobby   | Baking |         |             |

* The person whose hobby is video-games is to the right of the person whose hobby is reading. This means that reading cannot be on the far left (column 1) or the far right (column 3), since there would not be a column to the right for video-games. Therefore, reading must be in column 2.
* Video-games must be in column 3, since it is to the right of reading.

Here is the completed table:

Lv1-1x3-4	"Based on the given clues:


Since the Japanese person is on the far right (clue 1), they must be in position 3.


Clue 2 states that the Japanese person is to the right of the Nigerian, so the Nigerian person cannot be on the far right and must be in either position 1 or 2.


However, if the Nigerian person were in position 2, there would be no room for the French person. Therefore, the Nigerian person must be in position 1, and the French person in position 2.


Here is the final solution table:


#############
|               |   1    |    2     |    3     |
| Nationality   | Nigerian | French    | Japanese|

Lv1-1x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person drinking Sprite is to the left of the person drinking Almond-Milk.
This means that Sprite must be in either column 1 or 2, and Almond-Milk must be to its right.


2. The person drinking Water is on the far right.
This means that Water must be in column 3.


Now, let's combine the clues:


Since Water is already fixed in column 3, we can start by placing Sprite in either column 1 or 2. If we place it in column 1, Almond-Milk would have to go in column 2, which works!


Here's the final solution table:


|            |   1    |      2      |   3   |
| Beverage   |        |             |       |

Lv1-1x3-6	"Based on the clues, I can fill in the table as follows:


#############
|             |     1      |  2  |  3   |
| Transport   | Snowmobile | Car | Boat |
#############


Here's my reasoning:

* The person driving the car is on the right of the person driving the snowmobile, so the car must be in position 2 and the snowmobile must be in position 1.
* The person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the boat, so the car must be to the left of the boat. This means the boat must be in position 3.

Therefore, the final solution table has the snowmobile in position 1, the car in position 2, and the boat in position 3."	{'transport': ['snowmobile', 'car', 'boat']}	True	3	True
Lv1-1x3-7	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 2, we know that Action is to the left of Martial-Arts.


From clue 1, we know that Thriller is to the left of Action.


So, combining both clues, the order from left to right is: Thriller, Action, Martial-Arts.


Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-1x3-8	"Based on the given clues:

Clue 1: The person whose hobby is traveling is in the middle.
This means the person with the hobby ""traveling"" is in column 2.

Clue 2: The person whose hobby is dancing is to the right of the person who's hobby is traveling.
Given that the person with ""traveling"" as a hobby is already determined to be in the middle (column 2), this means the person with ""dancing"" must be in column 3, which is to the right of the middle.

So far, we have:
| Hobby | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|       |          | Traveling| Dancing  |

The only hobby left that hasn't been assigned a position yet is ""drawing."" Since columns 2 and 3 are already taken by ""traveling"" and ""dancing,"" respectively, ""drawing"" must be in column 1.

Thus, the final solution table with '#############' around it looks like this:

#############
| Hobby | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|       | Drawing  | Traveling| Dancing  |

Lv1-1x3-9	"Let's break down the clues:


From clue 2, we know that the person watching disaster movies is in the middle, so it must be column 2.


From clue 1, we know that the person watching disaster movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Since the disaster movie watcher is in column 2, the comedy movie watcher must be in column 1.


The only genre left is time-travel, which must be in column 3.


Here's the final solution table:

Since the Turkish person is in the middle (column 2), and the Spanish person is to the left of the Turkish person, we can fill in the first two columns as follows:
