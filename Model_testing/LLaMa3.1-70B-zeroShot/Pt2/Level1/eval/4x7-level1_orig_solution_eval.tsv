Lv1-4x7-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |    2     |     3      |    4    |    5    |     6      |    7    |

| Transport     | quad-bike| ship     | jet-ski   | train    | skateboard| snowmobile | tram      |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 4, the manager is on the left of the french.
* From clue 7, the french is the analyst. So, the manager and analyst are in positions 5 and 6 or 6 and 7 (since they can't be together).
* From clue 13, the doctor is the russian, and from clue 16, the russian is on the far right. This means the analyst must be in position 6.
* From clue 12, the tram is on the far right, which confirms that the russian is indeed in position 7.
* Clue 2 states that the person drinking water is on the far right, which matches with the russian's position.
* From clue 1, the person drinking juice is the dancer. Clue 15 states that the person drinking juice is on the left of the person drinking sprite, so they must be in positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3.
* Clue 14 states that the indian is on the far left, which means the indian is in position 1.
* From clue 19, the indian is on the left of the mechanic. Since the dancer (who drinks juice) is already in position 1, the mechanic must be in position 2.
* Clue 18 states that the person drinking fanta is the person driving the jet-ski. Clue 3 states that the snowmobile is on the right of the jet-ski, so they must be in positions 4 and 5 or 5 and 6 (but we already know the analyst is in position 6).
* From clue 9, the person driving the ship is the chinese. This means the ship must be in position 3.
* Clue 10 states that the canadian is the person driving the train. Since the indian is on the far left and the quad-bike is also on the far left (clue 5), the train must be in position 4.
* From clue 20, the british is on the right of the canadian, which means the british is in position 5 or 6 (but we already know the analyst is in position 6).
* Clue 8 states that the designer is the person driving the skateboard. Clue 11 states that the british is the person drinking tea, and clue 6 states that the british is the person driving the skateboard.
* The remaining positions can be filled using clues 17 (the italian is on the left of the person drinking water) and 21 (the person drinking iced-tea is the engineer).

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took:

* From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left (column 1).
* Clue 16 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk has fishing as their hobby, so they must be in column 2.
* Clues 13 and 11 reveal that the person with woodworking as their hobby is in the middle (column 4) and drinks milk.
* From clue 18, we know the argentine is on the left of the person drinking milk, placing them in column 3.
* Clue 15 states that the person who's sport is snowboarding drinks water, so they must be in column 1, which matches with the argentine.
* The dutch person (column 3) has climbing as their sport (clue 1).
* Clues 19 and 20 place the thai and biathlon in columns 5 and 2, respectively.
* Clue 17 places the malaysian on the left of the spanish, so they must be in column 2 and 6.
* The person with chess as their hobby is on the left of the person drinking milk (clue 14), placing them in column 3.
* From clue 10, we know the person drinking coffee is on the far right (column 7).
* Clues 5 and 6 place the person who's hobby is drawing on the right of the person drinking iced-tea. Since there is no iced-tea drinker in columns 1-3, they must be in column 4 or later.
* From clue 8, we know that filmmaking and parkour are paired together. The only possible spot for them is in column 6 (since the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the brazilian).
* Clue 21 places the person drinking mirinda on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, which puts them in column 5.
* Finally, clue 4 places the person with rowing as their sport on the right of the brazilian (column 7)."	{'beverage': ['water', 'soy-milk', 'almond-', 'milk', 'mirinda', 'coffee', ''], 'hobby': ['hiking', 'fishing', 'chess', 'woodworking', 'drawing', 'filmmaking', 'cooking'], 'nationality': ['argentine', 'malaysian', 'dutch', 'mexican', 'thai', 'spanish', 'brazilian'], 'sport': ['snowboarding', 'biathlon', 'climbing', 'parkour', 'tennis', 'volleyball', 'rowing']}	True	7	False
