Lv1-1x6-1	"Let's solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 1, we know the lawyer is on the far right, so the last column (6) is occupied by the lawyer.


|       |     1     |       2        |     3     |      4       |   5   |   Lawyer |
| Job   |           |                |           |              |       |        |

From clue 2, we know the nurse is on the left of the lawyer. Since there's only one column to the left of the lawyer (column 5), the nurse must occupy that column.


|       |     1     |       2        |     3     |      4       | Nurse |   Lawyer |
| Job   |           |                |           |              |       |        |

From clue 3, we know the videographer is on the left of the nurse. Since there are multiple columns to the left of the nurse (columns 1-4), we can't determine the exact position yet.


From clue 4, we know the security-guard is on the left of the architect. This means they must occupy consecutive columns. We also know that the bartender is on the far left (column 1).


|       | Bartender |       ?        |     ?     |      ?       | Nurse |   Lawyer |
| Job   |           |                |           |              |       |        |

Since the security-guard and architect are consecutive, they must occupy columns 2-3 or 3-4. But we know the videographer is on the left of the nurse (from clue 3), so it's likely that the videographer occupies column 3.


|       | Bartender | Security-Guard | Videographer |      ?       | Nurse |   Lawyer |
| Job   |           |                |              |              |       |        |

The only remaining job is architect, which must occupy column 4.


|       | Bartender | Security-Guard | Videographer | Architect    | Nurse |   Lawyer |
| Job   |           |                |              |              |       |        |

Lv1-1x6-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that Gardening is on the far left.

From clue 3, we know that Sudoku is on the left of Drawing, but we don't know where they are yet.

From clue 5, we know that Camping is on the right of Gardening, so the order for these two is: Gardening - Camping

From clue 1, we know that Filmmaking is on the right of Camping, so the order for these three is: Gardening - Camping - Filmmaking

From clue 4, we know that Filmmaking is on the left of Writing, so the order for these two is: ... - Filmmaking - Writing (we'll fill in the gaps later)

Now, let's combine what we have:

Gardening - Camping - Filmmaking - Writing

We still need to fit in Sudoku and Drawing. From clue 3, we know that Sudoku is on the left of Drawing. We can try to insert them into the existing order.

One possibility is:
Gardening - Sudoku - Camping - Filmmaking - Writing (this doesn't work because it contradicts clue 5)

Another possibility is:
Gardening - Camping - Sudoku - Drawing - ... (this looks promising, but we need to make sure it fits with the other clues)

Let's try to complete this order:

Gardening - Camping - Sudoku - Drawing - Filmmaking - Writing

This satisfies all the clues!

Here is the final solution table:


| Hobby   | Gardening | Camping  | Sudoku  | Drawing | Filmmaking | Writing |

| Sport   | Cycling | Weightlifting | Lacrosse | Skiing | Baseball | Skateboarding |
#############


Here's the step-by-step explanation:

* From clue (4), we know that cycling is on the far left, so it goes in position 1.
* From clue (5), we know that skateboarding is on the far right, so it goes in position 6.
* From clue (2), we know that lacrosse is to the left of skiing. Since skiing can't be in position 1 or 6, and cycling is already in position 1, lacrosse and skiing must go in positions 3 and 4, respectively.
* From clue (3), we know that skiing is to the left of baseball. So, baseball goes in position 5.
* Finally, from clue (1), we know that skateboarding is to the right of weightlifting. Since skateboarding is already in position 6, weightlifting must go in position 2.

So, the final solution table is:

From clue 5, we know that Scientific is on the far left.

From clue 3, Crime is to the right of Scientific.
So, we have: Scientific | Crime | ...

From clue 2, Zombie is to the right of Crime.
So, we have: Scientific | Crime | Zombie | ...

From clue 1 and 4 (which are identical), Time-Travel is to the left of Spy. Since Time-Travel can't be on the far left (Scientific occupies that spot), it must be in the second or third position.

From clue 6, Time-Travel is to the right of Romance.
So, we have: Scientific | Romance | Time-Travel | ...

Now we can combine the two sequences:
Scientific | Romance | Time-Travel | Crime | Zombie | Spy

From clue 3, we know the owner of the bird is on the left of the owner of the ferret. Since the lizard is already in position 1, the bird must be in position 2 and the ferret in position 3:
|       |   Lizard  | Bird    | Ferret |      |        |     |

From clue 4, we know the owner of the lizard is on the left of the owner of the mouse. Since the lizard is already in position 1, the mouse must be in one of the positions to its right. But from clue 1, we also know that the owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the mouse. So, the mouse must be in position 4:
|       |   Lizard  | Bird    | Ferret | Mouse|        |     |

From clue 2, we know the owner of the dog is on the far right, so:

From clue 5, we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies. Also, from clue 2 and 3, we know that horror is between adventure and romance.


So far:

From clue 4, we know that the person watching martial-arts movies is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. However, this is not possible since superhero is already on the far left.


So, martial-arts must be on position 6:

Lv1-1x6-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 1, we know the owner of the lizard is on the far right. This means the lizard can only be in position 6.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the lizard is to the right of the owner of the fish. So, the fish must be in one of the positions to the left of the lizard (positions 1-5).

From clue 4, we know the owner of the turtle is to the left of the owner of the fish. This means the turtle and fish must be in adjacent positions, with the turtle on the left.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the ferret is to the left of the owner of the hedgehog. This means the ferret and hedgehog must be in adjacent positions, with the ferret on the left.

From clue 5, we know the owner of the hedgehog is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. This means the hedgehog and chinchilla must be in adjacent positions, with the hedgehog on the left.

Putting all these clues together, we get the solution:

From clue 5, puzzles must be to the left of baking. Since chess is already in position 1, we can't place puzzles before it. Therefore, this clue doesn't give us any new information yet.


Wait a minute... If puzzles is to the left of baking (clue 5), and baking is currently in position 2, then puzzles must be in position 1! But that's not possible since chess is already there.


Let's revisit our assumption about baking. What if baking is actually in position 3? Then drawing would be in position 4 or later. However, we know video-games is in position 4 (or at least to the right of chess), so baking can't be in position 3.


Hmm... What if baking is actually in position 5? That wouldn't work either since singing is already there.


Let's try something else. What if puzzles is actually in position 2, and baking is in position 3?

Finally, we know singing is to the right of video-games (clue 3). However, there's no space left for it! This means our initial assumption about video-games being in position 5 was incorrect. Let's move it one spot to the right.

Explanation of steps:

From clue 3, we know the motorbike is on the far left, so it goes in column 1.

From clue 5, we confirm that the motorbike is indeed on the far left.

From clue 4, we know the airplane is to the right of the trike. Given the airplane's position relative to the jet-ski (clue 2), the airplane must be in column 2, and the trike in column 3.

From clue 1, we know the subway is to the right of the jet-ski. With the jet-ski already placed after the airplane (clue 2) and considering the position of the airplane relative to the trike, the subway goes in column 4.

The jet-ski then takes its place between the airplane and the subway, as per clue 1 and 2.

Finally, with the roller on the right of the motorbike (clue 3), it must be placed after the motorbike's rightmost neighbor. Since that spot is taken by the jet-ski and the motorbike has to stay at column 1, the roller takes its place in column 6."	{'transport': ['', '', '', '', '', '']}	True	0	False
