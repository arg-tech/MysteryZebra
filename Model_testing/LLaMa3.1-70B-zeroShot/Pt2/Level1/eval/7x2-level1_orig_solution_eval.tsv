Lv1-7x2-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution. Here is the completed table:

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the dancer is on the right of the person driving the bus. So, the dancer must be in column 2.
* From clue 3, we know that the person eating eggplant is on the right of the person driving the bus. Since the dancer is already in column 2, the person eating eggplant must also be in column 2.
* From clue 1, we know that the owner of the pony is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing. So, the owner of the pony must be in column 2, and the person who likes rowing must be in column 1.
* From clue 2, we know that the person drinking milk is on the right of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the dancer (who eats eggplant) is already in column 2, the person drinking milk must also be in column 2, and the person watching martial-arts movies must be in column 1.
* The remaining items can be filled in accordingly.

Please note that this solution satisfies all the given clues.

Lv1-7x2-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I got the following solution:

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 3, we know the Argentine is watching documentary movies, so we can fill in that information.
* From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the owner of the fish, but since the Argentine is already placed on the right side (due to being associated with documentaries), this means the Argentine must be on column 2. This also tells us that the person who owns a fish cannot be in column 2.
* From clue 4, we know the doctor is on the right of the person whose hobby is card-games. Since the Argentine is already placed on the right side (column 2), this means the person with card-games must be on the left side (column 1).
* From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is sailing is on the left of the person driving the train. This tells us that sailing cannot be in column 2.
* By process of elimination and using the remaining clues, we can fill in the rest of the information.

Lv1-7x2-5	"Let's start by filling in the information we know:

* The person watching time-travel movies is on the far left (2)
* The fan of metal is on the far left (4)

So, column 1 must be the one who watches time-travel movies and listens to metal. Let's fill that in:

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         |               |            |

| Transport     |               |            |

Now, let's look at clue 5: the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right. So, column 2 must be the hiker.

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Hiking     |

| Pet           |               |            |
| Transport     |               |            |

Now, let's look at clue 1: the spanish is on the right of the firefighter. This means that column 1 must be the firefighter (since the spanish can't be on the far left). And since the engineer is the only job left, it must go in column 2.

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Hiking     |

| Transport     |               |            |

Now, let's look at clue 3: the person driving the trike is on the right of the owner of the fish. Since column 2 has hiking as a hobby (which can't be combined with owning a fish), column 1 must own the fish.

|               |       1       |     2      |
| Hobby         | Rock-climbing | Hiking     |

| Transport     |               | Trike      |

Finally, let's fill in the remaining blanks:

* The person who prefers spy movies must be in column 2 (since time-travel is already taken).
* The person who listens to house music must be in column 2 (since metal is already taken).
* The polish nationality must be in column 1.
* The guinea-pig pet must be in column 2.
* The helicopter transport must be in column 1.

Lv1-7x2-6	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |      1       |       2       |
| Food          | pomegranate  | garlic        |

| Sport         | water-polo   | skateboarding |
| Transport     | motorbike    | scooter       |

#############

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 3, we know that the person eating pomegranate is on the far left. From clue 4, we also know that the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left. Therefore, the first column must be: pomegranate (food) and puzzles (hobby).

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the scooter is the mechanic. Since the mechanic can't be on the far left (because of the pomegranate-eating puzzle-solver), they must be in the second column.

From clue 2, we know that the mechanic is on the right of the owner of the guinea-pig. Therefore, the guinea-pig must belong to the person in the first column, but since the first column already has a hedgehog (by process of elimination), this means that the guinea-pig belongs to the second column.

Now we have: pomegranate (food) and puzzles (hobby) on the far left, and scooter (transport) and mechanic (job) on the right. We can also infer that the person on the right has a thriller movie-genre preference, since skateboarding is on their right (clue 1).

From clue 1, we know that the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person watching thriller movies. Since the person on the right already prefers thrillers, this means that the person on the left must watch satire movies.

The remaining options can be filled in: water-polo (sport) for the person who eats pomegranate and has puzzles as their hobby, and motorbike (transport) for the person on the right. The person on the right also has video-games as their hobby (by process of elimination).

Finally, we have garlic (food) for the person on the right, and entrepreneur (job) for the person on the left.

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching romance movies.

Since the person watching adventure movies is already on the far left (clue 5), this means that the person watching romance movies must be in column 2. Also, since the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person watching romance movies, the person drinking lemonade must also be in column 1.

This means that the person whose hobby is sudoku must be in column 1. Also, since the owner of the goat is on the right of the person whose hobby is sudoku, the owner of the goat must be in column 2, but we don't know yet what pet is owned by the person in column 1.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of country is on the far right.

Since the person whose hobby is sudoku is already in column 1 (clue 3), this means that the fan of country must be in column 2. However, we can't put the fan of country in column 2 because it's occupied by someone else (the owner of the goat). Therefore, the fan of rock must be in column 1.

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, the owner of the horse is on the right of the person who prefers golf. This means the person with golf must be in column 1.

From clue 2, the owner of the horse eats strawberry, so strawberry must be in column 2.

From clue 3, the person drinking lemonade is on the left of the person driving a bike. Since bike is not mentioned as being associated with any particular food or pet, we can conclude that bike is in column 2 (otherwise, lemonade would be on the right). Therefore, lemonade must be in column 1.

From clue 4, the fan of disco is on the right of the person watching family movies. Since animation and family are the only two movie genres mentioned, family must be in column 1.

Now we can start filling in the remaining blanks:

* Food: kale goes with lemonade (column 1), strawberry goes with horse (column 2)
* Movie-Genre: family is in column 1, so animation must be in column 2
* Music-Genre: disco is on the right of family movies, so it's in column 2. Therefore, soul must be in column 1.
* Pet: ferret goes with lemonade (column 1), horse goes with strawberry (column 2)
* Sport: golf is in column 1, skiing must be in column 2
* Transport: ship goes with lemonade (column 1), bike goes with disco (column 2)

The resulting table should satisfy all the given conditions."	{'beverage': ['lemonade', '7up'], 'food': ['kale', 'strawberry'], 'movie-genre': ['family', 'animation'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'disco'], 'pet': ['ferret', 'horse'], 'sport': ['golf', 'skiing'], 'transport': ['ship', 'bike']}	True	14	True
