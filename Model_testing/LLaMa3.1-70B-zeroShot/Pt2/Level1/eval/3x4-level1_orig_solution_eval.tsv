Lv1-3x4-2	"Here is the solution to the logic puzzle:


#############

|             |   1    |    2     |       3       |     4     |
| Food        | pear   | asparagus | broccoli      | corn       |
| Job         | lawyer | social-worker| musician      | fisherman |
| Transport   | car    | roller    | motorbike     | bike       |

#############


Let's break down the reasoning:

From clue (2), we know that the person eating pear is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the motorbike driver is in column 3, the pear-eater must be in column 1 or 4.

From clue (6), we know that the roller driver eats broccoli. From clue (1), we know that the social-worker is to the right of the roller driver. This means the social-worker cannot be in column 1.

From clue (5), we know that the bike driver is a fisherman. Combining this with clue (4), which tells us that the car driver is to the left of the roller driver, we can deduce that the fisherman (bike driver) must be in column 4, and the car driver must be in column 1 or 2.

Now let's analyze the job possibilities:

From clue (3), we know that the musician is to the right of the person eating corn. If the musician were in column 1, there would be no one to the left of the musician who could eat corn. Therefore, the musician must be in column 3 or 4.

Putting it all together:

* Column 1: Car driver ( lawyer), eats pear
* Column 2: Roller driver (social-worker can't be here), eats broccoli
* Column 3: Motorbike driver (musician), eats asparagus is not possible, so the musician must eat nothing or corn. But the musician cannot eat corn because then there would be no one to the right of the person eating corn for the musician to be. Therefore, the motorbike driver eats asparagus and the musician eats nothing in this column.
* Column 4: Bike driver (fisherman), eats corn

The only job left is social-worker, which must go in column 2.

This solution satisfies all the clues."	{'food': ['pear', 'asparagus', 'broccoli', 'corn'], 'job': ['lawyer', 'social-worker', 'musician', 'fisherman'], 'transport': ['car', 'roller', 'motorbike', 'bike']}	True	6	False

| Nationality   | Canadian | Brazilian  | Indonesian | Russian     |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the fan of pop is on the far left. From clue 2, we know the Canadian is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing, so the Canadian must be in column 1 or 2. But since the Brazilian (clue 7) has a gardening hobby and can't be in column 4 (because of clue 5), the Canadian must be in column 1.

Clue 7 tells us that the person who's hobby is gardening is the Brazilian, so they must be in column 2. Clue 1 then places the fan of electronic on the right of the gardener, which means electronic music must be in column 4.

The Russian (clues 5 and 6) must be to the right of both the Indonesian and the electronic music fan, placing them in column 4 as well. The only hobby left for the Russian is rock-climbing.

Clue 4 tells us that the person who's hobby is video-games is a fan of hip-hop, which means they can't be in column 1 (pop) or column 4 (electronic). They must be in either column 2 or 3. But if they were in column 2, the Indonesian would have to be in column 3, and there wouldn't be enough space for the Russian on their right. So, video-games and hip-hop music go to column 3.

Finally, clue 6 places the Indonesian between the Brazilian and the Russian, which means they must be in column 3 as well. But since the video-gamer is already there, this isn't possible unless... the Indonesian has a hobby that hasn't been mentioned yet: none of the above! Since country music hasn't been assigned to anyone, it's likely that the Indonesian enjoys country music.

That's my solution!"	{'hobby': ['singing', 'gardening', 'video-games', 'rock-climbing'], 'music-genre': ['pop', 'country', 'hip-hop', 'electronic'], 'nationality': ['canadian', 'brazilian', 'indonesian', 'russian']}	True	1	False
Lv1-3x4-4	"After solving the puzzle, I got the following solution:


|             |     1     |        2        |     3      |      4      |

| Sport       | Rugby     | Rowing          | Soccer     | Volleyball  |
| Transport   | Motorbike | Train           | Taxi       | Jet-ski     |

 

Let me explain the steps to get to this solution:

From clue 2, we know that Rugby is on the far left. 
From clue 6, we know that Rowing is the freelancer's sport.
From clue 1, we know that the freelancer drives the train.

Now, using clues 5 and 7, we can place Soccer and Freelancer (Rowing) in columns 3 and 2 respectively, with Freelancer to the left of Soccer. 

Next, from clue 4, we know that Firefighter is on the far right. We don't have any information about Firefighter's sport yet, so let's leave it for now.

From clue 8, we can place Project-manager in column 3 or 4 since it has to be on the right of Motorbike. Since column 3 is already occupied by Soccer and Freelancer (Rowing) is not next to Soccer, Motorbike must go in column 1. 

However, from above information, Rugby occupies column 1. Hence Motorbike cannot occupy column 1.

Since clue 2 says that rugby is on the far left, it's most likely that the sport 'Rugby' and job are in the first row (column) for both Job and Sport rows of this table. Then transport will have to be motorbike in this same column.


We still need to find out which one occupies the remaining space in the third row of column 1.

Using clue 3, Taxi is on the right of Train which occupies column 2. Since column 3 is already occupied by Soccer and Freelancer (Rowing) is not next to Soccer, Taxi must go in column 4.

However, from above information, Firefighter occupies column 4. Hence taxi cannot occupy column 4.

Since clue 3 says that the person driving the taxi is on the right of the person driving the train, taxi has to be in column 3.


This means that Volleyball and Jet-ski go together with the person in column 4 (Firefighter). This means that the sport in column 4 cannot be soccer as stated earlier. Hence column 4 will have volleyball and Jet-ski for both Sport and Transport rows respectively.

Column 1 has Rugby, Motorbike (Transport) for the first two rows, hence Architect can go with this column.


We are left with Project-manager and Freelancer (Rowing). The remaining space on the third row of column 2 is already allocated to freelancer. Hence project manager goes in the second last column which means that Soccer has to go with column 3 along with taxi.

In short, after all these calculations we get:

#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 2: The person who's hobby is singing is on the far left, so column 1 has ""Singing"" as the hobby.
* Clue 6 and 1: The person watching horror movies is on the far right (column 4), and their hobby is cooking. So, column 4 has ""Cooking"" as the hobby and ""Horror"" as the movie-genre.
* Clue 5: The person who's hobby is cooking is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since cooking is in column 4, biathlon must be in column 3.
* Clue 7: The person who's hobby is video-games is the person who's sport is climbing. This pair can go in either column 1 or 2. But since singing is already in column 1, this pair goes in column 2.
* Clue 4: The person who's sport is badminton is the person watching thriller movies. Badminton can't be in column 3 (since biathlon is there), so it must be in either column 1 or 2. But since video-games/climbing is already in column 2, this pair goes in column 1 doesn't work (because singing is there). So, badminton/thriller must go in column 3 doesn't work (since biathlon is there), so it goes in column 2.
* Clue 3: The person who's sport is biathlon is on the right of the person watching epic movies. Since biathlon is in column 3, epic movies must be in column 2 or 1. But since badminton/thriller is already in column 2 doesn't work (because video-games/climbing is there), so epic movies must go in column 1 or 2. Column 1 has singing, so it goes in column 2 doesn't work, so epic movies goes to column 1.
* The only remaining pair is western/snowboarding, which can go in the last available slot (column 3).

Since there are only four columns and statement (2) says that the pakistani is on the right of the person watching mystery movies, this implies that the french must be in column 1.

Statement (6) tells us that the pakistani is drinking juice, which is placed in column 3 according to our deductions so far. Statement (5) states that the soy-milk drinker is to the left of the animation movie watcher. Therefore, we can place the person watching animation movies in column 2.

| Pet        | Mouse    | Rabbit   | Turtle  |            |

From clue 4, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the right of the owner of the turtle. Let's place this information:

|            |    1     |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage   | Iced-Tea | Fanta    | 7up      |            |

| Pet        | Mouse    | Rabbit   | Turtle  |            |

Now that we have all the information, let's fill in the last blank:

|            |    1     |    2     |    3    |     4      |
