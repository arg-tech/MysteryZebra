Lv1-1x5-1	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know: Electrician - Engineer (order not specified yet)

From clue 2, we know: Freelancer is in the middle, so Freelancer must be at position 3.

From clue 3, we know: Writer is on the right of the freelancer, so Writer must be at position 4 or 5.

From clue 4, we know: Freelancer is on the right of the engineer. Since Freelancer is already at position 3, Engineer must be at position 2.

Now, combining all the clues:

* Electrician - Engineer (clue 1) => Electrician must be at position 1
* Engineer (at position 2)
* Freelancer (already at position 3)
* Writer is on the right of the freelancer (clue 3), so Writer must be at position 4 or 5. But since there's only one spot left, Videographer must be at position 5.

The final solution table:

Lv1-1x5-2	"Here's my attempt to solve it:


|               |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
| Nationality   | indian | russian | german| dutch | british|

 Wait, there is no 'german' in the solution! Let me try again.


After re-examining the clues:


1. The Russian is on the right of the Indian.
2. The Russian is on the left of the Dutch.
3. The Dutch is on the left of the British.
4. The Indian is on the far left.

I realized that I can place the German in position 5 and still satisfy all conditions.


Here's my revised solution:


|               |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |
| Nationality   | indian | russian | dutch | british | german |

And here is the solution with '#############' around it:


#############
|               |   1    |    2    |   3   |    4    |   5    |

Lv1-1x5-3	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is rock-climbing is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing.
2. The person who's hobby is gardening is on the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
3. The person who's hobby is dancing is in the middle.

From clue 3, we know that dancing is in position 3.

From clue 1, rock-climbing must be to the left of dancing, so it can only be in positions 1 or 2.

From clue 2, gardening is to the right of skydiving. Since dancing is already in position 3, gardening and skydiving must be in positions 4 and 5 (in some order).

Here's a possible arrangement:

|         |    1    |       2       |    3    |     4     |     5     |
| Hobby   | Camping | Rock-climbing | Dancing | Skydiving | Gardening |

Wait, no! This doesn't work because rock-climbing is not to the left of dancing.

Let's try another arrangement:

|         |    1    |       2       |    3    |     4     |     5     |
| Hobby   | Rock-   | Camping      | Dancing | Skydiving | Gardening |

This looks good! It satisfies all the clues.

So, here is the final solution table:


#############

Lv1-1x5-4	"Based on the clues, we can deduce that:

* The person eating strawberry is in the middle (clue 2), so they must be at position 3.
* The person eating strawberry is on the left of the person eating pomegranate (clue 3), so pomegranate must be at position 4.
* The person eating potato is on the right of the person eating plum (clue 1). Since pomegranate is already at position 4, potato can't be there. So, the only option for potato to be on the right of plum is if plum is at position 1 and potato is at position 5.

The remaining food, grapes, must be at position 2.

Here is the final solution table:


#############
|        |  1   |   2    |     3      |      4      |   5    |

Lv1-1x5-5	"Let's break down the clues:

* The Spanish is in the middle, so it must be in position 3.
* The Spanish is on the right of the French, so the French must be to the left of the Spanish, which means the French is in either position 1 or 2.

Now, let's consider the first clue: the Indonesian is on the left of the Turkish. This doesn't give us a specific position for the Indonesian and Turkish yet, but it tells us that they are not next to each other with the Spanish.

Putting all this together, we can start filling in the table:

|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Nationality   |         |        |  Spanish|            |         |

Since the French is to the left of the Spanish, it must be in position 2. The Indonesian and Turkish must be on either side of the remaining two positions.

|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Nationality   |  French?| French |  Spanish|            |         |

Now, let's look at the Indonesian and Turkish again. The only way to fit them in is for the Indonesian to be on the left of the Turkish.

So, here's the solution:

#############
|               |    1    |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |

Note: The only remaining nationality is Russian, which can fit in the first position."	{'nationality': ['russian', 'french', 'spanish', 'indonesian', 'turkish']}	True	5	True
Lv1-1x5-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching action movies is in the middle, which means they are at position 3.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching action movies is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person watching action movies is at position 3, the person watching time-travel movies must be at position 4 or 5. However, if they were at position 5, there would be no one to the right of them, so they must be at position 4.

From clue 1, we know that the person watching comedy movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies. Since the person watching action movies (at position 3) and time-travel movies (at position 4) are already fixed, the only positions left for comedy and crime are positions 1 and 2. If the person watching comedy were at position 2, there would be no one to their left, so they must be at position 1, with the person watching crime movies at position 2.

The only movie genre left is horror, which must be at position 5.

Here is the final solution table:

Lv1-1x5-7	"Based on the clues, we can start by placing the Polish person in position 1, since they are on the far left.

| Nationality   | polish |           |         |            |           |

From clue 1, we know the Colombian is to the right of the Polish person, so they must be in position 2.

|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |     4      |     5     |
| Nationality   | polish | colombian |         |            |           |

From clue 2, we know the Turkish is to the left of the Indonesian. Since position 2 is already taken by the Colombian, the earliest position for the Turkish person is position 3.

|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |     4      |     5     |
| Nationality   | polish | colombian | turkish |            |           |

Now we can place the Indonesian in position 4, since they are to the right of the Turkish person.

|               |   1    |     2     |    3    |     4      |     5     |
| Nationality   | polish | colombian | turkish | indonesian |           |

Finally, from clue 4, we know the Brazilian is to the right of the Indonesian. Therefore, they must be in position 5.

From clue 2, we know that grapefruit is in the middle, so it's at position 3.

From clue 4, potato is to the right of grapefruit, so it's at position 4 or 5. However, from clue 1, potato must be to the left of eggplant, which means potato can't be at position 5 (because there would be no space for eggplant). Therefore, potato is at position 4.


Now we have:
