The solution was found by carefully applying the given clues one by one, using a process of elimination to narrow down the possibilities.

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

* Clues 1 and 13 tell us that the person eating strawberry is on the far left, and the person whose hobby is photography is on the far right.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person eating garlic is on the left of the person eating cherry.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person whose hobby is photography is on the right of the person eating cherry. Combining this with clue 13, we can deduce that the person eating cherry must be in column 2.
* Clues 4 and 5 tell us that the fan of folk is on the left of the person whose hobby is photography, and that the fan of soul is watching epic movies. Since the person whose hobby is photography is on the far right, we can deduce that the fan of folk must be in column 3.
* Clue 2 tells us that the Indonesian is on the right of the fan of folk, so the Indonesian must be in column 4.
* Clues 6 and 7 tell us that the person watching epic movies is on the right of the person whose hobby is sudoku, and that the fan of blues is on the left of the owner of the fish. Combining these with clue 5, we can deduce that the person watching epic movies must be in column 4.
* Clues 9 and 12 tell us that the Australian is on the left of the Pakistani, and that the Pakistani is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski. Since the Indonesian is already in column 4, we can deduce that the Pakistani must be in column 3, and the Australian must be in column 1 or 2.
* Clues 14-17 tell us about the relationships between the person driving the boat, the owner of the fish, and the person watching family movies. Combining these with clue 16, we can deduce that the person driving the boat must be in column 1.

The rest of the solution follows from careful application of the remaining clues."	{'food': ['strawberry', 'cherry', 'garlic', 'peas'], 'hobby': ['writing', 'sudoku', 'photography', 'gardening'], 'movie-genre': ['horror', 'documentary', 'family', 'epic'], 'music-genre': ['d&b', 'blues', 'soul', 'folk'], 'nationality': ['australian', 'nigerian', 'pakistani', 'indonesian'], 'pet': ['rabbit', 'horse', 'fish', 'frog'], 'transport': ['roller', 'trike', 'boat', 'jet-ski']}	True	7	False

| Transport     | jet-ski     | skateboard    | taxi       | car         |

Here's how I solved it:

From clue 8, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the far left. From clue 7, this person drinks milk.

From clue 5, the person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking milk (water-polo) is on the far left, the person eating peas must be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 1, the person eating peas drives a skateboard. From clue 2, this person's hobby is camping.

From clue 10, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person eating blueberry. Since the person eating peas (camping) is in column 2 or 3, the person eating blueberry must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 11, the person who's sport is biathlon is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.

From clue 3, the fan of folk is on the far left. Since the person drinking milk (water-polo) is already on the far left, this must be the same person.

From clue 4, the person who's hobby is baking is on the right of the person who's hobby is board-games.

From clue 6, the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the fan of house. From clue 14, the fan of fantasy movies is also the fan of house.

From clue 9, the fan of house is on the right of the person eating kale.

From clue 12, the person watching animation movies is on the far right.

From clue 13, the person driving the car is the fan of trance.

Now we can start filling in the table. The far left column must be:

* Beverage: milk
* Food: peas (no, wait, that's not possible... see below)
* Hobby: camping
* Movie-Genre: ? (not animation, because that's on the far right)
* Music-Genre: folk
* Sport: water-polo
* Transport: jet-ski (no, wait, that's not possible... see below)

From clue 5, the person eating peas is on the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. So the person eating peas must be in column 2, and the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in column 1.

* Beverage: milk -> no, hot-chocolate
* Food: ? -> blueberry (because peas is in column 2)
* Hobby: camping -> no, board-games
* Movie-Genre: romance (not comedy, because that's on the right of juice)
* Music-Genre: folk
* Sport: water-polo

| Transport     | train          | car        | helicopter | jet-ski  |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clues 1 and 11, we know that the person reading is on the right of the guinea-pig owner, and the train driver is on the far left. This means column 1 must be hiking (since gardening is on the far right) and the pet is a bird.

Clue 2 says crime movies are on the far right, which means onion is also on the far right. Clue 16 confirms this.

From clues 3 and 12, we know the spanish person drives a helicopter and is on the far right (since gardening is on the far right). This means column 4 must be spanish, pony, jet-ski, and crime movies.

Clues 5 and 6 confirm that the pony owner drives a jet-ski. Clue 9 says the american is on the right of the security-guard, which places the american in column 2.

From clues 10 and 15, we know the person eating blueberry is on the right of the security-guard, and the dog owner (scientist) is on the right of the blueberry eater. This means column 3 must be cranberry, bartender, animation movies, and japanese.

Clue 13 says fantasy movies are on the left of the cranberry eater, which places fantasy movies in column 2. Clue 8 confirms that the japanese person watches animation movies.

Finally, clue 4 says cranberry is on the right of the bartender, which means the food in column 3 must be cranberry.

I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 2, we know the Italian is on the left of the bartender. Since the Italian cannot be in position 4 (software-developer), they must be in either position 1 or 3.

2. Clue 12 tells us that the person driving the bus is on the far left, so position 1. This means the Canadian (clue 6) and the Italian are not in position 1, so they must be in positions 2 and 3.

3. From clue 14, we know the Italian watches disaster movies. Clue 9 tells us that cycling is associated with disaster movies, so the Italian's sport is cycling.

4. Clue 15 states that water-polo is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the person driving the bus (position 1) cannot be the person driving the boat, the person driving the boat must be in position 2 or 3.

5. From clue 7, we know the police-officer is on the left of the person driving the subway. Clue 5 tells us that the British drives the subway, so the police-officer must be in position 2 and the British in position 3.

6. The Canadian (clue 6) is on the right of the librarian, who cannot be in position 1 or 4. Therefore, the librarian must be in position 2.

7. Clue 13 tells us that cabbage is on the left of the person driving the subway (the British). This means the person eating cabbage is in position 2.

8. From clue 11, we know the software-developer (position 4) is on the right of the Indonesian. The Indonesian must be in either position 1 or 3, but since the person in position 3 drives the subway, it cannot be the Indonesian. Therefore, the Indonesian is in position 1.

9. Clue 8 tells us that watermelon is on the right of tennis. Since asparagus (clue 4) is on the right of goldfish and pumpkin (the only remaining food option) must be associated with a person who eats something other than asparagus or cabbage, we can determine the order of foods.

10. Clues 16 and 3 help us fill in the movie-genre column. Animation is associated with dog ownership (clue 16), while western movies are associated with water-polo (clue 3).

11. The remaining clues helped me fill in any gaps or confirm existing answers.
