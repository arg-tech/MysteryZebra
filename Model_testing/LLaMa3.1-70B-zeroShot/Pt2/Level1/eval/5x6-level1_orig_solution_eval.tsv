* Clue 8 revealed that the person who likes Chess is also the Chef, which helped anchor the table.
* Clues 2 and 11 established the relationship between Pumpkin, Soccer, and the Chef.

Lv1-5x6-7	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

From statement 19, the person eating grapefruit is also on the far left.
Combining statements 6 and 19, we can fill in column 1.

From statement 12, the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left, so they are in column 1.

From statement 22, the fan of blues is on the right of the person eating grapefruit.
From statement 17, the fan of blues is also the person eating blueberry.
Combining statements 22 and 17, we can fill in column 2.

* From clue 1 and clue 12, we can deduce that the social-worker is in column 2, and the owner of the guinea-pig is in column 3 or 4.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk owns the guinea-pig, which means they must be in column 4.
* Clue 9 places the person drinking water on the left of the person drinking juice (in columns 1 and 5).
* From clue 6, we know the fan of trance drinks juice, so they are in column 5.
* Clue 20 places the person who's sport is sailing to the right of the person drinking juice, which means they must be in column 6.

Let me explain the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 7, we know the musician is on the far left.
* From clue 18, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left. This must be the same person as the musician.
* From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is rugby is on the far left. Again, this must be the same person as the musician and hiker.
* From clue 6, we know the person watching thriller movies is the indian. Since the indian is also on the far left (from clue 22), we can fill in the first row of columns.
* Clue 11 tells us that the person who's sport is lacrosse is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby, so the lacrosse player must be in column 4.
* Clues 5 and 13 tell us that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the brazilian, and the brazilian is on the right of the lacrosse player. Therefore, the person watching fantasy movies is in column 3.
* From clue 14, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the chef. Since the chef cannot be in column 1 (because the musician is there), and column 6 is already occupied by the magic-tricks enthusiast, the chef must be in column 5. The person with the hobby ""drawing"" must then be in column 2.
* Clues 15 and 21 tell us that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left of the person who's hobby is board-games, which is also the architect. Since the architect is on the left of the person watching mystery movies (from clue 10), we can deduce that the architect is in column 3 and the person with the hobby ""board-games"" is in column 4.
* From clues 16 and 1, we know that the person who's hobby is board-games is on the left of the japanese, which means the japanese is in column 6. We can also confirm that the person with the hobby ""magic-tricks"" is indeed in column 6 (from clue 1).
* Clue 8 tells us that the person who's sport is handball is on the far right. Since this must be the same person as the japanese, we can fill in the last row of columns.
* The remaining clues help to confirm our solution and provide additional details.
