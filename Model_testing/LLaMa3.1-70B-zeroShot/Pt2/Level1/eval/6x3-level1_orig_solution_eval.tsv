This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know that the person driving the tram is on the far right.
* From clue 1, we know that the fan of indie is the person driving the tram.
* From clue 5, we know that the fan of indie is eating apple, so column 3 must be eating apple.
* From clue 10, we know that the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right, which confirms that column 3 is for climbing and transport is tram.
* Clues 2 and 6 help us determine the order of columns 1 and 2 for sport and transport.
* The remaining clues are used to fill in the other cells.

#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, we know the person who likes handball is on the far left. This means column 1 is for handball.
* From clue 8, we know the electrician (who is Turkish, according to clue 1) is on the right of the person who likes hiking. Since the electrician can't be in column 1 (due to clue 4), the hiker must be in column 1.
* Clue 7 tells us that comedy is on the left of satire, which means comedy is in column 1 and satire is in column 2.
* From clue 5, we know camping is with motorbike. Since hiking is already in column 1, camping can't be there (due to clue 8). Therefore, camping must be in column 2 or 3.
* Clue 6 tells us the Turkish person (electrician) is on the left of zombie movies. This means zombie must be in column 3, and since electrician is already in column 2 (from clue 3), it's consistent with this information.
* With comedy in column 1 and satire in column 2, we can now deduce that malaysian is in column 3 (due to clue 2).
* Clue 9 tells us the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of rugby. Since jet-ski must be in either column 2 or 3 (since train and motorbike are already taken), this means rugby is in column 2, and jet-ski is in column 3.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks: fishing goes with rugby (column 2) doesn't have a sport yet, paramedic goes with hiking (column 1) doesn't have a job yet, and baseball goes with satire (column 2) which already has a movie-genre.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."	{'hobby': ['hiking', 'camping', 'fishing'], 'job': ['paramedic', 'electrician', 'software-developer'], 'movie-genre': ['comedy', 'satire', 'zombie'], 'nationality': ['polish', 'turkish', 'malaysian'], 'sport': ['handball', 'baseball', 'rugby'], 'transport': ['train', 'motorbike', 'jet-ski']}	True	14	False
Lv1-6x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution:

| Transport     | Bus          | Quad-bike   | Train       |

However, upon re-examining the clues, I noticed that clue #5 implies that the person driving the train is on the left of the person watching western movies. But in the above solution, the person watching western movies (Guinea-pig owner) is already on the far right. This means we need to swap the German and Canadian columns.


Here's the corrected solution:

Lv1-6x3-4	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |    1     |     2     |      3      |
| Food          | nectarine | broccoli | plum         |

| Nationality   | british   | german    | american     |
| Pet           | rat       | rabbit   | goat         |

Here's how I solved it:


From clue 10, we know the British person's hobby is fishing, so they must be in position 1.


From clue 5, we know the British person (position 1) is to the left of the owner of the rat. From clue 7, we know the architect owns the rat, and from clue 2, we know the owner of the rat is to the left of the owner of the goat. Therefore:


Position 1: British (fishing)
Position 2: Architect (rat)


From clue 9, we know the person eating nectarine is to the left of the firefighter. Since the person in position 1 eats nectarine, the firefighter must be in position 3.


From clue 4, we know the person watching fantasy movies is in position 2. From clue 6, we know the manager watches romance movies, and from clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is to the right of the owner of the rabbit (which must be in position 2). Therefore:


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: ? (romance, goat)


From clue 6, we know the manager watches romance movies. Since the person in position 3 eats plum (from clue 1), they must be the manager.


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since position 2 has a rat and not a rabbit, the person in position 3 must own the rabbit.


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


From clue 8 again, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Therefore:


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


From clue 8 once more, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is to the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since position 1 has a British person with fishing as their hobby, they can't be in this position. Therefore:


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


From clue 6 again, we know the manager watches romance movies. Since position 2 has fantasy movies, and position 3 has romance movies:


Position 1: British (fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


The only movie-genre left is mystery, which must be in position 1.


Position 1: British (mystery, fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plumber)


The only food left is broccoli, which must be in position 2.


Position 1: British (mystery, fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, rat, broccoli, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, goat, plum)


The only nationality left is German and American. From clue 3, we know the firefighter is to the right of the american:


Position 1: British (mystery, fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, german, rat, broccoli, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, american, goat, plum)


From clue 3 again, we know the firefighter is to the right of the american. Therefore:


Position 1: British (mystery, fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, german, rat, broccoli, reading)
Position 3: Manager (romance, american, goat, plum)


The only job left is firefighter, which must be in position 3.


Position 1: British (mystery, fishing, nectarine)
Position 2: Architect (fantasy, german, rat, broccoli, reading)
Position 3: American (romance, firefighter, goat, plum)

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 7, we know the lawyer is on the far left.
2. From clue 8, we know the lawyer watches crime movies, so column 1 is complete.
3. From clue 6, we know the fan of folk music is on the right of the lawyer, which means the person eating plums (clue 9) must be in the middle.
4. From clue 2, we know the journalist is on the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. Since the lawyer is already in column 1, the journalist must be in column 2.
5. From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is parkour is also the person who's hobby is drawing. This person cannot be in column 1 (lawyer), so they must be in column 3.
6. From clue 5, we know the fan of hip-hop is the person eating raspberry. Since column 2 has grapes (clue 4), the person eating raspberry must be in column 3.
7. The remaining movie-genre (adventure) must be in column 2. Clue 1 tells us that this person is to the right of the person who's sport is skiing, so skiing must be in column 1.
8. Clue 4 gives us a relationship between baking and grapes, which means baking must be in column 2.
9. The remaining hobby (reading) must be in column 1.

Lv1-6x3-6	"Here's my step-by-step process:


From clue #7, we can start by placing ""writing"" in column 1.


From clue #4, the person whose hobby is writing likes electronic music.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      |             |             |               |

| Sport         |             |             |               |

From clue #1, the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person whose hobby is board-games.


Since ""writing"" is already in column 1, and there are no other hobbies left for column 2 (as magic-tricks is to the right of Brazilian), board-games must be in column 1, and coffee must be in either column 2 or 3. But from clue #6, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. We don't know yet what the person's hobby is whose sport is parkour, so it can only be board-games.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      |             | coffee      |               |

From clue #9, the person eating mango is on the far right.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      |             | coffee      |               |

From clue #8, the person eating lime is on the right of the Canadian.


Since there are no other food options left for column 2, and since we already know that mango is in column 3, it must be that the person who's food is lime is in column 3 (even though this doesn't add up), or more probably that the person eating lime is actually in column 1. Since there are only three countries left, Brazilian can be placed anywhere except for column 2.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      |             | coffee      |               |

From clue #6, the person drinking almond-milk is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.


Since there are no other beverage options left for column 2 and since we already know that coffee is in column 2, it must be that almond-milk is actually in column 1. The person whose hobby is magic-tricks can now be placed as well.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      |               |

From clue #2, the person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour.


Since we already know that coffee is in column 2 and since there are no other beverage options for column 3 except sprite (since it can't be almond-milk or coffee), sprite must be in column 3. As well, ice-hockey can now be placed.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      | sprite        |

| Nationality   | canadian    | brazilian? | dutch? or can?|
| Sport         | ice-hockey  | parkour     |               |

From clue #3, the person whose hobby is magic-tricks is on the right of the Brazilian.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      | sprite        |

| Sport         | ice-hockey  | parkour     |               |

From clue #5, the person whose sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the fan of hip-hop.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      | sprite        |

| Nationality   | canadian    | brazilian  | dutch         |
| Sport         | ice-hockey  | parkour     |               |

From clue #10, the fan of indie is on the far right.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      | sprite        |

| Nationality   | canadian    | brazilian  | dutch         |
| Sport         | ice-hockey  | parkour     | weightlifting |

And finally, since strawberry is the only food option left for column 2, it can be placed there.


Now we have:


|               |      1      |      2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | almond-milk| coffee      | sprite        |

From clue 8, we know that the person with video-games as their hobby is in the middle.

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Hobby         |            |           Video-Games       |             |

From clue 9, the person driving the bike is on the left of the person who's sport is weightlifting. 

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Transport     | Bike       |               | Weightlifting|

From clue 1, the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Movie-Genre   |            |               | Time-Travel |

From clue 7, the person watching time-travel movies is the owner of the cat.

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Pet           |            |               | Cat          |

From clue 5, the person who's hobby is card-games is the person watching sports movies. 

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Hobby         | Card-Games | Video-Games                |             |

Now we know column 1 and 2.

From clue 6, the person who's sport is cricket is the fan of soul. Since weightlifting must be on the left of time-travel (Clue 1), cricket can't be in column 3 as it would leave no room for weightlifting and time-travel.

|               |     1      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3      |
| Sport         | Cricket    |            | Weightlifting|

From clue 2, the person who's sport is rowing is the owner of the dog. Rowing can't be in column 1 since cricket already occupies that spot.

|               |     1 (Cricket)      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3 (Weightlifting) |
| Sport         | Cricket    | Rowing                    | Weightlifting|

Now we know the sports for each person. 

From clue 4, the fan of jazz is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.

|               |     1 (Cricket)      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3 (Weightlifting) |
| Music-Genre   |            | Jazz                     |

Now we can find the music-genre for the remaining two columns. Funk and Soul are left, so they must go to column 1 and 3 in some order.

From clue 6, the person who's sport is cricket is the fan of soul. 

|               |     1 (Cricket)      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3 (Weightlifting) |
| Music-Genre   | Soul         | Jazz                     | Funk           |

Now we can find the movie-genre for column 1, which is sports.

From clue 3, the person watching martial-arts movies is the person driving the airplane. This must be in column 2 since it can't fit anywhere else given the other information.


|               |     1 (Cricket)      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3 (Weightlifting) |
| Movie-Genre   | Sports        | Martial-Arts           | Time-Travel |

Now we have only one hobby left for column 3, which is dancing.

|               |     1 (Cricket)      |       2 (Video-Games)       |      3 (Weightlifting) |
| Hobby         | Card-Games   | Video-Games              | Dancing        |

Lastly, the pet and transport information can be filled in with what's left.


Here is the final solution:

Lv1-6x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Zucchini    | Peach      | Asparagus |

| Job           | Musician    | Freelancer | Accountant |

| Music-Genre   | Ambient     | Gospel     | Reggae     |
| Sport         | Snowboarding| Skiing      | Volleyball |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 5, we know the accountant is on the far right (column 3).

From clue 4, we know the person watching satire movies is in the middle (column 2). Clue 9 also tells us that the fan of gospel is in the middle.

Clue 6 states that the fan of gospel is on the right of the person eating zucchini. Since the fan of gospel is in the middle, the person eating zucchini must be on the left (column 1).

From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is traveling eats peach. Clue 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the musician can't be in column 1 (zucchini), and the accountant is already in column 3, the musician must be in column 2. The person watching musical movies is to their left, which means they are eating peach.

Clue 8 tells us that the fan of ambient is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person eating zucchini is on the left, and the fan of ambient can't be in column 2 (gospel), the fan of ambient must eat zucchini.

From clue 1, we know the person watching musical movies is to the left of the musician. This means they are in column 1, which is also consistent with them eating peach not being true (because peach is eaten by the person who's hobby is traveling).

Clue 7 states that the person who's sport is skiing is in the middle. Clue 3 also tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person eating asparagus can't be on the left (zucchini), and the accountant is already on the right, the person eating asparagus must eat musical.

The rest of the information falls into place from here.

Let me explain the steps to solve the puzzle:

From clue 2, we know the Dutch is on the far left.
From clue 7, we know the Dutch is driving a bike. So, column 1 is fixed.

Column 1:
|               |    1     |
| Food          |         |
| Job           |         |

| Nationality   | dutch   |
| Pet           |         |
| Transport     | bike    |

From clue 4, we know the accountant is on the far right. So, column 3 is fixed.

Column 3:
|               |       3      |
| Food          |            |
| Job           | accountant |

| Nationality   | indian     |
| Pet           |         |
| Transport     | train    |

From clue 1, we know the owner of the hamster is in the middle. So, column 2 is fixed for Pet.

Column 2:
|               |      2       |
| Food          |            |
| Job           |            |

| Nationality   | brazilian  |
| Pet           | hamster    |
| Transport     | trike        |

From clue 3, we know the person eating mango is on the left of the Indian. Since column 1 and column 2 are already occupied by Dutch and Hamster, Mango must be in column 1.

Column 1:
|               |    1     |
| Food          | mango   |
| Job           |         |
| Movie-Genre   |         |
| Nationality   | dutch   |
| Pet           | dog     |
| Transport     | bike    |

From clue 6, we know the person eating broccoli is on the left of the videographer. Since column 1 is already occupied by Mango, Broccoli must be in column 2.

Column 2:
|               |      2       |
| Food          | broccoli     |
| Job           |            |
| Movie-Genre   |            |
| Nationality   | brazilian  |
| Pet           | hamster    |
| Transport     | trike        |

From clue 5, we know the videographer is on the right of the owner of the rabbit. Since column 2 is already occupied by Hamster, Rabbit must be in column 1 or column 3. But since column 1 is already occupied by Dog and column 3 is already occupied by Accountant (who can't have a pet), we know the person having Rabbit is not an accountant but rather a Chef.

Column 2:
|               |      2       |
| Food          | broccoli     |
| Job           | videographer|

| Nationality   | brazilian  |
| Pet           | hamster    |
| Transport     | trike        |

From clue 8, we know the person driving the trike is on the left of the person watching epic movies. Since column 2 has a Trike and Broccoli, it must be watching Western or Romance.

Column 1:
|               |    1     |
| Food          | mango   |
| Job           | chef    |
| Movie-Genre   | romance |
| Nationality   | dutch   |
| Pet           | dog     |
| Transport     | bike    |

From clue 9, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person watching romance movies. Since column 2 has a Trike and Broccoli, it must be watching Epic.

Column 2:
|               |      2       |
| Food          | broccoli     |
| Job           | videographer|
| Movie-Genre   | epic         |
| Nationality   | brazilian  |
| Pet           | hamster    |
| Transport     | trike        |

Since column 3 has an Accountant, it must be watching Western.

Column 3:
|               |       3      |
| Food          | raspberry  |
| Job           | accountant |

Lv1-6x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Food          | peach    | garlic        | cranberry  |
| Job           | teacher  | fisherman     | lawyer     |
| Movie-Genre   | mystery  | satire        | scientific|
| Music-Genre   | ambient  | blues         | rock       |
| Sport         | lacrosse | skateboarding| ice-hockey |
| Transport     | scooter  | car           | helicopter |

The reasoning behind the solution is as follows:

* From clue 8, we know that the fan of ambient music is in the middle, so they are in position 2.
* From clue 7, we know that the fan of rock music is on the far right, so they are in position 3.
* From clue 1, we know that the person watching satire movies is on the right of the person eating peach. Since the person eating peach can't be on the far right (because of the fan of rock), they must be in position 1.
* From clue 2, we know that the teacher is on the right of the person driving the scooter. This means that the teacher is not in position 1, and since the person eating peach is already in position 1, the teacher must be in position 2 or 3. But if they were in position 3, there would be no one to their left who drives a scooter (since the fan of rock is in position 3). Therefore, the teacher is in position 2.
* From clue 4, we know that the person driving the car is on the left of the person eating garlic. This means that the person eating garlic can't be in position 1, so they must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the teacher and fan of ambient are already in positions 2 and 3 (respectively), the person eating garlic must be in position 2 as well. However, this conflicts with our previous conclusion that the teacher is in position 2. Therefore, we re-evaluate our conclusions so far.
* From clue 5, we know that the person eating garlic is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. This means that the person watching mystery movies can't be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right who eats garlic). Therefore, they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* From clue 3, we know that the person whose sport is lacrosse is on the left of the fisherman. This means that the person whose sport is lacrosse can't be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right who is a fisherman). Therefore, they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* From clue 6, we know that the fisherman is on the left of the person whose sport is ice-hockey. This means that the fisherman can't be in position 3 (since there's no one to their right who has ice-hockey as their sport). Therefore, they must be in either position 1 or 2.
* Putting it all together, we get:
