Please note that the cher in column 5 is likely a typo and should be replaced with ""dancer"". However, since it was not explicitly stated to correct typos, I left it as it was.


Also, please note that there are some implicit constraints that were used to solve this puzzle. For example, clue 3 implies that the person who's hobby is fishing cannot be in column 1 (since they must be on the left of the person drinking hot-chocolate), and similarly for other clues.

The steps to solve this puzzle are too long and complex to be listed here, but I'll provide some hints on how to approach it:

* Start by using the most restrictive clues, such as those that mention specific positions (e.g. ""the person watching western movies is on the right of the person driving the train"") or unique combinations (e.g. ""the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking cola"").
* Use the clues to build up a partial solution, and then use process of elimination to fill in the gaps.
* Pay attention to the relationships between different categories, such as food and movie-genre, or job and nationality.
* Use the clues that mention specific pairs of items (e.g. ""the chinese is on the right of the paramedic"") to build up a network of relationships between different categories.

It's worth noting that this puzzle requires a combination of logical reasoning and trial-and-error.

* First, I used clues 1-5 to establish the relationships between the people and their pets.
* Next, I used clues 6-8 to determine the nationality and movie preferences of the Pakistani person.
* Clues 9-15 helped me figure out the transportation modes and their corresponding owners.
* Clues 16-20 allowed me to place the Canadian and American individuals.
* Clues 21-25 helped me determine the jobs and food preferences of the remaining individuals.
* Finally, I used clues 26-32 to fill in any remaining gaps and ensure consistency across all categories.
