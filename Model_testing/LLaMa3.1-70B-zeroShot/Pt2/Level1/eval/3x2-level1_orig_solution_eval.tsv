Lv1-3x2-1	"Based on the given clues:

1. The person drinking hot-chocolate is on the right of the Turkish.
   This implies that the Turkish person is in column 1, and the person drinking hot-chocolate is in column 2.

2. The Turkish is the person who's sport is golf.
   From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is in column 1. So, the sport for column 1 is golf.

Given this information:

|               |    1    |       2       |
| Beverage      |         |               |

| Sport         |         |               |

We can start filling in the table:

- Column 1: Nationality = Turkish, Sport = Golf
- Since there are only two nationalities and beverages left for column 2 (which has hot-chocolate), the remaining nationality must be Egyptian. 

The completed table looks like this:


#############

Lv1-3x2-2	"I'll help you solve the logic puzzle. Here's my step-by-step reasoning:

From statement 1, we know that the person who sings is on the left of the person watching adventure movies.

From statement 2, we know that the owner of the fish is on the far right.

Let's start by placing the person who owns the fish in the rightmost column (Column 2). Since there are only two columns, this means the singing person must be in Column 1 (left).

Now, let's think about the movie genres. We know that the adventure movies fan is not on the left (because of statement 1), so they must be on the right. This means that the martial-arts movies fan is on the left.

Here's what we have so far:

|               |      1       |      2       |
| Hobby         | Singing    |              |
| Movie-Genre   | Martial-arts| Adventure    |
| Pet           |              | Fish          |

Now, let's think about the hobby of the person on the right. We know it can't be singing (because that's already taken by Column 1), so it must be magic-tricks.

Finally, we need to assign a pet to the person in Column 1. Since the fish is already assigned to Column 2, this means the goat must go to Column 1.

Here's the final solution table:


#############
|               |      1       |      2       |
| Hobby         | Singing    | Magic-tricks|

Lv1-3x2-3	"Based on the given information:


Since the dressmaker is on the far left (clue 2), the person on the left must be a dressmaker.

The person driving the tram is on the left of the owner of the mouse (clue 1). Since the dressmaker is already placed on the left, and it's not mentioned that they own a pet or transport, we can conclude that the person driving the tram is actually the electrician. The person owning the mouse must be on the right.


Considering the options for job, pet, and transport:


The dressmaker (on the far left) could either use the bus or have no specified transport mentioned in the clues.


Given the available options:


|             |     1      |      2      |
| Job         | Dressmaker| Electrician|
| Pet         |            | Mouse      |

Lv1-3x2-4	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is gardening drinks Fanta.

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since there are only two columns, this means that the person driving the helicopter must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in what we know:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    |            | Fanta     |
| Hobby       |            | Gardening |
| Transport   | Helicopter |           |

The person drinking Mirinda cannot be the same as the person drinking Fanta, so they must be in column 1. The hobby of the person in column 1 is not gardening (since it's camping), and the transport method for the person in column 2 is not helicopter (since it's roller). Therefore:

|             |     1      |     2     |
| Beverage    | Mirinda   | Fanta     |
| Hobby       | Camping   | Gardening |
| Transport   | Helicopter | Roller    |

The final solution table is:

Lv1-3x2-5	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the guinea-pig drives a quad-bike.
2. The owner of the frog is to the left of the person whose hobby is board-games.

From clue 2, we know that the person with the frog cannot have the hobby board-games (since someone else has it and they're to the left). So, the person with the frog must have the hobby traveling.

Now, let's fill in what we can:

|             |     1     |      2      |
| Hobby       |           | Board-Games|

| Transport   |          |           |

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the guinea-pig drives a quad-bike. The only person left is in column 1, so they must drive a motorbike.

Now we can fill in the remaining blanks:

|             |     1     |      2      |

Lv1-3x2-6	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 2, we know that the analyst is on the far right, so:

|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   |           |            |
| Job     |           | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           |            |

Now, let's consider clue 1: ""the person who's hobby is singing is on the left of the person who's sport is basketball"". This means that:

* The person who sings must be in column 1.
* The person whose sport is basketball must be in column 2.

So, we can fill in the hobby for column 1 and the sport for column 2:

|         |     1     |     2      |
| Hobby   | Singing  |            |
| Job     |           | Analyst    |
| Sport   |           | Basketball |

Now, let's think about the remaining options. The person who sings cannot have basketball as their sport (since singing is on the left of basketball), so they must prefer skiing. Similarly, the analyst in column 2 cannot have hiking as their hobby (since that would leave no room for the other hobby), so the bartender must be in column 1 and have hiking as their hobby.

Here's the completed table:

#############
|         |     1     |     2      |

Lv1-3x2-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

Clue 1: The person who's sport is skateboarding is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking.
This means that cooking must be in column 1, and skateboarding must be in column 2.

Clue 2: The person driving the quad-bike is on the far left.
This means that the quad-bike must be in column 1.

Now, let's fill in the table:

|             |     1     |       2       |
| Hobby       | Cooking   | Skydiving    |
| Sport       |           | Skateboarding|
| Transport   | Quad-bike |               |

Since sailing is the only remaining sport, it must be in column 1. And since roller is the only remaining means of transport, it must be in column 2.

Here's the final solution:

Lv1-3x2-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1     |    2     |
| Beverage      | Mirinda   | Tea       |
| Nationality   | Malaysian | American  |
| Sport         | Surfing   | Rowing    |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue (1), we know that the person drinking tea is also the person who rows. This means that Tea and Rowing must be paired together in one of the columns.

From clue (2), we know that the American is to the right of the person who surfs. Since there are only two nationalities, this means that the Malaysian must be on the left, surfing.

Putting it all together, we get the solution above.

Lv1-3x2-9	"Based on the given clues:


Clue 1: The fan of punk is on the right of the person driving the train.
This means that the person driving the train cannot be a fan of punk, and there must be someone to the right of them who is.


Clue 2: The person watching thriller movies is the person driving the taxi.

Let's start filling in the table:


Since the person watching thriller movies drives a taxi (from Clue 2), we can fill that information directly into the table.


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller    |          |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Transport     | Taxi        |          |

Now, based on Clue 1, since the punk fan is to the right of the train driver and there are only two columns, the person driving the train must be in column 1. Also, since the taxi and thriller movie go together (from Clue 2), they are already placed in column 1.


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller    |          |
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Transport     | Taxi        | Train    |

The person driving the train must be watching a different movie genre, which is time-travel. Since the punk fan is to the right of them and we have thriller in column 1, time-travel goes with the train.


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller    | Time-travel|
| Music-Genre   |             |          |
| Transport     | Taxi        | Train    |

Given that the person driving the train is not a punk fan (from Clue 1) and there are only two music genres, indie must be associated with the train.


|               |      1      |    2     |
| Movie-Genre   | Thriller    | Time-travel|
| Music-Genre   |             | Indie    |
| Transport     | Taxi        | Train    |

By elimination, since punk is left and it's not associated with column 1 (thriller), punk goes with the taxi.
