Lv1-2x3-1	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person whose sport is rugby is in the middle, so the ""Sport"" column for position 2 must be ""Rugby"".

2. The person drinking juice is the person who's sport is surfing, so we can combine these two.

3. The person drinking almond-milk is on the far left.


Here's the initial table with the information:


|            |      1      |   2    |    3    |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk |        |         |
| Sport      |             | Rugby |         |

Now, let's fill in the rest of the table. Since the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left and the person whose sport is rugby is in the middle, we can conclude that:


* The person drinking juice (whose sport is surfing) must be on the far right.

Here's the updated table:


|            |      1      |   2    |    3    |
| Beverage   | Almond-milk |        | Juice   |
| Sport      |             | Rugby | Surfing |

The only beverage left for position 2 is ""Coffee"", and since Biathlon is the only sport left, it must be paired with Coffee.


Here's the final table:

Lv1-2x3-2	"Let's analyze the puzzle step by step:


From clue 2, we know the Canadian is on the far left.


|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      |          |           |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian |           |          |

 
From clue 3, we know the Canadian drinks iced-tea.


|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea |           |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian |           |          |

 
From clue 1, we know the Argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since the Canadian is already on the far left, the Argentine must be in position 2.


|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea |          |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Argentine |          |

 
Now we have two options for the beverage of the Argentine: Fanta or Tea. However, if the Argentine drinks tea, then the clue ""the argentine is on the left of the person drinking tea"" becomes meaningless. Therefore, the Argentine must drink Fanta.


|               |    1     |     2     |    3     |
| Beverage      | Iced-tea | Fanta     |          |
| Nationality   | Canadian | Argentine |          |

 
Finally, by process of elimination, we can determine that the person drinking tea is Nigerian and is in position 3.

Lv1-2x3-3	"A nice logic puzzle! Let's break it down step by step.

From statement 1, we know that the person drinking tea is on the right of the person eating radish.

|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   |          |        |           |
| Food       |          | Radish | Tea       |

Now, let's consider statement 2: the person drinking water is on the left of the person eating raspberry. This means that Water and Raspberry must be in positions 1 and 2 or positions 2 and 3.

Since we already have Radish in position 2, Water and Raspberry must be in positions 1 and 2.

|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   | Water  |        |           |
| Food       | Raspberry | Radish | Tea       |

Now, let's consider statement 3: the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person eating radish. This means that Soy-Milk must be in position 1, which conflicts with our previous conclusion that Water is in position 1.

Wait a minute... What if we swap positions 2 and 3 for Radish and Tea? Then, we can have Soy-Milk on the left of Radish.

|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   |          |        |           |
| Food       |          | Tea      | Radish |

And now, let's put Water and Raspberry in positions 2 and 3, as before:

|            |    1     |   2    |     3     |
| Beverage   | Soy-Milk | Water  | Tea       |
| Food       | Plum    | Raspberry | Radish |

Finally, we have a plum left to place. We can put it in position 1.

Here is the final solution:

Lv1-2x3-4	"Let's break down the clues:

* The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the far left (Clue 3), so we can fill in the first column:

| Hobby   | Woodworking |            |             |

* The person eating radish is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (Clue 1), so Radish must be in either column 2 or 3. But since it can't be on the left of Woodworking, we can place Radish in column 3 for now:
|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |

* The person eating pomegranate is on the right of the person who's hobby is card-games (Clue 2). Since Pomegranate can't be in column 1, it must be in either column 2 or 3. But we already have Radish in column 3, so Pomegranate must be in column 2. We also know that Card-Games can't be in column 1 (since Woodworking is there), so it must be in either column 2 or 3. Given the placement of Pomegranate and Radish, we can deduce that Card-Games must be in column 2 as well:
|         |      1      |     2      |      3      |
| Hobby   | Woodworking | Card-Games |             |
| Food    |             | Pomegranate | Radish      |

* Now we just need to fill in the remaining hobby and food. The only hobby left is Puzzles, which must be in column 3. And the only food left is Zucchini, which must be in column 1:

From clue 1, we know the person driving the trike owns the hedgehog.

From clue 3, we know the owner of the hedgehog (who drives the trike) is on the right of the person driving the airplane.

| Transport   | boat       |           |       |


From clue 1, we know that the person eating kiwi is on the right of the person driving the boat. Since the boat is in column 1, the person eating kiwi must be in either column 2 or column 3.

| Food        | strawberry |           |       |

Let's place kiwi in column 2 (we can always move it to column 3 later if needed):

From clue 2, we know that the person eating plum is on the right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person eating plum can't be in column 1 (because the boat is there), and we've already placed kiwi in column 2, the person eating plum must be in column 3.

Lv1-2x3-7	"Based on the given clues, we can deduce the following:

* Clue 3 states that the owner of the chinchilla is on the far left, so the top-left cell in the ""Pet"" row should be filled with ""chinchilla"".
* Clue 1 states that the fan of salsa is on the left of the fan of jazz. Since there are only three columns, this means that salsa must be in column 2 and jazz must be in column 3.
* Clue 2 states that the fan of r&b is the owner of the ferret. This means that r&b cannot be in column 1 (since it's not on the far left), so it must be in either column 2 or 3. However, since salsa is already in column 2 and jazz is in column 3, r&b must be in column 1.

From clue 1: The person playing card-games is to the right of the person eating asparagus.

From clue 3: The person eating peach plays card-games.

Combining these two, we know that the person eating peach (who plays card-games) is not in column 1, because they must be to the right of someone. So, the person eating peach must be in either column 2 or 3.

2. The owner of the rabbit is on the far right.

3. The person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles.

| Beverage      | Cola   | Sprite    | Tea    |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Comedy   | Zombie |

Explanation:

From clue 3, we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the left of the person drinking tea. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1 or 2. But if they were in position 2, then the person drinking tea would have to be in position 3, which would mean that the person watching zombie movies (also in position 3) is not on the far right of the person drinking sprite (contradicting clue 1). Therefore, the person watching adventure movies must be in position 1.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching zombie movies is on the far right, which means they must be in position 3.

Now, using clue 1, we can deduce that the person drinking sprite must be to the left of the person watching zombie movies. Since the person watching adventure movies is already in position 1, and the person watching zombie movies is in position 3, this means that the person drinking sprite must be in position 2.

The remaining beverage (cola) goes to the person watching adventure movies in position 1, and the remaining movie-genre (comedy) goes to the person drinking sprite in position 2.
