#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 4, we know that hot-chocolate is on the far right (column 4).
* From clue 10, we know that disco is also on the far right (column 4), but since hot-chocolate is already there, this means that disco must be in column 3 or not exist. However, from clue 2, we see that disco is indeed a valid option.
* Clue 1 gives us a relationship between drama and cricket.
* Clues 5 and 6 give us relationships between coffee, 7up, fanta, and parkour.
* From clue 8, we know the owner of the hamster is an R&B fan.
* By combining clues 3, 7, and 9, we can start filling in the movie-genre column.

After carefully applying these and other relationships from the remaining clues, I arrived at the solution table above."	{'beverage': ['coffee', '7up', 'fanta', 'hot-chocolate'], 'movie-genre': ['documentary', 'satire', 'drama', 'spy'], 'music-genre': ['r&b', 'indie', 'electronic', 'disco'], 'pet': ['hamster', 'pony', 'ferret', 'rat'], 'sport': ['cricket', 'handball', 'parkour', 'skiing']}	True	8	False

Lv1-5x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |  soy-milk  |   sprite |    cola   |   coffee   |
| Food          | pepper     | raspberry| garlic    | grapefruit|
| Nationality   | japanese   | chinese  | indonesian| thai       |
| Pet           | snake      | cat      | goat      | guinea-pig |
| Transport     | jet-ski    | roller   | taxi      | trike      |

This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Note that some clues were used to derive others, and some were used to confirm the consistency of the solution.


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 5, the jet-ski is on the far left, and from clue 11, soy-milk is also on the far left. This suggests that person 1 drinks soy-milk and uses a jet-ski.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person eating raspberry is to the left of the roller, so person 2 must eat raspberry.
* From clue 3, the roller is to the right of the snake, which implies that person 1 owns the snake (since person 1 is on the far left).
* Clue 8 says the Japanese is to the left of the person eating raspberry, so person 1 or 2 must be Japanese. Since person 1 has a pet and is already assigned soy-milk and jet-ski, it's more likely that person 2 is not Japanese (since there are no other clues linking person 2 to Japan). Therefore, I assign person 1 as Japanese.
* Clue 4 states the guinea-pig owner is on the far right, which means person 4 owns the guinea-pig. Clues 7 and 10 imply that person 4 is Thai and drinks coffee.
* The remaining clues were used to fill in the gaps:
	+ Clue 9 implies that person 3 eats garlic (since Indonesian is left of garlic eater).
	+ Clue 6 places cola on the right, so person 3 must drink cola.
	+ Clue 1 says goat owner is left of cat owner. With the remaining spaces, this means person 2 owns a cat and person 3 owns a goat.
	+ Clues 12 implies that grapefruit eater uses trike.

Now you can see how all the clues come together to form the complete table!

| Pet           | Bird       | Ferret    | Snake      | Lizard   |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clues 2 and 10, we know that the person with the hobby of gardening is on the far left and is also to the left of the owner of the snake. This places the gardener in column 1.
* Clue 12 tells us that the journalist is on the far left, which confirms the gardener's job as a journalist.
* Clue 8 (which is identical to clue 1) tells us that the dancer owns the snake. Since the gardener is to the left of the owner of the snake (clue 10), and the Australian is to the right of the owner of the snake (clue 11), we can place the dancer in column 3.
* Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the ferret eats potato. Clue 5 says that the owner of the ferret is to the right of the person who eats mango. This places the owner of the ferret in column 4.
* Clues 6 and 7 tell us that the musician is on the far right, which confirms the owner of the ferret's job as a musician (since they're in column 4).
* Clue 9 tells us that the person who eats pumpkin owns the lizard. This places the person who eats pumpkin in column 3.
* Clues 13 and 14 tell us that the Australian is to the right of the person who has skydiving as a hobby, and the Spanish is to the right of the Turkish. This allows us to fill in the nationalities for columns 2-4.

With these steps, we can complete the table with the correct information."	{'food': ['kale', 'mango', 'pumpkin', 'potato'], 'hobby': ['gardening', 'collecting', 'skydiving', 'drawing'], 'job': ['journalist', 'teacher', 'dancer', 'musician'], 'nationality': ['turkish', 'spanish', 'australian', 'canadian'], 'pet': ['bird', 'ferret', 'snake', 'lizard']}	True	12	False

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clues 1 and 10, we know that the person whose sport is rugby drives a van.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person whose sport is snowboarding is on the right of the person whose sport is rugby. This helps to fix the positions of these two people relative to each other.
* Since the pakistani drives a bike (clue 12), we can place them next to the person whose sport is rugby, as per clue 1.
* Clues 5 and 6 help us position the brazilian in relation to the person who watches sports movies and the person whose hobby is dancing.
* From clues 8 and 11, we know that the person whose sport is climbing is on the left of the brazilian, and the person whose hobby is gardening watches animation movies. This helps to fix their positions.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who skydives also snowboards, so they must be in column 4.
* Finally, clue 9 places the indonesian at the far right.

| Transport   | roller        | jet-ski     | airplane     | trike        |

Let's go through the reasoning:

* From clue 4, the person drinking coffee is on the far left.
* From clue 10, the person who's sport is baseball is the person drinking coffee. So, the first row is: coffee, baseball.
* From clue 2, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the far left. So, the hobby of the first person is puzzles.
* From clue 1, the manager is on the right of the person who's sport is lacrosse. Since the manager can't be on the far left (because of clue 5), and the person with lacrosse as their sport can't be on the far right (because of clue 3), we know that lacrosse must be in column 2.
* From clue 12, the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person driving the airplane. Since the airplane driver has lacrosse as their sport (clue 3), and lacrosse is in column 2, the jet-ski driver must be in column 1 or 2. But we already know that column 1 is taken by coffee and puzzles. So, the jet-ski driver must be in column 2.
* From clue 7, the person who's hobby is card-games is the person driving the jet-ski. So, the hobby of the second person is card-games.
* From clue 6, the person drinking hot-chocolate is the person driving the trike. Since we don't know where hot-chocolate is yet, let's keep going.
* From clue 5, the manager is the person who's sport is basketball. So, the job of the fourth person is manager, and their sport is basketball.
* From clue 8, the person drinking cola is the nurse. Since we don't know where cola is yet, let's keep going.
* From clue 11, the social-worker is on the left of the nurse. This means that the social-worker must be in column 2 or 3.
* From clue 13, the person drinking cola is on the right of the person driving the roller. Since we don't know where cola is yet, let's keep going.
* We now have a few options for the remaining columns. Let's try to fill them in:
	+ Column 3: The job can't be manager (because of clue 5), social-worker (because of clue 11), or videographer (because they're already in column 1). So, the job must be nurse. But we already know that cola is the drink of the nurse (clue 8). And from clue 13, cola is on the right of the roller driver. This means that the roller driver must be in column 3.
	+ Column 4: The only remaining drink is hot-chocolate. From clue 6, we know that hot-chocolate is the drink of the trike driver. So, the transport method of the fourth person is trike.

* Clue 11 tells us that the paramedic is the fan of indie music, and clue 4 tells us that the accountant drives a ship. Since the accountant can't be on the far left (because of the frog), they must be in column 3 or 4. The writer must also be to the left of the doctor (clue 12).
* Clues 1, 7, and 9 help us determine the order of columns 2-4: Western movies are watched by someone on the right of the writer, scientific movies are watched by someone on the left of the paramedic, and R&B is preferred by the doctor.
* With these constraints in mind, we can place the jobs, movie-genres, music-genres, pets, and transports accordingly."	{'job': ['paramedic', 'writer', 'accountant', 'doctor'], 'movie-genre': ['scientific', 'western', 'epic', 'fantasy'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'house', 'classical', 'r&b'], 'pet': ['frog', 'dog', 'hedgehog', 'fish'], 'transport': ['van', 'train', 'ship', 'subway']}	True	5	False
