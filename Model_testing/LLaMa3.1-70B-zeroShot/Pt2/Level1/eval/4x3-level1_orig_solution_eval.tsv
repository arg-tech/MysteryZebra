Lv1-4x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

| Beverage      | water  | mirinda    | juice     |

| Music-Genre   | reggae | blues       | folk      |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 2, we know the fan of reggae is on the far left. This sets the music-genre for column 1 to reggae.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person drinking water is eating pepper. Since water can't be in column 3 (because it's on the left of blues, according to clue 3), we place water and pepper in column 1.
* From clue 5, cauliflower must be in the middle (column 2).
* Clue 7 tells us that woodworking is also in the middle. Since chess is already associated with pepper (clue 4), woodworking goes with cauliflower.
* Mirinda and cranberry are paired according to clue 1. This means they go together in column 3.
* Sudoku is left as the hobby for column 1, as it's not mentioned anywhere else.
* Finally, folk is placed in column 3, as blues must be on the right of water (clue 3), and reggae is already in column 1."	{'beverage': ['water', 'mirinda', 'juice'], 'food': ['pepper', 'cauliflower', 'cranberry'], 'hobby': ['sudoku', 'woodworking', 'chess'], 'music-genre': ['reggae', 'blues', 'folk']}	True	8	False
Lv1-4x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 5, we know the Brazilian owns a snake and is on the far left.

| Food          |           |         |               |
| Hobby         |           |         |               |
| Nationality   | Brazilian |         |               |
| Pet           | Snake     |         |               |

From clue 6, we know the owner of the snake is indeed the Brazilian.


Now, let's analyze clue 1: The person eating pear is on the left of the person eating potato. Since the Brazilian (snake owner) is already on the far left, this means:


|               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
| Food          | Pear      | Potato  |               |

| Pet           | Snake     |         |               |

From clue 4, we know the person whose hobby is traveling is on the left of the person whose hobby is singing. Since the person eating pear (on the far left) can't have a hobby that's to the right of another hobby, this means:


|               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
| Food          | Pear      | Potato  |               |

| Pet           | Snake     |         |               |

From clue 3, we know the person whose hobby is rock-climbing is on the right of the Italian. Since the person eating pear (on the far left) can't be to the right of anyone, this means:


|               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
| Food          | Pear      | Potato  |               |
| Hobby         | Traveling | Singing | Rock-climbing|
| Nationality   | Brazilian | Italian |               |
| Pet           | Snake     |         |               |

From clue 2, we know the person eating radish is on the right of the owner of the rat. Since the person eating pear (on the far left) can't be to the right of anyone, this means:


|               |     1     |    2    |       3       |
| Food          | Pear      | Potato  | Radish      |

| Nationality   | Brazilian | Italian | Turkish     |
| Pet           | Snake     | Rat     | Hedgehog    |

We've now solved the puzzle!

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

* Clue 3: The dancer is on the left of the person driving the bus, so the dancer must be in column 1.
* Clue 5: The person watching adventure movies is on the left of the software-developer, so the person watching adventure movies must be in column 1 as well. Since the dancer is already in column 1, this implies that the dancer watches adventure movies.
* Clue 6: The person drinking mirinda is on the far right, which means they're in column 3.
* Clue 2: The person driving the subway is on the right of the person drinking almond-milk. Since the person drinking mirinda is already in column 3, this implies that the person drinking almond-milk is in column 2.
* Clue 1: The software-developer is the person driving the bus, which means they're in column 2 as well (since the dancer is on their left).
* Clue 4: The person watching zombie movies is in the middle, which implies that they're in column 2. Since the software-developer and almond-milk drinker are already in column 2, this must be one of them.
* Putting it all together:
	+ Column 1: Dancer, coffee, adventure, train
	+ Column 2: Software-developer, almond-milk, zombie, bus
	+ Column 3: Chef, mirinda, satire, subway"	{'beverage': ['coffee', 'almond-milk', 'mirinda'], 'job': ['dancer', 'software-developer', 'chef'], 'movie-genre': ['adventure', 'zombie', 'satire'], 'transport': ['train', 'bus', 'subway']}	True	12	True

| Food          | tomato    | pepper  | pear      |

| Movie-Genre   | horror    | drama   | western   |
| Music-Genre   | classical | punk    | rock      |

Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 2, we know the person eating tomato is on the left of the fisherman. So, tomato must be in column 1.


From clue 4, we know the person eating pear is the fan of rock. Since rock is on the right of punk (clue 1), pear must be in column 3.


Now, from clue 2 again, we can conclude that fisherman is in column 2.


Clue 5 tells us that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. Since there's only one space left for a job, analyst must be in column 1 and drama in column 3 (but we already have western in column 3, so drama must be in column 2). Therefore, the analyst is not in column 3.


From clue 5, we also know that the person watching drama movies is on the right of the analyst. So, drama can't be in column 1. Western must be in column 3 (because it's the only one left), and horror must be in column 1.


Now, from clue 3, we know the fan of classical is on the left of the person watching horror movies. Therefore, classical must be in column 1.


Punk is the only music genre left for column 2.


The lawyer is the only job left for column 2.


That's it!

Lv1-4x3-5	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 4, we know that the nurse (who likes video-games) is on the far left. So, the first column is filled.

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | Video-Games |             |           |

| Pet           |             |             |           |

From clue 5, we know that the person who likes cooking is the owner of the dog. From clue 2, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. So, the second column must be the person who likes cooking.

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | Video-Games | Cooking    |           |
| Job           | Nurse       |             |           |
| Movie-Genre   |             |             |           |
| Pet           |             | Dog        |           |

From clue 7, we know that the fisherman is on the left of the person who's hobby is singing. Since the first column is already filled with the nurse, the fisherman must be in the second column or the third column would have to be the singer and the fisherman could not be to their left.

However, from clue 1, we know that the person watching documentary movies is the fisherman. From clue 6, we know that the person watching superhero movies is the coach. Clue 7 suggests that the singer must be in either column 2 or 3 but since cooking is already in column 2 and column 2 cannot be the singer (fisherman has to be to their left), then column 2's job must be the fisherman.

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |
| Hobby         | Video-Games | Cooking    |           |

| Pet           |             | Dog        |           |

Since column 3's hobby must be singing (because it can't be cooking or video-games), and the coach watches superhero movies, then column 3's job is also the coach.

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |

| Pet           |             | Dog        |           |

Finally, the only pet left is the hedgehog and lizard. Clue 2 states that the owner of the hedgehog is to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking (column 2). Therefore, column 3 must be the owner of the lizard.

|               |      1      |      2      |     3     |

| Pet           |             | Dog        | Lizard    |

The only movie-genre left is musical. From the remaining options, it must be that column 1's hobby (video-games) likes musical.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the ferret is in the middle, so pet column has ferret in the second position.

From clue 1, we know that the person eating spinach is on the right of the fan of gospel. Since the middle column already has cherry and ferret, spinach must be on the far right.

| Sport         |           |              |         |

Now, let's look at the remaining options. The only music-genre left is gospel and house. Since gospel must be to the left of spinach, it must be in the middle column.

| Sport         |           |              |         |

The only sport left that can be paired with cherry is tennis (from clue 4), and the only pet left for the right column is rat.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, the fan of metal is on the far left, but this doesn't directly tell us anything about the other columns. We'll come back to this later.
* From clue 2, the dressmaker is on the right of the person eating cherry. This means that the dressmaker must be in column 3, and the person eating cherry must be in column 2.
* From clue 4, the person eating broccoli is on the right of the fan of funk. Since the person eating broccoli can't be in column 1 (due to clue 1), this means the fan of funk must be in column 1, and the person eating broccoli must be in column 2 or 3. But we already know that the person eating cherry is in column 2, so the person eating broccoli must be in column 1.
* From clue 3, the police-officer is on the right of the person watching horror movies. This means that the police-officer can't be in column 1 (since there's no one to their left). Given the movie-genre columns we have so far, it makes sense for the police-officer to be in column 2 or 3.
* From clue 5, the fan of pop is on the right of the person watching mystery movies. This means that the fan of pop can't be in column 1 (since there's no one to their left). Given the music-genre columns we have so far, it makes sense for the fan of pop to be in column 2 or 3.

| Transport     | van       |             | car          |

From clue 5, we know the owner of the rabbit is on the left of the person watching family movies:

| Transport     | van       |             | car          |

From clue 3, we know the person whose hobby is woodworking is in the middle:

From clue 1, we know that the ship driver is in the middle (2). 
From clue 5, we know that the software-developer is on the far left (1).
From clue 6, we know that the writing hobbyist is on the far right (3).

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |

| Job         | Software-Developer|            |          |

| Transport   |                    | Ship       |          |

From clue 4, we know that the accountant is the guinea-pig owner.
From clue 3, we know that the cooking hobbyist drives a roller.

Now, let's combine this information:
The software-developer (1) cannot be the accountant or have the writing hobby. So, their hobby must be chess and their pet is unknown yet.

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |
| Hobby       | Chess            |            | Writing  |
| Job         | Software-Developer|            |          |
| Pet         |                    |            | Goldfish |
| Transport   |                    | Ship       |          |

The cooking hobbyist (roller) can't be the software-developer or have the writing hobby. So, their job must be either accountant or mechanic.

Since the accountant owns a guinea-pig and is not on the far left (software-developer), they must be in the middle with the ship.

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |
| Hobby       | Chess            | Cooking   | Writing  |
| Job         | Software-Developer| Accountant|          |
| Pet         |                    | Guinea-Pig| Goldfish |
| Transport   |                    | Ship       |          |

Now, let's fill in the remaining blanks.
The person driving a roller is the cooking hobbyist (Accountant was ruled out), so they must be a mechanic.

|             |         1          |     2      |    3     |
| Hobby       | Chess            | Cooking   | Writing  |
| Job         | Software-Developer| Accountant| Mechanic|
| Pet         |                    | Guinea-Pig| Goldfish |
| Transport   |                    | Ship       | Roller   |

The only pet left is the goat, so it must belong to the software-developer.
The person driving a bus is unknown yet. It's not the roller or ship driver, so they must be the software-developer.
