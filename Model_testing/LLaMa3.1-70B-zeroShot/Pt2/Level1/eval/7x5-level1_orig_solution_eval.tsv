The person drinking juice is the owner of the hedgehog. 

However, I noticed that there are some empty cells in the final table. Since there is no direct information about the drinker of hot-chocolate's transport or the drinker of tea's job, hobby, and pet, or the drinker of fanta's hobby, pet, movie-genre, and job (except for not being a project-manager), I was unable to fill those cells.

| Transport     | boat               | car        | bus        | taxi         | bike        |


Let me walk you through how I solved it:


From clue 6, the egyptian is on the far left.
From clue 12, the person watching western movies is the egyptian.


From clue 10, the person watching documentary movies is on the right of the person driving the car. From clue 4, the social-worker is the person driving the car. So, the social-worker must be in column 2.


From clue 8, the colombian is on the right of the social-worker. Therefore, the colombian must be in column 3.


From clue 21, the fan of indie is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. From clue 14, the person driving the bike is the person who's sport is sailing. From clue 24, the software-developer is the person driving the bike. But there is no software-developer in the columns yet. Therefore, we can conclude that the fan of indie must be in column 3.


From clue 18, the fan of indie is in the middle. So, the middle column is 3.


Now, let's fill in some more information:


From clue 5, the person eating pineapple is on the right of the egyptian. Therefore, the pineapple-eater must be in column 2 or further to the right.


From clue 19, the italian is on the left of the person eating corn. So, we can't place corn yet.


From clue 17, the person who's sport is water-polo is on the left of the person who's sport is surfing. From clue 15, the fan of house is on the left of the person who's sport is water-polo.


At this point, I made an educated guess that column 1 would have a lemon-eater (because it was one of the few options left for column 1) and placed the rest of the columns based on the given clues. The rest fell into place quite easily!

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 3, we know the Brazilian is on the far left.
2. Clue 19 tells us that the pilot (fan of disco) is on the left of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the pilot can't be in position 1 (Brazilian), they must be in position 2 or 3. But clue 12 says the Dutch is in the middle, so the pilot must be in position 2.
3. Clue 23 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is the chef. From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is hiking is on the left of the chef. Since the pilot is already in position 2, the person who's hobby is hiking must be in position 1 or 3.
4. Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is German. From clue 11, we know the Dutch is on the right of the chef. So, the order for positions 2-4 is: pilot (Brazilian), chef (German), Dutch.
5. Clue 1 tells us that the person who's hobby is reading owns a snake. Since the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the person who's hobby is reading (clue 2), we can place them in positions 3 and 4, respectively.
6. From clue 10, we know the fan of gospel is in the middle (position 3).
7. Clue 14 tells us that the person driving the boat is on the right of the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the person who's hobby is drawing is also a software-developer (clue 20) and their sport is baseball (clue 20), we can place them in position 5.
8. Clue 15 tells us that the person driving the taxi is on the far right, so they must be in position 5.
9. Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the jet-ski is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since the person driving the quad-bike (German) can't be in position 1 or 2, they must be in position 3 or 4. But clue 23 says the chef drives the quad-bike, so it must be the German chef.
10. From clue 21, we know the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the fan of disco (pilot). Since the pilot is already in position 2, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 3 or 4.
