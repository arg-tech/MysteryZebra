Lv12-3x5-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution to the logic puzzle. Here's the final answer:


#################
|               |     1      |   2    |    3    |     4      |    5    |
| Hobby         | sudoku     | puzzles| collecting| cooking    | fishing  |
| Job           | teacher    | analyst| nurse     | accountant | lawyer   |
| Movie-Genre   | drama      | action  | fantasy   | zombie     | western  |
#################


Let's go through the reasoning step by step:

* From clue 2, we know the lawyer is on the far right.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is fishing is also on the far right. Since the lawyer is already there, this means the person who's hobby is fishing must be the same as the lawyer (as per clue 15).
* From clue 8, we know the accountant watches fantasy movies.
* Clue 13 tells us that the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions (2 and 4), this narrows it down to these two options.
* Clue 9 gives us a hint about the relationship between the person who's hobby is puzzles, western movies, and the accountant. This clue suggests that the person watching western movies cannot be in an odd position (since they're either next to or not next to the person who's hobby is puzzles). Therefore, the person watching western movies must be on the left side.
* Clue 4 tells us that the nurse is not to the right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an even position (2 or 4), this means the nurse cannot be in positions 3, 4, or 5.
* From clue 1, we know the nurse is between the analyst and the person who's hobby is collecting. Given that the nurse is not on the right side of the person who's hobby is puzzles (clue 4), this means the nurse must be to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
* Clues 5 and 6 help us determine the order of jobs and hobbies:
	+ The teacher cannot be next to the nurse (clue 5).
	+ The person watching zombie movies is between the person watching action movies and the person who's hobby is puzzles (clue 6). This means that the person watching action movies must be in position 2, followed by the person watching zombie movies.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person who's hobby is collecting and the accountant have different parity positions. Since the accountant watches fantasy movies, this means the person who's hobby is collecting cannot be in an odd position (which would put them next to the accountant).
* Finally, clue 7 gives us a hint about the relationship between the person who's hobby is cooking and the person watching fantasy movies. This clue tells us that the person who's hobby is cooking cannot be to the right of the person watching fantasy movies.

Putting all these clues together leads us to the final solution:

Lv12-3x5-4	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3     |     4     |    5    |

| Transport     | subway     | jet-ski   | roller    | ship      | bike     |

Note: I've used the clues to fill in the table. Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* Clues 9 and 3 tell us that the fan r&b is on the far left or far right, and so is the person driving the subway. Since the fan r&b is also the person who's hobby is board-games (clue 17), we can place them in position 1.
* Clues 2 and 10 tell us that the fan folk is to the left of the fan salsa, and the person driving the subway is to the right of the fan salsa. Since the fan r&b is on the far left, this means the fan salsa must be in position 2 or 3.
* Clue 13 tells us that the person driving the jet-ski has a different parity position than the fan salsa. This means the jet-ski cannot be in an even position if salsa is in an odd position, and vice versa. Since salsa is in position 2 (an even position), this means the jet-ski must be in position 3 (an odd position).
* Clue 16 tells us that the person who's hobby is skydiving is in an odd position. The only remaining odd position is position 4, so we can place them there.
* Clues 7 and 14 tell us that the fan soul is to the right of the person who's hobby is board-games, and the person driving the subway or the person who's hobby is writing is the fan soul. Since the person driving the subway is already placed in position 1, this means the person who's hobby is writing must be the fan gospel (clue 15). We can place them in position 3.
* Clues 6 and 18 tell us that the person driving the bike is to the right of the person who's hobby is skydiving, and they have the same parity positions. This means the person driving the bike must be in an even position (position 5).
* Clue 8 tells us that the fan r&b is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since the fan r&b is already placed in position 1, this means the person who's hobby is gardening cannot be in position 4 or 5. The only remaining position for them is position 4.
* Clue 12 tells us that the fan salsa is not to the right of the person who's hobby is gardening. Since salsa is already placed in position 2, this means the person who's hobby is card-games must be in position 5.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification."

Lv12-3x5-6	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.


After analyzing all the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


###########
|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | 7up        | cola      | water   | soy-milk  | coffee  |
| Nationality   | chinese    | malaysian | thai    | german    | british |
| Transport     | snowmobile | motorbike | scooter | van       | train   |
###########


Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 4, the Thai is in the middle (position 3).


From clue 1, the German is on the left or right of the person drinking water. Since the Thai is in position 3, the German must be in position 4.


From clue 2, the British is to the right of the Thai, so the British must be in position 5.


From clue 6, the Malaysian is between the person drinking 7up and the German. The only possible position for the Malaysian is 2.


From clue 8, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the Chinese. Since the Malaysian is in position 2, the Chinese must be in position 1.


From clue 9, the person drinking 7up is on the left or right of the person drinking coffee. Since the British is already in position 5, the person drinking coffee must also be in an odd-numbered position. The only possible position for the person drinking coffee is 5, but this would mean the British and the person drinking coffee have the same parity positions, which contradicts clue 10. Therefore, the person drinking coffee must be in position 5 is not possible.


From clue 7, the Malaysian is on the left or right of the German. Since the Malaysian is already in position 2, this clue doesn't add any new information.


From clue 13, the Malaysian is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. This means the person drinking cola must be in either position 1 or 3. However, since the Thai is already in position 3, the person drinking cola must be in position 2 is not possible (already occupied by the Malaysian), so the person drinking cola must be in position 1 or another even-numbered position.


From clue 12, the person driving the van and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions. This means they must both be in either odd-numbered positions or even-numbered positions.


Since the British is already in an odd-numbered position (5), and the person drinking coffee also needs to be in an odd-numbered position, we can conclude that the person drinking soy-milk is in an even-numbered position.


The only remaining even-numbered position for the person drinking soy-milk is 4, but this would mean the German and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions, which contradicts clue 6. Therefore, the person drinking soy-milk must be in another even-numbered position, which means it must be in position 2 or 4 (but not 4 since that's occupied by the German). However, since the Malaysian is already in position 2, this would mean the person drinking soy-milk can't be in position 2.


From clue 16, the person driving the train is not the Thai. This means the person driving the train must be in either an odd-numbered or even-numbered position other than position 3 (which is occupied by the Thai).


The only remaining odd-numbered position for the person driving the train is 5, but this would mean the British and the person driving the train have the same parity positions. Since clue 10 states that the British and the person drinking coffee have different parity positions, we can conclude that the person drinking coffee must be in an even-numbered position (contradicting our previous conclusion), or the person driving the train is in an even-numbered position.


Since the person drinking soy-milk needs to be in an even-numbered position, and there's only one remaining even-numbered position for it, we can conclude that the person drinking soy-milk is actually in position 2 (contradicting our previous conclusion), which means the Malaysian must be moved. However, this would mean the Malaysian and the German don't have the same parity positions anymore.


Let's take a closer look at clue 6 again: ""the person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the van or the person drinking soy-milk is not the malaysian or both"". We previously concluded that the person drinking soy-milk can't be in position 2 (occupied by the Malaysian), but this conclusion was based on other assumptions. If we relax these assumptions, it's possible for the person drinking soy-milk to actually be the Malaysian.


From clue 3, the person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the scooter. Since the Thai is in position 3, and there are two positions available to the left (positions 1 and 2), we can conclude that the person drinking water must be in either position 1 or 2.


However, since the Malaysian is already in position 2, this would mean the person drinking water can't be in position 2 (occupied by the Malaysian). Therefore, the person drinking water must be in position 1, and the scooter must be driven by the Thai in position 3.


Now we have:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | water      |           |         |           |         |
| Nationality   |            | malaysian | thai    | german    | british |
| Transport     |            |           | scooter |           |         |


From clue 15, the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike. Since the person drinking water is in position 1, and the scooter is driven by the Thai in position 3, this means the person driving the motorbike must be in either position 2 or 4.


However, since the Malaysian is already in position 2, this would mean the person driving the motorbike can't be in position 2 (occupied by the Malaysian). Therefore, the person driving the motorbike must be in an odd-numbered position other than position 3 (which is occupied by the Thai), and not to the left of the person driving the train (clue 14).


The only remaining odd-numbered position for the person driving the motorbike is 5, but this would mean the British and the person driving the motorbike have the same parity positions. Since clue 11 states that the British is not to the right of the person driving the motorbike, we can conclude that the person driving the motorbike must actually be in position 1 (contradicting our previous conclusion), or another odd-numbered position.


However, since position 1 is already occupied by the person drinking water, this means the person driving the motorbike must actually be in another even-numbered position (not an odd-numbered position as previously concluded). The only remaining even-numbered position for it is 2 (occupied by the Malaysian) or 4.


Let's take a closer look at clue 15 again: ""the person drinking cola is on the left or right of the person driving the motorbike"". If we move the person driving the motorbike to an even-numbered position, this means the person drinking cola must also be in either an odd-numbered position or an even-numbered position.


Since the Malaysian is already in position 2 (even-numbered), and the German is already in position 4 (also even-numbered), we can conclude that the person driving the motorbike can't be in either of these positions (both are occupied). However, if we swap the person drinking soy-milk with another beverage (cola or water), this would allow us to make more conclusions.


From clue 6 again: ""the person drinking soy-milk is not the person driving the van or the person drinking soy-milk is not the malaysian or both"". We previously concluded that it's possible for the person drinking soy-milk to actually be the Malaysian.


If we swap the person drinking soy-milk with cola, and move the person drinking cola (now soy-milk) to position 2 (occupied by the Malaysian), this would mean the Malaysian is no longer in position 2. We can then conclude that the person driving the motorbike must be in an even-numbered position other than position 4 (which is occupied by the German).


The only remaining even-numbered position for it is actually position 2 (now available since we moved the Malaysian), which means the person drinking cola can't be in position 2 anymore. This also allows us to move the person drinking soy-milk to an odd-numbered position other than position 3 (which is occupied by the Thai).


We now have more options:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | water      | cola      |         |           | soy-milk|
| Nationality   |            | malaysian | thai    | german    | british |
| Transport     | motorbike  |           | scooter |           | train   |

Now, let's assign beverages and transports:


The person drinking water is in position 1.


The person driving the motorbike must be in an even-numbered position other than position 4 (which is occupied by the German). The only remaining even-numbered position for it is actually position 2.


Since position 2 is now occupied by the motorbike, we can move the cola to position 5. However, since position 5 is also occupied by the train, this means we need to swap another beverage with cola.


If we swap soy-milk and water, this would allow us to move the person drinking water (now soy-milk) to an odd-numbered position other than position 3 (which is occupied by the Thai).


We now have:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   |           | water   |           | cola    |
| Nationality   |            | malaysian | thai    | german    | british |
| Transport     | motorbike  |           | scooter |           | train   |

Finally, we can assign the remaining beverages:


The person drinking coffee must be in an odd-numbered position other than position 3 (which is occupied by the Thai), and not position 5 (occupied by cola). The only remaining odd-numbered position for it is actually position 1 (but that's occupied by soy-milk now).


However, if we swap the person drinking water with coffee, this would allow us to move the person drinking coffee (now water) to an even-numbered position.


The final solution:


|               |     1      |     2     |    3    |     4     |    5    |
| Beverage      | soy-milk   | cola      | water   | coffee    | cola    |"

After analyzing the clues, I arrived at a possible solution:


#############

|               |     1      |   2   |     3      |    4     |     5     |

| Pet           | Cat       | Chinchilla| Mouse    | Turtle   | Frog      |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


* Clues 1, 7, and 15 established that Gospel is on the left side, and Dutch is also on the left.
* Clue 11 placed Reggae between Gospel and Country. Since Gospel is already on the left, Reggae must be in position 2.
* Clue 6 allowed for two possibilities: Country being Pakistani or Country owning the turtle. Further clues helped disambiguate this.
* Clues 9 and 13 established that Chinchilla's owner is to the left of Turtle's owner. Since Mouse is also between these two, the order becomes clear.
* Clue 18 eliminated Indonesian as the owner of the Turtle, so Pakistani became a more likely candidate for Country.
* Clue 10 removed Rock from being the Cat's owner, and other clues helped place Rock at the end.
* The remaining clues helped fill in the gaps and confirm the arrangement.

Lv12-3x5-9	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|         |       1       |    2     |    3    |      4       |     5      |
| Food    | Tomato        | Onion    | Garlic  | Pumpkin     | Grapefruit|
| Hobby   | Reading       | Puzzles  | Rock-climbing | Chess       | Board-games|
| Sport   | Volleyball    | Cycling  | Swimming | Handball    | Snowboarding|

Let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:

From clues 1 and 10, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is in an odd position (not #2 or #4) and to the right of the person eating tomato.

From clue 9, we know that the person eating garlic is not the person who's hobby is reading. 

From clue 17, we know that the person who's hobby is reading is in an odd position.

Combining these clues, I placed Reading at #1 and Chess at #5, with Tomato at #1 (the only even position left for chess to be to the right of).

Clue 11 states that the person who's sport is cycling is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since Cycling must be in an odd or even position (not both), and since Chess is already at #5, I placed Puzzles at #2 and Cycling at #3.

From clue 13, we know that Garlic is to the right of Cycling, so I placed Garlic at #4 (although this would later change).

Clue 16 states that Reading is on the left or right of Board-games. Since Reading is already at #1, I placed Board-games at #5 (although Chess was already there). This means Chess must be moved to a different odd position, which would have to be #3.

However, this creates a problem with clue 11 and Cycling being next to Puzzles. To resolve this, I swapped the positions of Reading and Puzzles (moving Reading to #2), allowing Board-games to remain at #5 and Chess to return to its original position.

From clue 15, we know that Tomato is to the right of Rock-climbing. This means Rock-climbing must be in an odd position, but since both #1 and #3 are taken, I placed it at #5 wouldn't work as Board-games already occupies this space) which leaves only #5 for Handball from clue 6.

From clue 14, we know that Puzzles and Tomato have the same parity positions. This means they can either be both odd or both even. Since Tomato is #1 (odd), I made sure to place Puzzles in another odd position (#3 wouldn't work as it conflicts with Cycling from clue 11).

Since Rock-climbing and Volleyball share the same parity, they must also occupy an odd and even space respectively.

With Snowboarding not being able to be to the left of Grapefruit (clue 18), I placed it at #5. But then, Board-games has nowhere to go as #4 is occupied by Puzzles from its swap with Reading earlier (which caused a ripple effect pushing Rock-climbing up a spot into an odd position - only leaving even spots).

So I had to push everything back in order to get the correct parity for both puzzles and rock-climbing so they occupy positions that would allow for everyone else's clues to be satisfied.

I moved Puzzles back to its original spot at #2 (even) so Reading could return to an odd spot (#1), allowing the placement of Rock-climbing to fit into an even position. Volleyball now has a home as well, being next to rock climbing with same parity - which would place it in an odd numbered slot.



I hope this solution is correct and I'd be happy to explain further if needed!"
