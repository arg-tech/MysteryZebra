Lv12-3x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |   1    |     2      |     3     |
| Nationality   | French  | Argentine  | Pakistani |
| Pet           | Dog     | Bird       | Snake     |
| Transport     | Bus     | Helicopter | Subway    |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 5, we know the Pakistani is to the right of the Argentine. Since there are only three positions, the Argentine must be in position 1 or 2.

Clue 3 tells us that the person driving the bus is in an odd position, so they must be in position 1 or 3.

From clue 4, we know the French is not the owner of the bird or the driver of the bus. Since the Argentine can't be in both position 1 and 2, the French must be in position 1, driving the bus (which satisfies clue 3).

Now, from clue 6, we know the owner of the dog is not to the left of the French. This means the dog's owner must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Argentine can't be in both positions, and the Pakistani is already determined to be in position 3 (from clue 5), the owner of the dog must be the French.

Clue 1 tells us that the Pakistani is on the right of the bird's owner. Since the Pakistani is in position 3, the bird's owner must be in position 2.

Finally, from clue 7, we know the snake's owner is to the right of the bus driver (the French). This means the snake's owner must be the Pakistani.

Putting it all together, we get the solution table above."

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is on the far left, so:

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is on the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the chinchilla (clue 4), and they are already in position 1, the person playing ice-hockey must be in position 2.

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the rat is on the left of the person driving the bike. Since the person playing ice-hockey is already in position 2 and cannot be to the right of the owner of the rat, the owner of the rat must be in position 1.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the rat or the person playing ice-hockey. We already have the owner of the rat in position 1 and the person playing ice-hockey in position 2. Clue 4 says that the person driving the quad-bike cannot be the owner of the chinchilla, so they must own the pony.

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is not to the left of the person who's sport is rugby. Since they are already in position 1, the person playing rugby must be in position 3.

| Transport   | quad-     | bike       | car        |

 

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the person driving the bike. We already have the person playing ice-hockey in position 2 and they are to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 3). The only remaining pet is the chinchilla, so it must belong to the person in position 3.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking coffee is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is soccer.

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is skateboarding is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is soccer.

So, the order for sports is: ?, Soccer, Skateboarding

Now, let's look at clue 1. The person watching spy movies is either the person drinking coffee or the person whose sport is soccer.

Since coffee is already on the left side, it's more likely that the person drinking coffee watches spy movies.


Now, we have:


|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   |               |               |

| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |

From clue 5, we know the person drinking fanta and the person watching superhero movies have different parity positions.

Since position 1 is already taken by coffee, Fanta must be in an odd position (3) to satisfy this condition.


Now, we have:


|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   |               | Fanta         |

| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is soccer is not drinking hot-chocolate.

So, hot-chocolate must be in position 2.


Now, we have:


|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Hot-Choc.    | Fanta         |

| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |

From clue 9, the person drinking fanta and the person watching superhero movies have different parity positions.

Since Fanta is in an odd position (3), Superhero must be in an even position (2).


Now, we have:


|               |    1     |       2       |       3       |
| Beverage      | Coffee   | Hot-Choc.    | Fanta         |
| Movie-Genre   | Spy      | Superhero    | Fantasy       |
| Sport         |          | Soccer        | Skateboarding |

The only sport left is Climbing, which must be in position 1.


Now, we have:

Lv12-3x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |
| Food          | Pumpkin   | Orange    | Corn     |
| Nationality   | Indonesian| Australian| Thai     |
| Pet           | Turtle    | Bird      | Goldfish |
#############


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating pumpkin is on the left of the australian. This means that Pumpkin must be in position 1.

Clue 3 tells us that the indonesian is somewhere to the left of the person eating corn. Since Corn can't be in position 1 (because Pumpkin is already there), and the Indonesian can't be in position 3 (because they need to be to the left of Corn), we conclude that the Indonesian must be in position 1, which means Pumpkin is eaten by the Indonesian.

Clue 2 says that the person eating orange is between the owner of the bird and the person eating corn. This implies that Orange is in position 2.

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the bird is not the australian (or both), but since the Australian can't be in position 1 (because Pumpkin is there), we conclude that the Bird's owner must be in position 2 or 3. However, if they were in position 3, it would contradict clue 6 (which says that the Australian is to the left of the Goldfish). Therefore, the Bird's owner must be in position 2.

Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the turtle is somewhere to the right of the person eating pumpkin. Since Pumpkin is in position 1, the Turtle's owner can only be in position 2 or 3. However, if they were in position 2, it would contradict clue 4 (since the Bird's owner is already there). Therefore, the Turtle's owner must be in position 1.

However, this creates a contradiction with our earlier conclusion that Pumpkin is eaten by the Indonesian! So we revise our solution to make sure that the turtle's owner can indeed be on the right of the person eating pumpkin. We move the Bird's owner to position 3 and swap the Corn and Goldfish owners so that Goldfish can be on the left of the Turtle owner. The Australian then takes position 2.


Clue 6 tells us that the australian is on the left of the goldfish. This means that the Australian must be in position 1 or 2, but since Pumpkin's owner is already in position 1, we conclude that the Australian must be in position 2.

However this also caused another contradiction! So let’s revise our solution again to move Pumpkin and its eater Indonesian back on the leftmost side:

#############


Here's how the solution was derived:

From clue 7, we know that soccer is to the right of volleyball. From clue 9, we know that volleyball is on either side of soccer, so volleyball must be in position 2.

Clue 4 states that superhero movies are between trike and volleyball. Since volleyball is in position 2, superhero movies must be in position 2 or 1. But clue 8 states that superhero movies are not to the right of western movies, so superhero movies must be in position 1 is not possible (western would have to be in position 1). Therefore, western movies are in position 3.

Now we know that fantasy movies are in position 1.

Clue 2 and 6 state that western movies are not with bike. Clue 1 states that subway is not to the right of fantasy movies. So, trike must be with fantasy movies (position 1), bike must be with superhero movies (position 2), and subway must be with western movies (position 3).

The sport for position 1 can't be soccer (clue 7) or volleyball (clue 9). It also can't be the same as position 2 (volleyball, from clue 4). So it's skateboarding.

The final solution is:

From clue 7, we know that sailing is next to broccoli. Since sailing can't be on both sides of broccoli, and broccoli can't be to the left of itself (clue 3), sailing must be on the right of broccoli.
From clue 5, techno is to the right of weightlifting.
From clue 2, techno is not with pepper or weightlifting. This means techno must be in column 2.
Since techno is in column 2, and sailing is next to broccoli, broccoli must be in column 1.
Pepper can't be to the right of techno (clue 4), so it must be in column 3.

From clue 1, we know that the boat driver is between the golf and skateboarding enthusiasts.

From clue 3, we know that the trance fan and the boat driver have different parity positions (i.e., one is in an even position, and the other is in an odd position).

From clue 4, we know that the reggae fan is to the left of the skiing enthusiast.

From clue 5, we know that the golf enthusiast is to the left of the quad-bike driver.


Now, let's combine these clues:


We can start by placing the golf enthusiast and the boat driver. Since the boat driver is between the golf and skateboarding enthusiasts (clue 1), we can place them in positions 1 and 2:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Music-Genre   |        |        |               |

| Transport     | Boat  |        | quad-bike      |

Now, we can place the skateboarding enthusiast in position 3:

| Music-Genre   |        |        |               |
| Sport         | Golf  | Skateboarding |               |
| Transport     | Boat  |        | quad-bike      |

From clue 4, we know that the reggae fan is to the left of the skiing enthusiast. We can place the reggae fan in position 1 (since it's already occupied by the golf enthusiast, this must be a different person), and the skiing enthusiast in position 3:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae|        | Soul          |
| Sport         | Golf  | Skateboarding | Skiing     |
| Transport     | Boat  | Bike      | quad-bike      |

Now, we can place the trance fan. From clue 3, we know that the trance fan and the boat driver have different parity positions. This means that the trance fan must be in position 2:


|               |   1    |   2    |       3       |
| Music-Genre   | Reggae| Trance  | Soul          |
| Sport         | Golf  | Skateboarding | Skiing     |
| Transport     | Boat  | Bike      | quad-bike      |

Finally, we can place the person who's sport is golf in position 1 (since they're already there), and the person driving the bike must be the fan of either reggae or soul. But from clue 2, we know that the bike driver is not a fan of trance (already placed) or skiing (already placed), so the bike driver must be a fan of reggae.


Now, let's see if this solution satisfies all the clues:


1. The boat driver is between the golf and skateboarding enthusiasts: 
2. The person driving the bike is not the fan of trance: 
3. The trance fan and the boat driver have different parity positions: 
4. The reggae fan is to the left of the skiing enthusiast:

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the far left or far right. Since the person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball (clue 3), and there are only three columns, it means that the person who's sport is baseball must be on the far right.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching romance movies is somewhere to the right of the person watching scientific movies. Since the person who's sport is baseball is on the far right, and the person watching scientific movies is on the left of them (clue 3), it means that the person watching romance movies must be in column 2.

From clue 5, we know that the russian is not the person watching romance movies or the russian is not the person who's sport is baseball. Since the person watching romance movies is in column 2, and the person who's sport is baseball is on the far right (column 3), it means that the russian must be in column 1.

From clue 1, we know that the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the indian. Since the indian cannot be on the far left (column 1) because that would mean the russian is not the person watching romance movies or the russian is not the person who's sport is baseball (contradicting clue 5), it means that the indian must be in column 2, and the person who's sport is water-polo must be in column 3. However, this contradicts our earlier conclusion that the person who's sport is baseball is on the far right. Therefore, the indian must be in column 2, but the person who's sport is water-polo cannot be on the far right (column 3). Instead, it means that the indian is not on the far left or far right, which places them in column 2.

The only remaining nationality for column 1 is the malaysian. The only remaining movie-genre for column 1 is scientific movies. Finally, the only remaining sport for column 3 is water-polo, and since the person who's sport is baseball must be on the far left or far right (clue 4), it means that the person who's sport is climbing must be in column 2.

This completes the solution table:
