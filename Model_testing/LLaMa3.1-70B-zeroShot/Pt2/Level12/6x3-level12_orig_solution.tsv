| Transport     | Ship      | Van       | Skateboard|


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, Lemonade is to the left of Mirinda.
From clue 11, Mirinda is in an even position (2 or not 3).
From clue 14, Russian is either driving the van or drinking Mirinda. Since Van is likely with Dubstep (clue 2), Russian must be drinking Mirinda.

Using clues 5 and 6, French has the same parity as Reading and Ship.
Clue 15 states that Reading is to the right of Canadian.
From clue 9, Parkour and Folk have different parities. Given the positions of Parkour (clue 13) and Dubstep (clues 4 and 8), Parkour must be on the left.

Using clues 3, 7, and 10, Filmmaking is not with Canadian or Ship.
Clue 2 states that Van is with Dubstep. Clue 14 already linked Russian to Mirinda, so Van can't be with Russian.

The remaining pieces fall into place using the process of elimination.

After analyzing all 15 clues, I came up with a possible solution:


#############
|               |      1       |      2       |     3      |

| Nationality   | Dutch       | Italian     | Egyptian  |
| Transport     | Motorbike   | Bus         | Taxi       |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 1, the Egyptian is an R&B fan.
* Clue 5 states that the Dutch is not an R&B fan, and clue 2 implies that the Reggae fan is to the right of the R&B fan. This means the R&B fan must be in position 3 (Egyptian).
* Clue 6 puts the Watermelon eater in a Taxi.
* Clue 4 places the Videographer to the left of the Entrepreneur, and clue 14 confirms that the Entrepreneur is not to the left of the Videographer.
* The Italian cannot be an R&B fan or drive a Bus (clue 3), so they must be in position 2 with House music.
* Clue 7 implies that the Entrepreneur might be driving a Bus or be an R&B fan. Since the R&B fan is already occupied, the Entrepreneur drives a Bus.
* The Accountant is to the right of the Dutch (clue 8), and since the Dutch cannot be to the right of the Accountant (clue 15), they must be in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
* Clues 9-13 help determine the hobbies: Traveling is left of Reggae (clue 9) and Dutch (clue 12), Magic-tricks is left of Watermelon (clue 13), and Collecting has a different parity position than Reggae (clue 11).

This solution should satisfy all 15 clues."
Lv12-6x3-5	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:

| Transport     | jet-ski    | bike       | quad-bike |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 11, we know the person eating watermelon is in the middle. From clue 15, we also know the fan disco is in the middle.

Using clue 8, we can deduce that the person eating cherry is to the left of the person eating watermelon. Since the person eating watermelon is in the middle, the person eating cherry must be at position 1.

From clue 3, we know the person watching adventure movies is the same person eating cherry. So, the movie-genre at position 1 is adventure.

Using clue 6, we can deduce that the person watching family movies is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person eating watermelon is in the middle and the person watching family movies is between the paramedic and the person watching adventure movies (clue 5), the movie-genre at position 2 must be family.

From clue 9, we know the journalist is not the person drinking water. From clue 1, we also know the person drinking milk and the fan funk have the same parity positions. Since the journalist cannot be at position 3 (due to clue 5), the journalist must be at position 1.

The rest of the solution can be deduced using a combination of the remaining clues.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the taxi is also the one who enjoys photography.

Clue 2 tells us that the owner of the lizard is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since there are only three people, this means the lizard owner must be either in position 1 or 2.

Clue 3 indicates that the person driving the skateboard is to the left of the person who enjoys sailing.

From clue 4, we can infer that the person eating peach cannot be the one who enjoys gospel music (or vice versa).

Clue 5 tells us that the owner of the chinchilla is not to the right of the person eating orange. This means the chinchilla owner must be either in position 1 or 2.

Clue 6 indicates that the owner of the bird is to the left of the owner of the lizard.

From clue 7, we know that the person who enjoys water-polo is to the left of the person who enjoys chess.

Clue 8 tells us that the person who enjoys water-polo also loves metal music.

From clue 9, we can infer that the person driving the taxi (who also enjoys photography) is to the right of the person who enjoys traveling.

Clue 10 indicates that the person driving the skateboard is to the right of the person who enjoys water-polo.

Clue 11 tells us that the person eating peach is between the owner of the bird and the person eating orange.

From clue 12, we know that the owner of the lizard is not eating lettuce.

Clue 13 indicates that the person driving the taxi (who also enjoys photography) is to the right of the person driving the skateboard.

Clue 14 tells us that the fan of country music is either to the left or right of the person eating peach.

Finally, clue 15 indicates that the person eating peach is to the left of the person who enjoys photography.

By carefully combining these clues, we can arrive at the final solution table above."
Lv12-6x3-7	"After analyzing the puzzle, I've arrived at a possible solution:


|               |      1      |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage      | milk        | hot-chocolate | fanta    |

| Sport         | parkour     | cycling       | biathlon  |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clues 1 and 2, we know the Canadian is on the left of the person eating lemon and either watches musical movies or drinks Fanta. Since clue 8 states the Canadian doesn't drink hot-chocolate, they must be in position 2.

Clue 15 tells us the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the middle (position 2). This means the person drinking milk is in position 1, and from clue 14, this person is either the Brazilian or owns a horse. Since there's no other information about the Brazilian's preferences, let's assign them to position 1.

From clues 4 and 5, we know the owner of the ferret is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate (position 2), so they must be in position 3.

Clue 7 tells us the person eating pomegranate and watching comedy movies have the same parity positions. Since position 1 has an odd number, we can assign comedy movies to position 1 (brazilian).

Now, let's look at the sports clues:

* Clue 9 says cycling is between biathlon and pomegranate.
* Clue 5 says parkour is in an odd position.
* Clue 13 says biathlon is next to the owner of the chinchilla.

Given these constraints, we can assign parkour to position 1 (brazilian), biathlon to position 3 (russian), and cycling to position 2 (canadian).

The remaining clues help us fill in the gaps:

* Clue 6 puts horror movies next to the Russian (position 3).
* Clue 11 says musical movies aren't to the right of parkour, so they must be in position 2 (canadian).
* Clue 12 is a non-clue.
* Clue 16 gives us two options; let's assign Fanta to the person eating pomegranate (russian).

After making these assignments, we get the final solution table:

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* First, I used clues 3 and 16 to determine that the person watching family movies is on the right of the person drinking fanta.
* Next, I used clue 4 to place the person eating raspberry between the person eating lettuce and the person watching mystery movies.
* Clue 2 helped me place the person driving the bike relative to the person eating lettuce.
* Clues 1, 11, and 14 allowed me to determine the order of nationalities.
* I used clue 7 to place the person drinking 7up on an odd-numbered position (either 1 or 3).
* Clue 13 helped me place the owner of the hedgehog relative to the person driving the train.
* Finally, I used a combination of clues 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12 to fill in the remaining gaps.

Lv12-6x3-9	"I'll solve the puzzle step by step.


From statement 6, we know that the person drinking tea is on the far left or far right.

From statement 3, we know that the person watching musical movies is somewhere to the right of the person driving the car.

From statement 5, we know that the person driving the car is either a fan of r&b or drinks tea, but not both. Since the person drinking tea can only be on the far left or far right (statement 6), and the person watching musical movies must be to the right of the person driving the car (statement 3), we conclude that:

* The person drinking tea is on the far right.
* The person driving the car is a fan of r&b.

From statement 1, we know that the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the person driving the car is already assigned to the middle position (as a fan of r&b), the person driving the quad-bike must be on the far left.


Now, let's fill in some values:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3     |

| Sport         |             |            |           |
| Transport     | quad-bike  | car       |           |

From statement 7, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is to the right of the person watching documentary movies. Since the person driving the quad-bike is already on the far left (and can't be the fan classical), and the person driving the car is in the middle, we conclude that:


* The person watching documentary movies is on the far left.
* The owner of the chinchilla is in the middle.

From statement 4, we know that the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla is already assigned to the middle position, the owner of the bird must be on the far right.


Now, let's fill in some values:


|               |      1      |     2      |     3     |

| Transport     | quad-bike  | car       |           |

From statement 2, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is not a fan of classical music. Since the person driving the car is already assigned to be a fan of r&b, and the person drinking tea can only be on the far right (statement 6), we conclude that:


* The owner of the chinchilla is a fan of pop.

From statement 14, we know that the fan of pop and the owner of the goldfish have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the chinchilla (a fan of pop) is in the middle position (even), the owner of the goldfish must be on an even position as well.


Now, let's fill in some values:

| Transport     | quad-bike  | car       |           |

From statement 10, we know that the person who's sport is tennis is not to the left of the person driving the car. Since the owner of the goldfish must be on an even position (statement 14), and the person driving the car is already assigned to the middle position, we conclude that:


* The person who's sport is tennis is in the far right.

From statement 16, we know that the person watching documentary movies is either the person driving the car or the person who's sport is golf. Since the person driving the car is already assigned to be a fan of r&b, and the owner of the goldfish (on the far left) can't be the fan classical (statement 9), we conclude that:


* The person watching documentary movies is on the far left.
* The person who's sport is golf is on the far right.

From statement 15, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is between the fan of pop and the person who's sport is tennis. Since the owner of the chinchilla (a fan of pop) is in the middle position, and the person who's sport is tennis is in the far right, we conclude that:


* The person drinking iced-tea is on the right side.

From statement 11, we know that the person drinking water is to the left of the person who's sport is tennis. Since the owner of the goldfish (on the far left) can't be the fan classical (statement 9), and the person drinking tea can only be on the far right or far left (statement 6), we conclude that:


* The person drinking water is in the middle.

From statement 5, we know that the person driving the car is either a fan of r&b or drinks tea, but not both. Since the person drinking tea can only be on the far right or far left (statement 6), and the owner of the chinchilla (a fan of pop) is in the middle position, we conclude that:


* The person driving the car is a fan of r&b.
