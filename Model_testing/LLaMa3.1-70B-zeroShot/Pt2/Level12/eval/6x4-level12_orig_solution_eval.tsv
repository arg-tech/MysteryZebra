Lv12-6x4-1	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|               |     1     |        2        |     3      |      4       |

| Pet           | fish      | turtle        | horse     | pony       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

I started by using clues 3, 18, and 24 to figure out the order of the beverages: 7up, lemonade, sprite, and milk.

Next, I used clue 1 to determine that the person drinking sprite is not the owner of the pony. This meant that the pony must be in column 4.

I then used clues 2, 5, and 9 to figure out the order of the music-genres: electronic, reggae, rock, and d&b.

Clue 15 told me that the person who's hobby is puzzles is the photographer. Clue 14 then told me that the photographer is somewhere to the right of the owner of the horse. This meant that the horse must be in column 2 or 3.

I used clues 10, 13, and 20 to figure out the order of the pets: fish, turtle, horse, and pony.

Clue 6 told me that the fan rock is not to the right of the lawyer. This meant that the lawyer must be in column 1 or 2.

I then used clues 8, 9, and 22 to figure out the order of the jobs: teacher, project-manager, lawyer, and photographer.

Finally, I used clues 4, 11, and 12 to figure out the order of the hobbies: puzzles, reading, card-games, and baking.

Lv12-6x4-5	"After analyzing the puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |    1    |      2       |     3      |     4      |

| Hobby         | puzzles | reading      | magic-tricks| skydiving  |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster| scientific   | zombie     | crime      |
| Nationality   | american| mexican      | french     | chinese    |
| Pet           | guinea-pig| horse       | goat       | turtle     |
| Transport     | train    | snowmobile  | helicopter | car        |

The reasoning behind this solution is as follows:


From clue 19, the person eating cabbage is on the far left.


From clue 11, the person eating cabbage is not to the left of the person driving the car. So, the person driving the car must be in position 2 or further right.


From clue 7, the person driving the car is the person watching zombie movies. From clue 13, the person eating grapes is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.


From clue 22, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left or right of the person eating grapes.


From clue 10, the french is the person eating grapes or the person who's hobby is reading is the french, but not both.


Since the person driving the car (position 4) watches zombie movies, and the person eating artichoke might also watch crime movies or drive a snowmobile (clue 18), we can conclude that the person watching crime movies drives a train (not mentioned in any clue) and is on position 1.


The only pet left for position 3 is the goat. And from clue 16, the owner of the horse must be either to the left or right of the owner of the goat. Therefore, the guinea-pig must be at position 2 (clue 3), which means that the person driving the car owns a horse.


From clue 20, the person eating grapes is not to the right of the person eating potato.


By combining clues 4 and 16, we can conclude that the owner of the goat is watching disaster movies, and thus driving a helicopter (clue 15) isn't possible for this position since it needs to be left or right of the car.


Now let's determine which person drives what: from clue 29, either the train driver eats grapes or watches scientific movies. From clues 25 and 27, we can see that the american must watch scientific movies and drive a snowmobile (and thus eat potato). 


So far, we have:


|               |    1    |      2       |     3      |     4      |
| Food          | cabbage |   ?          | grapes     | artichoke  |
| Hobby         | puzzles | reading      | magic-tricks| skydiving  |
| Movie-Genre   | disaster| scientific   | zombie     | crime      |
| Nationality   | american| mexican      | french     | chinese    |
| Pet           | guinea-pig| horse       | goat       | turtle     |
| Transport     | train    | snowmobile  | ?          | car        |

Clue 5 tells us that the scientific movie fan and the Chinese are on different parity positions. Therefore, the american must be at position 2.


With clue 28, reading has to have a same parity with zombie which is odd number so reading needs to be 3 or 1, and since magic tricks need to come after artichoke (clue 1), then 1 for reading isn't valid option. Also if french is on the left of chinese (clue 6) then french should not be in position 4 either because it can only occupy an even number due to being the same parity as reading and zombie has odd positions.


With clue 26, potato cannot come after american and also since american occupies 2nd spot that means potato occupies first spot. However we know from 19 that cabbage needs to be on left so that makes grapes at third position because it is mentioned in 20 that grape cannot come after potato


Putting the rest of pieces together based on prior information, here's our completed table:

Lv12-6x4-9	"After analyzing all 30 clues, I've arrived at a possible solution:


|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |     4      |

Here's a brief explanation of the deductions I made:


From clues 18 and 19, we know that the dutch is either drinking soy-milk or watching musical movies. From clue 2, we know that the person eating potato is not the owner of the frog or the person drinking soy-milk (or both). Combining these clues, we can deduce that the dutch is not drinking soy-milk, so they must be watching musical movies.


Clue 21 tells us that the owner of the frog is in an odd position. Since the dutch are watching musical movies and must be in an even position (clue 18), the owner of the frog cannot be the dutch. Clue 15 says that the british is not the owner of the frog, or the owner of the frog is not eating mango. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the owner of the frog must be in position 1 and eating corn.


Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is to the left of the person watching comedy movies. Since the dutch are watching musical movies, they cannot be driving the quad-bike (clue 18). Clue 10 says that the spanish is not to the right of the person driving the quad-bike. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person driving the quad-bike must be in position 2.


From clue 25, we know that the person drinking tea is on the left or right of the person driving the jet-ski. Clue 14 says that the person eating corn and the person drinking tea have the same parity positions. Since the owner of the frog (in position 1) is eating corn, the person drinking tea must be in an even position (position 2 or 4). However, clue 20 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is between the person driving the skateboard and the person eating kale. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person drinking tea must be in position 3.


From clue 22, we know that the person driving the scooter is not to the left of the person drinking water. Clue 30 tells us that the owner of the bird is on the right of the person driving the scooter. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person driving the scooter must be in position 4.


The rest of the puzzle falls into place with relative ease:


* The person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person watching musical movies (clue 16).
* The chinese and the person drinking soy-milk have the same parity positions (clue 13), so they must be in even positions.
* The british is somewhere to the right of the owner of the fish (clue 11).
* The dutch are on the left or right of the chinese (clue 7).

Lv12-6x4-10	"Here is the completed table:

| Sport         | water-polo         | soccer      | rugby    | skiing        |

Let me explain the steps I took to solve this puzzle:


First, I started with the easiest clues and worked my way up. From clue 7, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right.


From clue 20, we know that the person eating radish is on the far left or far right. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is already on the far right, the person eating radish must be on the far left.


Clue 25 tells us that the person eating peas is on the left of the coach. Clue 21 tells us that the coach is somewhere between the person who's hobby is hiking and the person who's hobby is dancing. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person eating peas must be in column 2.


Clue 26 tells us that the software-developer is the person eating pear. Since the person eating peas is already in column 2, the person eating pear must be in column 4.


From clue 27, we know that the person eating grapes is somewhere to the left of the person watching time-travel movies. Clue 14 tells us that the person watching time-travel movies is the person who's hobby is dancing or the person who's sport is skiing is the person watching time-travel movies or both. Combining these clues, we can deduce that the person eating grapes must be in column 3.


Now let's look at the beverages. Clue 17 tells us that the person drinking milk is somewhere to the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person eating peas (and thus the person watching action movies) is in column 2, the person drinking milk must be in column 3 or 4.


Clue 6 tells us that the coach is the person who's sport is skiing or the person who's sport is skiing is the person drinking milk or both. Since the person drinking milk is already in column 3 or 4, and the coach can't be in column 1 (because of clue 21), we can deduce that the coach must be in column 3.


From clue 15, we know that the person who's hobby is chess and the person drinking hot-chocolate have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the far right, the person who's hobby is chess must be in an even-numbered column (i.e., 2 or 4). Clue 8 tells us that the freelancer is not to the right of the person who's hobby is chess, so the person who's hobby is chess must be in column 2.


Clue 19 tells us that the person who's hobby is hiking and the person who's sport is soccer have the same parity positions. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is already on the far left, the person who's sport is soccer must also be in an odd-numbered column (i.e., 1 or 3). Clue 23 tells us that the person who's sport is soccer is not to the right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking milk is in column 3, we can deduce that the person who's sport is soccer must be in column 2.


Now let's look at the jobs. From clue 26, we already know that the software-developer is the person eating pear (and thus in column 4).


From clue 11, we know that the freelancer is somewhere between the photographer and the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left, the freelancer must be in column 2 or 3.


Clue 10 tells us that the coach and the person who's hobby is dancing have different parity positions. Since the coach is already in column 3 (an odd-numbered column), we can deduce that the person who's hobby is dancing must be in an even-numbered column (i.e., 2 or 4). However, column 4 is already taken by the software-developer and the person drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, the person who's hobby is dancing must be in column 2.


From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is chess is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is hiking. Since the person who's hobby is chess is already in column 2, and the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far left, the person who's hobby is singing must be in column 4.


Finally, from clue 9, we know that the person watching time-travel movies and the person drinking milk have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking milk is already in column 3 (an odd-numbered column), the person watching time-travel movies must also be in an odd-numbered column. However, columns 1 and 3 are already taken by other movie genres, so we can deduce that the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 4.


Putting all these clues together, we get the final solution:


 Column 1:
 Person eating radish
 Hobby: Hiking
 Sport: Skiing (from clue 6)
 Movie: Time-Travel Movies


 Column 2:
 Person drinking milk -> no, person watching action movies!
 Hobby: Chess
 Sport: Soccer
 Movie: Action Movies


 Column 3:
 Person drinking milk
 Hobby: Dancing -> no, coach!
 Coach
 Sport: Football -> no, Skiing! (from clue 6)
 Movie: Comedy -> no, Time-Travel Movies!


 Column 4:
 Person eating pear (and thus software-developer!)
 Hobby: Singing
 Sport: ?
 Movie: Adventure -> no, Horror -> no... wait! From clue 14, person watching time-travel movies is in column 3 or 4. But we already have column 3 taken by another movie genre, so we can deduce that the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 4!


Therefore, we get:


 Column 1:
 Person eating radish
 Hobby: Hiking
 Sport: Skiing (from clue 6)
 Movie: Time-Travel Movies


 Column 2:
 Person drinking fanta -> no!
 Hobby: Chess
 Sport: Soccer
 Movie: Action Movies

 Hobby: Singing -> no, dancing -> no... wait! From clue 14, person watching time-travel movies is in column 3 or 4. But we already have column 3 taken by another movie genre, so we can deduce that the person watching time-travel movies must be in column 4!
