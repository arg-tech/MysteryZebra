* First, I used clues 1-5 to establish some basic connections between rows.
* Then, I used clues 6-15 to narrow down the possibilities for each row.
* Clues 16-25 helped me to further constrain the options and make some tentative assignments.
* Clues 26-35 allowed me to refine my previous guesses and make more confident assignments.
* Finally, clues 36-42 helped me to fill in the remaining gaps and arrive at a complete solution.
