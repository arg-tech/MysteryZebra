Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:


* From clue 8, we know that the person eating potato is on the far left.
* From clue 12, we know that the person eating cherry is to the right of the person eating potato.
* From clue 10, we know that the electrician and the person eating potato have different parity positions. Since the person eating potato is on the far left (odd position), the electrician must be in an even position.
* From clue 9, we know that the person drinking 7up is to the left of the bartender. Since the person drinking mirinda is already on the far left (eating potato), the person drinking 7up must be in the second column, and the bartender must be in the third column.
* From clue 1, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is not the pakistani or the bartender. Since the bartender is already assigned to the third column, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in the second column.
* From clue 5, we know that the fan of soul music is to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. This means that the fan of soul music must be in the third column.
* From clue 3, we know that the fan of techno music is not to the right of the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate is in the second column, the fan of techno music must be in the first or second column. However, since the person eating potato (mirinda) is already in the first column, and we need a different beverage for the person drinking 7up, the fan of techno music must be in the second column as well.
* From clue 11, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is somewhere to the left of the person who's sport is skiing. Since the person drinking hot-chocolate (second column) cannot have a sport (clue 1), the person who's sport is soccer must be in the second column.
* From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is soccer is between the owner of the rat and the chinese. This means that the owner of the rat must be in the first column, and the chinese must be in the third column.
* The remaining clues can be used to fill in the gaps.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 1, we know that the fan of house music is in an odd position.
* From clue 4, we know that the fan of folk music is on the left of the person who likes board games.
* Combining clues 3 and 10, we can deduce that the coach is the person who likes water polo.
* Clue 2 tells us that the coach is not the fan of folk music or comedy movies. This means that the coach must be in position 3, as it's the only odd position left.
* From clue 5, we know that the Colombian is on the left of the fan of house music. Since the fan of house music is in an odd position (1), the Colombian must be in either position 1 or not exist.
* Clue 8 tells us that the Colombian is to the right of the person who likes lacrosse, so it can't be in position 1. Therefore, the Colombian must be in position 3, but we already have the coach there! This means that the Colombian and coach are actually the same person, which also satisfies clue 19.
* Clue 6 tells us that either the horror movie fan or the soccer player is the coach, but since the coach likes water polo (from clue 10), this means that the horror movie fan must be in position 2. This leaves only one spot for the person who likes musicals, which is position 1.
* From clue 11, we know that the journalist can't be to the right of the Turkish person or soccer player. Since the journalist can't be in position 3 (taken by coach), this means they must be in position 1, and therefore drink mirinda (clue 16).
* Clue 12 tells us that either the coffee drinker is a lacrosse fan or a journalist. We already know the journalist drinks mirinda, so it must be the person who likes lacrosse.
* From clue 15, we can deduce that the Colombian (coach) is to the right of the lacrosse player, which means they're in position 3 and like soccer is not true (clue 5), so they must be in a different sport. Since water polo takes up an odd spot, this leaves only one possibility for the coach's sport: position 3.
* Clue 14 tells us that the person who likes water polo can't be to the left of the coach. This is true since we know the person who likes water polo is actually the coach!
* Finally, from clue 13, we can deduce that the cola drinker must have an even parity position (as they're paired with house music), so they must be in position 2.

Lv12-7x3-4	"Here is the solution to the logic puzzle:

| Transport     | taxi         | bus         | helicopter |

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:


From clue 7, we know that the Dutch person is in an odd position. Combining this with clue 5, we can conclude that the Dutch person must be in position 1.


Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the rabbit is on the far right, so they are in position 3.


From clue 4, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is to the left or right of the person watching romance movies. Since the Dutch person (in position 1) is to the left of the owner of the chinchilla (clue 5), the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 2.


Clue 15 tells us that the person driving the bus is between the person watching western movies and the videographer. Since the videographer can't be in position 1 (as they would be to the left of the person watching romance movies, which contradicts clue 4), the videographer must be in position 3.


From clue 11, we know that the dressmaker is not the Turkish person or the photographer. Combining this with clue 19, we can conclude that the dressmaker is in position 1 and the fan of reggae music is in position 2.


The rest of the puzzle falls into place by using the remaining clues and eliminating possibilities. For example, from clue 8, we know that either the person driving the taxi or the Dutch person has a hobby of singing, but not both. Since the Dutch person can't be singing (as they would then be to the right of the fan of reggae music, which contradicts clue 19), the person driving the taxi must have a hobby of singing.

#################


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clue 10 and 16 place the Nigerian person eating banana on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 4 places the person who's sport is tennis as either the one eating banana or driving the bus. Since the Nigerian person is already eating banana, the person driving the bus must be the one whose sport is tennis.
* Clue 2 restricts the chef to being on the left or right of the owner of the frog. The only possible position for the chef is in the middle (position 2), which makes the bartender the person on the far right (position 3).
* Clue 5 places the Turkish person somewhere to the right of the chef, so they must be the lawyer on the far right.
* Clues 12 and 13 place the person eating nectarine in an even position, which is position 2. This means the bartender eats nectarine and has magic-tricks as their hobby.
* Clue 15 places the person who's sport is basketball to the right of the person driving the van. Since the Nigerian person is driving the van, this means the person whose sport is basketball must be the Japanese person in position 2, but that would contradict clue 7. Therefore, the Japanese person must be the one eating nectarine and having magic-tricks as their hobby.
* Clue 17 places the owner of the chinchilla as not driving the van, which means they must be the person whose sport is ice-hockey (Japanese person).
* Clues 3, 7, and 9 place the person who's sport is ice-hockey between the person whose hobby is singing and the person driving the tram. Since the Japanese person has magic-tricks as their hobby, this means the person whose hobby is singing must be the Nigerian person.
* The remaining positions can be filled in using clues 1, 6, 11, 14, and 18.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. Clue 13 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the guinea-pig, so we can place iced-tea and guinea-pig in column 1.
2. Clue 8 tells us that the fan rock is on the left of the person drinking tea, which means rock must be in column 3 (since tea can't be in column 1).
3. Clue 4 tells us that the person driving the roller is not to the left of the fan rock, so roller must be in column 2 or 3.
4. Clue 9 tells us that the person watching family movies is somewhere between the fan country and the person driving the roller. Given that roller is already placed, we can place family in column 2.
5. Clue 6 tells us that the person watching family movies is on the right of the person driving the skateboard, so skateboard must be in column 1 (which confirms our earlier placement of guinea-pig).
6. Clue 10 tells us that the owner of the bird and the fan techno have the same parity positions. Given that we already have an even number of columns filled, we can place bird in column 2.
7. Clue 15 tells us that the owner of the bird is the person eating peach or the owner of the bird is the person driving the roller, but not both. Since we've placed bird and roller, we know peach must be in column 1 (which confirms our earlier placement of guinea-pig).
8. Clue 11 tells us that the person who's sport is rugby is not to the left of the person eating peach, so rugby must be in column 3.
9. Clue 7 tells us that the person drinking tea is not to the left of the person eating pepper, which means tea and pepper are in columns 2 and 3, respectively (since we already have tea placed).
10. The remaining options can be filled in based on the constraints provided by the other clues.

Lv12-7x3-9	"I'll help you solve the logic puzzle. After carefully analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution:


|               |    1     |       2       |    3     |
| Beverage      | milk     | iced-tea     | coffee   |

| Pet           | hedgehog | lizard       | hamster  |
| Sport         | skateboarding | rowing    | skiing  |

Let me walk you through the reasoning behind each step:


* Clue 1: Epic movies and hedgehog owner have same parity positions (both odd or both even). This means they can't be in position 2.
* Clue 7: Hedgehog owner is to the left of hamster owner. Since hedgehog owner can't be in position 2, it must be in position 1. Hamster owner is then in position 3.
* Clue 11: Coffee drinker is to the left of hamster owner. This means coffee drinker is in position 1 or 2. But since hedgehog owner is already in position 1, coffee drinker must be in position 2 (contradicting initial thought), and we'll revisit this later.
* Clue 5: Iced-tea drinker is to the right of kale eater. This means kale eater can't be in position 3, so it's in position 2.
* Clue 6: Action movie fan is to the right of adventure movie fan. Since epic movies are already paired with hedgehog owner (position 1), and action/adventure fans need to be together, they must occupy positions 2 and 3, respectively.
* Clue 15: Adventure movie fan is between zucchini eater and action movie fan. This confirms the order for positions 2-3.
* Clue 16: Japanese person is either eating zucchini or a gospel fan (or both). Since gospel fan can't be in position 1 (hedgehog owner), it's likely that Japanese person eats zucchini (position 3).
* Clue 17: Punk fan is in the middle. This means punk fan occupies position 2.
* Clue 18: Skiing fan is on the far right. This confirms skiing fan is in position 3.

Now, let's revisit some of the earlier clues:


* Clue 9: Nigerian person is to the right of coffee drinker. Since coffee drinker was initially thought to be in position 2, but we now know kale eater occupies that spot, it means coffee drinker must actually be in position 3 (which doesn't fit). However, we can infer that coffee drinker is in position 1 (hedgehog owner).
* Clue 14: Chinese person is to the right of skateboarding fan. Since skateboarding fan can't be in position 3 (skiing fan), it means skateboarding fan occupies position 2 or 1.
* Clue 13: Chinese person is not drinking coffee, and coffee drinker is not skateboarding fan. However, this clue also implies that chinese person might not be drinking milk (since they're not drinking coffee). Given the beverage distribution, we can infer that chinese person drinks milk.

With these revised deductions, the final solution table becomes:

* The scientist is in an odd position (clue 14), so they must be in column 2.
* The person watching western movies is not the fan of pop music (clue 3), and since the project-manager is the fan of R&B music (clue 7), the person watching western movies must be in column 3.
* The person who's sport is ice-hockey is not the scientist or eating pumpkin (clue 2), so they must be in column 1.
* Clue 10 states that the person drinking lemonade is on the right of the person eating nectarine, which means the person drinking lemonade must be in column 3.
* The fan salsa is not to the right of the person watching western movies (clue 5), so they must be in column 2.
* Clue 16 states that the fan pop is on the left or right of the person drinking milk. Since the person drinking lemonade is already in column 3, the person drinking milk must be in column 1, and the fan pop must be in column 3.
