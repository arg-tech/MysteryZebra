Lv12-5x3-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I've filled in the table with the correct information:


|               |        1        |      2      |     3      |
| Beverage      | Sprite         | Mirinda     | Cola       |
| Hobby         | Dancing        | Gardening   | Hiking     |
| Job           | Project-Manager| Electrician | Architect  |
| Movie-Genre   | Horror         | Thriller    | Comedy     |
| Transport     | Boat           | Helicopter  | Snowmobile |

 
Here's a brief explanation of the solution:


* From clue 1, we know that gardening is between horror movies and boat. Since horror movies can't be on position 3 (due to clue 5), it must be on either 1 or 2.
* From clue 4, electrician is between boat and architect. This means boat must be on position 1, as electrician can't be on position 1 (due to clue 7).
* Clue 7 also tells us that the electrician is not a dancer, and from clue 9, we know the dancer isn't watching comedy movies. So, the person dancing must be watching horror movies or thriller.
* From clue 2, comedy movies can't be on position 1 (as it's to the right of hiking), so it must be on position 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that comedy is to the right of hiking, and since hiking can't be on position 1 (due to clue 4), it must be on position 2.
* From clue 8, mirinda isn't to the right of helicopter. Since cola and snowmobile have different parities (clue 6), cola must be on an odd position (1 or 3). If cola were on position 1, then snowmobile would be on position 2 (clashing with helicopter). Therefore, cola is on position 3.
* Finally, from clue 8, the project-manager is either watching horror movies or drinking mirinda. Since they can't both be true (due to the ""but not both"" part), the project-manager must be watching horror movies.

The solution table above satisfies all the given clues.

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 3, we know that the person drinking coffee is to the left of the fan hip-hop. Since there are only three positions, this means that the person drinking coffee must be in position 1.
* Clue 11 tells us that the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person drinking mirinda, so mirinda must be in position 2 and soy-milk in position 3.
* From clue 4, we know that either the fan hip-hop is the person drinking coffee or the person driving the trike. Since the person drinking coffee can't be the fan hip-hop (because of their position), it must be the person driving the trike who is the fan hip-hop.
* Clue 8 tells us that the Nigerian is to the right of the person driving the trike, so the Nigerian must be in position 3. This also means that the Spanish person is in position 1 (because of clue 7).
* Clue 9 tells us that the person drinking coffee is not to the left of the person driving the boat, which means that the boat must be in position 2 or 3. But since the roller is already in position 2 (from clue 5), the boat must be in position 1.
* The remaining positions can be filled using clues 10 and 6.

| Transport     | Jet-ski   | Scooter    | Skateboard       |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

From clue 1, we know that the owner of the bird is on the far left. From clue 11, we know that the fisherman is in an odd position, so he must be in position 1.

From clue 12, we know that the thai is on the left of the coach, and from clue 3, we know that the person watching crime movies is not to the right of the person watching sports movies. So, the thai (who watches sports movies) must be in position 1 or 2. Since the fisherman is already in position 1, the thai must be in position 1.

From clue 10, we know that the owner of the lizard is on the left of the canadian. Since the thai is already in position 1, the owner of the lizard must be the thai (position 1) or the person in position 2. But from clue 4, we know that the owner of the turtle is not the person watching crime movies, so the person in position 2 cannot own the lizard (because they watch crime movies). Therefore, the thai owns the bird and the person in position 2 owns the lizard.

From clue 6, we know that the indonesian is on the right of the fisherman. Since the fisherman is in position 1, the indonesian must be in position 3.

From clue 5, we know that the person driving the skateboard is the canadian or the person driving the skateboard is the coach, but not both. Since the indonesian is already in position 3, the canadian and the coach must be in positions 1 and 2. But from clue 12, we know that the thai is on the left of the coach, so the thai (in position 1) cannot be the coach. Therefore, the coach must be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the person driving the scooter is not the indonesian or the indonesian is not the owner of the turtle or both. Since the indonesian is already in position 3 and the coach (in position 2) owns the lizard, the indonesian must own the turtle.

From clue 8, we know that the person driving the jet-ski and the software-developer have different parity positions. Since the person driving the jet-ski cannot be in an even position, they must be in position 1 or 3. But from clue 2, we know that the person driving the jet-ski is not the thai (because the thai watches sports movies), so they must be in position 3.

From clue 13, we know that the person driving the skateboard is not the owner of the lizard or the person driving the skateboard is not the software-developer or both. Since the person in position 2 owns the lizard and the coach (in position 3) drives the skateboard, the software-developer must be in position 2.

Finally, from clue 7, we know that the person watching crime movies is not the canadian or the canadian is not the person driving the scooter or both. Since the canadian is already in position 2 and they drive the scooter, they cannot watch crime movies. Therefore, the person in position 2 watches crime movies.

* From clue 3, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person driving the bus.
* Clue 10 states that the owner of the goat is on the left of the person driving the bus, so the person driving the taxi must be the owner of the goat (since they're already to the left of the bus).
* From clue 1 and 2, we know that the person who's sport is golf is in the middle and next to the person driving the bus.
* Clue 7 states that the person who's sport is climbing is on the far right.
* Using clues 5 and 6, we can deduce that the person eating peach must be between the person eating kiwi (who's hobby is woodworking from clue 8) and the owner of the hamster. Since the person driving the bus can't be next to the person eating lemon (from clue 11), the person eating lemon must be in the middle, making the person eating peach on the right.
* Clue 4 states that the person driving the bike is not to the right of the person who's sport is climbing. Given that the person driving the bike can't be next to the person eating lemon (from clue 9), they must be on the left, with the person eating kiwi.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 5, we know the person drinking cola is on the left of the person drinking sprite. This gives us a starting point for the beverages.
* Clue 9 tells us that the fan electronic is on the left or right of the person drinking cola. Since the person drinking cola can't be in position 3 (because of clue 5), the fan electronic must be in either position 1 or 2.
* From clue 6, we know the brazilian is either the fan indie or the owner of the cat, but not both. This implies that the brazilian can't be in position 3 (since the french is on the right of the fan indie). Therefore, the brazilian must be in either position 1 or 2.
* Clue 8 tells us that the fan indie and the brazilian have the same parity positions. Since the brazilian is in an even position (2), the fan indie must also be in an even position (2).
* Now we can use clue 3 to determine the order of the music genres. The fan indie is between the fan dubstep and the owner of the fish.
* From clue 7, we know the person eating pumpkin is not to the right of the person eating kale. This gives us a constraint on the food positions.
* Clue 4 tells us that the fan indie is not the person drinking almond-milk or the person drinking almond-milk is not the person eating pumpkin. Since the fan indie is in position 2, the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2 as well (to satisfy the constraint).
* Finally, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the rest of the table.

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning behind each row:

* Job: From clues 4 and 11, we know that the fan folk is on the left or right of the dancer. Since the fan blues is in the middle (clue 6), the fan folk must be on the left. The architect can't be to the right of the fan blues (clue 4), so it must be on the left as well.
* Movie-Genre: Clues 2, 7, and 12 tell us that the person watching family movies is not to the left of the owner of the mouse, the owner of the mouse is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies, and the person watching family movies is somewhere to the left of the person watching martial-arts movies. This implies a sequence of Family -> Mouse -> Martial-Arts. Since the owner of the mouse is on the left of the fan blues (clue 14), this places Family on the left.
* Music-Genre: Clue 6 tells us that the fan blues is in the middle, and clue 3 tells us that the fan blues is not to the left of the person driving the bus. This implies that the fan folk must be on the left, as deduced earlier. The remaining music-genre, Pop, goes on the right.
* Pet: Clue 14 tells us that the owner of the mouse is on the left of the fan blues, so Mouse goes on the left. Rat and Fish can go in either order on the right two columns.
* Transport: Clue 1 tells us that the dancer is on the right of the person driving the roller, which places Roller in the middle. Trike can't be to the right of the bus (clue 8), so it must be on the left. Bus goes on the right.

# Step 1: Analyze the given clues


From clue 6, we know the boat driver is somewhere to the left of the journalist.

From clue 3, the chef is to the right of the accountant.

Clue 7 suggests the accountant could be driving the bus or drinking tea, or both.


# Step 2: Deduce more information from given clues


Given that the person watching documentary movies is not the chef (clue 2), and combining it with clue 4, we know the person watching epic movies cannot be in position 3 since documentaries are to their right.

From clue 8, if the train driver isn't drinking tea or watching epics, they must be associated with either hot-chocolate and/or documentary/action.


# Step 3: Determine positions for some hobbies and beverages


Clue 9 implies a connection between magic-tricks and either hot-chocolate or documentaries but not both. Clue 10 further restricts magic-tricks to not being associated with tea or epics, reinforcing this separation.

From clue 5, since the tea drinker isn't left of the baker, we can infer possible beverage distributions considering the restrictions on other hobbies.


# Step 4: Finalize positions for jobs and transport


Clue 11 restricts the accountant from being to the left of magic-tricks, which helps in further defining job placements.

Using all previous deductions, especially clue 12 about the chef not being right of epic movies, we can place jobs and transport more accurately.


After meticulously applying these steps and considering each clue against the others for contradictions or confirmations, we arrive at a solution:

#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 9, we know the person drinking water is on the far right. Clue 10 tells us this person is also Russian.

Clue 7 states that the videographer is to the right of the person driving the trike. Since the videographer can't be in position 1 (as there's no one to their left), they must be in position 3, and the person driving the trike is in position 2 or 1.

Clue 8 says the Australian is either watching adventure movies or driving the snowmobile, but not both. If the Australian were driving the snowmobile, they'd be in position 2 (as the videographer is in position 3). But then, who would watch adventure movies? So, the Australian must be watching adventure movies.

From clue 1, we know the electrician is to the left of the videographer. Since the videographer is in position 3, the electrician must be in position 1 or 2. Clue 13 says the electrician is also to the left of the person watching disaster movies. This means the electrician can't watch disaster movies (clue 4), so they must watch documentary movies.

The librarian's position is now determined by clue 2, which states that the person drinking cola and the librarian have different parity positions. So, the librarian must be in an even position, i.e., position 2.

Clues 6 and 12 help us determine the nationality of the electrician (Japanese) and the transport used by the Australian (snowmobile).

The remaining information can be filled in accordingly.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 10, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is in an even position (2).
2. Clue 4 states that the person drinking soy-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking iced-tea, so the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 1.
3. From clue 8, we know that the person drinking soy-milk is either the mexican or the person watching martial-arts movies (or both). Since there's no other information linking a nationality to soy-milk, it's likely that the person drinking soy-milk is indeed the mexican.
4. Clue 9 states that the person driving the jet-ski is on the left of the person watching disaster movies, and since the person drinking cola is either the person driving the jet-ski or eating cauliflower (clue 6), we can deduce that the person driving the jet-ski is in position 1.
5. Clues 7 and 3 tell us that the person watching disaster movies is to the right of the japanese, and the brazilian is to the right of the person watching disaster movies. Since there's no other information linking a nationality to the disaster movie genre, we can conclude that the person watching disaster movies is in position 3.
6. Clue 11 states that the person eating carrot is on the left of the brazilian, so the person eating carrot must be in position 1 (already occupied by the mexican), or more likely, in a different column but still to the left of the brazilian.
7. From clue 12, we know that the person driving the bus is either the brazilian or the person watching martial-arts movies (or both). Since there's no other information linking a nationality to the bus, it's likely that the person driving the bus is indeed the person watching martial-arts movies.
8. Clue 5 states that the person eating mango is not to the left of the person driving the car, which means the person eating mango must be in position 2 (since there's no other column where the person eating mango could be without being to the left of the person driving the car).
9. The remaining pieces fall into place: the person watching thriller movies is not the person drinking iced-tea or eating mango, so it must be the person in position 3 who watches disaster movies; and the person eating cauliflower is in position 3 (since there's no other column where they could go without conflicting with other clues).

After filling in all the remaining blanks, we get the final solution table:

Let me walk you through the deductions that led to this solution:


From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is filmmaking is on the right of the person driving the train. Combining with clue 1, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is dancing is not on the leftmost position.


Clue 10 tells us the person eating lettuce is on the left of the person driving the train. This means the person eating lettuce must be in position 1.


From clue 8, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is on the left of the person drinking water. Since the person drinking water is driving the snowmobile (clue 5), and the person driving the snowmobile is to the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (clue 3), we can conclude that the person who's hobby is dancing must be in position 2.


Now, combining clues 6 and 7, we know the person drinking sprite cannot be the fan funk or the person whose hobby is filmmaking. This means the person drinking sprite must be the person eating blueberry (as they have the same parity positions).


Clue 11 tells us the fan disco is on the left of the fan indie. Since the person who's hobby is dancing has to be in position 2, and the fan funk cannot be to their right (clue 12), we can conclude that the fan disco must be in position 1.


From clue 9, we know the person eating banana is not to the right of the fan funk. This means the person eating banana must be in position 3.


Now, using clue 4, we can determine that the person drinking water must be in either position 2 or 3. However, since the person driving the snowmobile (water) is on the right of the person who's hobby is dancing (position 2), we conclude that the person drinking water must be in position 3.


Finally, using clue 7, we can determine that the person who's hobby is card-games and the person drinking lemonade have the same parity positions. Since the person drinking sprite is already assigned to position 1, the person drinking lemonade must be in position 2 or 3. However, since the person who's hobby is dancing is already in position 2, we conclude that the person drinking lemonade must be in position 1.
