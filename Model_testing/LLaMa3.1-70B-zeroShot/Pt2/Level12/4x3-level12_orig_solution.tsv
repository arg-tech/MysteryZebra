| Hobby         | Board-games | Hiking      | Camping |
| Movie-Genre   | Documentary | Time-travel | Family  |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 8 tells us that the person drinking iced-tea is to the right of the person eating pomegranate.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person eating carrot is to the right of the person eating pomegranate, so the order for food is: Pomegranate, ?, Carrot. The remaining option, Blueberry, must be in the middle.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person who's hobby is hiking is between the person drinking 7up and the person watching time-travel movies. Since the person eating carrot is not to the left of the person who's hobby is board-games (Clue 5), Hiking must be in position 2.
* Clue 9 tells us that the person watching documentary movies and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions, so they must both be in odd or even positions. Since Iced-tea is already in an odd position, Documentary must also be in an odd position (1). This means Time-travel must be in position 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person eating carrot and the person watching documentary movies have different parity positions, so they can't both be in odd or even positions. Since Documentary is already in an odd position, Carrot must be in an even position (3).
* The remaining options for beverage are Mirinda and Iced-tea. Clue 1 tells us that the person watching time-travel movies is not to the right of the person drinking iced-tea, so Time-travel must be in a lower position than Iced-tea. This means Time-travel is in position 2, and Iced-tea is in position 3.
* The only remaining option for beverage is Mirinda, which goes in position 1.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person who's hobby is camping is not to the left of the person watching family movies. Since Family is already in an even position (2), Camping must be in a higher position than Board-games (which can't be in position 1 since it would be to the right of Hiking). Therefore, Camping goes in position 3, and Board-games goes in position 1.

Lv12-4x3-2	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with a possible solution for the puzzle:


|         |      1       |     2     |     3     |
| Food    | Blueberry   | Plum      | Tomato    |
| Hobby   | Skydiving   | Baking    | Hiking    |
| Job     | Scientist  | Coach     | Photographer|
| Sport   | Baseball    | Snowboarding| Swimming    |

Let me explain the reasoning behind this solution:

From clue 7, we know that Plum is to the left of Tomato. This gives us a partial order for the Food row.

Clue 9 states that Baseball is to the left of Baking. Since Baseball can't be in position 3 (due to clue 2), it must be in position 1 or 2. If Baseball were in position 1, then Baking would have to be in position 2 (since Plum is already in position 2). However, this would contradict clue 4, which states that either the person who's sport is Swimming or the person eating Tomato has a hobby of Baking (or both). Therefore, Baseball must be in position 1.

Now, from clue 10, we know that Skydiving is to the right of Blueberry. Since Skydiving can't be in position 3 (due to clue 2), it must be in position 2 or 3. If Skydiving were in position 3, then Blueberry would have to be in position 1 or 2, which contradicts our previous conclusion that Baseball is in position 1. Therefore, Skydiving must be in position 2.

The remaining positions can be filled using the other clues:


|         |      1       |     2     |     3     |
| Food    | Blueberry   | Plum      | Tomato    |
| Hobby   | Skydiving   | Baking    | Hiking    |
| Job     | Scientist  | Coach     | Photographer|
| Sport   | Baseball    | Snowboarding| Swimming    |

This solution satisfies all the given clues.

Lv12-4x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Music-Genre   | soul      | punk       | pop        |
| Pet           | goat      | rabbit     | chinchilla |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person who likes reading eats nectarine.

Clue 2 tells us that the person eating peas is not to the left of the person who likes reading. This means that the person eating peas must be in position 3.

Clue 3 gives us two possibilities: either the person who likes traveling doesn't eat nectarine, or they don't own a rabbit. We'll come back to this later.

Clue 4 tells us that the owner of the goat is to the left of the fan of soul music.

Clue 5 states that the person who likes reading and the person eating radish have the same parity positions (i.e., both in odd or even positions). Since the person who likes reading eats nectarine, this means that the person eating radish must be in position 1 (an odd position).

Clue 6 tells us that the person who likes card-games and the person eating peas have the same parity positions. This means that the person who likes card-games must be in position 2 (an even position), since the person eating peas is already in position 3.

Now, let's go back to clue 3. If the person who likes traveling doesn't eat nectarine, then they must be in position 1 or 3. But we already know that the person eating radish is in position 1, and the person eating peas is in position 3. So, this possibility is ruled out.

Therefore, the person who likes traveling must not own a rabbit. This means that the owner of the rabbit must be in position 2 (since the person who likes reading eats nectarine and is already in position 2).

Clue 7 tells us that the person eating nectarine is to the left of the owner of the rabbit, which confirms our previous conclusion.

Finally, clue 8 tells us that the owner of the rabbit is to the left of the fan of pop music. This means that the fan of pop music must be in position 3.

Putting it all together, we get the solution above.

| Music-Genre   | salsa      | hip-hop | dubstep       |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 8, we know that the person watching sports movies is on the far left. Clue 4 tells us that this person is to the left of the person watching action movies.

Clue 2 gives us two possibilities for the fan salsa: either they drink water or their hobby is magic-tricks. Since the person drinking water is already placed (from clue 7), we can deduce that the fan salsa has a hobby of magic-tricks.

From clue 3, we know that the fan hip-hop is to the left of the fan salsa. This means that the fan hip-hop must be in position 2.

Clue 5 tells us that the person drinking mirinda has a hobby of writing. Clue 6 gives us two possibilities for the fan dubstep: either they don't have a hobby of writing or they don't drink mirinda. Since we already know that the person with a hobby of writing drinks mirinda, it means that the fan dubstep doesn't have a hobby of writing and therefore must be in position 3.

Clue 1 tells us that the person watching comedy movies and the person drinking iced-tea are in positions with the same parity (i.e., both odd or both even). Since the person watching comedy movies is already placed (from clue 4), we can deduce that they drink iced-tea.

Finally, we fill in the remaining blanks to get the final solution.

Since the person whose sport is cricket is on column 1, the person eating grapes must be on column 2 (which is already occupied by kale), or the mechanic must be on column 3 (but the security-guard is already there). Therefore, the mechanic must be on column 1.

Since the person eating kale is on column 2, and the person with the camping hobby (skateboarding) is also on column 2, the person whose sport is sailing must be on either column 1 or column 3. However, since the person whose sport is cricket is already on column 1, the person whose sport is sailing must be on column 3.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:

* From statement 3, we know the German is on the far left or right. Since the German can't be to the left of the person who's sport is Rugby (statement 10), and the person eating Broccoli is the one who's sport is Rugby (statement 9), the German must be on the far left.
* From statement 6, we know the person eating Avocado is either the person who's sport is Handball or the person driving the Boat. Since the German is already on the far left, and the person driving the Snowmobile is in an even position (statement 7), the person eating Avocado must be in position 1.
* From statement 4, we know the German is to the left of the Russian. This means the Indian must be in the middle, as the German can't be on the far right.
* The rest of the puzzle falls into place by combining statements 2, 8, and 11: the person driving the Jet-ski is not the Indian (so it must be either the German or the Russian), but also can't be to the right of the Snowmobile. Therefore, the Snowmobile must be in position 3.
* Statement 12 tells us that the Boat is to the right of Cricket. Since the Boat is already in position 1, Cricket must be in position 2.

Lv12-4x3-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the correct information. Here is the solved puzzle:

| Job        | project-manager | doctor           | fisherman|
| Pet        | bird      | turtle          | lizard    |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 8, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is the owner of the turtle. Clue 9 tells us that the owner of the bird and the person drinking iced-tea have the same parity positions, so they must be in columns 1 and 3.

Clue 4 indicates that the owner of the bird is on the left or right of the person eating pear. Since the bird is in column 1, the pear must be in either column 2 or 3. Clue 7 rules out the possibility of the pear being in column 3 (since it's not the project-manager or the turtle owner), so the pear must be in column 2.

Clue 6 states that the fisherman and the person eating pepper have the same parity positions, which means they're both in either columns 1 and 3 or columns 2. Since the fisherman can't be in column 2 (because of clue 7), they must be in columns 1 and 3.

Clue 5 tells us that the doctor is to the right of the owner of the turtle, so the doctor must be in either column 2 or 3. Clue 11 indicates that the person drinking lemonade is to the right of the owner of the lizard, which means the lemonade drinker can't be in column 1.

Now we have a good idea of where each item can go. By using clues 2 and 10, we can figure out that the project-manager must drink cola and own the bird (since they're not ruled out by any other clue). The rest of the items fall into place based on the remaining clues.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the person drinking almond-milk is between the fan of soul and the fan of reggae.

From clue 5, we know the person drinking juice is the fan of soul. So, the order is: Almond-Milk - Juice (Soul) - ? (Reggae)

Clue 7 says the person drinking almond-milk is on the left or right of the person drinking juice. This confirms the previous deduction.

From clue 8, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the left of the person drinking lemonade.

Combining clues 1 and 2, we can deduce that the person watching animation movies is not the journalist (clue 1), and the designer is not watching zombie movies (clue 2). This suggests that the person watching zombie movies is likely the bartender or the journalist. However, since the person drinking lemonade is not to the right of the bartender (clue 6), we can conclude that the bartender is watching thriller movies.

From clue 9, we know the person watching thriller movies is not to the left of the fan reggae. Since the fan reggae is on the rightmost position (due to the previous deductions), this means the person watching thriller movies must be in the middle column.

Clue 10 provides additional information that helps us determine the positions of the movie genres and jobs.

Putting all these pieces together, we arrive at the final solution:

The only available food left for position 2 (funk) is tomato. But from clue 6, the owner of the snake (position 1) is to the left of the person eating tomato. So, the person eating tomato must be in position 3.

| Beverage      | coffee |           | 7up        |

| Music-Genre   | classical | funk       |            |
| Pet           | snake   | chinchilla|            |

From clue 7, we know the person eating tomato and the owner of the turtle have the same parity positions.


Since the person eating tomato is in position 3 (odd), the owner of the turtle must also be in an odd position. The only available odd position is 1.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      |        |           |            |
| Food          |        | radish    | tomato     |
| Music-Genre   | classical | funk       |            |
| Pet           | turtle  | chinchilla| snake      |

From clue 12, we know the owner of the turtle is drinking coffee.


From clue 10, we know the person eating peach is not drinking coffee (because if they were, then the person drinking coffee would be a fan of trance, but that's not possible since the owner of the turtle is drinking coffee and is not a fan of trance).


So, the person eating peach must be in position 3.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | coffee |           |            |
| Food          |        | radish    | peach      |
| Music-Genre   | classical | funk       |            |
| Pet           | turtle  | chinchilla| snake      |

From clue 1, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the right of the person drinking coffee.


Since the person drinking coffee is in position 1, the person drinking soy-milk must be in position 2.


|               |   1    |     2     |     3      |
| Beverage      | coffee | soy-milk  |            |
| Food          |        | radish    | peach      |
| Music-Genre   | classical | funk       |            |
| Pet           | turtle  | chinchilla| snake      |

The only beverage left is 7up, which must be in position 3.


From clue 11, we know the owner of the turtle (position 1) is not drinking 7up.


So, the person drinking 7up must be a fan of trance.


The final solution is:
