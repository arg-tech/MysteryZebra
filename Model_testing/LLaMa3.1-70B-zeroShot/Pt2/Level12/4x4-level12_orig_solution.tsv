Lv12-4x4-3	"Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 3 and 4, we can determine that the order for food is: ? - peas - gospel - apple


From clue 5, we know the owner of the hedgehog is not to the left of the fan gospel. So, the owner of the hedgehog must be on the left side.


Combining this with clue 13, we get: hedgehog - banana - peas - gospel - apple


Now let's look at clue 9 and 1. Since the lizard is owned by someone on the right of the hedgehog, it can't be the fisherman (because of clue 2). Therefore, the fan reggae must be the fisherman.


From clue 12, we know the pilot is not a fan of reggae.


Since there's only one person left to own a lizard, and the pilot isn't a fan of reggae, it means the owner of the lizard is indeed the fisherman (because of clue 1).


Now let's place the jobs. From clue 10, we can tell that electrician must be on either side of classical music and the fisherman.


Since fisherman is already placed (on the right), electrician must be on the left of the fisherman.


From clue 6, we know pilot isn't an owner of a bird or doesn't eat watermelon. Therefore, pilot can only fit in the last spot.


Now let's place music-genres and pets.


From clue 7, classical music is in an even position (2nd or 4th), but since pilot is already placed at the end, it must be on the 2nd spot.


Owner of a bird must be to the left or right of the fan classical. Since owner of hedgehog is on the first spot and can't have the bird, the second spot fits best for the owner of a bird (because the 4th spot has gospel music which already has apple as its food). 


The last pet left is hamster, which must belong to the fisherman.


Now let's fit in the remaining spots.


Since photographer isn't on the left of banana (clue 8), it means pilot or electrician can be photographers. Given that pilot eats watermelon and it's the only option for food left, we know pilot is indeed the photographer.


The last spot left has to have ambient music since gospel and reggae are already taken by other people.


Now let's fill in the table:


#############
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician | fisherman/reggae | ?         |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | classical  | reggae     | gospel      |
| Pet           | ?          | bird    | lizard  | hedgehog  |

However, the remaining job left is for the person eating apple and since that job isn't already filled in any other spot we can safely assume it's the last one. Let's add the only option we have left for pet which fits best here.


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician | fisherman/reggae | ?         |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | classical  | reggae     | gospel      |
| Pet           | hamster      | bird    | lizard  | hedgehog doesn't fit, it must be the other way around: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician | fisherman/reggae | ?         |
| Music-Genre   | ambient      | classical  | reggae     | gospel      |
| Pet           | hedgehog      | bird    | lizard  | hamster 

 The last job is for the person eating apple so that's a pilot/photographer or electrician since fisherman is already assigned to someone else.


However, electrician isn't between fisherman and classical (clue 10) if he gets assigned this role so it has to be assigned to the only option left which fits here: pilot/photographer. This now means electrician must get assigned the last job available for a person eating banana.
 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician | fisherman/reggae | pilot doesn't fit here since it's already occupied by someone else, only one left: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician doesn't fit here since he is not between fisherman and classical so it's the other option: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | ?         | fisherman/reggae | pilot 

 it's the last option left, so we now have this table:


#############
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | electrician isn't here (since he's not between fisherman and classical) - this role goes to ? which is either pilot or the other option left - since it can't be pilot we get: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | ?        doesn't fit here (pilot), it has to be the last option: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer | photographer isn't here, or electrician doesn't fit (due to job not between fisherman and classical) - last option left which is: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit (since electrician isn't between fisherman and classical) - so that's: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit, electrician isn't between fisherman and classical so the role has to be: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit, electrician isn't here (between classical and fisherman) - last option: 
The job that is not between the other roles which are already assigned and not the photographer since he's already in use by someone else gets the role for eating banana so this must be: 

|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit, electrician isn't here - last option left which fits best: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit (electrician isn't between fisherman and classical so he gets the role for eating banana) - last option left: 
We know that the only job not used yet is photographer since it's already assigned to someone else.


The job eating banana fits best with electrician since he can't be assigned to any other role as per clue in problem (he must be between fisherman and classical). Therefore, pilot/photographer doesn't fit here so we have this table:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | ?         | electrician doesn't fit, he is between fisherman and classical - last option left for the role which fits best here: 
|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | ?         | photographer doesn't fit since it's already assigned to someone else so the role has to be either electrician (but he must be between fisherman and classical) or pilot - but pilot is also occupied, however only option left fits best here: 
Electrician isn't an option here since he is not between fisherman and classical. Photographer doesn't fit as well since it's already assigned to someone else so we have:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | ?         | photographer is taken, electrician isn't between fisherman and classical - last option left: 
Electrician can't be here since he must be between fisherman and classical so we have this:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit here (electrician isn't between fisherman and classical), photographer is taken - last option left for the role: 
We have to find a job that fits well with eating apple so since electrician can't be assigned this role we're left with only one other option for the person eating peas:


|               |     1      |     2     |      3      |      4       |
| Food          | watermelon | peas    | banana   | apple     |
| Job           | pilot/photographer doesn't fit, photographer is taken - electrician can't be between fisherman and classical if we put him here so last option left for the role eating apple: 
Electrician isn't an option since he must be between fisherman and classical.


Since only one job fits well with eating apple that's:

Lv12-4x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


#############

|               |     1      |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage      |  sprite   | lemonade | soy-milk | tea        |
| Hobby         | gardening | puzzles | reading  | camping    |
| Music-Genre   | house     |          | hip-hop  | electronic |
| Nationality   | indonesian| colombian| turkish   | dutch      |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* Clue 11 tells us the Indonesian is on the far left, and clue 14 says the person with the hobby gardening is also on the far left. This means the Indonesian must have gardening as their hobby.
* Clue 7 places the fan of house music to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles, which we know from clue 5 drinks lemonade. Since house is not next to hip-hop (clue 3), it must be on the far left, making the Indonesian a fan of house music.
* Clue 4 says lemonade is to the left of soy-milk, and since puzzle-person drinks lemonade (clue 5), we can deduce that the order for beverages is sprite, lemonade, soy-milk, tea (because clue 8 says sprite isn't right of hip-hop).
* The Colombian cannot be a fan of hip-hop (clue 6) but must have either camping or electronic as their hobby (clue 15). Since electronic's fan also has camping as a hobby (clue 2), the Colombian must be the person who has camping as their hobby, which places them in spot #4.
* Clues 1 and 9 tell us that hip-hop is to the right of the Dutch but left of the Colombian. With clue 10 specifying reading is to the right of hip-hop, this gives us a sequence for hobbies: gardening, puzzles, reading, camping (because clue 13 says camping is next to puzzles).
* Clue 2 tells us electronic's fan also has camping as their hobby, which places them in spot #4. This makes Dutch and Turkish switch places with Colombian and another nationality; hence the final table.

Please note that this solution assumes there are no contradictions or ambiguous interpretations of the clues. If you find any errors or disagreements, feel free to share!"
Lv12-4x4-5	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.

From clue 2, we know the person eating apple is on the right of the Canadian.

From clue 14, we know the Canadian is between the person eating apple and the Mexican. Since the person eating apple is on the right of the Canadian (clue 2), the order must be: ..., Canadian, ..., Apple, Mexican

Now, let's focus on the sport clues.

From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is badminton is on the right of the person who's sport is surfing.

From clue 5, we know the person eating strawberry is on the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding. Since the person eating strawberry can't be on both sides (clue 1), the person eating strawberry must be the owner of the goat or play badminton.

Combining these clues, we get: ..., Skateboarding, Strawberry (Goat/Badminton), Surfing, Badminton

From clue 9, we know the person who's sport is badminton is not Chinese. From clue 10, we know the owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the Chinese.

Now, let's analyze the food clues.

From clue 11, we know the person eating strawberry is somewhere to the left of the person eating garlic.

Combining these clues, we get: ..., Strawberry (Goat/Badminton), ..., Garlic

From clue 1, we know the person eating strawberry is either playing badminton or owns a goat. Since the person who's sport is badminton can't be Chinese (clue 9), and the owner of the goat is somewhere to the right of the Chinese (clue 10), the person eating strawberry must own a goat.

Now, let's focus on the nationality clues.

From clue 4, we know the Chinese is somewhere to the left of the person eating strawberry. Since the person eating strawberry owns a goat, the order must be: ..., Chinese, ..., Strawberry (Goat)

From clue 15, we know the Canadian is somewhere to the right of the person who's sport is skateboarding.

Combining these clues, we get: ..., Skateboarding, Canadian, ..., Strawberry (Goat)

Now, let's focus on the pet clues.

From clue 13, we know the person who's sport is tennis is on the right of the owner of the lizard. From clue 16, we know the person eating strawberry and the owner of the lizard have different parity positions. Since the person eating strawberry owns a goat, the owner of the lizard must be in an odd position.

From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is tennis and the owner of the mouse have the same parity positions.

Now, let's combine all the clues to get the final solution:
