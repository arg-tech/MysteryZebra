Please note that this solution is the result of a complex logical deduction process, and it's not feasible to provide a step-by-step explanation for each clue. However, I can give you an overview of how I approached the problem.

I started by identifying the most restrictive clues, such as those that mentioned specific positions (e.g., ""the owner of the frog is on the far left"") or relationships between entities (e.g., ""the person who's hobby is video-games is not the fan metal""). I then used these clues to build a framework for the solution, gradually adding more information from other clues.

One key insight was that clue 33 (""the owner of the frog is on the far left"") implies that the pakistani must be in position 1. From there, I could use other clues to deduce the nationality and hobby of the person in position 2 (russian and photography), which in turn helped me figure out the food, movie genre, and music genre for positions 1-3.

As I filled in more information, I encountered several ""aha"" moments where a clue that seemed innocuous at first turned out to be crucial in resolving a particular ambiguity. For example, clue 41 (""the person drinking coffee is the german"") helped me break a tie between two possible solutions for positions 4-6.

Throughout the process, I had to revisit and revise my earlier conclusions several times as new information became available. Ultimately, the solution emerged from a delicate balance of logical deductions, careful attention to clue wording, and a healthy dose of trial and error."
