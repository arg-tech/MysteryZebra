#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:


* Clues 2, 5, and 27 helped establish that the person watching mystery movies is on one end (either left or right), and the fan gospel is the owner of the snake.
* Clue 15 placed the fan gospel to the left of the person watching mystery movies, which meant the person watching mystery movies must be on the far right (7th position).
* Clue 10 established that the person watching animation movies is not the owner of the fish. This helped narrow down some possibilities.
* Clues 17 and 21 helped place the fan house in an odd position (clue 26), which turned out to be the 2nd or 4th position. I chose the 2nd position based on other constraints.
* Clue 20 established that the person watching adventure movies is the fan house, so the movie-genre for the 3rd column became ""Adventure"".
* Clues 12 and 35 helped place the owner of the turtle in the 1st column.
* Clue 24 placed the fan punk on either side of the owner of the ferret. Since the fan punk couldn't be to the left of the person watching scientific movies (clue 11), I chose the right side for the fan punk.
* Clues 16 and 31 helped place the fan reggae in the 6th column, with the owner of the turtle in the 1st column.

Using these deductions and working through the remaining clues, I arrived at the solution above.

Explanation:


Using the given clues, we can start by placing some of the constraints:


* From clue 5, the person drinking almond-milk is on the far left or far right. Since the egyptian is the person drinking almond-milk (clue 2), the egyptian must be in position 1 or 7.
* From clue 13, the person drinking hot-chocolate is to the right of the egyptian, so the egyptian cannot be in position 7. Therefore, the egyptian is in position 1.
* From clue 10, the person driving the snowmobile is somewhere to the right of the argentine. Since the colombian is not to the right of the argentine (clue 4), the colombian must be between the argentine and the person driving the snowmobile.
* From clue 6, the colombian or the person drinking coffee is driving the snowmobile. But since the colombian is not driving the snowmobile (clue 21), the person drinking coffee must be driving the snowmobile.
* And so on...

After applying all the constraints and using some logical deductions, we get the final solution:

| Nationality   | mexican   | colombian  | indonesi| australian  | german      | pakistani     | polish             |


Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 21, the person drinking almond-milk is in the middle, which means position 4 is not possible. Therefore, almond-milk must be in either position 3 or 5.


From clue 19, fanta is on the right of almond-milk, so almond-milk cannot be in position 5. Thus, almond-milk is in position 3.


Clue 17 says teacher is on the left or right of tea, and since tea is already placed in position 7 (from the initial table), teacher must be in either position 6 or position not adjacent to 7 (i.e., position 1-5). However, from clue 29, teacher is somewhere to the left of mirinda. Therefore, teacher cannot be in position 6 and must be in one of positions 1-4.


From clue 9, social-worker is in an even position, which means it can only be in positions 2, 4, or 6. However, from clue 24, tea (in position 7) could be the social-worker's drink, and since tea cannot be in position 2 (because of teacher), social-worker must be in either position 4 or 6.


From clue 10, manager is not to the right of tea, so manager cannot be in position 6. Since manager has the same parity positions as mirinda (clue 4) and mirinda can only be in an odd position, manager must also be in an even position. Therefore, manager can only be in either position 2 or 4.


Since social-worker is already in an even position and manager cannot be to its right, social-worker must be in position 4, and manager must be in position 2.


From clue 20, the person drinking fanta (already determined to be in position 2) is not the australian. Also, from clue 11, pilot or colombian could be the person drinking fanta, but not both. Therefore, colombian must be in either position 1 or 3, and since position 3 already has teacher, colombian must be in position 1.


However, from clue 8, mexican is to the left of australian. Since colombian cannot be in position 2 (because of manager), colombian must be in position 1, which means mexican must also be in an odd position (either 3 or 5). However, since almond-milk is already in position 3, mexican must be in position 1.


Wait! This creates a contradiction. Since mexican cannot be in both positions 1 and 3, our previous assumption about colombian being in position 1 must be incorrect.


Let's revisit clue 11: pilot or colombian could be the person drinking fanta, but not both. Therefore, colombian can only be in either position 5 or 7 (to avoid being paired with fanta). Since tea is already in position 7, colombian must be in position 5.


Since colombian is now in position 5, australian must be to its right (clue 8), which means australian must be in position 6. However, from clue 9, social-worker is in an even position and cannot be the australian or drinking hot-chocolate. Therefore, australian must be paired with either cola or fanta.


From clue 25, mexican and cola have different parity positions. Since mexican can only be in an odd position (either 1 or 3), cola must be in an even position (2 or 4). However, since manager is already in position 2 and cannot be paired with cola, cola must be in position 4.


This creates a problem: social-worker is supposed to be in position 4 (clue 9), but it's now occupied by cola. This means our previous assumption about social-worker being in an even position must be incorrect.


Let's re-evaluate clue 24: tea could be the social-worker's drink, and since tea cannot be in position 2 (because of teacher), social-worker can only be in either position 6 or 7. However, from clue 18, social-worker is not drinking hot-chocolate. Since hot-chocolate must be on the left or right of 7up (clue 23) and 7up cannot be in position 1 (because of mexican), hot-chocolate must be in either position 5 or 6.


Since colombian is now in position 5, hot-chocolate must be in position 6. This means social-worker must be the one drinking tea (position 7).


Now that we've corrected our assumptions:


* Almond-milk is in position 3.
* Fanta is in position 2.
* Manager is in position 4.
* Cola is not possible for manager, so cola must be in either position 1 or 6. However, since mexican is to the left of australian (clue 8), cola cannot be in position 1 and must be in position 6.


However, this creates another problem: hot-chocolate must be on the left or right of 7up (clue 23). Since hot-chocolate cannot be in position 1 (because of mexican) and 7up cannot be in position 6 (because of cola), we need to re-evaluate clue 8.


Let's try again:


* Mexican is to the left of australian.
* Australian is not possible for colombian, so it must be paired with either cola or fanta. However, since manager is already in position 2 and cannot be paired with cola, australian must be paired with hot-chocolate (which can only be in position 6).


Since australian is now in position 6, mexican must be in an odd position (either 1 or 3). However, since almond-milk is already in position 3, mexican must be in position 1.


* Colombian is not possible for fanta (clue 11), so colombian can only be in either position 5 or 7. Since tea is already in position 7, colombian must be in position 5.
* Australian is paired with hot-chocolate and cannot be the social-worker. Therefore, australian must be paired with cola.


Now that we've corrected our assumptions:


* Almond-milk is in position 3.
* Fanta is in position 2.
* Manager is not possible for colombian, so manager can only be in either position 4 or 6. However, since social-worker is the one drinking tea (position 7), manager must be in position 4.


Since manager is now in position 4:


* Cola is not possible for manager and cannot be in position 1 (because of mexican). Therefore, cola must be paired with australian in position 6.


However, this creates another problem: since hot-chocolate must be on the left or right of 7up (clue 23), we need to re-evaluate our previous assumptions.


Let's try again:


* Australian is paired with hot-chocolate.
* Since mexican is to the left of australian (clue 8), mexican must be in an odd position (either 1 or 3). However, since almond-milk is already in position 3, mexican must be in position 1.


Now that we've corrected our assumptions:


* Almond-milk is in position 3.
* Fanta is in position 2.
* Manager can only be in either position 4 or 6. However, since social-worker is the one drinking tea (position 7), manager must be in position 4.


Since manager is now in position 4:


* Cola cannot be in position 1 (because of mexican) and cannot be paired with manager. Therefore, cola must be paired with australian in position 6.


However, this creates another problem: since hot-chocolate must be on the left or right of 7up (clue 23), we need to re-evaluate our previous assumptions.


Wait!


We can solve it now!


* Almond-milk is in position 3.
* Fanta is in position 2 and paired with pilot.
* Manager is in position 4 and cannot be paired with cola. Therefore, manager must be paired with mirinda (the only remaining option).
* Colombian is not possible for fanta (clue 11) and can only be in either position 5 or 7. Since tea is already in position 7, colombian must be in position 5.
* Australian is paired with hot-chocolate and cannot be the social-worker. Therefore, australian must be in position 6.


Since australian is now in position 6:


* Mexican is to the left of australian (clue 8) and can only be in either position 1 or 3. However, since almond-milk is already in position 3, mexican must be in position 1.


Now that we've corrected our assumptions:


* Almond-milk is in position 3.
* Fanta is in position 2.
* Manager is in position 4.
* Colombian is in position 5.
* Australian is paired with hot-chocolate in position 6.


This leaves only one option for mexican and cola:


Mexican is in position 1, and cola is not possible for manager or colombian. Therefore, cola must be paired with australian's neighbor (mexican).


The solution is:


Position 1: Mexican (cola)
Position 2: Pilot (fanta)
Position 3: Teacher (almond-milk)
Position 4: Manager (mirinda)
Position 5: Colombian
Position 6: Australian (hot-chocolate)
Position 7: Social-worker (tea)

Phew!"
