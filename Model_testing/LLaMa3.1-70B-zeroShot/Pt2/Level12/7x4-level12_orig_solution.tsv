Lv12-7x4-1	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle:


|               |      1      |     2      |      3       |     4      |

| Transport     | bike        | taxi        | subway       | quad-bike  |

Please note that this is just one possible solution, and there might be other valid solutions. However, I've tried to satisfy all the given clues with this arrangement.


Here are some explanations for the deductions:


* Clue 28 suggests that folk is either on the far left or far right. Since folk is not on the far right (due to clue 19), it must be on the far left.
* Clue 26 states that the person who's hobby is card-games is in an even position, which means they are in column 2 or 4. However, clue 8 suggests that the person eating banana is either the person who's hobby is card-games or the thai. Since banana can't be in an odd position (due to clue 12), it must be in an even position, and therefore, the person who's hobby is card-games must be in column 4.
* Clue 9 states that the photographer is somewhere to the left of the fan folk. Since folk is on the far left, the photographer must be in column 2 or 3. However, clue 22 suggests that the engineer is not to the right of the photographer, which means the engineer must be in column 2.
* Clue 13 states that the person eating raspberry is somewhere to the right of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since kale is between raspberry and video-games (clue 2), and video-games is on the far left, raspberry must be in column 3 or 4. However, clue 11 suggests that the person who's hobby is cooking and the person eating raspberry have different parity positions, which means they can't both be in odd or even columns. Therefore, raspberry must be in an odd column (column 3), and the person who's hobby is cooking must be in an even column (column 2).
* Clue 15 suggests that the fan d&b is not the owner of the lizard. Since the lizard is already placed in column 1, the fan d&b must be in a different column.
* Clue 20 states that the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is not to the left of the fan d&b. Since magic-tricks is on the far right (due to clue 23), and the lizard is already placed in column 1, the fan d&b must be in column 3.
* Clue 4 states that the dancer is somewhere to the left of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the dancer is already placed in column 3, the owner of the chinchilla must be in a column to their right (column 4).
* Clue 16 suggests that the owner of the mouse and the fan d&b have the same parity positions. Since the fan d&b is in an odd column (column 3), the owner of the mouse must also be in an odd column, which means they are in column 1 or 3.
* Clue 25 states that the musician is not to the left of the indian. Since the musician is already placed in column 4, the indian must be in a column to their left (column 2 or 3).
* Clue 14 suggests that the spanish is not to the left of the indian. However, clue 6 states that the indian is somewhere to the left of the spanish. This means that the indian must be immediately to the left of the spanish.
* Clue 24 states that the japanese is on the right of the photographer. Since the photographer is already placed in column 2 or 3, the japanese must be in a column to their right (column 3 or 4). However, clue 5 suggests that the dancer and the owner of the bird have the same parity positions, which means they are both in odd columns. Therefore, the japanese must be in an odd column (column 1).
* Clue 10 states that the person driving the quad-bike is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the quad-bike is already placed in column 4, the taxi must be in a column to their left (column 3 or 2). However, clue 1 suggests that the person driving the quad-bike is not the fan dubstep, and clue 7 states that the spanish is somewhere between the fan dubstep and the person driving the subway. This means that the subway must be in an odd column (column 1 or 3), and the taxi must be in an even column (column 2).
* Clue 21 suggests that the thai is either eating banana or owns the mouse, but not both. Since banana can't be in an odd position (due to clue 12), it must be in an even position (column 4). Therefore, the thai must own the mouse.
* Clue 27 states that the person driving the quad-bike is not the owner of the lizard or the fan d&b. Since the lizard and the fan d&b are already placed, the only remaining option for the person driving the quad-bike is to be in column 4.

I hope this explanation helps clarify some of the deductions!"

| Sport         | handball  | ice-hockey| rugby       | swimming     |

 
I'll walk you through the steps I took to solve it:


1. From clue 13, we know the dutch person eats eggplant.
2. From clue 27, we know the person eating eggplant doesn't drink sprite. This means the cola must be in column 1.
3. From clue 17, we know cooking is between milk and cola. So, cooking is in column 3, and milk is in column 4.
4. From clue 6, we know the indian drinks milk or owns a turtle. Since cooking is in column 3, the indian must be in column 4.
5. From clue 19, we know the person drinking milk doesn't own a turtle. So, the indian must drink milk.
6. From clue 18, we know sprite is to the left of milk. This means sprite is in column 2.
7. From clue 20, we know the owner of the mouse watches time-travel or drinks juice. Since sprite is in column 2 and cooking is in column 3, the mouse must be in column 3, watching time-travel movies, and drinking juice.
8. From clue 4, we know time-travel is between sprite and the mouse. So, time-travel is in column 3.
9. From clue 25, we know puzzles are not to the right of time-travel. This means puzzles are in column 2.
10. From clue 21, we know kiwi doesn't own a ferret or isn't puzzles. Since eggplant is already taken by the dutch, kiwi must be in column 3.
11. From clue 22, we know the mouse watches time-travel or ice-hockey. But we already know it's watching time-travel.
12. From clue 26, we know video-games eats nectarine or watches time-travel. Since puzzles is already taken by kiwi in column 2, video-games must be in column 1.
13. From clue 8, we know satire is to the left of time-travel. So, satire is in column 1.
14. From clue 3, we know ice-hockey doesn't eat nectarine. This means handball eats kiwi or lime (since eggplant and nectarine are taken).
15. From clue 10, we know handball is to the left of ferret. So, ferret must be in column 2.
16. From clue 24, we know milk doesn't eat kiwi. This means kiwi eats juice or lime (since eggplant and nectarine are taken).
17. From clue 29, we know ferret doesn't own an eggplant or drink sprite. So, ferret must be in column 2.
18. From clue 14, we know rugby is to the right of thai. This means thai is in column 3, and rugby is in column 4.
19. From clue 7, we know swimming is on either side of dutch. Since cola is already taken by video-games in column 1, swimming must be in column 4.
20. Finally, the remaining columns can be filled with the remaining options.

Note: This puzzle requires careful analysis and step-by-step reasoning. I hope this explanation helps clarify the solution!"

After analyzing all the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


#############
|               |      1      |       2       |      3      |    4    |

| Transport     | jet-ski      | boat         | bike        | ship     |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:


From clue 10, we know the person watching zombie movies is on the far left. From clue 28, we also know that this person drinks milk (not listed in the solution table). We can place the person drinking sprite and watching action movies to the right of them.


Clue 14 tells us the person who's sport is rowing is somewhere between the person who's hobby is rock-climbing and the malaysian. Clue 23 places this person between the one eating pear and the person watching spy movies, so we know the order for columns 1-3 must be (zombie), action, sports.


Clue 18 says the russian is either driving the ship or eating asparagus. Since clue 21 states that rock-climbing isn't to the right of apple, this means the person eating cabbage can't be in column 2, because then rock-climbing would have to be to its left. This places the person eating asparagus and volleyball (or iced-tea) in column 3.


Clue 12 says handball is to the left of asparagus, so this sport must be in column 1 or 2. However, since clue 9 states that parkour isn't watching sports movies, we know parkour can't be in column 2 (because then it would have to watch sports). This places parkour and boat in column 2.


Clue 15 tells us the person driving the ship is not parkour, so they must be the russian. Clue 19 states that jet-ski is to the left of the ship, so we place this transport mode in column 3.


The remaining items can be placed using a process of elimination and by considering the parity positions (odd or even columns) mentioned in some clues.

* Clue 18 established a connection between the person who's sport is soccer and the person drinking soy-milk or the person who's hobby is cooking.
* Clues 21 and 22 helped eliminate some possibilities for the italian and the owner of the snake.
* Clue 25 placed the manager to the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles.
