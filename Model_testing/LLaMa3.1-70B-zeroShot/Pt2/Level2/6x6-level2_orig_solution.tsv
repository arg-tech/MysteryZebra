| Transport     | bike    | skateboard | subway    | boat     | roller   | trike      |


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I solved the puzzle:


1. From clue #5, we know the chinese is on the far left.
2. From clue #20, we know the person driving the bike is on the far left, so it must be the chinese person.
3. From clue #21, we know the person driving the skateboard is on the right of the owner of the fish.
4. From clue #18, we know the person driving the skateboard is the person who's hobby is card-games.
5. So, the italian (clue #19) must be in column 2 or 3.
6. But if the italian were in column 3, then the fan of blues would not be to their right (clue #2).
7. Therefore, the italian is in column 2.
8. From clue #24, we know the person who's sport is surfing is the italian.
9. From clue #9, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving.
10. So, the person who's sport is rowing must be in column 3 or 4.
11. But if they were in column 4, then the person who's hobby is skydiving would not be to their right (clue #9).
12. Therefore, the person who's sport is rowing is in column 3.
13. From clue #13, we know the person who's sport is rowing is the owner of the frog.
14. The fan of dubstep must be on the left of the spanish (clue #22), so they can't be in column 1 or 6.
15. Therefore, the fan of dubstep is in column 2, 3, 4, or 5.
16. From clue #11, we know the fan of pop is on the far right, and from clue #7, we know their hobby is gardening.
17. So, the owner of the snake must be the person who's sport is cricket (clue #15), and they must also have gardening as a hobby (clue #10).
18. The only column where this works is column 5.
19. From clue #3, we know the fan of metal is on the left of the fan of country.
20. So, the fan of metal cannot be in column 6, and therefore must be in column 4 or 5.
21. But if they were in column 5, then the fan of country would not be to their right (clue #3).
22. Therefore, the fan of metal is in column 4.
23. From clue #6, we know the fan of country is on the left of the person driving the boat.
24. So, the fan of country must be in column 4 or 5.
25. But if they were in column 4, then there would not be enough space for the fan of metal (clue #3).
26. Therefore, the fan of country is in column 5.
27. The person driving the boat must be in column 6, and from clue #1, we know their sport is parkour.
28. From clue #17, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the person who's sport is rowing.
29. So, the person who's sport is water-polo must be in column 4 or 5.
30. But if they were in column 5, then there would not be enough space for the fan of country (clue #6).
31. Therefore, the person who's sport is water-polo is in column 4.
32. From clue #16, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the nigerian.
33. The only column where this works is column 6.
34. So, the nigerian must be in column 5.
35. But from clue #12, we know the owner of the goat is between the indonesian and the owner of the goldfish.
36. Therefore, the mexican (the only nationality left) must be in column 5, but that's not possible since the nigerian is already there.
37. So, the indonesian must be in column 6, and the person driving the trike is actually in column 4 or 5 (clue #16).
38. The only column where this works is column 5.
39. From clue #14, we know the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
40. So, the person driving the skateboard must be in column 3 or 4.
41. But if they were in column 4, then there would not be enough space for the fan of country (clue #6).
42. Therefore, the person driving the skateboard is in column 3.
43. From clue #8, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the right of the person driving the skateboard.
44. So, the person who's hobby is puzzles must be in column 4 or 5.
45. But if they were in column 5, then there would not be enough space for the fan of country (clue #6).
46. Therefore, the person who's hobby is puzzles is in column 4.
47. The only hobby left is reading, which must be in column 1 or 2.
48. So, the person with reading as a hobby must be in column 1 or 2.

This completes the puzzle!"
