#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know that western movies are on the far left.
* Clue 1 tells us that musical movies are to the right of adventure movies. Since western is already on the far left, this means that adventure must be in position 2 and musical in position 3.
* Clue 5 places the mexican on the far right, which corresponds to position 3.
* Clue 4 puts tea to the left of indian, so we can place polish (the only remaining nationality) on the far left with western movies.
* From clue 6, milk is to the left of fanta. We already have tea in position 1, so this means that milk must be in position 2 and fanta in position 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that bus is to the right of lizard. Since subway is still unplaced, we can put it on the far left with polish and western movies.
* Now, using clue 7, we know that cabbage is between chinchilla and mango. We already have tea (polish) in position 1, so this means that cabbage must be in position 2 with peas (indian) and mango (mexican).
* Finally, we place the remaining transport option, train, in position 3.

|               |     1     |      2      |    3     |
| Beverage      |  Fanta   |  Cola      |  Tea     |

| Sport         | Tennis    | Rowing     | Biathlon  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* Clue 1: Fanta is on the left of Cola, so Fanta must be in column 1.
* Clue 4: Chinchilla owner is on the right of the person watching Drama movies. Since Drama is likely in column 2 (due to clue 7), the Chinchilla owner must be in column 1.
* Clue 6: Lemon eater is between Pakistani and Tea drinker. This suggests that Lemon is in column 2, with Pakistani in column 1 and Tea in column 3.
* Clue 5: Cola is on the left of Dutch, which means Cola must be in column 2 (since Fanta is already in column 1).
* Clue 7: Documentary watcher is between Drama and Rat owner. This implies that Documentary is in column 2, with Drama in column 1 and Rat in column 3.
* The remaining clues help fill in the gaps:
	+ Biathlon sport is on the right of Chinchilla (clue 2), so it's in column 3.
	+ Rowing sport is on the left of Cabbage eater (clue 3), which means Rowing is in column 2 and Cabbage is in column 3.

I hope this solution is correct!"
Lv2-6x3-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know that the French is on the left of the Egyptian.

From clue 3, we can infer that the Egyptian is not the French, so they must be in different columns.


Since there are only three columns, the French must be in column 1 and the Egyptian must be in column 2 or 3.


Now, from clue 5, we know that the French is on the left of the fan of classical. This means that the fan of classical cannot be in column 1 (since the French is already there), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


From clue 7, we know that the person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the van. This means that the person driving the van cannot be in column 1 (since the car driver would have to be in column 0, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


From clue 9, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the fan of folk. This means that the fan of folk cannot be in column 1 (since the snowmobile driver would have to be in column 0, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


Now we can combine all this information:


French: column 1
Egyptian: column 2 or 3
Fan of classical: column 2 or 3
Person driving van: column 2 or 3
Fan of folk: column 2 or 3


From clue 8, we know that the fan of folk is on the left of the person eating pumpkin. This means that the person eating pumpkin cannot be in column 1 (since the fan of folk would have to be in column 0, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


Now, from clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person eating nectarine. This means that the person eating nectarine cannot be in column 1 (since the writer would have to be in column 0 or -1, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


However, we already know that the fan of folk is on the left of the person eating pumpkin (clue 8), and the fan of folk is also on the left of the person driving the snowmobile (clue 9). This means that the person eating pumpkin cannot be in column 1 or 2 (since the fan of folk would have to be in column 0 or 1, which doesn't make sense), so they must be in column 3.


Now we can start filling in some values:


|               |     1      |    2    |     3     |
| Food          |            |         | pumpkin   |

| Transport     |            |         |           |

From clue 1, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is between the Mexican and the owner of the cat. This means that the writer cannot be in column 3 (since there would have to be two people to their left), so they must be in either column 1 or 2.


However, from clue 6, we know that the person who's hobby is writing is between the person who's hobby is traveling and the person eating nectarine. This means that the writer cannot be in column 1 (since there would have to be someone to their left), so they must be in column 2.

From clue 4, we know that the owner of the snake is the fan of folk. This means that the fan of folk must be in column 2 or 3.


However, from clue 9, we know that the person driving the snowmobile is on the left of the fan of folk. This means that the fan of folk cannot be in column 1 (since the snowmobile driver would have to be in column 0, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


However, we already know that the fan of folk is on the left of the person eating pumpkin (clue 8), and the person eating pumpkin is in column 3. This means that the fan of folk must be in column 2.

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the car is on the left of the person driving the van. This means that the person driving the van cannot be in column 1 (since the car driver would have to be in column 0, which doesn't exist), so they must be in either column 2 or 3.


However, we already know that the fan of folk is in column 2. This means that the person driving the van must be in column 3.

| Pet           | Guinea-pig     | Goat         | Dog           |

Here's how the clues were used to derive this solution:

* From clue 3, Animation is on the far left.
* Clue 1 indicates that Indie is to the left of Country. Since Animation is already on the leftmost column, Indie must be in the middle column.
* Clue 2 tells us that Banana's owner has a Guinea-pig, and since Banana can't be in the first column (because Kiwi is there), Banana must be in the third column.
* From clue 5, the Country fan owns the dog. Since Country is on the right of Indie (clue 1) and Banana is already in the third column, Country must also be in the third column. Thus, the owner of the Dog has Country music as their preference.
* Clue 4 places Japanese on the far right.
* From clue 6, the bartender is between Pumpkin and Goat's owner. Considering the arrangement so far, this means that Pumpkin must be in the second column.
* The Egyptian must be to the right of Kiwi (clue 7), placing Egyptian in the second or third column. However, since Japanese is already on the far right, Egyptian can only fit into the second column.
* Clue 8 requires Social-worker to be to the right of Martial-arts fan. Given the current arrangement, this places Martial-arts in the first or second column. Since Animation is already occupying the first column and Egyptian has taken up a space, Martial-arts must occupy the remaining spot in the middle column.
* The Security-guard can now only fit into the remaining position.

Lv2-6x3-6	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |
| Food          | Kale      |   Apple      |  Cauliflower  |
| Hobby         | Skydiving | Reading      | Puzzles       |

| Music-Genre   | Funk      | Classical    | Metal         |
| Sport         | Badminton | Weightlifting | Handball      |
| Transport     | Tram      | Trike        | Boat          |

Here's how I solved the puzzle:


From clue 1, we know that cauliflower is on the right of kale. This means that kale must be in position 1 or 2, and cauliflower must be in position 2 or 3.


From clue 6, we know that martial-arts movies are between badminton and apple. Since badminton is a sport and not a food, it's likely that badminton is on the left of the person eating apple. This means that the person eating kale (in position 1 or 2) must be eating kale to avoid having badminton next to cauliflower.


So we have:


|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | Kale      |   Apple      |
| ...           | ...       |              |

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person driving the trike. Since badminton is already associated with apple in clue 6, this means that the person eating apple must drive a trike.


We also know from clue 2 that reading is on the right of funk music. This means that classical music (the only other option) cannot be in position 1 or 2, since it would separate funk and reading.


So we have:


|               |     1     |      2       |
| Food          | Kale      |   Apple      |
| Music-Genre   | Funk      | Classical    |

Now from clue 3, we know that metal is on the right of handball. Since metal cannot be in position 1 (it would separate funk and reading), this means that handball must be in position 2.


But wait! From clue 6, we already have martial-arts movies between badminton and apple, which means that handball cannot be in position 2!


This means that handball must be in position 3. We also know from clue 5 that handball is on the right of the person driving the tram, so tram must be in position 1 or 2.


So we have:


|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |
| Food          | Kale      |   Apple      |               |
| Music-Genre   | Funk      | Classical    | Metal         |
| Sport         |           | Weightlifting| Handball      |

Now from clue 4, we know that skydiving is between superhero movies and metal. Since metal is already in position 3, this means that superhero movies must be in position 1 or 2.


We also know from clue 6 that martial-arts movies are between badminton and apple. This means that epic movies (the only other option) cannot be in position 1 or 2, since it would separate superhero and metal.


So we have:


|               |     1     |      2       |       3       |
| Food          | Kale      |   Apple      | Cauliflower  |
| Music-Genre   | Funk      | Classical    | Metal         |
| Movie-Genre   | Superhero | Martial-Arts | Epic          |

Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks. We know from clue 7 that badminton is on the left of trike, so weightlifting must be with tram.


And we're done!

| Beverage    | milk      | coffee     | water       |
| Food        | asparagus | cranberry  | pomegranate |
| Hobby       | drawing   | baking     | writing     |

| Sport       | handball  | volleyball | badminton   |
| Transport   | bus       | taxi       | bike        |
#############


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 4, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the far right, so pet in column 3 is ""goldfish"".
2. From clue 8, we know the person eating asparagus is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since there are only three columns, this means that food in column 1 is ""asparagus"" and sport in column 2 or 3 must be ""volleyball"". We can also conclude that sport in column 2 is not ""badminton"", since clue 1 says the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton.
3. From clue 2, we know the person driving the bike is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since food in column 1 is ""asparagus"" and sport in column 2 or 3 must be ""volleyball"", this means that transport in column 1 is not ""bike"". We can conclude that transport in column 3 is ""bike"".
4. From clue 6, we know the person driving the taxi is between the person eating pomegranate and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since food in column 1 is ""asparagus"", this means that food in column 2 or 3 must be ""pomegranate"". We can also conclude that transport in column 2 is ""taxi"".
5. From clue 7, we know the person drinking water is on the right of the person eating cranberry. Since food in column 1 is ""asparagus"", this means that food in column 2 must be ""cranberry"" and beverage in column 3 is ""water"".
6. From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is baking is between the person who's hobby is drawing and the person who's hobby is writing. Since hobby in column 1 or 2 must be ""drawing"", this means that hobby in column 2 is ""baking"" and hobby in column 3 is ""writing"".
7. From clue 1, we know the person drinking coffee is on the right of the person who's sport is badminton. Since beverage in column 3 is ""water"", this means that beverage in column 2 is ""coffee"". We can conclude that sport in column 1 is ""badminton"".
8. From clue 3, we know the owner of the fish is on the left of the person who's sport is handball. Since pet in column 3 is ""goldfish"", this means that pet in column 1 or 2 must be ""fish"". We can conclude that pet in column 1 is ""fish"" and sport in column 2 is not ""handball"".
9. Finally, we can fill in the remaining blanks using process of elimination.

This solution satisfies all the given clues."

####################


|               |       1       |     2      |      3      |
| Beverage      | lemonade    | hot-chocolate | iced-tea    |
| Food          | spinach     | corn        | apricot     |
| Hobby         | camping     | video-games | skydiving   |
| Job           | journalist  | writer      | pilot       |
| Movie-Genre   | mystery     | spy         | epic        |
| Sport         | tennis      | basketball  | skiing      |


####################


Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


* From clue 6, the person drinking iced-tea is on the far right (column 3).
* From clue 2, the writer is the person drinking hot-chocolate. Since the writer can't be in column 3, they must be in either column 1 or 2.
* From clue 4, the person who's sport is basketball is between the person drinking hot-chocolate and the person eating apricot. This means the writer (hot-chocolate) must be in column 2, with basketball in column 2 as well.
* From clue 3, the person watching epic movies is on the far right (column 3).
* From clue 5, the person eating spinach is on the left of the person eating corn. Since apricot can't be in column 1 (due to the writer and basketball), the order must be: spinach, corn, apricot.
* From clue 7, the person watching mystery movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means mystery movies are in column 1, with skydiving in column 3 or 2. However, since video-games (clue 1) must be to the right of the journalist, and skiing (clue 8) is also on the right of the journalist, skydiving must be in column 3.
* From clue 8, the person who's sport is skiing is on the right of the journalist. This means the journalist is in column 1 or 2, with skiing in column 2 or 3. However, since basketball (clue 4) is between hot-chocolate and apricot, and video-games (clue 1) is to the right of the journalist, the journalist must be in column 1.
* The remaining hobbies can now be filled in: camping in column 1 (next to mystery movies), video-games in column 2 (to the right of the journalist), and skydiving in column 3.

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, as logic puzzles can sometimes have multiple valid answers. However, this solution satisfies all the given clues."
Lv2-6x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to solve the puzzle. Here is the completed table:


|               |         1          |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | Hot-Chocolate    | Fanta      | Lemonade     |
| Food          | Radish           | Potato     | Carrot        |
| Hobby         | Singing          | Skydiving  | Drawing       |
| Job           | Firefighter      | Software-Developer| Teacher     |
| Music-Genre   | House            | Folk       | Country       |
| Pet           | Dog              | Fish       | Chinchilla    |

Let me walk you through my thought process:

From clue 2, we know the person eating radish is between the person drinking lemonade and the firefighter. This means Radish must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 4, we know the person drinking Fanta is between the software-developer and the person who's hobby is skydiving. This means Fanta must be in column 2.

Now, let's combine these two clues: since Radish is in column 1 or 2, and Fanta is in column 2, we can conclude that Radish is in column 1 and Lemonade is in column 3 (clue 2).

From clue 6, we know the fan of house is on the right of the person who's hobby is singing. This means House must be in column 2 or 3.

Now, let's combine this with clue 3: since the fan of country is on the right of the fan of house, and House is in column 2 or 3, we can conclude that Folk is in column 2 (as a buffer between House and Country).

From clue 1, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the person eating carrot. Since Carrot is not in column 1 (Radish), it must be in column 3.

Now, let's combine this with clue 5: since the person who's hobby is drawing is between the owner of the dog and the person eating potato, we can conclude that Potato is in column 2 (as a buffer between Dog and Drawing).

The rest of the puzzle falls into place from here.
