Lv2-4x4-3	"Here is the step-by-step solution to the logic puzzle:


From clue 1, we know that the paramedic drives a motorbike.


From clue 2, we can deduce that the pilot is on the right of the paramedic (motorbike), and from clue 4, we know that the helicopter is also on the right of the motorbike. Therefore, the order for transport is: roller, motorbike, pilot (helicopter).


We don't know where the subway is yet.


From clue 3, we can confirm that the roller is indeed on the left of the motorbike.


Now, let's analyze the food and hobby clues:


From clue 5, we know that lemon is on the left of photography.


From clue 7, we know that mango is on the right of photography.


Therefore, the order for food is: ?, lemon, photography, mango


We don't know where artichoke is yet.


From clue 8, we know that artichoke is between camping and traveling.


Since artichoke can't be on the left (because there's no space), it must be in column 2 or 3. If it were in column 3, then photography would have to be in column 4, which contradicts clue 7. Therefore, artichoke is in column 2.


Now we know that camping and traveling are on either side of artichoke.


From clue 9, we know that photography is between lemon and the lawyer (traveling).


Since photography can't be on the left (because there's no space), it must be in column 3.


We now have a complete order for food: ?, lemon, photography, mango


Since artichoke is in column 2, blueberry must be in column 1.


Now we know that camping and traveling are on either side of artichoke (column 2). From clue 6, we know that the lawyer is traveling. Therefore, camping is on the left of artichoke, and traveling (lawyer) is on the right.


We now have a complete order for hobbies: camping, ?, photography, traveling


Since fishing and paramedic are not yet assigned, they must be in column 1 and 4 respectively.


Now we know that the analyst can't be in column 1 (because it would conflict with clue 6), so the analyst must be in column 3.


We now have a complete order for jobs: paramedic (motorbike), ?, analyst, lawyer


Since subway is not yet assigned, it must be in column 4 (the only remaining space).


Here is the final solution:

Lv2-4x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |    2    |      3       |       4        |

| Sport         |            |         |              |                |

##1  | Fisherman     | Scientific  | Frog    | Volleyball
##2  | Mechanic      | Action      | Hamster | Rugby
##3  | Police-officer| Disaster    | Pony    | Soccer
##4  | Teacher       | Martial-arts| Bird    | Ice-hockey


Let me walk you through my reasoning:

From clue 1, we know the person watching disaster movies is on the far right. Clue 7 tells us that this person is the police-officer.

Clue 2 states that the fisherman watches scientific movies, and clue 5 says that the owner of the frog also watches scientific movies. Therefore, the fisherman owns a frog.

Clue 4 puts ice-hockey on the far left. Clue 6 tells us that the pony is to the right of the person who likes ice-hockey, which means the pony must be owned by either person ##2 or ##3.

Now we can look at clue 9, which states that the fisherman is to the left of the rugby player. Since the fisherman watches scientific movies and owns a frog (from clues 2 and 5), this puts the fisherman in position ##1.

Clue 8 says that the person watching action movies is to the right of the person watching scientific movies, which means the action movie fan must be either person ##2 or ##3. 

However, from clue 10, we know that the mechanic is between the owner of the bird and the teacher, so the mechanic cannot be in position ##4 (since ice-hockey is already there). The mechanic also can't be in position ##1, as it's occupied by the fisherman. Therefore, the mechanic must be in position ##2.

Given this information, we know that person ##3 watches disaster movies and owns a pony (clue 7 and clue 6), which makes them the police-officer.

This leaves us with only one possibility for person ##4: they watch martial-arts movies and own a bird. Clue 10 tells us that the mechanic is between the owner of the bird and the teacher, so person ##4 must be the teacher.


With these conclusions in mind, we've solved the puzzle!"
Lv2-4x4-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |       1        |       2       |       3       |     4      |

| Sport         | Basketball    | Sailing       | Weightlifting | Ice-Hockey |
 
 Now let's fill in the rest of the table:
 
The person eating lemon is on the right of the person eating garlic. 
Therefore, the security-guard (garlic) must be to the left of lemon.

the security-guard is on the left of the person who's sport is sailing.
So, the order for columns 1 and 2 is: security-guard (sailing is not an option for column 1), then the person whose sport is sailing.

The lawyer is the person watching epic movies. 
Also, the social-worker is on the left of the person eating asparagus
Therefore, we can conclude that the freelancer must be in column 4 because there are no other job options available.
Also, since the social-worker cannot be in column 1 (basketball), they must be in either columns 2 or 3. 
Since the security-guard (garlic) is on the left of the person eating lemon and asparagus has to be after the social worker: asparagus can only go into column 4.

Now, we have a problem since epic movies cannot go with ice-hockey.
Therefore, epic movies must be in either columns 2 or 3.

Also, romance movies are sailing's favorite. ( Clue #10 ) 
So sailing is column 2 and the order is: basketball - sailing - weightlifting - ice-hockey

Since epic-movies must be on the right of scientific movies, scientific movies cannot be on the far left.
Therefore, adventure movies have to go into column 1.

Since peach has to be after scientific movies ( Clue #5 ) 
And lemon must be between weightlifting and adventure movies: the order for food is garlic - lemon - peach - asparagus

So we can conclude that freelancer = ice-hockey and lawyer = sailing doesn't work.
Also, social-worker = weightlifting also doesn't work.
Therefore, social-worker must be in column 2. (sailing)
So lawyer has to go into column 3.

The person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person eating peach
The order for movie-genre is: adventure - romance - scientific - epic

So we have this:

Lv2-4x4-6	"After analyzing the given clues, I'll solve the puzzle and present the final solution in the following table:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |
| Job           | freelancer| librarian | paramedic | analyst   |
| Music-Genre   | funk       | folk       | punk      | jazz      |
| Nationality   | turkish    | chinese    | polish    | dutch     |
| Sport         | climbing   | sailing    | cricket   | cycling   |

Here's how I solved it:


From clue 9, the fan of funk is on the far left, so music-genre in column 1 is ""funk"".


From clue 2, the freelancer is between the fan of folk and the turkish. Since the freelancer can't be on the far left (already occupied by funk), it must be in column 2 or 3. However, if it were in column 3, there would be no space for the polish to be between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch (clue 3). So, the freelancer must be in column 2.


From clue 1, the fan of folk is between the person who's sport is sailing and the fan of jazz. Since the fan of jazz is on the far right (clue 8), the fan of folk must be in either column 2 or 3.


Considering clues 2 and 1 together, the freelancer must be to the left of the fan of folk, which means the freelancer is in column 2, and the fan of folk is in column 3. The sport for the person in column 2 must be sailing (to satisfy clue 1).


From clue 4, the librarian is on the left of the dutch. Since the dutch is not yet placed, let's come back to this later.


From clue 6, the dutch is on the right of the person who's sport is cycling.


Now we know that the person in column 2 has sailing as their sport (from clue 1). From clue 6, the dutch must be in either column 3 or 4. However, if the dutch were in column 3, there would be no space for the polish to be between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch (clue 3). So, the dutch must be in column 4.


From clue 6, the person whose sport is cycling must be in either column 2 or 3. Since column 2 already has sailing as its sport, the person whose sport is cycling must be in column 3. This also satisfies clue 1.


Now we can fill in the remaining columns:


Column 1: freelancer (from clue 2), funk music (from clue 9), turkish nationality (since it's between the fan of folk and the turkish, and the fan of folk is in column 3)


Column 4: analyst (since the dutch is on the left of the analyst, clue 7), jazz music (from clue 8), dutch nationality


The only remaining job is paramedic, which must be in column 3.


For sports, we have climbing and cricket left. From clue 1, sailing is already assigned to column 2. The person whose sport is cycling is in column 3. This leaves climbing for column 1 and cricket for column 3 doesn't work (polish would not be between the person who's sport is cricket and the dutch), so cricket must be in either column 1 or 4. However, if it were in column 4, there would be no space for cycling to be on the left of the dutch. So, cricket must be in column 3 doesn't work (as said before), and sailing is already assigned to column 2. Thus, climbing must be in column 1.


Here's the final solution table:

From clue 3, we know the fan of dubstep is between the Dutch and the person driving the subway.
From clue 2, we know the person watching fantasy movies is the Dutch.

So, the order for these three people is: ???, Dutch (fantasy), ??? (dubstep), ??? (subway)

From clue 6, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person driving the bike.
So, the order becomes: ???, Dutch (fantasy), ??? (dubstep), Bike, Subway

From clue 10, we know the Dutch is the person driving the train. But this contradicts with our current order. So, let's re-evaluate the clues.


From clue 1, we know the person driving the train is on the right of the fan of blues.
From clue 4, we know the fan of metal is the person driving the train.

So, the order for these two people is: ??? (blues), Train (metal)

Combining this with clue 10, we get: ??? (blues), Dutch (train, metal), ???

Now, let's go back to the previous order and combine them:
??? (blues), Dutch (train, fantasy), ??? (dubstep), Bike, Subway

From clue 9, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the right of the person watching time-travel movies.
So, the order becomes: Time-Travel, Dutch (fantasy), Dubstep, Bike, Subway

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


From clue 7, we know the Argentine is the person driving the airplane. This must be on the far left:
Argentine (airplane), Time-Travel, Dutch (train, fantasy), ??? (dubstep), Bike, Subway

From clue 5, we know the Russian is on the left of the person watching zombie movies.
So, the order becomes: Argentine (airplane), Russian (time-travel), Dutch (train, fantasy), ??? (dubstep), Bike, Subway, Zombie

The only remaining position for Blues is next to the train:
Argentine (airplane), Russian (time-travel), Blues, Dutch (train, metal, fantasy), Dubstep, Bike, Subway, Soul (zombie)

Now we can fill in the music genres and movie genres:


From clue 8, we know the fan of soul is on the far right. We already placed this person as watching zombie movies.


The final solution table is:

| Transport     | jet-ski   | quad-bike| car         | subway |
#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 6, we know that lemonade is paired with zombie movies.
* Clue 1 tells us that drama movies are between quad-bike and car. Since drama is on the right side of quad-bike (from clue 2), it must be in position 3.
* Clue 8 states that iced-tea is to the left of juice, so they must occupy positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, respectively. But since lemonade is already paired with zombie movies in position 2, iced-tea and juice must be in positions 1 and 3, which conflicts with drama's position. Therefore, iced-tea and juice are in positions 1 and 2.
* Clue 4 places the car to the left of juice, so it must be in position 3 or 4. But since quad-bike is already on the left side of water (from clue 2), car must be in position 3, which conflicts with drama's position. Therefore, car is in position 4.
* Clue 1 places quad-bike to the right of drama, so it must be in position 2 or 3. But since car is already in position 4, and water is on the right side of quad-bike (from clue 2), quad-bike must be in position 3 doesn't work, as we've established that drama is in position 3. Therefore, quad-bike is in position 2.
* Clue 5 places jet-ski between quad-bike and documentary movies. Since quad-bike is in position 2, jet-ski must be in position 1 or 4. But since iced-tea is already in position 1, jet-ski must be in position 4 doesn't work, as we've established that car is in position 4. Therefore, jet-ski is in position 1.
* Clue 3 places cat to the left of horse, so they must occupy positions 1 and 2 or 2 and 3, respectively. But since snake can't be paired with lemonade (zombie movies), snake must be in position 2. Therefore, cat is in position 1, and horse is in position 4.
* Clue 7 places water to the left of frog, so they must occupy positions 3 and 4 or 2 and 3, respectively. But since quad-bike is already on the left side of water (from clue 2), water can't be in position 2. Therefore, water is in position 4 doesn't work, as we've established that car is in position 4, so water must be in position 4 isn't an option for frog either. Since cat and horse are already paired with positions 1 and 4, frog must be in position 3.
* Finally, by process of elimination, satire movies and subway transport go to the remaining empty cells.

From clue 7, we know the designer is on the left of the fisherman.

Since the indie fan is already on the far left, the designer must be in column 2.

From clue 5, we know the fan of metal is the person who's eating grapefruit.

Since the fisherman is already assigned to lettuce, and the designer can't be on the far left (clue 7), the person eating grapefruit must be in column 1 or 4.


If the person eating grapefruit were in column 4, then from clue 5, the metal fan would also be in column 4. However, this contradicts clue 8, which states that the house fan is on the far right.

Therefore, the person eating grapefruit must be in column 1.

|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |     4     |

From clue 2, we know the person eating tomato is the person who's sport is parkour.

Since the person eating grapefruit (column 1) and lettuce (column 3) are already assigned, the person eating tomato must be in column 2 or 4.


However, from clue 10, we know the person eating tomato is on the left of the person eating spinach. Therefore, the person eating tomato cannot be in column 4.


So, the person eating tomato must be in column 2.

|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |     4     |

From clue 9, we know the accountant is between the social-worker and the person who's sport is cycling.


We can now deduce that the person in column 1 is a social-worker (since the fisherman and designer are already assigned to columns 3 and 2, respectively).


|               |       1       |     2      |     3      |     4     |

And finally, we can fill in the remaining music-genre (folk) and sport (cycling).
