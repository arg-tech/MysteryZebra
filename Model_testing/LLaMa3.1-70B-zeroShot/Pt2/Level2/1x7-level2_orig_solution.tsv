Explanation of the solution:

From clue 3, we know that techno is on the left of classical. From clue 1, we know that house is on the right of blues.

Since disco is between ambient and classical (clue 4), we can deduce that classical must be to the right of ambient.

Combining clues 2 and 5, we get: ambient - d&b - blues. Also, from clue 4, we know that disco is between ambient and classical. So, the order for these four genres is: techno - classical - disco - ambient - d&b - blues

Finally, since house is on the right of blues (clue 1), it must be in position 7.

The final solution table shows the correct order of music-genres."
Lv2-1x7-2	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know fishing is to the left of skydiving.


From clue 2, we know baking is to the right of skydiving.


From clue 3, we know chess is to the right of baking.


From clue 4, we know chess is between collecting and baking. This means collecting must be on the left of chess.


From clue 5, we know collecting is to the left of camping.


From clue 6, we know chess is in the middle. Since there are 7 hobbies, the middle position would be 4th or 3rd and 4th (since it can't occupy two positions). Given the previous clues, chess must occupy the 4th position.


Now, let's arrange the hobbies:


Collecting must come before camping (clue 5) and collecting is also to the left of chess (clue 4), so we have:

Collecting - ? - Chess


From clue 1, fishing comes before skydiving. Baking comes after skydiving (clue 2). Since chess comes after baking (clue 3), we can fill in some gaps:


Fishing - Skydiving - Baking - Chess


We still have to fit in collecting and camping. Collecting must come before chess (clue 4) but also before camping (clue 5), so it's likely that collecting comes first.


Filmmaking is the only hobby left, and we haven't received any information about its position relative to the others, so it will be placed last for now:


Collecting - ? - Fishing - Skydiving - Baking - Chess - Camping doesn't fit since chess needs to come after baking. However: 


Collecting - ? - Fishing - Skydiving - Baking - Chess - Camping still doesn't work because collecting and camping need some separation.


Collecting - ? - Fishing - Skydiving - Baking - Chess isn't correct, but:


Collecting - Fishing - ? - Skydiving - Baking - Chess


Chess must come after baking. Collecting comes before camping (clue 5). Thus, we place camping on the right of chess and have:


Fishing can be in position 2 or 3 since it is to the left of skydiving but has no other restrictions.


Collecting - Fishing - ? - Skydiving - Baking - Chess - Camping


Filmmaking can only go between fishing and skydiving because camping needs to stay on the right:


Collecting - Fishing - Filmmaking - Skydiving - Baking - Chess - Camping


Now we just have to figure out which hobbies fit in spots 3, but since there is no other hobby available for spot 3, our table must be correct. 


Here's the final solution:

Lv2-1x7-3	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step:


From clue 3, we know that fishing is to the right of baking.
From clue 5, we know that card-games is to the left of baking.

So far, we have: card-games - baking - fishing


From clue 1, we know that hiking is to the right of fishing.

So, we update our table: card-games - baking - fishing - hiking


From clue 2 and 4, we know that traveling is to the right of woodworking.


We also know from clue 6 that sudoku is between traveling and card-games. However, since card-games is already on the leftmost side, sudoku must be at the beginning, followed by card-games.


So, our updated table is: sudoku - card-games - baking - fishing - hiking


Now we can add woodworking and traveling to the right of sudoku (but not next to each other). We get:


sudoku - woodworking - card-games - baking - fishing - hiking - traveling


However, this contradicts clue 6. Therefore, the correct order is:


sudoku - card-games - woodworking - baking - fishing - hiking - traveling


Let's put the hobbies in a table format and surround it with '#############':

Lv2-1x7-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|         |   1    |   2   |    3    |      4      |    5    |    6    |    7    |

|         | Sudoku | Chess | Fishing | Woodworking | Reading | Camping | Dancing |
#############

Here's how I deduced the solution:

* From clue 2 and 4, we know that Sudoku is to the left of Chess.
* From clue 6, we know that Woodworking is in the middle, which means it must be at position 4.
* From clue 1, we know that Fishing and Reading are on either side of Woodworking. Since Woodworking is at position 4, Fishing must be at position 3, and Reading must be at position 5.
* From clue 3 and 5, we know that Camping is to the right of Reading, so Camping must be at position 6.
* From clue 8, we know that Camping is to the left of Dancing, so Dancing must be at position 7.
* The only remaining position is position 1, which must be Sudoku.

Note that there was a redundant clue (clue 5 and 3 are the same), and also clue 7 doesn't provide any useful information."
Lv2-1x7-5	"Based on the given clues, I've solved the puzzle and here's the final solution:


|               |   1    |   2    |    3    |      4       |   5   |     6     |   7    |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie | family | musical | martial-arts | drama | animation | action |

 

Here's how I deduced the solution:


From clue 1: Musical is between Family and Martial-Arts.
From clue 2: Action is on the far right, so it must be in position 7.
From clue 3: This clue is a bit ambiguous, but based on the context, I assume it means that Family is not at the edges. Let's keep this in mind for now.
From clue 4: Animation is to the left of Action, which is already determined to be in position 7. So, Animation must be in position 6.
From clue 5: Zombie is on the far left, so it must be in position 1.
From clue 6: Drama is between Martial-Arts and Animation.

Now, let's put everything together!


Since Action is already determined to be in position 7, we can use the other clues to fill in the gaps:


Clue 5 tells us that Zombie is on the far left, so it goes in position 1.
We have Family, Musical, Martial-Arts, Drama, Animation, and Action remaining.


From clue 6: Drama must be between Martial-Arts and Animation. Since Animation is already determined to be in position 6, we can place Drama in position 5.
Clue 4 tells us that Animation is to the left of Action, which is correct with our current placement.


Now, let's use the first clue: Musical is between Family and Martial-Arts.


Given our existing placements, the only way this works is if we have:


...Family -> Musical -> Martial-Arts...


We can place these in positions 2-4. Since Family is not at the edges (from clue 3), it must be in position 2 or 3. Let's put it in position 2 for now.


This leaves us with:


zombie | family | musical | martial-arts | drama | animation | action


So, the final solution table looks like this:

Lv2-1x7-6	"Based on the given clues, let's fill in the table:


Since the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far right (clue 3), we can start by placing ""dancing"" in column 7.

From clue 5, the person who's hobby is magic-tricks is on the left of the person who's hobby is dancing. Let's place ""magic-tricks"" in column 6.

Now, from clue 4, the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person who's hobby is fishing. Since ""magic-tricks"" is already placed in column 6, we can place ""rock-climbing"" in column 5 and ""fishing"" in column 4.


|         |   1    |   2   |    3    |    4    |       5       |      6       |    7    |

From clue 2, the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Since we don't know where ""chess"" is yet, let's move to clue 1.


From clue 1, the person who's hobby is chess is on the right of the person who's hobby is baking. Let's place ""baking"" in column 1 and ""chess"" in column 2.


|         |   1    |   2   |    3    |    4    |       5       |      6       |    7    |
| Hobby   | baking | chess |         | fishing | rock-climbing | magic-tricks | dancing |

 
Now, from clue 2 again, the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person who's hobby is chess. Let's place ""singing"" in column 3.

Lv2-1x7-8	"Let's break down the clues and solve the puzzle step by step.

From clue 1, we know that sailing is in the middle, which means it's in position 4 (since there are 7 positions).

From clue 6, we know that skiing is on the left of cycling. We also know from clue 5 that cycling is between skiing and golf. This means skiing must be in position 1 or 2. But if it's in position 2, then cycling would have to be in position 3, which is already occupied by baseball. Therefore, skiing is in position 1.

Now we can place cycling. From clue 5, we know it's between skiing and golf. Since skiing is in position 1, cycling must be in position 2.

Now we can place biathlon. It must be on the right of basketball, which means it's in position 6 or 7. But from clue 2, we know that golf is on the right of cycling, and cycling is in position 2. This means golf must be in position 7, which in turn means biathlon is in position 6.

Now, let's look at clues 1 and 2. We know that Woodworking is on the left of Baking, and Baking is between Woodworking and Magic-tricks.

Since there are no more spaces to the left of Singing, and we already have a sequence going from left to right (Singing > Chess > Gardening > Photography), we can conclude that Woodworking must be in position 2:

| Hobby   | Singing | Woodworking | ... |

Then, Baking must be in position 3 or 4. But since Magic-tricks is also involved, and we don't know its exact position yet, let's just place Baking for now:
