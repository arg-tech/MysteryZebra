| Transport     | taxi              | tram    | helicopter | car       |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 8, we know the software-developer is on the left of the person watching superhero movies. This gives us a starting point for column 1.

Clue 9 tells us that the person watching drama movies is on the left of the person driving the tram. Since the cat owner drives the tram (clue 3), and the dancer can't be in column 3 (because of clue 2), we place the person watching drama movies in column 2.

Clue 1 gives us a relative position between columns 1 and 3, so we place the car driver in column 4. Clues 5 and 7 help us determine the remaining columns for the jobs and transport.

From clue 6, we know the goldfish owner is on the right of the person driving the taxi. Since the dog owner must be on the left of the goat owner (clue 4), we place them in columns 1 and 2, respectively.

The music genres are relatively easy to figure out with clues 2 and 5, which give us a starting point for column 3.

Putting it all together, we arrive at the solution above."

However, I noticed that some information is missing or inconsistent. For example:


- There is no clear connection between the person eating lemon and their job.
- The fan of gospel should be on the right of the person eating blueberry (clue #2), but this would mean the gospel fan is in position 3, which conflicts with other clues.


Assuming there might have been some errors or omissions in the puzzle statement, I've made an educated guess to fill in the table. If you'd like me to revisit any specific parts of the solution or clarify my reasoning, please let me know!

From clue 11, we know the Colombian's sport is golf.


From clue 7, we know the British is on the left of the person eating strawberry. Since the British can't be on the far left (clue 10), the British must be in column 2 or 3. But from clue 1, we know the British is on the right of the fan of ambient, so the British must be in column 3.

| Sport         | golf      |            |            |            |

From clue 5, we know the owner of the dog is on the right of the person eating strawberry. Since the British is already in column 3, the owner of the dog must be in column 4.

From clue 2, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the right of the fan of R&B. Since the owner of the dog is already in column 4, the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 3 or 4. But from clue 3, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Japanese, so the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 2 or 3. Combining these two conditions, we can conclude that the owner of the chinchilla is in column 2.

From clue 4, we know the owner of the chinchilla's sport is rugby.


From clue 6, we know the person eating asparagus is between the fan of electronic and the person who's sport is golf. Since the person who's sport is golf is in column 1, the person eating asparagus must be in column 2 or 3. But from clue 6, we also know that the fan of electronic is on one side of the person eating asparagus, so the fan of electronic can't be in column 1 (because the person who's sport is golf is already there). Combining these two conditions, we can conclude that the person eating asparagus and the fan of electronic are in columns 2 and 3.

| Sport         | golf      | rugby     |            |            |

From clue 3, we know the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the Japanese.


From clue 8, we know the person eating grapefruit's sport is skiing. Since there are only two columns left (1 and 4), one of which already has a sport assigned (golf in column 1), the person eating grapefruit must be in column 4.

The only food left is banana, which must be in column 1.


The only music-genre left is techno, which must be in column 1.

| Transport     | bus     | roller     | quad-bike   | van          |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 6, we know the person who's sport is soccer is on the far left. This means the first row is already determined.
* Clue 10 tells us that the person eating spinach is also on the far left. This confirms our initial placement for column 1.
* Using clues 3 and 5, we can determine the order of columns 2-4: disco, cricket (with lemonade), and bus-house.
* From clue 9, almond-milk must be between quad-bike and jazz. Given that quad-bike is already in column 3, almond-milk must be in column 2 or 3.
* Clue 11 states that the person eating corn is on the far right (column 4). With this placement, we can confirm that the fan of jazz is in column 3 and parkour is in column 4 (due to clue 7).
* The remaining clues help fill in the gaps:
	+ Avocado goes with roller (clue 1), which must be in column 2.
	+ 7up goes with van (clue 8), so it's placed in column 4.
	+ Pop and tea are left for columns 1 and 3. Given that pop doesn't have a specific placement, we put it in column 1.

After applying these steps, the table should be correctly filled as shown above."
Lv2-5x4-5	"After analyzing the given conditions, I've constructed the following solution:

| Nationality   | mexican      | canadian    | german       | spanish     |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From condition 2, the person watching thriller movies is on the left of the German.
2. Condition 5 states that the person who's hobby is reading is on the far right. This helps to place some hobbies and nationalities.
3. Conditions 4 and 9 suggest that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the entrepreneur, which can be placed in column 3 or 2. Given condition 10, woodworking must be between traveling and the doctor, so traveling goes in column 2.
4. Condition 11 places the Canadian to the right of magic-tricks, which must go in column 1 due to condition 12 (asparagus is on the far left).
5. From conditions 7 and 8, we can deduce that corn is in column 2 or 3. Since cranberry is to the right of corn (condition 3), and Spanish is to the right of cranberry (condition 6), this sequence must be: asparagus, corn, cranberry, watermelon.
6. The remaining conditions help place jobs and movie genres:
   - Condition 7 places crime movies on the right of the pilot, which can only go in column 1 or 2.
   - Condition 8 places action movies to the left of corn (column 2), and condition 1 places thriller movies with woodworking (already determined).
   - The remaining movie genre, martial-arts, must be paired with traveling in column 2.

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

1. From clue 9, we know that traveling is on the far left.
2. Clue 10 states that woodworking is between avocado and video-games, so we can place those three in order: traveling -> woodworking -> video-games (not necessarily in that order).
3. Clue 11 tells us that avocado is to the left of lemon.
4. From clue 5, pomegranate must be to the right of woodworking.
5. The musician is between dressmaker and avocado (clue 8), so we can place those three in order: dressmaker -> musician -> avocado.
6. Clue 7 tells us that the american is a dancer, which means the french must be on the left of lacrosse (clue 2).
7. From clue 3, badminton must be to the right of dressmaker.
8. The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps and ensure consistency.

From clue 8, gospel is carrot.
From clue 1, country must be 2nd or 3rd since gospel cannot be 4th.
From clue 6 and 11, bus (dog) is at position 4.

| Transport     | airplane | train      | roller | bus      |

 
From clue 2, the person driving the roller owns a horse.
Now from clue 3 and above table, the owner of goat is in position 1.
From clue 4, d&b must be at position 3 since train cannot be on the left of d&b.

| Transport     | airplane | train      | roller | bus      |

From clue 10, the person eating potato is on the left of the person driving the roller.
Now from above table, this possible only if potato is at position 2.

| Transport     | airplane | train      | roller | bus      |

Now the only option left for soy-milk is at position 1.
From clue 7, water must be at position 3 since it's on the left of banana.

| Transport     | airplane | train      | roller | bus      |

From clue 5, bus is at position 4 so the person driving train must be at position 2.
Now from above table, this possible only if peas are not at position 3.
So the only option left for milk and water.

| Transport     | airplane | train      | roller | bus      |

Now from clue 9, the fan of d&b is on the left of the person drinking milk.
So only option left for water and milk.

Now the only option left for iced-tea.
The final answer is:

Lv2-5x4-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've filled in the table with the correct answers:


|               |    1     |    2     |    3    |       4       |
| Beverage      | 7up     | milk     | coffee   | hot-chocolate|
| Food          | broccoli | lemon    | peach    | eggplant     |
| Nationality   | british  | egyptian | french   | thai         |
| Pet           | goldfish | goat     | rabbit   | turtle       |
| Transport     | scooter  | taxi     | boat     | van          |

Here's the explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking 7up is the owner of the goldfish. So, we can place ""7up"" and ""goldfish"" in the same column.

Clue 2 tells us that the owner of the goldfish eats peach. Since the person eating peach must be on the right side (from clue 3), we can place ""peach"" in column 4. Then, from clue 6 again, we know that the person drinking 7up is also the one eating peach, so column 1 is fixed.

Clue 10 tells us that the owner of the rabbit is on the far right. From clue 3, we know that the goldfish's owner is to the left of the goat's owner, and since there are only two columns remaining for these two pets (columns 2 and 3), they must be in this order.

Clue 5 tells us that the person driving the scooter is between the French and the person drinking milk. Clue 8 says the broccoli eater is on the left of the person drinking milk, which implies that the broccoli eater cannot be column 4 (otherwise, there wouldn't be anyone to the right of them). Since we have already placed peach in column 4, we can conclude that broccoli goes in column 1. From clue 5 again, scooter's position is fixed.

Clue 9 says hot-chocolate is on the right side of milk. Clue 8 also implies that there must be a person eating between the two drinks (broccoli and milk). Therefore, coffee cannot be in column 4, which leaves only one possibility for its placement.

The remaining clue 7 places the Egyptian to the right of lemon, while clue 1 says Thai is on the right of French. Since we have already placed peach in column 4, this arrangement works well. We can also determine that British must go with broccoli.

Now, let's combine all these results:
