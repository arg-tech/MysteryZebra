Lv2-2x3-1	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The fan of folk drinks lemonade.
2. The person drinking soy-milk is between the fan of pop and the person drinking lemonade (which means the person drinking lemonade cannot be in position 1 or 3).
3. The person drinking juice is on the right of the fan of disco.

From clue 2, we know that lemonade cannot be in position 1 or 3. This means lemonade must be in position 2. Since the fan of folk drinks lemonade (clue 1), folk must also be in position 2.

Now, let's look at clue 3: the person drinking juice is on the right of the fan of disco. If disco were in position 2, then juice would have to be in a non-existent position 4. So, disco must be in either position 1 or 2, but since lemonade (and folk) are already in position 2, disco must be in position 1.

From clue 2 again, we know that soy-milk is between pop and lemonade. Since lemonade is in position 2, soy-milk must be in either position 1 or 3. But since disco is already in position 1, soy-milk must be in position 3.

Finally, the only remaining beverage is juice, which goes to position 1 (on the right of disco). However, we've established that disco is in position 1, so this doesn't make sense! We have a contradiction. But wait, what if we swap the positions of disco and lemonade/folk? Then juice would be on the right of disco.

So, our final solution table looks like this:

#############
|               |    1     |    2     |   3   |
| Beverage      | Juice    | Lemonade | Soy-milk|
| Music-Genre   | Disco    | Folk     | Pop     |

Lv2-2x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############
|         |     1      |       2       |       3       |
| Hobby   | Drawing    | Sudoku        | Rock-climbing|
| Job     | Coach      | Social-worker | Dressmaker   |
#############


Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 1, we know the person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is sudoku. This means the drawing person must be in column 1 or 2.

From clue 2, we know the social-worker is between the coach and the person who's hobby is drawing. Since the social-worker can't be in column 1 (because there's no one to their left), they must be in column 2. This means the coach must be in column 1 or 3.

Considering both clues, I placed the coach in column 1, followed by the social-worker in column 2. The person who's hobby is drawing must be on the left of sudoku, so I placed them in column 1 as well (which means their job is coach).

The only remaining hobby is rock-climbing, which goes to the person in column 3. Their job is dressmaker (the only one left).

So, this solution satisfies both clues and completes the table!"
Lv2-2x3-3	"Based on the given clues, I'll try to solve the puzzle.


From clue 1, we know that the owner of the dog is on the right of the person drinking cola.


From clue 2, we know that the person drinking cola is between the owner of the ferret and the person drinking tea. This means that the order is: Ferret - Cola - Tea (or the reverse, but let's start with this order)


Now, combining these two clues, we get:


|            |    1    |    2     |  3  |
| Beverage   | Tea     | Cola     | Mirinda|
| Pet        | Ferret  | ?       | Dog  |

The only pet left for the second column is the Goldfish.

Lv2-2x3-4	"Based on the given clues, we can solve the puzzle as follows:


From clue 1, we know that the fan of funk owns a bird.

From clue 2, we know that the fan of soul is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the bird. This means that the order must be: fish - soul - bird or bird - soul - fish.


From clue 3, we know that the owner of the goldfish is on the left of the owner of the bird. Since the goldfish is in column 2, this means that the bird cannot be in column 1 (because there would be no space for the goldfish to its left). Therefore, the bird must be in column 3.


Now we can combine all the clues:


Since the bird is in column 3 and the owner of the goldfish is on its left, the goldfish must be in column 2. This means that the fish cannot be in column 2 (because it's already occupied by the goldfish), so the fish must be in column 1.


Now we have:


|               |  1   |    2     |  3   |
| Music-Genre   |      |          |      |
| Pet           | fish | goldfish | bird |

The only music-genre left for column 1 is soul, because the fan of funk owns a bird and the fan of soul is between the owner of the fish and the owner of the bird.


So we get:


|               |  1   |    2     |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | soul |          |      |
| Pet           | fish | goldfish | bird |

The only music-genre left for column 2 is r&b, because it's the only one that hasn't been assigned yet.


So we get:


|               |  1   |    2     |  3   |
| Music-Genre   | soul | r&b      |      |
| Pet           | fish | goldfish | bird |

Finally, the only music-genre left for column 3 is funk.


So we get:

Lv2-2x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:


#############
|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Hobby   | Sudoku  | Reading    | Cooking |
| Pet     | Goat    | Chinchilla | Fish    |
#############


Here's how I deduced the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the person who has sudoku as a hobby is on the right of the owner of the goat. This means that the owner of the goat must be in column 1.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the goat and the owner of the fish. Since the owner of the goat is already in column 1, this means that the owner of the chinchilla must be in column 2.

Now we have:

|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Hobby   | ?       | ?          | ?       |
| Pet     | Goat    | Chinchilla | Fish    |

Clue 1 states that the person who has sudoku as a hobby is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. Since we already have column 1 occupied by the owner of the goat, this means that the person with sudoku as a hobby must be in column 1.

We also know from clue 2 that the person with sudoku as a hobby is on the right of the owner of the goat. This implies that the person with sudoku as a hobby cannot be in column 3 (since they would not be to the right of the owner of the goat).

Therefore, we can place the person with sudoku as a hobby in column 1:

|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |
| Hobby   | Sudoku  | ?          | Cooking |
| Pet     | Goat    | Chinchilla | Fish    |

The only remaining hobby is reading, which must go to the person who owns the chinchilla.

The final solution is:


#############
|         |    1    |     2      |    3    |

Lv2-2x3-6	"Let's break down the clues:


1. The person who's sport is basketball is between the Indian and the Dutch.
   This means the order is: ?, Basketball, ?
                  or: ?, ?, Basketball


2. The Dutch is the person who's sport is rowing.


3. The Egyptian is on the right of the Dutch.

From clue 2, we know the Dutch plays Rowing. From clue 3, we can place the Egyptian to the right of the Dutch. Since there are only three people, this means the order for nationality must be: Indian, Dutch, Egyptian (or the first two switched but since Basketball is between them, it has to be in this order).

Now let's fill in what we have so far:


|               |   1    |     2      |       3       |
| Nationality   | Indian | Dutch      | Egyptian     |
| Sport         |        | Rowing     |               |

Given the first clue, Basketball must be on the right of the Indian (since it has to be between the Dutch and the Indian), which means:


|               |   1    |     2      |       3       |
| Nationality   | Indian | Dutch      | Egyptian     |
| Sport         |        | Rowing     | Basketball   |

But we still have Weightlifting left. It must go under the first column (since it's the only one left), and thus:


|               |   1    |     2      |       3       |
| Nationality   | Indian | Dutch      | Egyptian     |

Lv2-2x3-7	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating pineapple is to the right of the person eating broccoli. This means the order for food is: broccoli, ?, pineapple.

From clue 2, we know that the Brazilian is between the person eating pineapple and the Chinese. Since the person eating pineapple is already placed on the right, the Brazilian must be in the middle.

So far, we have:

|               |    1    |     2     |     3     |
| Food          | broccoli|           | pineapple |
| Nationality   |         | brazilian |           |

Now, let's figure out the remaining food and nationality. The only option left for the middle column is carrot.

For the nationalities, we have Chinese on one end (since Brazilian is in the middle), so it must be Dutch on the right (eating pineapple).

Therefore, the solution is:

#############

1. The person watching satire movies is the Mexican.
2. The British is between the person watching satire movies and the person watching western movies.
3. The person watching satire movies is on the right of the person watching comedy movies.

From clue 3, we know the order of movie-genres is: Comedy, ?, Satire (where ? represents Western).

From clue 1, we know the Mexican watches Satire movies.

From clue 2, we know the British is between the Satire and Western movies. Since the British can't be on the right of the Satire movies (because that's where the person watching Comedy movies is), the British must be on the left of the Satire movies.

So, the order is: Comedy (on the left), ?, Satire (on the right)

The only position left for Western is in the middle. Therefore, the final solution table is:

Lv2-2x3-9	"Based on the given clues, let's start by filling in the information we know:

| Transport   |               |            |           |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the bus is to the left of the person who's sport is swimming. This means the bus driver must be in column 1 or 2.


Let's try placing the bus driver in column 1:

|             |       1       |     2      |     3     |
| Sport       |               |            |           |
| Transport   | Bus          |            |           |

Now, from clue 2, we know that the person driving the bus is between the person who's sport is weightlifting and the person driving the quad-bike. Since the bus driver is in column 1, this means the weightlifter must be in one of the other columns (either 2 or 3), and the quad-bike rider must be to the right of the weightlifter.


Let's try placing the weightlifter in column 2:


|             |       1       |     2      |     3     |
| Sport       |               | Weightlifting |           |
| Transport   | Bus          |            |           |

Now, from clue 1, we know that the bus driver is to the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Since the weightlifter is in column 2, this means the swimmer must be in column 3:


|             |       1       |     2      |     3     |
| Sport       |               | Weightlifting | Swimming    |
| Transport   | Bus          |            |           |

Finally, from clue 2, we know that the quad-bike rider is to the right of the weightlifter. Since the weightlifter is in column 2 and the swimmer is in column 3, this means the quad-bike rider must be in column 3 (but that's already occupied by the swimmer), so let's try placing the quad-bike rider in column 2 instead:


|             |       1       |     2      |     3     |
| Sport       |               | Weightlifting | Swimming    |
| Transport   | Bus          | Quad-bike  | Snowmobile|

The only sport left is ice-hockey, which must go in column 1:

Lv2-2x3-10	"Based on the given clues:


Clue 1: The person driving the car is to the right of the social-worker.
This means the social-worker cannot be in column 3, because there would be no one to their right.


Clue 2: The lawyer is between the person driving the quad-bike and the fisherman.
From this clue, we can deduce that the lawyer must be in either column 1 or 2. If the lawyer were in column 3, they couldn't be ""between"" two other people.


Now let's try to piece together a solution:


We know from Clue 1 that the social-worker is not in column 3. Let's place them in column 1 for now.


Column 1: Social-worker


From Clue 2, we can put the lawyer in column 2, between the quad-bike and the fisherman. But which person drives the quad-bike? Since the car driver is to the right of the social-worker (Clue 1), it must be either the lawyer or the fisherman driving the car. However, from Clue 2, we know that the lawyer is between two people. Therefore, the fisherman cannot drive the car; otherwise, they wouldn't fit between the quad-bike and the lawyer. This implies that the person driving the car is actually not the fisherman but rather the lawyer (driving a different vehicle would contradict Clue 2). Since we have already placed the social-worker in column 1, this means the fisherman must drive the motorbike, placing them in column 3.


Column 1: Social-worker
Column 2: Lawyer (car)
Column 3: Fisherman


Now let's look at the transport for each person:


From Clue 1 and our deductions, we have:


Column 1: Social-worker -> quad-bike (as the car driver is to their right)


This leaves us with the following solution:
