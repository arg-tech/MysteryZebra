#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the Japanese person eats strawberry.
* Clue 23 states that the Japanese person drinks lemonade, so we can fill in the beverage for column 2.
* Clue 10 says that the person driving the roller is on the left of the person drinking tea, which means that tea must be in either column 3 or 5. But clue 9 states that sprite is on the left of the Japanese, and since lemonade is already filled in for column 2, sprite must be in column 1.
* Clue 20 says that strawberry is on the right of the Turkish person, so we can place the Turkish person in column 3 or 4. But clue 6 states that the Turkish is on the right of the German, and since the German can't be in column 5 (due to the train being on the far right), we can conclude that the Turkish person is in column 4.
* Clue 13 says that the Turkish person's sport is sailing. We also know from clue 18 that the fan of r&b is the person who's sport is sailing, so we can fill in r&b for column 4's music genre.
* From clue 5, dancing is on the left of woodworking. Since the roller (cooking) is already filled in for column 2, and woodworking must be after dancing, we can place dancing in either column 1 or 3. But clue 21 states that the fan of blues is on the right of almond-milk, which means that blues must be in column 2.
* Clue 17 says that rock-climbing is on the left of the jet-ski, so we can fill in rock-climbing for column 1's hobby. And since clue 15 states that skiing is between rock-climbing and boat, we can conclude that skiing is in column 3.
* Clue 12 says that rowing is on the right of metal, which means that rowing must be in either column 2 or 4. But clue 8 states that skiing is in the middle, so rowing must be in column 1 or 5. Since the German can't be in column 5, we can conclude that rowing is in column 1.

The rest of the puzzle falls into place from these conclusions!"
