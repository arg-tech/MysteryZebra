| Nationality   | Egyptian   | Japanese   | Indonesian| Pakistani | British   |
#################


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the Egyptian is on the far left (column 1).
* From clue 13, we know the fan of funk is also on the far left (column 1), which means the person who's hobby is woodworking (clue 8) is in column 2.
* Using clues 3 and 5, we can place the onion-eater between columns 2 and 3, with the artichoke-eater to their right.
* Clues 7 and 11 help us determine the order of the papaya-eater, singer, and skydiver (columns 1-3).
* Clue 4 places the Pakistani between the fan of reggae and the tomato-eater, which must be in columns 3 or 4. This also implies that the fan of reggae is not on the far right.
* Using clues 2 and 9, we can place the cooking hobbyist to the right of the funk fan (column 2) and the rock fan in column 3.
* Clues 6 and 12 help us determine the order of the Indonesian and British nationalities (columns 4 and 5).
* Finally, we use clues 10 and 12 to place the British fan of reggae on the far right.

This solution satisfies all the given conditions. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!"

| Sport      | weightlifting| climbing    | parkour     | volleyball  | skateboarding|

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* Clues 1 and 10 indicate that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the dancer, and the person drinking juice is on the far right.
* Clue 2 indicates that the person eating orange is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person drinking milk is on the left of the person eating orange (Clue 6), we can deduce that the person drinking milk is also on the left of the person who's sport is climbing.
* Clues 4 and 11 indicate that the person eating apricot is on the left of the person eating lettuce, and the person drinking lemonade is between the person who's sport is parkour and the person eating apricot. This allows us to place the person eating apricot and the person drinking lemonade in positions 2 and 3.
* Clue 5 indicates that the person eating watermelon is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, which places them in position 5.
* Clues 7 and 12 indicate that the person drinking milk is on the left of the lawyer, and the social-worker is on the left of the dancer. This allows us to place the social-worker in position 1 and the lawyer in position 4.
* Clue 8 indicates that the writer is on the left of the person who's sport is skateboarding, which places them in position 2.
* Clue 9 indicates that the person drinking juice is on the far right, which confirms their placement in position 5.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining positions with the person drinking mirinda (Clue 3) and the person who's sport is weightlifting.

Lv2-4x5-6	"After solving the puzzle, I get:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   | zombie    | thriller   | family   | mystery | sports     |
| Nationality   | polish    | french     | turkish  | argentine| australian|
| Sport         | baseball##2| badminton  | volleyball| rowing   | skiing     |

However, there is an inconsistency in the final solution based on the given clues. Since the person drinking water is between the person watching zombie movies and the person who's sport is baseball, but also the person drinking water is at position 1 (far left), I assume that baseball##2 refers to a different row for sports.

Here is the corrected table:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5      |

| Movie-Genre   | zombie    | thriller   | family   | mystery | sports     |
| Nationality   | polish    | french     | turkish  | argentine| australian|
| Sport         |            |            | baseball##2| badminton  | volleyball,skiing |

However, this solution still doesn't satisfy all the conditions. For example, according to clue 7 and 11, rowing should be at position 4 and thriller at position 2 but we already assigned fanta to polish in column 2 which contradicts with some other clues.

Considering another assumption where 'baseball##2' is baseball and it has two persons who have this sport (or there are different rows for each person), I got the following table.


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5      |
| Beverage      | water     | fanta      | sprite   | iced-tea| soy-milk   |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie    | thriller   | family   | mystery | sports     |
| Nationality   | polish    | french     | turkish  | argentine| australian|
| Sport         | baseball##2| badminton  | volleyball| rowing   | skiing,badmitton


However, the first assumption about two 'badminton' doesn't satisfy other clues.

Considering another assumption where there are different rows for each person and ignoring that inconsistency in sport row I get the following table which satisfies most of the conditions:


|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5      |
| Beverage      | water     | fanta      | sprite   | iced-tea| soy-milk   |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie    | thriller   | family   | mystery | sports     |
| Nationality   | polish    | french     | turkish  | argentine| australian|
| Sport         | badminton | baseball##2| volleyball| rowing   | skiing


However, even with all assumptions the resulting table is inconsistent in some places. To get an accurate result you need to carefully check your clues or add more conditions.

Here's my closest guess using '#############' around the final solution table:


#############
|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |    4    |     5      |
| Beverage      | water     | fanta      | sprite   | iced-tea| soy-milk   |
| Movie-Genre   | zombie    | thriller   | family   | mystery | sports     |
| Nationality   | polish    | french     | turkish  | argentine| australian|
| Sport         | badminton | baseball##2| volleyball| rowing   | skiing

Lv2-4x5-8	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution to the puzzle. Here it is:


|               |      1      |     2     |      3      |    4    |    5    |

| Nationality   | thai        | italian   | polish      | french  | indian |


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 9, we know that the person who's hobby is sudoku is on the far left.

From clue 1, we know that the Polish person is in the middle. Since there are 5 people, this means they must be in position 3.

From clue 2, we know that the person whose hobby is woodworking is to the right of the Indian.

From clue 11, we know that the fan of r&b is between the person watching epic movies and the person who's hobby is sudoku. Since the person with sudoku is on the far left, this means the fan of r&b must be in position 2.

Now, using clues 4 and 7, we can determine that the Italian person (who watches documentary movies) is to the left of the person whose hobby is skydiving, which puts them in position 1 or 2. However, since the fan of r&b is already in position 2, this means the Italian must be in position 1.

The rest of the solution falls into place using a combination of the remaining clues.

| Transport   | Bus          | Car         |            |               | Roller |

From clue 6, we know that the person drinking water is on the left of the person driving the jet-ski:


|             |      1       |     2      |     3      |       4       |     5     |

Lv2-4x5-10	"I'll solve the puzzle and provide the final solution table.


After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the following solution:


#############
|               |     1      |     2      |    3     |     4     |    5    |
| Job           | Dancer    | Bartender | Chef     | Manager   | Nurse    |
| Nationality   | Dutch     | Argentine | Thai     | Turkish   | Australian|
| Pet           | Hedgehog  | Lizard    | Rabbit   | Dog       | Cat      |
| Transport     | Snowmobile| Trike     | Airplane | Van       | Scooter  |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the deductions:


From clue 5, we know the dancer is Dutch. Clue 8 tells us the Dutch drives a snowmobile, so the dancer is in position 1.


Clue 11 says the dancer is on the left of the bartender, so the bartender is in position 2.


From clue 9, we know the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the bartender. Clue 6 tells us the Argentine is between the owner of the hedgehog and the manager. Therefore, the Argentine must be in position 2 or 3, but since the bartender is already in position 2, the Argentine must be in position 3.


Now we know the bartender is between the lizard (clue 1) and the chef. Since the Argentine is in position 3, the lizard must be in position 1, but that's taken by the dancer. Therefore, the lizard must be in position 2, and the chef is in position 4.


From clue 12, we know the owner of the cat is on the far right, so the cat is in position 5.


Clue 3 tells us the Turkish is on the right of the person driving the van. Clue 7 says the Australian is on the right of the Dutch (dancer). Therefore, the Turkish and Australian must be in positions 4 and 5 or vice versa.


From clue 2, we know the person driving the trike is on the right of the person driving the van. The only possible arrangement for this is: Van-Trike-Airplane.


Clue 10 tells us the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person driving the airplane. Therefore, the Airplane must be in position 3 or 4, but since position 3 is taken by the Argentine (and the Thai), the Airplane must be in position 4, and the Rabbit is in position 5.


Finally, clue 6 says the Argentine is between the owner of the hedgehog and the manager. The only possible arrangement for this is: Hedgehog-Argentine-Manager, with the Hedgehog in position 1 (taken by the dancer), so it must be in position 2 or 3, but since position 2 is taken by the lizard (Bartender), the Hedgehog must be in position 1, and that's not possible. The only other option is to put the Hedgehog in position 1 of the Dutch, which means the Argentine takes the place of the hedgehog, making the Argentine the owner of the hedgehog impossible, so we swap the manager with the nurse (we still don't know who the nurse or manager are), putting the Nurse in the last spot.


After all these deductions, the final solution table is:
