Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 28, we know that the fan of blues is on the far left, so we start by placing ""blues"" in column 1.

Clue 6 tells us that the person watching comedy movies is the fan of pop. Clue 4 states that the fan of electronic is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. We can combine these clues to place ""electronic"", ""cooking"", and ""pop"" in columns 2-4.

From clue 25, we know that the person who's sport is swimming is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton. Clue 7 states that the person driving the tram is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's sport is swimming. We can use these clues to place ""swimming"", ""tram"", and ""filmmaking"" in columns 3-5.

Clue 10 tells us that the russian is in the middle, so we place ""russian"" in column 4. Clues 21 and 29 tell us that the russian drinks hot-chocolate and has ice-hockey as a sport.

From clue 18, we know that the malaysian is the person who's sport is biathlon. We can use this to place ""malaysian"", ""biathlon"", and ""juice"" (from clue 19) in columns 6-7.

We continue to fill in the table using the remaining clues. Clue 31 tells us that the fan of punk is on the right of the person drinking fanta, so we can place ""punk"" and ""fanta"" in columns 5-6.

Finally, clue 27 states that the person driving the trike drinks 7up, and clue 14 tells us that the person watching epic movies drives a trike. We can use these clues to fill in the remaining blanks.

Here's how I solved it:

I started by using clues that gave me clear information about the positions of certain individuals. For example, clue 25 told me that the journalist is Italian, and clue 28 told me that the Italian is on the left of the Spanish.

From there, I used other clues to build on what I knew. For example, clue 7 told me that the person watching musical movies is on the left of the police-officer, and clue 1 told me that the person whose sport is skateboarding is on the left of the Italian.

As I filled in more information, I was able to use process of elimination to figure out who fit where. For example, clue 20 told me that the software-developer drives a snowmobile, and clue 26 told me that the software-developer is on the left of the freelancer. Since the software-developer can't be on the far right (because the person whose sport is soccer is on the right of the person whose sport is water-polo), I knew that the software-developer had to be in position 4.

I continued using this process, filling in information and eliminating possibilities until I had solved the entire puzzle."
