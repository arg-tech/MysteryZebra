Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 11, the person who's hobby is traveling drives the taxi, so they must be in column 1.
* Clue 7 states that the person who's hobby is traveling is on the left of the person who's hobby is magic-tricks. Since there are only two columns to the right of the traveling person, magic-tricks must be in column 6 or 7. But clue 4 says the chef (who sings) is not at either end, so magic-tricks cannot be in column 7.
* Clue 3 places the guinea-pig owner between the rat and the lawyer. Since the writer is on the far right (clue 1), the lawyer must be in column 4 or 5.
* Clue 14 states that the person who's hobby is fishing owns a lizard, so they cannot own a guinea-pig (since clue 16 says the guinea-pig owner comes before the mouse owner).
* From clue 10, the lizard owner comes before the bird owner. Since the rat owner is between the snake and tram owners (clue 18), the snake must be in column 1.
* Clue 5 states that the jet-ski driver's hobby is cooking, so they cannot be in column 7 (which is occupied by a person with a different job).
* Clue 13 places the airplane driver in the middle. Since there are only three columns left for the remaining hobbies and jobs, the airplane driver must be in column 5.
* The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining gaps.

Please note that this solution assumes that each person has a unique hobby, job, pet, and transport method. If multiple people can share these attributes, there may be additional possible solutions."

Here is the solved table:


#############
|            |      1      |      2       |      3      |      4       |     5     |    6    |      7      |

| Job        | entrepreneur| bartender    | photographer | manager      | dressmaker| coach   | teacher     |
| Pet        | bird        | rabbit       | snake        | hamster      | chinchilla | lizard  | ferret      |

Here's a brief explanation of how the solution was obtained:

From clue 16, we know that the entrepreneur is on the left of the bartender. From clue 1, we also know that the photographer is on the left of the manager.

Combining clues 4 and 12, we can conclude that the person drinking tea is in position 6. 

We also know from clue 3 that the person drinking lemonade is on the far right (position 7). However, we have no lemonade mentioned yet, so let's assume that it will be filled later.

Clue 5 says that mirinda is in the middle (positions 3 or 4), but from clue 14, we know that mirinda is also between video-games and iced-tea. This can only happen if miranda is on position 4 and video-games and iced-tea are around it.

From clues 2 and 13, we can conclude that the person drinking soy-milk is in position 3 and owns a snake and has board-games as a hobby.

Now let's fill the hobbies: 

* From clue 9, sudoku must be on the left of video-games.
* From clue 6, fishing is on the left of dressmaker. So far, we have two positions filled with jobs (photographer and manager). The only position that can satisfy the clues for photographer and manager without contradicting them with other clues (mainly 1) is if they are in positions 2 and 5 respectively.
* From clue 7, board-games must be on the left of photographer. This means video-games and sudoku have to fill the remaining spots on either side of mirinda. Since we don't know which one has photography as a hobby yet (we can only conclude that it is between tea and fishing from clue 12), let's leave photography empty for now.
* From clue 10, dressmaker cannot be in positions 1 or 2 since fishing must be to its left. This means dressmaker has to fill the remaining job spot which doesn't contradict any of the already filled jobs or hobbies (position 6).
* From clue 17, baking is on the right of video-games.
* From clue 11, lizard must be in position 7.

Now let's fill the pets:

* From clues 8 and 13, snake has to fill either positions 2 or 3 since it owns board-games as a hobby. But from clue 4, we also know that ferret is on the right of tea which can only happen if snake fills position 3.
* From clue 19, bird must be in position 1.

From here, we can conclude the beverages and remaining pets/jobs:


* Lemonade is in position 7 (since it's the only one left)
* Tea is in position 6
* Juice must be the beverage of the person drinking juice which doesn't contradict any other clues if it fills the empty spot for beverage on the left (position 1).
* Iced-tea and sprite are also filled similarly.
* Chinchilla has to fill the remaining pet spot in position 5.

With all these conclusions, we get the final solution table:

Lv2-4x7-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Transport     | train   | helicopter| bus        | scooter  | boat     | quad-bike| jet-ski   |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 17, we know that the fan of salsa is on the far right. Clue 13 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike is the fan of salsa.

Clue 1 and 6 indicate that the fan of gospel is between the owner of the turtle (clue 18) and the owner of the snake. Clue 11 reveals that the fan of gospel is the owner of the dog.

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the scooter is the owner of the frog. Clue 12 tells us that the owner of the frog is between the person driving the train and the spanish (who owns a fish, according to clue 2).

The rest of the clues help fill in the gaps:

* The fan of jazz is on the left of the owner of the dog (clue 3), which places it next to the gospel fan.
* The chinese person drives the helicopter (clue 14).
* The american drives the jet-ski (clue 15) and is a trance fan (clue 5).
* Clues 8, 10, and 19 help determine the positions of the salsa fan, ambient fan, and cat owner.
* Clues 20 and 21 provide additional constraints on the positions of the r&b fan, fish owner, and boat driver.

The final solution satisfies all 21 clues."
Lv2-4x7-9	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:

| Pet           | guinea-pig | rabbit  | chinchilla   | horse      | ferret      | goat      | rat      |


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 19, we know pineapple is on the far left (column 1).
* From clue 10, cranberry must be on the right of magic-tricks. Since peas is on the far right (clue 7), and apricot is between peas and blueberry (clue 6), cranberry can't be in column 5 or 7.
* Using clue 11, camping is the hobby associated with the goat. From clue 13, camping is left of r&b, so we place camping on the rightmost side that still allows r&b to fit (column 7).
* Clue 16 places electronic left of blueberry. With ambient being the owner of the rabbit (clue 3), and salsa's placement from clue 1, we deduce electronic is in column 2.
* Using clue 4, salsa is right of horse. Since salsa can't be in column 7, it must be in column 5 or 6. But with blueberry in column 4 (due to apricot's placement), salsa can only fit in column 5.
* From clue 12, r&b owns a rat. With camping on the right of r&b, we place r&b in column 6.
* Clue 18 places reading right of guinea-pig. Given card-games' relation to reading (clue 15), and peas being on the far right, we can deduce that guinea-pig is in column 2 or 3.
* By using a combination of clues 9 and 17, woodworking and cooking are paired with plum and apricot respectively.
* Using clue 8, punk is right of rat. With r&b owning a rat (clue 12), we place punk in column 7.


This solution should satisfy all the given conditions. Please note that there might be other possible solutions due to the complexity of the puzzle.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the firefighter drinks tea. From clue 2, we know the firefighter drives a trike.
From clue 15, we know the teacher is on the left of the person drinking tea, so the teacher must be in position 1 or 2. But from clue 19, we know the teacher drinks lemonade, which contradicts the initial hot-cho-tea in position 1, so I assume it's a typo and the correct beverage for position 1 is actually ""tea"" (drunk by the firefighter) and not ""hot-cho-te"". Therefore, the teacher must be in position 2.

From clue 14, we know the person drinking tea (firefighter) is on the right of the person watching musical movies. From clue 5, we know the firefighter is also on the right of the person watching musical movies. So, the person watching musical movies must be in position 3 or 4. But from clue 9, we know the roller driver is on the right of the person watching comedy movies, and from clue 18, we know the scientific movie watcher is on the right of the roller driver. Since the firefighter can't watch comedy (clue 5), the musical movie watcher must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know the police-officer drinks coffee. From clue 13, we know the person drinking coffee is between the person drinking 7up and hot-chocolate. So, the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 1 or 6 (since hot-cho-tea was a typo). But from clue 16, we know the person watching spy movies drinks hot-chocolate, so position 1 makes more sense.

From clue 11, we know the entrepreneur watches action movies. From clue 20, we know the manager is on the right of the entrepreneur. So, the entrepreneur must be in position 5 or 6. But from clue 1, we know the jet-ski driver is on the right of the entrepreneur, and from clue 6, we know the van driver is on the right of the jet-ski driver. Since the manager can't drive a jet-ski (clue 20), the entrepreneur must be in position 5.

From clue 8, we know cola is on the left of lemonade. So, cola must be in position 3 or 4. But from clue 17, we know cola is in the middle, so it must be in position 4.

The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining positions.
