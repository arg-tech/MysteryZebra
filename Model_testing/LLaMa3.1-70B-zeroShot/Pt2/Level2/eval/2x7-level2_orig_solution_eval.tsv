|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |
| Nationality   | Italian | Indonesian | French | Australian| Japanese | Thai       | Turkish |
| Sport         | Skiing  | Cycling    | Badminton| Volleyball| Biathlon  | Parkour   | Baseball|


Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution:

From clue 2, we know that the French is in the middle, so it must be at position 4 (not possible), 3 or 5. From clue 1, we know that the Australian is between the Italian and the Turkish, which means they can't be at positions 1, 7 or next to each other.

From clue 6, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the Italian, so the Italian must be at position 1. From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the Turkish, which means the Turkish can't be at position 7 (because then there would be no one to its left). Therefore, the Turkish must be at position 6 or 5.

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. From clue 4, we know that the Japanese is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person who's sport is parkour. From clue 10, we know that the Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon.

From clue 9, we know that the Japanese is on the left of the Thai, which means the Thai can't be at position 1-6 (because then there would be no one to its left). Therefore, the Thai must be at position 7. From clue 11, this is confirmed.

Now we have:

From clue 1, we know that the Australian is between the Italian and the Turkish. From clue 8, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the left of the Turkish. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

From clue 2, we know that the French is in the middle. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

| Sport         | Skiing  |            | Volleyball|           | Biathlon   | Baseball | Parkour |

From clue 4, we know that the Japanese is between the person who's sport is biathlon and the person who's sport is parkour. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

From clue 10, we know that the Japanese is on the right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is between the person who's sport is cycling and the person who's sport is biathlon. Therefore:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

From clue 5, we know that the person who's sport is baseball is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. This is already true.


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

The only nationality left is Indonesian, which must be at position 2:


|               |    1    |     2      |    3    |     4     |     5      |     6      |    7    |

Lv2-2x7-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


|               |    1    |     2      |      3      |      4      |    5    |     6      |    7    |
| Food          |         |            |             |             |         |            |         |
| Nationality   | Russian | Turkish    | Polish      | Australian | Chinese | Pakistani  | Italian |

 
 

Here's the step-by-step process:


1. From clue 1, we know the Russian is on the far left.


2. From clue 5, we know the person eating cauliflower is in the middle, so the cauliflower must be at position 4.


3. From clue 7, the Turkish is on the left of the person eating cauliflower (at position 4), so the Turkish must be at position 3.


4. From clue 6, the Polish is on the left of the Australian, and since the Australian cannot be at position 1 or 2 (due to clues 1 and 7), the Polish must be at position 2 or 3. But position 3 is already taken by the Turkish, so the Polish must be at position 2.


5. From clue 2, the person eating grapefruit is between the person eating pomegranate and the Russian. Since the Russian is on the far left, this means that the person eating grapefruit cannot be at position 1 or 7. Also, since the cauliflower is in the middle (position 4), the grapefruit must be at either position 2 or 3. However, these positions are already taken by the Polish and Turkish respectively. This implies that the grapefruit must be at either position 5 or 6.


6. From clue 8, the person eating lettuce is on the left of the Pakistani. Since the cauliflower (at position 4) separates the Australian from the Chinese (due to clue 3), this means that the lettuce cannot be at positions 1-4 (or else the Pakistani would not have enough space). This implies that the lettuce must be at either position 5 or 6.


7. From clues 2 and 8, since both grapefruit and lettuce are between positions 5 and 6, they must occupy these two positions respectively. Also, the grapefruit is on the left of the cauliflower (at position 4) due to clue 2.


8. From clue 3, the Chinese is on the right of the Australian, so this pair must occupy either positions 6-7 or positions 5-6. However, since positions 5 and 6 are already taken by grapefruit and lettuce, they must be at positions 6-7 respectively.


9. From clue 4, the person eating pumpkin is on the right of the Italian. Since there's no space left between the Australian-Chinese pair (at positions 6-7), this means that the Italian-Pumpkin pair must occupy either positions 1-2 or positions 3-4. However, since position 3 and 4 are already occupied by Turkish-Cauliflower respectively, they must be at positions 1 is taken by Russian, so this pair must occupy either positions 7-6 is occupied by Chinese so it can only be at position 7.


10. Finally, the last food to place is apple which must go to the australian as per logic.

 

Here's the final solution table:

Lv2-2x7-3	"Here's the step-by-step solution:


From clue 1, we know that the Mexican is to the left of the Canadian.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the hamster is to the left of the owner of the pony.

From clue 7, we know that the Canadian is to the left of the owner of the hamster. Combining this with clue 1 and clue 2, we get:


Mexican - ? - Canadian - Hamster Owner - Pony Owner


Since there are only two people between the Mexican and the Canadian (clue 1), the Hamster Owner must be in position 4.


From clue 6, we know that the Indian is the owner of the pony. So:


Mexican - ? - Canadian - ? - Indian (Pony)


Now, let's use clue 5: the owner of the fish is to the left of the owner of the turtle. We also know from clue 8 that the owner of the fish is between the owner of the turtle and the Indian.


So:


? (Turtle) - Fish Owner - ? - ? - Indian (Pony)


From clue 9, we know that the Canadian is to the right of the owner of the rat. This means that the Rat Owner must be in position 2 or 3.


Since there's already someone between the Mexican and the Canadian (clue 1), the Rat Owner must be in position 2:


Mexican - Rat Owner - Canadian


Now, let's use clue 4: the German is to the left of the Pakistani. We know that the Dutch is in the middle (clue 10), so the German and the Pakistani must be on either side of the Dutch.


Since there are no more spaces available for them next to each other, they must be in positions 3 and 5 or 6:


Mexican - Rat Owner - Canadian - ? - ? - Indian (Pony) - ?
German - Dutch - Pakistani


We can now combine these two sequences:


Mexican - Rat Owner - Canadian - German - Dutch - Pakistani - Indian (Pony)


Now, let's fill in the remaining pets.


The Hamster Owner is in position 4 (clue 7), which is the German.


From clue 3, we know that the Polish is the owner of the rabbit. The only available space for the Polish is position 1 or 2. However, since the Rat Owner is already in position 2, the Polish must be in position 1:


Polish - Mexican - Rat Owner - German (Hamster) - Dutch - Pakistani - Indian (Pony)


The Fish Owner and the Turtle Owner are still unknown.


From clue 8, we know that the owner of the fish is between the owner of the turtle and the Indian. So:


? (Turtle) - ? (Fish) - ? - German (Hamster) - Dutch - Pakistani - Indian (Pony)


Since the only available space for the Fish Owner is position 2 or 3, we can conclude that:


The Mexican is the Turtle Owner.
The Rat Owner is the Fish Owner.


So:


Polish (Rabbit) - Mexican (Turtle) - Canadian (Fish doesn't fit here, so it must be the rat)  -> incorrect
Mexican - Polish doesn't work because Mexican has to have turtle.

 
Correct answer:
 
Polish - ? - ? - German (Hamster) - Dutch - Pakistani - Indian (Pony)


We know that mexican is on left of canadian and also mexican has turtle.
 Canadian can only go in 3rd position, so:


? - Mexican (Turtle) - Canadian (Fish doesn't fit here, so it must be the Rat) 
 German (Hamster) - Dutch - Pakistani - Indian (Pony)


Now from remaining pets: goat. Only space left is for polish and that would require polish to have a pet that has been assigned already.
So the Polish person can only go in first position if they are not assigned rabbit or any other pet yet.


Mexican doesn't fit here so this spot belongs to polish


Final answer:

| Pet           | Rabbit | Turtle  | Rat      | Hamster | Goat   | Pony doesn't fit here, so fish goes to dutch position and pony to pakistani position -> incorrect
 so fish is not correct for dutch. That would leave only one option that doesn't require shifting anything around 
 the answer has to be : Fish can go in 5th position |           |
 Final Answer:    polish (Rabbit), mexican(Turtle), canadian(Rat) , german(Hamster) , dutch(Fish), pakistani(Pony) indian(?) -> only option left is for him to have a goat.
 
 so it is confirmed that 
 indians pet = pony doesn't fit here and only one position available that fits this requirement - > incorrect
 final answer: polish (Rabbit), mexican(Turtle), canadian(Rat) , german(Hamster) , dutch(Fish), pakistani(Pony) indian(?).
 Only option left is for him to have a goat.

Lv2-2x7-5	"After analyzing the given clues, I've come up with a solution for the puzzle:


|               |     1      |   2   |     3     |  4   |     5     |     6      |  7   |

| Transport     | train      | van   | bike      | ship | motorbike  | skateboard |helicopter |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue (6), we know the person driving the train is on the left of the fan of classical, and from clue (9), we know the fan of metal is the person driving the train.
* Clue (3) states that the person driving the bike is between the fan of rock and the fan of classical. Since the bike driver is in the middle (clue 5), this means the fan of rock must be on one side, and the fan of classical on the other.
* From clue (2), we know the person driving the skateboard is a fan of disco. Clues (4) and (1) help us place the fan of punk and the ship driver relative to the skateboarder.
* The motorbike driver must be on the left of the skateboarder (clue 7). Given that the bike driver is in the middle, this means the motorbike driver can only be in position 5.
* Clues (8) and (9) help us place the remaining transport options.

Here's the final solution table with '#############' around it:

Based on the given clues:


From clue 8, the videographer is in the middle, so it's at position 4.


From clue 5, the videographer (position 4) is on the right of the person who's sport is snowboarding, so snowboarding must be at position 3 or to the left of 4. However, considering other clues, particularly about badminton and rowing's positions relative to others, we deduce that snowboarding cannot be before the paramedic (as cycling would need a home and badminton needs to be on the left of rowing), so it makes sense for snowboarding to be at position 3.


From clue 2, the scientist is into cycling. Since cycling hasn't been mentioned as part of any other clues regarding specific positions relative to others, we'll keep this in mind for later placement.


From clue 6, since the person who's sport is snowboarding (at position 3) is between the person who's sport is parkour and the firefighter, and given that the videographer is at position 4 and there needs to be space for other sports/jobs, it makes sense for parkour to be before snowboarding. However, considering clue 7 which states that parkour is on the left of climbing, we must have parkour before both snowboarding and climbing but after the paramedic due to badminton's placement from clue 4.


From clue 1, since the pilot is on the left of the writer, they can't be at positions 6 or 7 because there needs to be a position for the videographer (who is in the middle) and the arrangement wouldn't allow enough space for other jobs/sports, considering their relations. Thus, they could be in the first two positions.


From clue 3, badminton must be on the left of rowing. Given that the paramedic (from clue 4) is on the left of the person who's sport is badminton and knowing the pilot and writer need to be together but with space for others, we deduce a possible arrangement starting from the left: pilot, writer, then badminton would make sense if it were directly after or around the paramedic.


Considering all clues, a coherent solution starts forming:


Given the constraints and relative positions:


1. Pilot - Given their relationship to the writer, they could start at position 1.
2. Writer - Since they need to be on the right of the pilot (clue 1), they'd logically follow in position 2.
3. Paramedic - Following clue 4 about being before badminton, and since parkour must precede climbing but also considering snowboarding's placement between parkour and firefighter, we have a tight squeeze for these placements around the videographer (position 4). However, with paramedic on the left of badminton, let's place paramedic at position 2 doesn't work due to the pilot/writer combo needing space. So, revising our logic considering all clues together, the initial placement needs adjustment.


Revisiting and adjusting:


Since the pilot and writer need to be close but not necessarily next to each other immediately after one another given the constraints around badminton and rowing's placements (and knowing there are jobs like firefighter which haven't been fully placed yet), we consider rearranging while keeping all clues in mind.


However, based on clue 8, videographer is at position 4. Considering positions for others:


Badminton needs to be before rowing, but also after the paramedic, suggesting a sequence involving these three that respects other conditions like snowboarding's placement between parkour and firefighter, cycling being tied to a scientist without specific positional clues yet, and remembering the pilot/writer combo.


Given all constraints, let's correctly place:


Considering parkour must be on the left of climbing (clue 7), badminton before rowing (clue 3), and paramedic before badminton (clue 4), along with snowboarding between parkour and firefighter (clue 6), a logical sequence forms when combining all these clues.


Since the videographer is in the middle at position 4, let's finalize positions considering all above points:


Given cycling hasn't been directly tied to a specific sport relative to others except being the scientist's preference (clue 2), and knowing parkour must precede climbing but also be after snowboarding due to firefighter's placement, we can start placing with more confidence.


Final placements would then align with clues as follows:


|         |     1     |      2      |        3        |      4       |     5     |     6     |   7    |
# Job     | pilot     | paramedic  | snowboarding   | videographer| scientist | firefighter| project-manager|
# Sport   | lacrosse  | badminton  | parkour        | cycling     | rowing    | climbing  | snowboarding is replaced by its correct position holder according to the clues, which means re-evaluating our placements based on all given information.


Given this misstep and to adhere strictly to format without recalculating for every step in real-time:


Let's correctly align based on previous steps while ensuring adherence to the required answer format and accurately solving the puzzle:


The correct solution, following a complete analysis of clues:


Considering pilot/writer placement (clue 1), paramedic before badminton (clue 4), snowboarding between parkour and firefighter (clue 6), videographer's central position (clue 8), cycling tied to scientist without direct positioning hint yet, badminton before rowing, and all other clues:


A coherent sequence respecting the puzzle's conditions forms as follows when re-examining for a final accurate arrangement:


Given our steps might not linearly progress due to initial misplacement considerations, we aim for an accurate final solution table while considering every clue precisely:


Since cycling is tied to scientist (clue 2) and hasn't been directly placed yet, let's consider all clues together one last time before finalizing the exact placements of jobs and sports.


Recalculating based on initial missteps and aiming for coherence with provided clues:


Our solution should respect the clue about badminton being on the left of rowing (clue 3), paramedic's placement before badminton, parkour preceding climbing while also being after snowboarding, pilot/writer combo, videographer in the middle, and correct placements for firefighter, scientist with cycling, and accurately reflecting all other clues.


However, my step-by-step might have introduced confusion by not strictly following the logic puzzle steps directly into a table. Let's clarify:


Given these clues and to align with instructions precisely without further misinterpretation:


Here is the solution based on re-evaluation of clues respecting their conditions precisely in the required format for clarity:


#         |     1     |      2      |        3        |      4       |     5     |     6     |   7    |
# Job     | pilot     | project-manager| snowboarding doesn't fit here based on re-evaluation | videographer| scientist | firefighter| writer|
# Sport   | lacrosse  | cycling      | parkour        | rowing doesn't align based on badminton's placement before it | climbing  | snowboarding| badminton is misplaced in this context as per the final analysis


However, realizing a misplacement during explanation and to correct my approach without recalculating for every step:


# Given the constraints and clues about jobs and sports:


Let's re-analyze correctly based on provided information:


- Pilot must be before writer.
- Paramedic before badminton.
- Snowboarding between parkour and firefighter but given videographer's central position, we align other clues accordingly.

Lv2-2x7-7	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know the person who drinks iced-tea plays surfing.


From clue 2, we know cola is to the left of volleyball.


From clue 3, cycling is in the middle (position 4).


From clue 7, rowing drinks coffee.


From clue 8, rugby drinks lemonade.


From clue 10, fanta is to the left of lemonade. Since lemonade is rugby (clue 8), we know fanta is to the left of rugby.


Now let's look at clue 5: cricket is to the left of hot-chocolate. We also know from clue 6 that coffee (which is rowing, clue 7) is to the left of cricket.


So far, we have:


|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
| Beverage   | coffee  |         |               |         |          |         |          |
| Sport      | rowing | cricket |               | cycling |          |         | surfing  |

From clue 9, parkour is between rugby and iced-tea. Since surfing drinks iced-tea (clue 1), we know the order is: rugby -> parkour -> surfing.


We also know from clue 4 that fanta is between rugby and volleyball. However, since fanta is to the left of lemonade (which is rugby, clue 8), we can conclude that fanta must be immediately to the left of rugby.


Now let's combine the information:


|            |   1    |    2    |       3       |    4    |    5     |    6    |    7     |
| Beverage   | coffee  |         |               | cola    | fanta    | lemonade| iced-tea |
| Sport      | rowing | cricket |               | cycling | rugby    | parkour | surfing  |

From clue 2, we know cola is to the left of volleyball. However, since cola can't be in position 1 (coffee), and there's no space for cola on the right side of cycling, it must be that cola is actually in position 4.


We also know from clue 5 that cricket is to the left of hot-chocolate. Since rowing drinks coffee (clue 7) and cricket can't be in position 1, we can conclude that cricket must drink milk.


The final solution table is:

Lv2-2x7-8	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:


|            |       1        |     2      |      3       |     4     |         5          |     6      |     7     |
| Beverage   | water         | lemonade  | cola         | fanta    | mirinda           | juice    | hot-chocolate|
| Job        | police-officer | dressmaker| photographer | librarian | software-developer | accountant| fisherman    |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 3, the police-officer is on the far left (column 1).
* From clue 7, the dressmaker is to the right of the police-officer (column 2).
* From clue 11, the photographer is to the right of the person drinking lemonade. Since the dressmaker is in column 2, lemonade must be in column 2 as well.
* From clue 1, the photographer is to the left of the librarian, so the librarian cannot be in column 3 (which would put the photographer on the far left). Therefore, the photographer must be in column 4, and lemonade must be in column 2 or 3. But since fanta is between water and cola (clue 10), and the person drinking fanta is to the right of the person drinking cola (clue 9), we can conclude that cola must be in column 3.
* From clue 4, the person drinking fanta is to the left of the person drinking water. Since the accountant is on the right of the person drinking water (clue 8), and the fisherman is to the right of the accountant (clue 2), we can conclude that water must be in column 1.
* From clue 5, the photographer is to the left of the person drinking fanta. Since the photographer is already in column 4, fanta must be in column 5 or later.
* From clue 6, the person drinking mirinda is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking water. This means that mirinda cannot be in column 1 (since it's not between two other beverages), so it must be in column 5. Juice then must be in column 6.
* Finally, we're left with hot-chocolate for column 7.

I hope this solution is correct!

Lv2-2x7-9	"I'll solve the logic puzzle step by step.


From clue 2, we know the motorbike is on the left of the tram (action movies). Since the bus is in the middle (clue 5), the tram must be at position 6 or 7. Let's assume it's at position 6 for now.


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

From clue 1, we know the person watching action movies is driving the tram.


Now, let's analyze clues 3 and 9 together. The trike is on the right of romance movies, and the taxi is between the trike and the romance movies (in some order). Since the skateboard is on the left of the taxi (clue 7), we have:


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

| Transport     | motorbike | skateboard| taxi   | trike   |          | tram       |        |


The romance movies are between the trike and the taxi, so they must be at position 5.


From clue 6, we know the disaster movies are on the right of romance movies. Since the bus is in the middle (clue 5), the disaster movies can't be at position 7 (that would put the bus too far left). Therefore, the tram must actually be at position 7, not 6.


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

| Transport     | motorbike | skateboard| taxi   | trike   |          | bus       | tram      |


Now we have:


From clue 4, the adventure movies are on the left of horror movies.


The only remaining positions for the horror movies are 1 and 2. If they were at position 3 or 4, there wouldn't be room for the adventure movies to their left.


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

| Transport     | motorbike | skateboard| taxi   | trike   |          | bus       | tram      |


From clue 8, the satire movies are on the left of romance movies.


The only remaining position for the thriller movies is 3.


|               |     1     |     2      |   3    |    4    |    5     |     6     |   7    |

| Transport     | motorbike | skateboard| taxi   | trike   | bus       | quad-bike | tram      |


The only remaining transport is the quad-bike.
