Since the Thai is on the left of the Japanese (clue 1), we can deduce that the order must be: Thai, Japanese


Clue 2 tells us that the Thai is between the Indian and the Japanese, so the order must be: Indian, Thai, Japanese


Here is the final solution:

Lv2-1x3-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know that the person watching disaster movies is between the other two.

From clue 2, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the right of the person watching disaster movies.

Combining these two clues, we can conclude that:

* The person watching disaster movies must be in position 2 (since they are between the other two).
* The person watching horror movies must be in position 3 (since they are on the right of the person watching disaster movies).
* The person watching sports movies must be in position 1 (by elimination).

Here is the final solution table:

Clue 1: The fan of folk is between the fan of ambient and the fan of metal.
This means that Folk cannot be in position 1, as there would not be a position for Ambient to its left.

Clue 2: The fan of folk is on the left of the fan of ambient.
Since Folk must be on the left of Ambient (from Clue 2), and considering Clue 1 that Folk is between Metal and Ambient, we can deduce the order as follows:


- Metal cannot be in position 3 because then there wouldn't be a place for both Folk and Ambient to its right with Folk being to the left of Ambient.
- Therefore, Metal must be in position 1 (to satisfy Clue 1), making the order: Metal - Folk - Ambient.


The final solution table looks like this:

Lv2-1x3-4	"Based on the clues, I will fill in the table.


Since the owner of the snake is on the left of the owner of the guinea-pig (clue 1), we can place the snake's owner in column 1 or 2. However, clue 2 states that the owner of the snake is between the owner of the guinea-pig and the owner of the ferret. This means the snake's owner cannot be in column 1, because then there would be no one on the left side to be ""between"". Therefore, the snake's owner must be in column 2.

Here is the updated table:


|       |   1    |   2   |     3      |
| Pet   |        | Snake |            |

Now we know the guinea-pig's owner must be on the right side of the snake, so it goes in column 3.


|       |   1    |   2   |     3      |
| Pet   |        | Snake | Guinea-Pig|

Finally, by process of elimination, the ferret's owner goes in column 1.

From clue 2, we know the person drinking milk is on the far right, so we can fill in the table as follows:

| Beverage   |       |      | milk |

Now, from clue 1, we know the person drinking cola is between the person drinking milk and the person drinking juice. Since the person drinking milk is on the far right (position 3), the person drinking cola must be in position 2.

Lv2-1x3-7	"Let's break down the clues:

1. The owner of the cat is between the owner of the hedgehog and the owner of the frog.
2. The owner of the cat is on the right of the owner of the hedgehog.

From clue 2, we know the order is: Hedgehog -> Cat (since the cat is to the right of the hedgehog)

Now, let's consider clue 1. If the cat is between the hedgehog and the frog, it means the frog must be on the other side of the cat. So, the order is:

Hedgehog -> Cat -> Frog

Let's fill in the table:

Lv2-1x3-8	"Let's analyze the clues:

1. The person who's hobby is drawing is on the left of the person who's hobby is gardening.
This means that Drawing is in column 1 and Gardening is in either column 2 or 3.

2. The person who's hobby is gardening is between the person who's hobby is reading and the person who's hobby is drawing.
Since Drawing is already determined to be on the left, this means that Reading must be on the right of Gardening.

Combining both clues, we get:

Clue 1: The fan of techno is between the fan of country and the fan of rock.
This means that the order must be either ""country-techno-rock"" or ""rock-techno-country"".

Clue 2: The fan of techno is on the left of the fan of rock.
This means that techno cannot be after rock, so the correct order is ""country-techno-rock"".

Lv2-1x3-10	"Based on the given conditions:


Condition 1 states that the owner of the rabbit is between the owners of the bird and the ferret.
Condition 2 states that the owner of the bird is to the right of the owner of the rabbit.


Given these two conditions, we can deduce the arrangement as follows:

- If the rabbit's owner is in position 1, then the bird must be in position 3 (to satisfy Condition 2), and the ferret would have to be in position 2. However, this does not satisfy Condition 1 because it states that the rabbit should be between the bird and ferret.
- If the rabbit's owner is in position 2, then the bird must be in position 3 (to satisfy Condition 2), which automatically places the ferret in position 1. This arrangement satisfies both conditions.

Therefore, the final arrangement is:
