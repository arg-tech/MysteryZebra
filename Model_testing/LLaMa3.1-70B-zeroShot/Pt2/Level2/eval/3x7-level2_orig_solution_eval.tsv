#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 15, we know the Canadian is on the far right.


Clue 12 tells us that the person driving the bus is the Canadian, but since the Canadian is on the far right (clue 15), the bus must be in position 4.


From clue 1, we know the Canadian is on the right of the person driving the car. This means the car must be in position 6.


Clue 14 tells us that the Egyptian is on the left of the British, and clue 13 says the Egyptian is on the right of the person driving the train. Therefore, the train must be in position 1.


Using clues 7 and 11, we can determine that the Indian is on the right of the British, so the order for these three is: Egyptian-British-Indian.


From clue 16, we know the Cricket player (Japanese) is on the left of the Thai, who plays Badminton.


Clue 3 tells us that the Sailing sport is to the right of Parkour, which in turn is to the right of Bus (clue 4). This means Snowboarding and Soccer are to the left of Parkour.


Soccer must be on the far left since it's to the left of Parkour, and Handball is to the left of Indian. Therefore, we can determine that the British plays Handball.


Now, using all the other clues, we can fill in the remaining gaps:


Colombian is on the right of Ship (clue 10), which must be in position 5.


Roller must be in position 3 since it's not mentioned anywhere else.


This completes the solution table."	{'nationality': ['egyptian', 'british', 'indian', 'japanese', 'thai', 'colombian', 'canadian'], 'sport': ['soccer', 'handball', 'cricket', 'parkour', 'badminton', 'snowboarding', 'sailing'], 'transport': ['train', 'trike', 'bus', 'roller', 'scooter', 'ship', 'car']}	True	3	False
Lv2-3x7-3	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 9, we know the person driving the van is on the far right. Clue 14 tells us that this person drinks water.
* Clue 1 tells us the person driving the roller is the accountant. This means the accountant can't be in position 7 (since it's the van).
* From clue 8, we know the scooter driver is to the left of the photographer. Since the trike driver is between the van and the photographer (clue 5), the scooter must be in position 5.
* Clue 4 tells us the scooter driver drinks fanta.
* The journalist drives a taxi (clue 2) and is on the right of the helicopter driver (clue 6). Since the taxi can't be in position 7, it must be in either position 3 or 4. But if it's in position 3, there's no room for the person drinking soy-milk to be on the left of the tea drinker (clue 7). So the taxi must be in position 4.
* Clue 13 tells us the coffee drinker is on the left of the journalist. This means the coffee drinker can't be in positions 5-7, so it must be in one of the first three positions. The only available spot is position 1.
* From clue 15, we know the helicopter driver is on the left of the soy-milk drinker. Since the taxi is in position 4 and the helicopter can't be in position 5 (because of the scooter), it must be in either position 2 or 3. But if it's in position 3, there's no room for the person drinking tea to be on the right of the soy-milk drinker. So the helicopter must be in position 2.
* The soy-milk drinker is now in position 3, and the tea drinker must be in position 4 (to satisfy clue 7).
* Clue 10 tells us the engineer is on the right of the musician. Since the coffee drinker is in position 1, the musician can't be in that spot, so it must be in one of positions 2-6. But if it's in any of those spots, there's no room for the engineer to be on the right of the musician and also satisfy clues 11 and 12.
* After trying a few combinations, I found that the only way to satisfy all the clues is to put the musician in position 1 (drinking coffee), the analyst in position 2 (driving the helicopter), the engineer in position 3 (drinking tea), and so on.

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

From clue 1, strawberry is on the far right (column 7). Clue 2 places the roller in the middle (column 4 or column 5 are possible, but we'll come back to this later).

Clue 3 places woodworking to the right of nectarine. Since nectarine's hobby is writing (clue 6), and cherry is on the train (clue 7), we can start building a sequence:

 Cherry - ? - Nectarine (writing)

From clue 4, radish is between cherry and grapes. Clue 5 places camping to the right of the person driving the train (cherry). This implies that the middle column (column 4) has the person who's hobby is camping.

Now we can place some more people:

 Cherry - ? - Radish - Camping - Grapes

The remaining columns are filled using other clues. Clue 8 places gardening to the left of filmmaking, and clue 9 places zucchini to the left of the car. Since the person driving the roller is on the right of the person who's hobby is woodworking (clue 10), we can conclude that:

 Roller - Woodworking

However, this contradicts our initial assumption about the roller being in column 4 or 5. We re-evaluate and find that the correct placement for the roller is indeed in column 6.

 Clue 11 places the bus to the left of the train, so we fill the remaining columns:

 Bus - Cherry (train) - Zucchini - Kiwi - Radish - Camping - Grapes

Finally, clue 13 places the skateboard to the left of the taxi, and since hiking is on the skateboard (clue 14), we get:

 Skateboard (hiking) - Taxi - Car

* Clue 1 places the person with filmmaking hobby in the middle, so they must be in position 4.
* Clue 2 tells us that the person eating pineapple is also drawing, and clue 3 indicates that eggplant is on the left of papaya. This suggests that pine (pineapple) is in position 3, eggplant in position 2, and papaya in position 4. However, since filmmaking is already in position 4, papaya must be in position 5.
* Clue 8 confirms that the chef eats papaya, which is now in position 5.
* Clue 10 tells us that collecting (hobby) goes with eggplant (food), so this person can only be in position 2.
* Clue 13 indicates that the firefighter is on the left of the person who collects, placing the firefighter in position 1 and the collector in position 2.
* Clue 7 tells us that writing (hobby) is on the left of pineapple (food), so this person must be in position 6. This also means that video-games (hobby) is on the left of apple (food), placing them in positions 5 and 6, respectively. However, since papaya (and chef) are already in position 5, we need to swap video-games with another hobby.
* Clue 4 tells us that video-games is on the left of apple, so this person must be in position 2 or 3. Since eggplant and collector are already in position 2, we place video-games in position 7 doesn't work (because of clue 6), so it goes to position 5, and coach takes its original spot.
* Clue 14 tells us that writing is on the right of hiking, placing hiking in position 1 or 3. Since garlic is not mentioned anywhere else, we place hiking with garlic in position 1.
* Clues 6 and 9 help us place teacher between pineapple (drawing) and peas, which puts them in positions 4-6. This also confirms that writer goes to the right of teacher.
* Finally, clue 12 places dancer with dancing hobby, and since coach is already taken, we give the remaining job (dancer) to the person eating garlic.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 13, we know the architect is in the middle, so they must be at position 3.
* Clue 12 states that the analyst is between the person drinking coffee and the firefighter. Since the firefighter drinks juice (clue 4), the analyst must be at position 4 or 5. However, clue 16 states that the analyst is on the left of the firefighter, so they must be at position 4.
* Clue 9 states that the coach is watching satire movies, and clue 10 states that the analyst is on the right of the scientist. This means the scientist must be at position 1 or 2. Since the person drinking soy-milk is on the left of the person watching romance movies (clue 7), the scientist must be at position 1.
* Clue 11 states that the engineer is on the right of the doctor, and clue 14 states that the analyst is between the person drinking coffee and the firefighter. This means the engineer must be at position 3 or 6. However, since the architect is already at position 3 (clue 13), the engineer must be at position 6.
* Clue 2 states that the person watching romance movies is on the left of the person watching drama movies. Since the person watching romance movies is at position 4, the person watching drama movies must be at position 5 or 6. However, since the engineer is already at position 6, the person watching drama movies must be at position 5.
* Clue 1 states that the person drinking sprite is in the middle, which means they are at position 3 or 4. Since the architect is already at position 3 (clue 13), the person drinking sprite must be at position 4.
* Clue 6 states that the person drinking fanta is watching documentary movies, and clue 12 states that the analyst is between the person drinking coffee and the firefighter. This means the person watching documentary movies must be at position 2 or 5. However, since the coach is already at position 5 (clue 9), the person watching documentary movies must be at position 2.
