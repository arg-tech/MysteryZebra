Please let me explain the reasoning behind my solution:


From clue 22, we know that water is on the far left.

From clues 14 and 16, we can deduce that orange is between 7up and peas, and peas are on the right of 7up. Since orange is also on the left of drama movies (clue 12), musical movies must be on the far left.

Clues 8 and 4 give us a starting point for the project-manager's position: it's on the far right. Clue 5 places climbing with orange, which we already know to be between 7up and peas.

From clue 23, hot-chocolate is on the right of watermelon. With melon (clue 2) in column 2, this means that hot-chocolate must be in column 3, making it a hot-chocolate drinker eating watermelon or grapefruit (clues 10 and 20). But clue 1 tells us that garlic is on the right of family movies, which can't be true if watermelon is in column 2. Therefore, grapefruit is the food for person 1.

The rest of the solution follows from these initial deductions.

1. Started by placing the brazilian on the far left (clue 12) and the person eating banana on the far right (clue 10).
2. Used clues 4, 7, and 16 to determine the order of the beverages: 7up, mirinda, sprite, cola, water, lemonade, soy-milk.
3. Placed the thai on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (clue 3) and the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles (clue 5).
4. Used clues 6, 9, and 22 to determine the order of the food: zucchini, banana, garlic, mango, grapes, kale, carrot.
5. Placed the colombian as the person driving the bike (clue 19) and the french as the person drinking soy-milk (clue 23).
6. Used clues 11, 21, and 24 to determine the order of the hobbies: collecting, puzzles, drawing, chess, hiking, camping, woodworking.
7. Placed the indian as the person who's hobby is drawing (clue 17) and the person driving the train is the person drinking soy-milk (clue 15).
8. Used clues 1, 13, and 20 to determine the order of the transport: taxi, subway, bus, car, bike, train, ship.
9. Finally, used the remaining clues to fill in any gaps and ensure consistency throughout the table.

* From clues 5 and 6, we can deduce that the person watching musical movies is at position 3 and the person eating apple is at position 5.
* From clues 9 and 23, we can determine the positions of the persons who's sport is weightlifting (position 2) and pineapple (position 4).
* Clue 10 allows us to place the guinea-pig owner at position 3, which means the person eating spinach must be at position 3 as well.
* From clues 11 and 12, we can deduce that the persons watching superhero movies and thriller movies are at positions 3 and 1 respectively.
* The rest of the puzzle falls into place by using the remaining clues.

* Clues 3 and 22 place the person eating grapefruit with rugby, and clue 23 places the person who's hobby is singing on the right of the person eating cranberry. This means that positions 6 and 7 are occupied by the person eating cranberry (and writing) and the person eating cherry (and singing).
* Clues 4 and 24 place the person who's sport is surfing on the right of the brazilian, which can only be in position 3.
* Clue 25 places the person who's hobby is baking on the right of the chef, which must be in positions 2 and 1 (or vice versa).

* Clue 8 places the person who's sport is skiing on the left of the person who's hobby is baking. This means that positions 1 and 2 must be occupied by the person eating cauliflower (and chess) and the designer.

* Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the snowmobile is eating radish.
* Clue 21 places the horse owner on the far left, which means the first row is complete.
* Clue 1 and 5 tell us that lime is to the right of ship (iced-tea), and clue 14 says pepper is with ship.
* Clue 10 puts water on the left side, with roller on its right. Since strawberry is eaten by roller owner (clue 15), we can deduce the order for columns 6-7.
