| Sport         | sailing | rugby        | golf    | skateboarding| skiing     |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 4, the person who's hobby is chess is the person drinking tea.
* From clue 8, the person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking cola. This means the person drinking cola ( Pakistani from clue 10) must be in column 3 or later.
* From clue 11, the Turkish is on the left of the Mexican. Since the Turkish is also on the left of the person drinking lemonade (clue 1), and the person drinking tea is on the left of the person drinking cola, we can deduce that the order for columns 2-4 is: Turkish, Lemonade, Pakistani.
* Clues 5 and 6 help us determine that the Canadian is in column 5. We also know from clue 16 that the person eating garlic is between the person who's sport is rugby and the Canadian.
* By combining clues 3 and 15, we find that the order for columns 2-4 is: Pepper, Banana, Soy-milk (or Fanta).
* With these constraints in mind, I filled in the rest of the table using the remaining clues.

Please note that this solution assumes that each person has only one favourite beverage, food, hobby, nationality, and sport."	{'beverage': ['tea', 'lemonade', 'cola', 'soy-milk', 'fanta'], 'food': ['garlic', 'pepper', 'banana', 'pomegranate', 'spinach'], 'hobby': ['chess', 'reading', 'writing', 'dancing', 'gardening'], 'nationality': ['french', 'turkish', 'pakistani', 'mexican', 'canadian'], 'sport': ['sailing', 'rugby', 'golf', 'skateboarding', 'skiing']}	True	8	False

#################


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 2, we know that the fan of d&b is on the left of the nurse (airplane).
* Clue 9 tells us that the librarian is on the left of the fan of d&b.
* Since the italian is in the middle (clue 3), and there are only two spots to the left of the airplane, we can place the librarian and the fan of d&b in positions 1 and 2, respectively.
* Clue 8 tells us that the helicopter is driven by the fan of pop. Since the thai is on the right of the fan of pop (clue 7), we can place them in position 3.
* Clues 4 and 12 allow us to determine the relative positions of the fans of d&b, dubstep, and reggae, as well as the malaysian and spanish individuals.
* The volleyball player is between the dressmaker and dancer (clue 15), and since the spanish is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball (clue 6), we can place them in positions 4 and 5.
* Finally, we can use clue 10 to confirm that the quad-bike driver is on the far right, which allows us to determine the order of transport modes.

Please note that the solution is unique.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 13, we know that Volleyball is on the far right.
From clue 1, Cola is to the left of Volleyball. So, Cola must be in position 4.
From clue 5, Pilot is to the right of Cola. So, Pilot must be in position 5 (or not, as we'll see later).
From clue 3, Skiing is between Martial-Arts and Writer. We don't know their positions yet, but we'll keep this in mind.
From clue 10, Onion is watching Martial-Arts. This helps us to place Martial-Arts relative to other movies.

Now, let's focus on the left side of the table.
From clue 9, Sprite is between Golf and Grapes. So, Golf must be in position 1 (or not, as we'll see later).
From clue 14, Videographer is to the right of Satire. This helps us to place Satire relative to other movies.

Next, let's use clues related to milk:
From clue 7, Water-Polo is to the right of Milk.
From clue 8, Cauliflower is to the right of Water-Polo.
From clue 11, Firefighter is between Milk and Tea. So, Milk must be in position 2 (or not, as we'll see later).

Now, let's analyze what we have so far:
- Volleyball is on the far right.
- Cola is to the left of Volleyball.
- Pilot might be in position 5 or not.
- Skiing is between Martial-Arts and Writer.
- Onion is watching Martial-Arts.
- Golf might be in position 1 or not.
- Sprite is between Golf and Grapes.
- Satire has Videographer on its right.
- Milk is in position 2 (or not).
- Water-Polo is to the right of Milk.

From clue 4, Western is to the left of Tea. So, Western must be in position 3 (if we consider that the person drinking tea might be a ""middle"" element). This would mean that Tea is in position 5 and Pilot can't be there.
Also, considering clues related to skiing:
- If Martial-Arts were on the right side, it would conflict with clue 1. So, Martial-Arts must be on the left side.

Considering these constraints, we get:

| Beverage      | sprite        |      milk    |     hot-cho   | cola        | tea         |
| Food          | grapes        | cauliflower | onion         | artichoke   | spinach     |

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 9, we know that the person drinking 7up is on the far left.

From clue 1, the person who's hobby is fishing owns the mouse, and from clue 10, the owner of the ferret is on the right of the fan of dubstep. This means that the person drinking 7up (dubstep fan) must be followed by the fishing enthusiast with a mouse as pet.

From clue 4, the rock fan is on the left of the hip-hop fan. Since there's already a punk fan between them in clue 5, we can conclude that the order for music-genres is dubstep, rock, punk, hip-hop, soul.

Clue 6 says that the person who's hobby is reading is between the person drinking soy-milk and the owner of the bird. Since there are already two people on the left with hobbies (fishing and cooking), we can conclude that the reader must be in position 4.

From clue 8, the fan of dubstep is on the right of the person who's sport is skiing. This means that the person drinking coffee (dubstep fan) is followed by someone whose sport is skiing.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the bird is on the left of the person who's sport is volleyball. Given the above information, we can conclude that the bird owner must be in position 4.

The rest of the clues fall into place nicely from here.
