Lv2-7x3-1	"Here is the solved puzzle:


|               |     1      |     2      |       3       |
| Beverage      | mirinda    | soy-milk   | 7up          |
| Food          | plum       | spinach    | lemon         |
| Hobby         | reading    | skydiving  | hiking        |
| Job           | accountant | mechanic   | designer      |
| Music-Genre   | d&b        | dubstep    | country       |
| Nationality   | italian    | colombian  | german        |
| Sport         | water-polo | weightlifting| tennis        |

Here's how I solved it:


From clue 10, we know the person on the far left has a hobby of reading.

From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is skydiving (colombian) is to the right of the person eating lemon. Since the person on the far left has a hobby of reading, and they're not eating lemon (clue 5 says the designer eats spinach), the person on the far left must be eating plum.

From clue 6, we know the colombian's hobby is skydiving, so they can't be on the far left. This means the colombian must be in position 2 or 3.

From clue 4, we know the fan of d&b is to the left of the colombian, so d&b must be in position 1 or 2. But since the person on the far left has a hobby of reading, and they're not listening to country (clue 8 says water-polo is to the left of country), the fan of d&b must be in position 1.

From clue 3, we know soy-milk is between italian and mirinda. Since the person on the far left drinks mirinda, and the colombian can't be drinking soy-milk (they drink something else, as indicated by the blank space), the italian must be in position 2, and they drink soy-milk.

From clue 5, we know the designer eats spinach, so they can't be in position 1 or 3. This means the designer is in position 2, but since the italian is already in position 2, this is a contradiction. We need to re-evaluate our assumptions.


Let's go back to clue 7 and assume the person eating lemon is actually in position 2. Then, the colombian can be in position 3, and they drink mirinda.

From clue 9, we know tennis (german) is to the left of the designer. Since the designer eats spinach, they can't be in position 1 or 3. This means the german must be in position 1, and they're not the designer.

From clue 2, we know weightlifting (mechanic) is in position 3, since it's the only remaining sport for the colombian.


Putting everything together:


The person on the far left drinks mirinda, eats plum, has a hobby of reading, listens to d&b, and has an unknown nationality.

The person in position 2 drinks soy-milk, eats spinach, has a hobby of skydiving, listens to dubstep, and is italian.

The person in position 3 drinks 7up, eats lemon, has a hobby of hiking, listens to country, and is colombian."	{'beverage': ['mirinda', 'soy-milk', '7up'], 'food': ['plum', 'spinach', 'lemon'], 'hobby': ['reading', 'skydiving', 'hiking'], 'job': ['accountant', 'mechanic', 'designer'], 'music-genre': ['d&b', 'dubstep', 'country'], 'nationality': ['italian', 'colombian', 'german'], 'sport': ['water-polo', 'weightlifting', 'tennis']}	True	14	False

Let's start by filling in the information from clues 1 and 11:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating kale is the owner of the hedgehog. Let's place kale in column 2:

| Sport         | swimming     | weightlifting | lacrosse   |
| Transport     | quad-bike    | bike          | taxi       |

#############

Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 4, we know juice is on the far right. Clue 3 tells us that water is associated with weightlifting.

Clue 10 states that the engineer eats strawberry, and since they can't be in column 3 (due to clue 1), they must be in column 1.

Using clue 7, we can determine the order of bike and 7up. Bike is between strawberry and 7up, so it's either in column 2 or 3. Since quad-bike is already in column 1, bike can't be there.

Clue 5 tells us that weightlifting (water) is between swimming and pop. Clue 6 says it's also between lacrosse and snake.

With clue 9, we know the journalist is to the right of indie. Since punk is to the right of indie (clue 8), the order for music-genre must be indie-punk-pop.

Using all these clues together, we can fill in the table:


From column 1: engineer eats strawberry and drives a quad-bike, drinks water, likes indie music, has a snake as a pet, and their sport is swimming.


From column 2: photographer eats onion and drives a bike, drinks 7up, likes punk music, has a mouse as a pet, and their sport is weightlifting.


From column 3: journalist eats eggplant and drives a taxi, drinks juice, likes pop music, has a horse as a pet, and their sport is lacrosse."	{'beverage': ['water', '7up', 'juice'], 'food': ['strawberry', 'onion', 'eggplant'], 'job': ['engineer', 'photographer', 'journalist'], 'music-genre': ['indie', 'punk', 'pop'], 'pet': ['snake', 'mouse', 'horse'], 'sport': ['swimming', 'weightlifting', 'lacrosse'], 'transport': ['quad-bike', 'bike', 'taxi']}	True	14	False

Lv2-7x3-7	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

| Pet           | dog       | goat    | pony               |
#############


Here's how I derived the solution:

From clue 1, we know that the person eating onion is on the far left (column 1).

Clue 3 tells us that the Thai person is between the woodworker and the fan of pop music. This implies that the woodworker must be in column 2 or 3.

Clue 4 states that the owner of the goat is the skydiver, so we can place the goat in column 2 (since the onion eater is already in column 1).

From clue 7, we know that the person eating onion (column 1) is on the left of the fan of rock music. This implies that the fan of rock music must be in column 2.

Now, let's use clue 6 to place the software developer: they eat pepper, so they can't be in column 1 (onion). They also can't be in column 3 (because of clue 3), so they must be in column 2. However, this would put them on top of the fan of rock music, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to swap columns 2 and 3.

Clue 5 tells us that the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the owner of the dog. This implies that the dog must be in column 3.

From clue 8, we know that the Italian person is on the left of the person watching sports movies. Since the person watching fantasy movies (column 1) can't watch sports movies as well, the sports movie fan must be in either column 2 or 3. But since the dog owner is already in column 3, the sports movie fan must be in column 2.

Finally, we use clue 2 to place the analyst: they are on the left of the fan of indie music. This means that the analyst can't be in column 1 (since there's no one to their right), so they must be in column 1 or 2. However, this would put them on top of the onion eater, which is not possible. Therefore, we need to place the analyst in column 1.

The rest of the table falls into place with some simple deductions and eliminations.
