Explanation:

From clue 11, the person watching western movies is on the far right. 
Combining with clue 1, the fan of ambient music is to the left of the person watching western movies. 

Clue 2 places the fan of reggae between the fan of ambient and the person drinking juice. Since the person watching western movies is also on the far right (clue 11), it means the fan of ambient cannot be in position 4, so they must be in either position 2 or 3.

However, clue 5 states that the owner of the rat is to the right of the person drinking iced-tea. If the fan of ambient were in position 2, there would not be enough space for the person drinking juice (clue 2), the owner of the rat, and the person watching western movies on the right side.

Thus, the fan of ambient must be in position 3. Clue 8 says that the person driving the motorbike drinks almond-milk, which places them in either position 1 or 2. However, if they were in position 1, there would not be enough space for the owner of the fish (clue 4), the fan of ambient, and the rest of the puzzle on the right side.

Thus, the person driving the motorbike must be in position 2. Since they drink almond-milk, this also places the beverage for that row (almond-milk).

From clue 6, the owner of the fish is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, which means the person drinking iced-tea cannot be in position 1. From clue 13, the videographer is to the left of the person drinking iced-tea, so they must be in position 2 or 3.

However, since the person driving the motorbike (almond-milk) is already in position 2, it means the videographer must be in position 1. Clue 12 places the dancer to the left of the fan of reggae, which puts them in either position 1 or 2. However, if they were in position 1, there would not be enough space for the videographer on the left.

So the dancer must be in position 2, but this is already occupied by the person driving the motorbike (almond-milk). This is a contradiction, so our previous conclusion that the fan of ambient is in position 3 must have been wrong.

Going back to clue 2 and re-evaluating it with all other clues shows that we made an incorrect assumption earlier. The correct placement for the fan of reggae and the person drinking juice relative to the fan of ambient remains, but their absolute positions change.

With this new information, we place the fan of ambient in position 2 (between the fan of reggae and the person drinking juice). Clue 4 places the owner of the fish on the left of the fan of ambient. The only available spot is now position 1, so the pet for that row is a fish.

The beverage for position 1 must be milk because almond-milk (motorbike) is in position 2 and iced-tea cannot be there due to clue 6.

From clue 10, the person who's sport is badminton watches romance movies. From clue 7, the owner of the bird is on the right of the person watching romance movies. However, since the fan of ambient (in position 2) and their beverage (almond-milk) are already determined, the person watching romance movies cannot be in position 1 or 2.

From clue 3, the fan of reggae is between the person watching comedy movies and the owner of the bird. Since we know the positions relative to each other for these three entities, but not their absolute positions, let's place them starting from the rightmost possible position for the owner of the bird (since it has to be on the right of the romance movie fan).

This means that if we try placing the person watching comedy movies in position 3 and fail, then they must be in a lower-numbered position.

From clue 9, the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the software-developer. If the software-developer were in position 1 or 2, there would not be enough space for all other entities (including western movies fan) to fit, so they must be in either position 3.

However, since we previously placed the person watching comedy movies as possibly being in position 3 and it conflicts with our new placement of software-developer here, then this is an error on our part. We have to start again from scratch.

Starting over: 

From clue 2, the fan of ambient is between the fan of reggae and the person drinking juice.
From clue 1, the person watching western movies is on the right of the fan of ambient.

Now let's look at clue 9. The person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the software-developer. If they are in positions 3 and 4 respectively, then that leaves only position 1 for the videographer (clue 13), which forces the owner of the fish into a non-existent fifth column.

This means the software-developer must be in either position 2 or 3. 

From clue 8, the person driving the motorbike drinks almond-milk.
If they are in position 1 and drink almond-milk, this would leave no space for the owner of the fish (clue 4), so they cannot be in that position.

If they were in position 2 and drank almond-milk, this would conflict with clue 13 since there is not enough space to place both the videographer and the person drinking iced-tea.
However, if the motorbike driver were in position 3, then we can fit the rest of the puzzle pieces. 

The motorbike driver drinks almond-milk (clue 8), so their beverage is determined.

From clue 9, the software-developer must be to the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
Since the motorbike driver occupies position 3 and has a sport of either badminton or golf (because lacrosse is taken by jet-ski in clue 15), then the only spot available for the software-developer is position 2.

From clue 12, the dancer must be to the left of the fan of reggae.
Since we know that the motorbike driver and software-developer are already in positions 3 and 2 respectively, this forces the dancer into position 1.

We have not yet determined what beverage is associated with the dancer. 

Now let's go back to clue 4: The owner of the fish must be on the left of the fan of ambient.
Since the dancer occupies position 1, then they are either a fish or there is an empty space in front of them for the fish.

If the dancer had a pet that wasn't a fish (let's say bird), this would mean that we have no room to place both the owner of the fish and the videographer. However, since the only possible positions left are 1 and the non-existent fifth column, then the dancer must own a fish (because there is no other option for where the fish could go).

The beverage associated with position 1 has not been determined yet.

Let's review our current progress:
- Motorbike driver in position 3
- Software-developer in position 2
- Dancer in position 1

We still need to figure out what beverages and pets are associated with positions 2 and 4."	{'beverage': ['milk', 'almond-milk', 'iced-tea', 'juice'], 'job': ['videographer', 'dancer', 'software-developer', 'coach'], 'movie-genre': ['romance', 'drama', 'comedy', 'western'], 'music-genre': ['funk', 'ambient', 'reggae', 'metal'], 'pet': ['fish', 'bird', 'rat', 'pony'], 'sport': ['badminton', 'lacrosse', 'rowing', 'golf'], 'transport': ['motorbike', 'jet-ski', 'trike', 'bike']}	True	9	False

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* Clue 10 helped establish the polish person driving the van (column 2).
* Clue 1 and 7 helped place the dancing hobbyist (column 3) to the right of volleyball and snowboarding.
* Clue 4 connected skiing with woodworking (column 4).
* Clue 5 and 16 established the pony owner's position between the project-manager and the person who's hobby is woodworking, which had to be column 4 due to other constraints.
* Clue 2 placed the polish person to the right of the hamster owner, which helped establish the nationalities.
* Other clues were used to fill in the gaps and ensure consistency.

| Transport     | bus        | roller       | taxi       | tram        |

Here's the explanation for each step:


From clues 4 and 5, we know that the manager is on the far left and watches documentary movies.


From clue 16, we know that the russian is also on the far left. Since there can only be one person on the far left, we conclude that the russian is the manager who watches documentary movies.


From clue 13, we know that the person watching documentary movies (russian) is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing.


From clue 8, we know that the bus driver is on the left of the person who's hobby is writing. Combining this with the previous step, we conclude that the russian drives a bus and has a hobby of reading (since it can't be writing or card-games), and the colombian (who is not the far left) drives a roller.


From clue 11, we know that the owner of the hedgehog is on the right of the manager. Combining this with the previous steps, we conclude that the colombian owns the hedgehog.


From clue 2, we know that the firefighter's sport is weightlifting.


From clue 17, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting (firefighter) is on the right of the person who's sport is water-polo.


From clue 10, we know that the nurse's sport is rowing. Since the nurse can't be on the far left (manager), the nurse must be in the second column.


Now we can start filling in the rest of the table:

| Transport     | bus        | roller       |            |             |

From clue 9, we know that the thai is between the owner of the ferret and the person who's sport is sailing.


Since the colombian owns the hedgehog (not ferret) and the russian owns the bus (not taxi), the thai must be in column 3. The only pet left for the thai is the ferret, so the person in column 4 must own a horse.


From clue 1, we know that the thai is on the left of the owner of the horse, which confirms our previous conclusion.


Now we can fill in the rest of the table:

From clue 15, we know that the person who's hobby is reading (russian) is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.


From clue 3, we know that the person driving a taxi is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Combining this with our previous steps, we conclude that the colombian drives a roller and has a hobby of card-games.


Finally, from clue 14, we know that the owner of the goldfish (colombian) drives a roller.

#############


Explanation:

From clue 1, we know the British person is on the left of the person watching animation movies. Since there are only four columns, this means the British person must be in column 3 and the person watching animation movies must be in column 2.

Clue 5 tells us that the person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the ferret, which means the person eating cauliflower is in column 3. From clue 6, we know the person watching satire movies is between the French and the person driving the helicopter. Since the British person is already in column 3, this must mean that the French person is in column 2.

Clue 7 tells us that the person driving the trike is on the right of the lawyer, which means the lawyer is in column 1 or 2. Clue 12 confirms that the lawyer is on the left of the person eating lettuce, so the lawyer must be in column 1 and the person eating lettuce must be in column 2.

From clue 8, we know the person eating pomegranate is on the right of the owner of the goat, which means the person eating pomegranate is in column 4. Clue 9 tells us that the person driving the ship is the owner of the goat, so the person driving the ship must be in column 3 or 4.

Clue 10 tells us that the doctor is on the left of the person driving the helicopter, which means the doctor is in column 1 or 2. Clue 11 confirms that the person who's sport is climbing is the police-officer, and clue 13 tells us that the writer is on the far right.

By combining these clues, we can deduce the remaining information:

* The person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person who's sport is cricket (clue 3), so they must be in column 4.
* The person watching satire movies is on the left of the person who's sport is skiing (clue 4), so they must be in column 2.
* The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the owner of the ferret (clue 5), which confirms that the person eating cauliflower is in column 3 and the owner of the ferret is in column 2.
* The person driving the trike is on the right of the lawyer (clue 7) and also on the right of the owner of the lizard (clue 14), so they must be in column 2 or 3.

With these deductions, we can complete the table as shown above."	{'food': ['pineapple', 'cauliflower', 'lettuce', 'pomegranate'], 'job': ['lawyer', 'police-officer', 'doctor', 'writer'], 'movie-genre': ['animation', 'satire', 'drama', 'adventure'], 'nationality': ['brazilian', 'french', 'british', 'egyptian'], 'pet': ['lizard', 'ferret', 'rabbit', 'goat'], 'sport': ['weightlifting', 'climbing', 'skiing', 'cricket'], 'transport': ['taxi', 'trike', 'helicopter', 'ship']}	True	6	False
