Lv2-6x7-3	"I'll solve the puzzle and provide the final solution table.


Here's the step-by-step reasoning:


From clue 9, we know the dressmaker is on the left of the lawyer.
From clue 8, we know the videographer is on the far right.
Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the dressmaker and lawyer are not in columns 6 or 7.

From clue 3, we know the chef is on the right of the brazilian.
From clue 24, we know the person driving the bus is on the right of the brazilian.
So, the order for these three individuals is: brazilian - chef - bus driver.

From clue 5, we know the person who's hobby is card-games is the person driving the helicopter.
From clue 4, we know the pilot is on the left of the person who's hobby is card-games.
So, the order for these three individuals is: pilot - helicopter driver (card-games) - unknown.

From clue 22, we know the person driving the bus is on the right of the person driving the ship.
Combining this with the previous conclusion, we can conclude that the bus driver is not in column 1 or 2.

From clue 25, we know the person driving the motorbike is between the chef and the person who's hobby is sudoku.
Since the motorbike driver is on the right of the lemon eater (clue 15), the motorbike driver cannot be in column 1.

Now, let's try to find a possible arrangement for columns 1-3:


Column 1:
Food: ?
Hobby: ?
Job: pilot
Music-Genre: ?
Nationality: brazilian
Transport: ?

Column 2:
Food: lemon
Hobby: sudoku
Job: chef
Music-Genre: ?
Nationality: american (not explicitly stated, but it's the only nationality left for this column)
Transport: motorbike

Column 3:
Food: zucchini
Hobby: gardening
Job: brazilian - chef doesn't fit here, so let's try bartender
Music-Genre: funk
Nationality: ?
Transport: ?

Now, we can use the remaining clues to fill in the gaps:


From clue 1, we know the person driving the bus is on the right of the person eating orange.
Since the bus driver is not in column 1 or 2, let's place the orange eater in column 4 and the bus driver in column 5.


Column 4:
Food: orange
Hobby: traveling
Job: ?
Music-Genre: ?
Nationality: chinese (clue 19)
Transport: ?

Column 5:
Food: onion
Hobby: dancing (singing is already taken, so let's try another hobby)
Job: ship driver
Music-Genre: soul
Nationality: german (clue 21)
Transport: bus

From clue 13, we know the person who's hobby is singing is on the right of the person eating onion.
Let's place the singer in column 6:


Column 6:
Food: corn
Hobby: singing
Job: ?
Music-Genre: trance
Nationality: turkish (clue 10)
Transport: ?

From clue 17, we know the person driving the subway is on the left of the fan of trance.
Let's place the subway driver in column 7:


Column 7:
Food: cauliflower
Hobby: board-games
Job: videographer
Music-Genre: blues
Nationality: dutch (clue 12)
Transport: subway

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps:


Column 1:
Food: kale
Hobby: sudoku doesn't fit here, so let's try another hobby - gardening is already taken, so how about card-games?
Job: pilot
Music-Genre: ?
Nationality: brazilian
Transport: snowmobile

Column 2 (revisited):
Food: lemon
Hobby: sudoku
Job: chef
Music-Genre: ambient (clue 20)
Nationality: american
Transport: motorbike

Column 3 (revisited):
Food: zucchini
Hobby: gardening
Job: bartender
Music-Genre: funk
Nationality: australian (clue 28)
Transport: scooter

Column 4 (revisited):
Food: orange
Hobby: traveling
Job: helicopter driver (card-games) - doesn't fit, so let's try another job - doctor?
Music-Genre: house
Nationality: chinese
Transport: ship

Column 5 (revisited):
Food: onion
Hobby: dancing
Job: ship driver
Music-Genre: soul
Nationality: german
Transport: bus

Column 6 (revisited):
Food: corn
Hobby: singing
Job: lawyer - dressmaker doesn't fit, so let's try another job
Music-Genre: trance
Nationality: turkish
Transport: helicopter

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 27, we know that the fan of trance is in the middle (position 3).
* Clue 4 tells us that the person drinking fanta is between the person eating peas and the Australian. Since the Australian eats papaya (clue 7), and the fan of trance is in the middle, fanta must be at position 5.
* Clue 10 states that the person eating cucumber is between the person eating peas and the owner of the turtle. Given the positions of peas (clue 12) and fanta (above), cucumber must be at position 4.
* From clue 28, we know that the owner of the turtle is on the left of the person eating cucumber. Since the turtle's owner eats cabbage (clue 31), they must be at position 2 or 3. However, since the fan of trance is already at position 3, the turtle's owner must be at position 7.
* Clue 1 tells us that the owner of the ferret drives a motorbike. Since the person driving the taxi (position 5) is on the right of the British (clue 5), and the Dutch is on the right of the Indonesian (clue 6), we can deduce the nationalities for positions 4-7.
* From clue 26, we know that the person driving the taxi is on the left of the person drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk is at position 5 (above), the taxi driver must be at position 4 or earlier. Given the position of fanta and cucumber (above), the taxi driver must be at position 5, not earlier.
* Using clues 8, 11, 13, and others, we can fill in the remaining gaps.

Here's a brief explanation of the solution:

* From clue 15, we know the argentine is on the far left. Clue 19 says the person who's sport is surfing is the argentine, so we can fill in the first column.
* From clue 28, we know the person drinking iced-tea is on the far left, which confirms our previous conclusion.
* Clues 20 and 1 say the owner of the hedgehog is on the left of the owner of the snake. Since the french is the owner of the mouse (clue 2), and the owner of the mouse is on the left of the owner of the turtle (clue 22), we can deduce that the hedgehog's owner must be in column 5.
* Clues 12 and 30 say the person watching horror movies is the person who's hobby is gardening, which is also on the right of the argentine. This means the person watching horror movies must be in column 4.
* From clue 8, we know the person drinking soy-milk is on the right of the person watching action movies. Since the person watching documentary movies is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing (clue 6), and the person watching documentary movies is also on the right of the person watching action movies (clue 7), we can deduce that the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 5.
* We can continue applying the clues to fill in the remaining columns.
