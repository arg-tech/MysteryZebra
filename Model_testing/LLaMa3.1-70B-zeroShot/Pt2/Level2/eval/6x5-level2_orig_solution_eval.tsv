#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps to solve the puzzle:

* Start with the most restrictive clues, such as #3 (Egyptian is fan of Soul) and #13 (Russian is fan of Electronic).
* Use clue #10 to place the person who's hobby is Chess on the left of the person eating Pomegranate.
* From clue #11, we know that the person driving the Motorbike is between the person eating Peach and the person eating Lettuce. This helps us place the person eating Peach in position 3.
* Clue #15 tells us that the owner of the Turtle is the person eating Peach, so we can fill in the Pet column for position 3.
* Continue using the clues to fill in the remaining positions, making sure to follow the restrictions imposed by each clue."	{'food': ['grapes', 'kale', 'peach', 'lettuce', 'pomegranate'], 'hobby': ['reading', 'rock-climbing', 'baking', 'skydiving', 'chess'], 'music-genre': ['electronic', 'hip-hop', 'salsa', 'soul', 'techno'], 'nationality': ['russian', 'mexican', 'egyptian', 'polish', 'indian'], 'pet': ['hamster', 'dog', 'turtle', 'cat', 'guinea-pig'], 'transport': ['jet-ski', 'taxi', 'motorbike', 'roller', 'van']}	True	9	False

#############
| Hobby         | singing   | traveling | card-games  | hiking     | fishing    |
| Job           | freelancer | designer  | lawyer      | doctor     | bartender |
| Music-Genre   | funk       | country   | blues       | reggae     | folk      |
| Pet           | bird       | mouse     | hedgehog   | horse      | frog      |
| Sport         | handball   | lacrosse  | ice-hockey  | swimming   | baseball  |
| Transport     | bus        | roller    | van         | ship       | helicopter|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

From clue 7, we know that the person driving the van is on the left of the person driving the bus. Combining this with clue 1 and 3, we can conclude that the person who enjoys card-games and swimming drives the van.

Clue 6 tells us that the person who enjoys singing drives the bus. Clue 9 reveals that this person is a fan of funk music.

From clue 16, we know that the owner of the frog is on the far right. Clue 5 places the person who enjoys handball to the left of the frog owner. Clue 15 positions the reggae fan to the left of the frog owner.

Clue 2 indicates that the lawyer is on the left of the ice-hockey enthusiast. Clue 12 reveals that the lawyer owns a hedgehog.

By combining clues 10, 13, and 17, we can determine the middle three columns: traveling (hobby), designer (job), country (music-genre), mouse (pet), lacrosse (sport), and roller (transport).

The remaining pieces can be filled in using the other clues.

Note: The solution is unique, and all the conditions are satisfied.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

I started by using clues that gave me direct information about specific positions (e.g., clue 6: person who's hobby is fishing is on the far left). Then, I used clues that related two or more attributes to each other (e.g., clue 1: person watching scientific movies is the person who's sport is surfing).

I gradually built up a partial solution by combining these clues. When I had enough information, I started using more nuanced clues that relied on relative positions (e.g., clue 2: person watching scientific movies is on the left of the person who's sport is lacrosse).

As I progressed, I made sure to check my work against all the other clues to ensure consistency and avoid contradictions."	{'food': ['lime', 'lemon', 'blueberry', 'nectarine', 'eggplant'], 'hobby': ['fishing', 'puzzles', 'chess', 'traveling', 'skydiving'], 'movie-genre': ['sports', 'scientific', 'fantasy', 'romance', 'horror'], 'music-genre': ['soul', 'ambient', 'classical', 'house', 'blues'], 'sport': ['lacrosse', 'surfing', 'skiing', 'snowboarding', 'parkour'], 'transport': ['airplane', 'helicopter', 'bus', 'boat', 'tram']}	True	12	False
Lv2-6x5-7	"After analyzing the clues, I was able to fill in the table as follows:

However, I noticed that clue #16 states that the person who's hobby is rock-climbing is in the middle (position 3), which contradicts the initial solution. Let me re-evaluate the clues.

After re-analyzing the clues, I came up with a revised solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |

| Transport     | quad-bike   | tram       | jet-ski      | helicopter  | boat       |

However, this solution still doesn't satisfy all the clues. After another re-evaluation, I found a new solution:


|               |     1      |    2     |       3       |      4      |     5      |
