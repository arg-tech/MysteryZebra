From clue 2, we know that the person who's sport is weightlifting is on the far left.
However, from clue 4, we also know that the person drinking water is on the far left.

Since there can only be one person on the far left, this means that the person who's sport is weightlifting must also be drinking water. So, the table now looks like this:


|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |  Water      |         |          |            |
| Sport      | Weightlift |         |          |            |

 

From clue 5, we know that the person drinking lemonade is between the person drinking juice and the person drinking cola.

Also, from clue 1, we know that the person drinking cola is on the right of the person who's sport is soccer.

Now, let's look at clue 3. It says that the person who's sport is soccer is between the person who's sport is ice-hockey and the person drinking juice.

Combining these clues, we can deduce the order of sports: weightlifting (already placed), then ice-hockey, then soccer, then cycling (the only one left).

The beverages are also almost fixed. We have water on the far left, then lemonade and cola (in some order), with juice between soccer and cycling.

Putting it all together:


|            |       1       |    2    |    3     |     4      |
| Beverage   |  Water      | Juice   | Lemonade | Cola       |
| Sport      | Weightlift | Ice-hockey| Soccer   | Cycling    |

Lv2-2x4-2	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian.

From clue 2, we know the video-gamer is at position 4.

From clue 3, we know the Dutch person is to the right of the British person.

From clue 4, we know the gardener is to the left of the British person.

Let's start by placing the gardener and the British person. Since the gardener is to the left of the British person, they must be in positions 1 and 2 or positions 2 and 3. We'll try both options:

 Option 1: Gardener (1), British (2)

From clue 3, we know the Dutch person is to the right of the British person, so the Dutch person must be at position 3.

Now, from clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. Since there's no space left for the Turkish person, this option doesn't work.

 Option 2: Gardener (2), British (3)

From clue 3, we know the Dutch person is to the right of the British person, so the Dutch person must be at position 4. But wait, from clue 2, we know the video-gamer is at position 4! This means the gardener and the British person can't be in positions 2 and 3.

Let's try again:

 Option 3: Gardener (1), British (3)

From clue 3, we know the Dutch person is to the right of the British person, so the Dutch person must be at position 4. But again, from clue 2, we know the video-gamer is at position 4!

 Option 4: Gardener (3), British (4)

This won't work because the video-gamer is already assigned to position 4.

Let's try:

 Option 5: Gardener (1), British (2), Dutch (3)

Now, from clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. The only space left for the Turkish person is at position 2, but that's already occupied by the British person.

Let's try:

 Option 6: Gardener (1), Dutch (2), British (3)

Now, from clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. The only space left for the Turkish person is at position 4, but that's already occupied by the video-gamer.

Let's try:

 Option 7: Gardener (2), Dutch (3), British (1)

No, this won't work because the gardener can't be to the right of the British person.

 Option 8: Gardener (3), Dutch (4), British (2)

No, this won't work because the video-gamer is already assigned to position 4.

 Option 9: Gardener (1), Turkish (2), Colombian (3)

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. So, the reader must be at either position 1 or position 2. Since the gardener is already at position 1, the reader can't be there.

 Option 10: Gardener (1), Reader (2), Turkish (3)

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. So, the Colombian must be at either position 4 or a position to the right of the Turkish person. Since there's no space left for the Colombian, this option won't work.

 Option 11: Gardener (2), Reader (1)

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. So, the Colombian must be at either position 3 or a position to the right of the Turkish person. The only space left for the Turkish person is at position 3.

 Option 12: Gardener (2), Reader (1), Turkish (3)

Now we have:

Gardener (2)
Reader (1)
Turkish (3)

From clue 4, we know the gardener is to the left of the British person. So, the British person must be at either position 3 or a position to the right of the gardener. Since the Turkish person is already at position 3, the British person can't be there.

 Option 13: Gardener (2), Reader (1), Colombian (4)

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. So, the Turkish person must be at either position 2 or a position to the left of the Colombian. Since the gardener is already at position 2, this option won't work.

 Option 14: Gardener (2), Reader (1), British (3)

No, this won't work because the Turkish person can't be between the reader and the Colombian.

 Option 15: Gardener (2), Reader (1), Dutch (4)

From clue 2, we know the video-gamer is at position 4. So, this option won't work.

Let's try:

 Option 16: Gardener (1), British (3), Turkish (2)

No, this won't work because the reader can't be between the gardener and the Turkish person.

 Option 17: Reader (1), Gardener (2), Colombian (4)

From clue 1, we know the Turkish person is between the reader and the Colombian. So, the Turkish person must be at either position 2 or a position to the left of the Colombian. Since the gardener is already at position 2, this option won't work.

 Option 18: Reader (1), Gardener (2), British (3)

From clue 4, we know the gardener is to the left of the British person. So, this option works!

Now, from clue 3, we know the Dutch person is to the right of the British person. The only space left for the Dutch person is at position 4, but that's already occupied by the video-gamer.

 Option 19: Reader (1), Gardener (2), British (3), Video-games (Dutch)

No, this won't work because the Dutch person can't be a video-gamer.

Let's try:

 Option 20: Reader (Colombian) (1), Turkish (2), Gardener (British) (3)

No, this won't work because the gardener can't be British.

 Option 21: Reader (Turkish) (1), Colombian (2), Gardener (3), British (4)

No, this won't work because the Turkish person is not between the reader and the Colombian.

 Option 22: Reader (British) (1), Colombian (2), Turkish (3), Video-games (Dutch) (4)

No, this won't work because the British person can't be a reader.

 Option 23: Gardener (Turkish) (1), Reader (Colombian) (2), British (3)

No, this won't work because the gardener can't be Turkish.

 Option 24: Colombian (Reader) (1), Turkish (2), British (Gardener) (3)

Lv2-2x4-3	"Let's break down the clues and fill in the table step by step.


From clue 3, we know the British is on the far left:


|               |    1    |      2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food          |         |             |        |            |
| Nationality   | British |             |        |            |

From clue 5, we know the person eating corn is the French:


|               |    1    |      2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food          |         |             | Corn   |            |
| Nationality   | British |             | French |            |

From clue 2, we know the Colombian is between the British and the person eating corn (who is the French). Since the British is on the far left, the Colombian must be in position 2:


|               |    1    |      2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food          |         |             | Corn   |            |
| Nationality   | British | Colombian  | French |            |

From clue 4, we know the French is on the left of the person eating cranberry. Since the French is in position 3, the person eating cranberry must be in position 4:


|               |    1    |      2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food          |         |             | Corn   | Cranberry  |
| Nationality   | British | Colombian  | French |            |

From clue 1, we know the Colombian is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the Colombian is in position 2, the person eating kale must be in position 1:


|               |    1    |      2      |   3    |     4      |
| Food          | Kale    |             | Corn   | Cranberry  |

The only remaining food is cauliflower, which must be in position 2:

| Food          | Kale    | Cauliflower| Corn   | Cranberry  |

Lv2-2x4-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#################
|         |   1   |   2    |     3      |    4     |
| Pet     | rat   | cat    | pony       | lizard  |
| Sport   | rugby | basketball | tennis | biathlon |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:

From clue 3, we know the person who's sport is biathlon is on the far right, so that goes in position 4.

Clue 2 tells us the owner of the cat is between the person who's sport is basketball and the owner of the rat. This means the cat cannot be in position 1 or 4 (since there would not be space for both basketball and rat), so it must be in either position 2 or 3.

Clue 4 says the owner of the cat is on the right of the person who's sport is rugby. If the cat were in position 3, then rugby would have to be in position 1 or 2, but this would not leave space for both basketball and rat (as per clue 2). Therefore, the cat must be in position 2.

Now we can use the information from clue 2 again: since the cat is in position 2, the person who's sport is basketball must be in either position 1 or 3. But if basketball were in position 3, then rugby would have to be in position 1 (to satisfy clue 4), which would not leave space for tennis and biathlon. Therefore, basketball must be in position 1.

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is biathlon owns the lizard, so that goes with the biathlon in position 4.

The only remaining pet is the pony, which must go with the remaining sport, tennis, in position 3.

Finally, the rat must be in position 1 (since basketball is already there), and rugby must be paired with it.

This gives us the final solution table:


#################
|         |   1   |   2    |     3      |    4     |
| Pet     | rat   | cat    | pony       | lizard  |
| Sport   | rugby | basketball | tennis | biathlon |

Lv2-2x4-5	"Based on the clues, I've solved the puzzle:


|            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |
| Beverage   |              |          |           |               |
| Hobby      |              |          |           |               |

Solution:

|            |      1       |    2     |     3     |       4       |
| Beverage   | hot-chocolate| fanta    | iced-tea  | soy-milk     |
| Hobby      | magic-tricks | dancing  | skydiving | card-games   |

Here's how I arrived at the solution:


* From clue 2, we know that magic-tricks is on the far left. Let's place hot-chocolate as their beverage (since it's not specified otherwise).
* From clue 3, we know that card-games is on the far right.
* From clue 4, soy-milk must be between card-games and dancing. Since dancing can't be on the far right, it must be in position 2 or 3.
* From clue 1, fanta must be to the left of iced-tea. If we place fanta in position 2 (next to magic-tricks), then iced-tea would have to be in position 3, which leaves dancing with no available space between card-games and soy-milk.
* Therefore, fanta can't be next to magic-tricks. Let's place it in position 2 instead. Then, we can put dancing in position 1 is already taken by magic-tricks), so dancing goes in position 3 (leaving space for soy-milk).
* Since fanta is now in position 2, and the person drinking soy-milk must be between card-games and dancing, soy-milk must go to the right of dancing. This places it next to card-games.
* Finally, the only beverage left for position 4 (card-games) is actually not important; we can put any remaining beverage here since the puzzle doesn't specify a unique beverage-card-game pairing.

Lv2-2x4-6	"Let's analyze the clues:

From clue 3, we know the fan of salsa is on the far right, so it must be in column 4.

From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is rowing is a fan of salsa, and since salsa is on the far right (column 4), rowing must also be in column 4.

From clue 1, we know the person who's sport is rowing is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour, so parkour must be in column 3.

Now, let's look at the music-genres:

From clue 5, we know the fan of pop is between the fan of classical and the fan of d&b. Since salsa is already on the far right (column 4), pop must be in either column 1 or 2.

From clue 4, we know the fan of d&b is the person who's sport is cycling. Cycling can't be in column 3 (since parkour is there) and can't be in column 4 (since rowing is there). So, cycling must be in either column 1 or 2.

Considering clue 5 again, if pop were in column 1, classical would have to be on the far left, which means d&b (and cycling) would be in column 3, but that's already occupied by parkour. Therefore, pop must be in column 2.

So, we can now fill in some of the table:


|               |    1    |       2       |     3     |   4    |

| Sport         |         |               | Parkour   | Rowing |

Now, we can fill in the remaining blanks:

From clue 1, we know that the gospel fan drives a bus.


Clue 2 states that the roller driver is on the left of the bus driver (gospel fan). This means:


|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Music-Genre   |        | Gospel |            |            |
| Transport     | Roller | Bus    |            |            |

Clue 3 states that the snowmobile driver is on the right of the electronic fan.


Clue 5 states that the electronic fan is between the bus driver (gospel) and the house fan. Since the roller driver is already on the left, this means:


|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Music-Genre   |        | Gospel | Electronic | House      |
| Transport     | Roller | Bus    |            |            |

Now, using clue 3 and the fact that the snowmobile driver is on the right of the electronic fan:


|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4      |
| Music-Genre   |        | Gospel | Electronic | House      |
| Transport     | Roller | Bus    |            | Snowmobile|

Finally, using clue 4 (the motorbike driver is on the left of the snowmobile driver), we can fill in the remaining space:


|               |   1    |   2    |     3      |     4      |

From clue 4, we know that the person driving the helicopter is on the far right, so:

| Transport   |          |               |            | Helicopter |

From clue 1, we know that the person driving the helicopter is also the person who's sport is lacrosse:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   |          |               |            | Helicopter |

From clue 3, we know that the person who's sport is biathlon is on the far left:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Sport       | Biathlon |               |            | Lacrosse   |
| Transport   |          |               |            | Helicopter |

From clue 2, we know that the person driving the motorbike is between the person who's sport is soccer and the person driving the roller. Since the person driving the helicopter (lacrosse) is on the far right, the person driving the motorbike cannot be on the far left or far right. Therefore:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   |          | Motorbike     | Roller      | Helicopter |

Now, we know that the person who's sport is soccer must be either on column 1 or column 2. If it were on column 1, then biathlon and soccer would be adjacent, which doesn't allow for motorbike to be between soccer and roller. Therefore:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |

| Transport   |          | Motorbike     | Roller      | Helicopter |

The only remaining sport is weightlifting, which must be on column 3:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Sport       | Biathlon | Soccer        | Weightlift | Lacrosse   |
| Transport   |          | Motorbike     | Roller      | Helicopter |

The only remaining transport is snowmobile, which must be on column 1:


|             |    1     |       2       |     3      |     4      |
| Sport       | Biathlon | Soccer        | Weightlift | Lacrosse   |
| Transport   | Snowmobil | Motorbike     | Roller      | Helicopter |

So the solution is:

#############

| Sport       | Biathlon | Soccer        | Weightlift | Lacrosse   |
| Transport   | Snowmobil | Motorbike     | Roller      | Helicopter |

Lv2-2x4-9	"Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 1, we know the order is: ..., Boat, Librarian, Dressmaker, ...

From clue 4, we know the order is: Boat, Van, ...

Combining these two clues, we get: Boat, Van, Librarian, Dressmaker, ...

From clue 2, we know the person driving the van is on the left of the dressmaker, so this order is correct.

From clue 3, we know the videographer is on the right of the dressmaker.

From clue 5, we know the dressmaker is on the left of the person driving the ship.

Now, let's fill in the table:


|             |      1       |     2     |     3      |      4       |
| Job         |              |           |            |              |
| Transport   | Boat         | Van        | Librarian  | Ship         |

The only job left for position 1 is Entrepreneur (since the others are already assigned), and the only job left for position 4 is Videographer.

So, the final solution table is:


#############

| Job         | Entrepreneur | Librarian  | Dressmaker | Videographer|
| Transport   | Boat         | Van        | Scooter    | Ship         |

Lv2-2x4-10	"Let's break down the clues:

From clue 1, we know that Ice-Hockey is to the right of Plum.

From clue 3, we know that Avocado is to the right of Garlic.

From clue 5, we know that Ice-Hockey is between Garlic and Tennis.

Combining these clues, we get:
Garlic - Ice-Hockey - Tennis (since Ice-Hockey is between Garlic and Tennis)
Plum - ??? - ??? (since Ice-Hockey is to the right of Plum)

We also know that Avocado is to the right of Garlic, so:

Garlic - Avocado - ??? - ???

Combining these two sequences:
Garlic - Avocado - Ice-Hockey - Tennis
Plum - ??? - ??? (to the left of the previous sequence, since Ice-Hockey is to the right of Plum)

From clue 2, we know that Swimming is to the right of Peach.

We also know that Swimming is to the right of Ice-Hockey (from clue 4).

Since Avocado is already placed in the third column, Peach must be in the second column:

Plum - Peach - ??? - ???

Combining this with the previous sequence:
Plum - Peach - Garlic - Avocado - Ice-Hockey - Tennis

The only sport left for Plum-Peach is Swimming or Baseball. Since Swimming is to the right of Peach and also to the right of Ice-Hockey, it can't be paired with Plum. Therefore:

Plum - Baseball
Peach - Swimming
