Lv2-1x6-2	"A nice logic puzzle!


Let's analyze the clues:


From clue 3, we know that ambient is on the far right.


From clue 4, we know that rock is to the left of ambient.


From clue 1, we know that electronic is to the left of rock.


So, we have: ... electronic, rock, ambient


Now, let's look at clues 2 and 6. They both say that funk is between reggae and trance, but in opposite orders. This means that funk cannot be on either end (because then it wouldn't be ""between"" the other two). So, we have: ... electronic, rock, ?, funk, ?, ambient


From clue 5, we know that electronic is to the right of reggae.


So, we can place reggae on the left: reggae, electronic, rock, ?, funk, ?, ambient


The only one left is trance. It must be between funk and ambient (from clue 2).


Here's the final solution:

Lv2-1x6-3	"Based on the given clues, let's analyze and fill in the table:


Clue 1: The person eating cranberry is between the person eating cabbage and the person eating spinach.
This means that cabbage and spinach cannot be at positions 3 or 4 (since there needs to be space for cranberry), and also not adjacent to each other.

Clue 2: The person eating cauliflower is on the right of the person eating cabbage.
This implies that cabbage cannot be in position 5 or 6, as it would leave no room for cauliflower.

Combining Clues 1 and 2, let's consider placing cabbage. If we put cabbage at position 1, there's enough space for cranberry and spinach to its right, and also room for cauliflower.

Clue 3: The person eating grapefruit is on the far right.
Grapefruit must be in position 6.

Clue 4: The person eating grapefruit is on the right of the person eating cauliflower.
This implies that cauliflower cannot be at positions 5 or 6, as it would conflict with grapefruit being in position 6. Cauliflower should be to the left of grapefruit, but not directly adjacent (since cabbage needs to come first).

Given these constraints and clues, let's construct a possible solution:


|        |     1      |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |     6      |
| Food   |            |         |           |         |             |            |

A possible arrangement that satisfies all the conditions is:

|        |     1      |    2    |     3     |    4    |      5      |     6      |
| Food   | cabbage  | cauliflower | cranberry | spinach | strawberry | grapefruit |
#############


This solution meets all the given conditions:

* Cranberry is between cabbage and spinach (clue 1).
* Cauliflower is to the right of cabbage (clue 2).
* Grapefruit is on the far right (clue 3).
* Grapefruit is to the right of cauliflower, with strawberry filling in the gap (clue 4)."
Lv2-1x6-4	"After analyzing the clues, I arrived at the following solution:


#############
|       |  1  |   2    |    3     |  4   |  5   |   6    |
| Pet   | Goat| Lizard | Goldfish | Bird | Rat  | Turtle |

#############


Here's how I solved it:

From clue 2, we know the turtle is on the far right (column 6).

Clue 4 states that the owner of the turtle is on the right of the owner of the goat. This means the goat must be in column 1 or 5. However, if the goat were in column 5, there would not be enough space for the goldfish and bird to fit between columns 3 and 5 (as required by clue 3). Therefore, the goat is in column 1.

From clue 1, we know the owner of the goldfish is on the right of the owner of the lizard. This means the lizard must be in either column 2 or 4.

Clue 3 states that the owner of the bird is between the owner of the goldfish and the owner of the goat. Since the goat is already in column 1, this means the bird cannot be on the right of the goldfish (it would not fit). Therefore, the bird must be on the left of the goldfish.

Putting it all together:

* Column 6: Turtle
* Column 5: We can't put the rat here because we don't have enough information yet. Let's move to column 4.
* Column 4: Since the lizard is on the left of the goldfish (clue 1), and the bird is between the goat and the goldfish, the only spot for the lizard is column 2. This means the rat can go in column 5.

So, the final solution table is:

From clue 4, we know that the Russian is on the left of the Italian. Since the Canadian is already on the far right, this means:

From clue 2, we know that the Russian is on the right of the Colombian. This means:

Clue 3 states that the writer is between the project-manager and the designer. Since the project-manager is already in position 2 (to the right of the engineer), the writer must be in position 3.

Now, clue 1 says the designer is between the chef and the writer. With the writer in position 3, the designer can only fit in position 4.

Clue 2 states that the chef is between the designer and the bartender. Since the designer is in position 4, the chef must be in position 5.

Finally, clue 5 says the bartender is on the right of the chef, so the bartender must be in position 6.

From clue 5, we know that action movies are at position 6 (far right).

Clue 4 tells us that family movies are to the left of action movies, so family movies must be at position 5.

Now, let's focus on the superhero movies. Clues 1 and 2 imply that superhero movies are between spy movies and epic movies, with superhero movies being closer to epic movies (since it's on the left of epic). However, clue 3 states that superhero movies are on the right of spy movies, which means superhero movies cannot be directly next to spy movies. This creates a contradiction unless... 

Superhero movies are at position 4, spy movies are at position 2 or 3 (but not directly next to superhero), and epic movies are also at either position 2 or 3.

Since time-travel movies (clue 6) must be on the left of spy movies, we can place them at position 1. This forces spy movies to position 2 (as there's no other option for spy movies).

Finally, epic movies go to position 3.
