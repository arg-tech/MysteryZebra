Lv2-6x4-2	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |     1     |      2      |     3      |      4      |

| Transport     | Bus        | Bike        | Ship        | Train       |

#############

Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 1, we know the German is between the person who skydives and the person driving a bike.

From clue 2, we know the Pakistani is on the left of the person watching time-travel movies.

From clue 4, we know the German is also between the person drinking almond-milk and the person driving the ship.

Combining clues 1 and 4, we can deduce that the German must be in position 3.

From clue 10, we know the person who plays chess is on the far left (position 1).

From clue 14, we know the person drinking Fanta is on the left of the German, so they must be in position 2.

Using clue 5, we can determine that the fan of disco (who drinks Fanta) is also watching time-travel movies. Since the Pakistani is to their left (clue 2), the Pakistani must be in position 1, but this contradicts clue 10. Therefore, the Pakistani must be in position 4, and the person who plays chess is indeed in position 1.

From clue 6, we know the fan of folk is on the far right (position 4).

Using clue 11, we can determine that the fan of disco (who drinks Fanta) is also watching time-travel movies. Since this is already determined to be in position 2, we can move on.

From clue 3, we know the person who writes is to the left of the Canadian. Since the German is in position 3, and there's only one spot to the left of them (position 2), the person who writes must be in position 1 or 2. However, since chess is already determined to be in position 1, the person who writes must be in position 2.

From clue 8, we know the person driving a ship is between the person watching action movies and the person who writes. Since the German is in position 3, and there's only one spot between positions 2 and 4 (position 3), the person who writes must watch thriller movies. Using clue 9, this confirms that the person who writes watches thriller movies.

From clue 12, we know the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person who makes films.

Using clue 13, we can determine that the Malaysian is on the right of the person driving a bus.

The remaining clues (7) can be used to fill in the gaps:

* The fan of electronic must be between the person making films and the person playing chess.
* Since the person drinking soy-milk is to the left of the person making films, they must drink soy-milk.

With all the clues accounted for, we arrive at the final solution table."

6. The owner of the rat is on the far right (clue 6) => column 4 has rat
7. The person driving the van is between the mexican and the person drinking tea##2 (clue 7) => column 3 has van, but since it's between mexican and tea, mexican must be in column 1 or 2
8. The person drinking hot-chocolate is the owner of the hamster (clue 8) => one of the columns has hot-chocolate and hamster
9. The person drinking 7up is between the person driving the van and the owner of the guinea-pig##2 (clue 9) => column 4 has guinea-pig, so 7up must be in column 3 or 4, but since tea is already in column 3, 7up must be in column 4
10. The person who's sport is soccer is on the left of the person who's sport is handball (clue 10) => one of the columns has soccer and handball
11. The person drinking tea is the person driving the subway (clue 11) => one of the columns has tea and subway

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 9, we know that the person drinking mirinda is on the far left.
* From clue 13, we know that the person drinking hot-chocolate is on the left of the argentine. Since the argentine is also on the right of someone (clue 5), this means that the person drinking hot-chocolate must be in position 3, and the argentine must be in position 4.
* From clue 1, we know that the dutch person drinks fanta, which means that the dutch person cannot be in position 1 or 3. Therefore, the dutch person must be in position 4 is not possible, so it must be in position 2 or 3 but from other clues we can see that dutch is on the far right and also in position 3.
* From clue 5, we know that the argentine person's sport is surfing. Since the person who's sport is volleyball is on the far right (clue 7), this means that the argentine person must be in position 4.
* Clues 6 and 12 help us to figure out the transport for each column: colombian left of quad-bike, subway on the right of collecting hobby and helicopter is on the far right. 
* The rest of the puzzle can be solved by using the remaining clues to eliminate possibilities.

From clue 13, the engineer is on the left of the person who's sport is baseball.

From clue 2, the argentine is on the left of the british.
Since the pakistani (fisherman) is already on the far left, the argentine and british must be in columns 2 and 3.

From clue 1, the person who's hobby is sudoku is between the person who's sport is surfing and the person drinking juice.


Since the person drinking juice (skydiving) is in column 3, and there are only two columns left, the person who's hobby is sudoku must be in column 4.

From clue 3, the owner of the goldfish is between the canadian and the person who's hobby is cooking.


Since there are only two columns left for nationality (column 2 has argentine), the canadian must be in column 4. This also means that the person who's hobby is sudoku is not canadian.


|               |       1       |     2     |    3     |     4      |

From clue 3, the owner of the goldfish is between the canadian and the person who's hobby is cooking.


The only available pet for column 2 is goldfish (since column 1 has chinchilla and column 4 will have a different pet), so:


|               |       1       |     2     |    3     |     4      |

| Sport         |               | surfing   | basketball|          |

The only available job for column 4 is engineer.


From clue 13, the person who's hobby is sudoku has a pet which is not goldfish or cat. The only option left is rat.


From clue 14, the person who's sport is surfing has a pet which is not chinchilla, cat or rat. This means that column 2 will have a different pet, but we've already placed goldfish there.

Lv2-6x4-8	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Nationality   | italian    | nigerian    | japanese | thai       |
| Pet           | snake      | goat        | ferret   | frog       |
| Transport     | trike      | tram        | helicopter| bike       |


Here's how I arrived at the solution:

From clue 4, we know that the person watching fantasy movies is the Italian. From clue 1, we know that the person driving the tram is between the person driving the trike and the person watching fantasy movies.

From clue 8, we know that the person who's hobby is hiking is between the Italian and the person driving the trike. Since the Italian is watching fantasy movies, the person with the hobby of hiking must be on the left of the Italian.

From clue 2, we know that the owner of the frog is the Thai. From clue 13, we know that the person who's hobby is skydiving is on the left of the Thai. This means that the person with the hobby of skydiving must be in position 3.

From clue 9, we know that the designer is the person who's hobby is skydiving.

From clue 7, we know that the musician is on the right of the Thai. Since the Thai is watching zombie movies (not explicitly stated, but inferred from other clues), the musician must be in position 2.

From clue 12, we know that the Nigerian is on the right of the writer. This means that the writer must be in position 1, and the Nigerian in position 2.

The rest of the clues can be used to fill in the remaining information:

* The person who's hobby is woodworking is on the right of the owner of the snake (clue 10), which means that the owner of the snake is in position 1.
* The owner of the ferret is on the right of the person who's hobby is hiking (clue 6), which means that the owner of the ferret is in position 3.
* The person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching zombie movies (clue 5), which means that the person watching horror movies is in position 2.

The final solution table is:
