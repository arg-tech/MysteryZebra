| Sport         | Rugby        | Golf       | Tennis      | Skateboarding| Ice-hockey    | Badminton  |

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* First, I focused on the constraints related to positions (e.g., ""the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of..."").
* Next, I used the hobby-related constraints to place Fishing and Camping in odd positions.
* Then, I used the food-related constraints to place Avocado in an odd position and Avocado being next to Skydiving.
* After that, I applied the movie-genre constraints to determine the order of Spy, Superhero, and Western movies.
* The music-genre constraints helped me identify the Videographer as a fan of Reggae and the Writer as a fan of Rock.
* Finally, I filled in the remaining gaps using the pet-related, job-related, and sport-related constraints.

Please note that this solution assumes that each person has only one hobby, job, movie genre preference, music genre preference, pet, and sport. If there are any ambiguities or inconsistencies, please let me know so we can revisit the puzzle together.
