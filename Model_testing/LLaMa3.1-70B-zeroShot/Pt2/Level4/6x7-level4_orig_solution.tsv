| Sport         | volleyball | badminton  | sailing   | skateboarding| baseball      | soccer    | parkour     |

 

Here's the explanation of how I solved it:


From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is parkour is on the far right. Clue 21 tells us that this person is also on the right of the american.

Clue 31 tells us that the person watching horror movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since parkour is on the far right, and horror movies can't be in position 7 (because crime movies are to its right), it must be in position 6.

From clue 11, we know that the person watching horror movies is on the left of the person watching crime movies, so crime movies must be in position 7. Clue 2 tells us that the person watching action movies is between the argentine and the person watching adventure movies, so action movies can't be in position 1 (because there's no room for adventure movies). Since action movies are also on the left of japanese (clue 6), it must be in position 3.

From clue 32, we know that the person watching adventure movies is on the left or right of the american. Since american is already to the left of parkour, and adventure movies can't be to its right (because action movies are there), it must be in position 2.

Clue 1 tells us that the person watching superhero movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is sailing. Clue 8 also tells us that this person is on the left or right of the person drinking tea. From clue 3, we know that the person drinking iced-tea is in an odd position, so it can't be the one drinking tea (since that would leave superhero movies with no options). Therefore, the person watching superhero movies must be to the left of the person who's sport is sailing.

From clue 9, we know that the person who's sport is badminton is on the left of the person drinking tea. Clue 10 tells us that this person is also on the left of the person drinking soy-milk (since classical music is to its right).

Clue 16 tells us that the manager is in an even position, and clue 15 tells us that the fan of electronic is in an even position. Since there are only two even positions left (4 and 6), and the fan of jazz is on the left or right of the lawyer (clue 19), it must be that the manager is in position 4, and the fan of electronic is in position 6.

The rest of the table can be filled in using the remaining clues.


Note: This solution assumes that ""left"" and ""right"" are used consistently throughout the puzzle. If this is not the case, there may be multiple solutions or no solution at all."
