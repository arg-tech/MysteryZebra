Lv4-5x3-2	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | potato     |  orange  | lemon       |

Wait, no! The nigerian is supposed to be in an even position (clue 4). Let me try again:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |

| Movie-Genre   | sports      | comedy    | spy         |
| Nationality   | colombian   | nigerian | american    |

Nope, still not correct. The person eating lemon is supposed to be on the right of the person who's hobby is fishing (clue 3). Let me try again:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | potato     | lemon    | orange      |

Hmm... The person watching sports movies is between the person eating orange and the mechanic (clue 8). Let me try again:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |
| Food          | potato     | lemon    | orange      |

| Movie-Genre   | sports      | comedy    | spy         |
| Nationality   | colombian   | nigerian | american    |

The person watching comedy movies is the person who's hobby is woodworking (clue 6). The pilot is on the left or right of the person watching comedy movies (clue 7). Let me try again:


|               |      1      |    2     |      3      |

Lv4-5x3-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:


#############

|               |    1    |      2      |      3       |
| Beverage      | Fanta   | Almond-milk | Iced-tea     |
| Food          | Plum    | Kiwi        | Grapes       |
| Hobby         | Baking  | Magic-tricks| Camping      |
| Nationality   | British | Australian  | Japanese     |
| Transport     | Ship    | Boat        | Bike         |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I solved the puzzle:

* Clue 3 places Fanta on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 4 places the person eating grapes in position 2 or 3, and since they drive a bike, they must be in position 3.
* Clue 6 places the Japanese person in an odd position, which means they must be in either position 1 or 3. However, clue 1 says they are on the far right, so they must be in position 3.
* Clue 5 places the Australian to the left or right of the Japanese, so they must be in position 2.
* Clue 7 and 8 place the person with a hobby of baking in an odd position (1 or 3) and next to someone drinking almond-milk. Since almond-milk can't be on the far left (Fanta is), it must be in position 2, which means baking must be in position 1.
* Clue 9 places the person driving a boat between the person who's hobby is magic-tricks and the person drinking fanta. This means magic-tricks must be in position 2, and since Fanta is already in position 1, the person driving a boat must be in position 2 as well.
* Clue 2 places the person eating kiwi to the left of the person driving a bike (in position 3). Since grapes are eaten by the person in position 3, kiwi must be eaten by the person in position 1."
Lv4-5x3-4	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:


#############

|               |     1     |       2        |      3       |
| Food          | Pineapple | Artichoke    | Corn         |
| Job           | Musician  | Police-officer| Entrepreneur  |
| Movie-Genre   | Adventure | Fantasy       | Epic         |

| Transport     | Bus        | Quad-bike     | Snowmobile   |

#############

Here's a brief explanation of the reasoning:

* From clue 2, we know that Pineapple is on the left of Fantasy movies. This means that Fantasy must be in position 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person driving the quad-bike watches Fantasy movies. Since Quad-bike is an odd-positioned transport (clue 7), it must be in position 2 as well.
* From clue 3, we know the Entrepreneur is on the far right, so they must be in position 3.
* Clue 8 tells us that Volleyball is between Quad-bike and Artichoke. Since Quad-bike is already placed in position 2, Volleyball must be in position 1 (left of Quad-bike).
* From clue 4, we know the Police-officer is on the right of Surfing. This means Surfing cannot be in position 3 (far right), so it must be in position 2 or 1. However, since Volleyball already occupies position 1, Surfing must be in position 2, and Police-officer must be in position 3.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person driving the Bus is on the left or right of the person who's sport is Volleyball. Since Volleyball is already placed in position 1, Bus must be in position 1 as well (left of Volleyball).
* From clue 9, we know Adventure movies are on the left or right of Pineapple. This means that Adventure movies cannot be in position 3 (far right), so they must be in position 1.
* The only remaining movie genre is Epic, which must go to position 3.

The rest of the clues can be used to confirm this solution or make further deductions if needed."
Lv4-5x3-5	"Let's break down the clues:


From clue 2, we know the person who's sport is handball is on the far left.
From clue 7, we know the person who's hobby is dancing is on the far left.
Combining these two clues, we can conclude that the person who's hobby is dancing and sport is handball is on the far left.


From clue 4, we know the fan of ambient is the person who's sport is handball.
So, the person on the far left prefers ambient music.


From clue 5, we know the person who's sport is handball is the person watching western movies.
So, the person on the far left prefers western movies.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | dancing     |              |            |

| Music-Genre   | ambient     |              |            |
| Sport         | handball    |              |            |


From clue 6, we know the person watching superhero movies is between the person who's sport is handball and the fan of country.
Since the person on the far left prefers western movies, the person in position 2 must prefer superhero movies.


From clue 1, we know the bartender is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
The person in position 1 has a sport of handball, so the bartender must be in position 1 or 2. However, since the person in position 1 already has a hobby and music-genre filled in, the bartender must be in position 2.


From clue 8, we know the bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies.
The bartender is in position 2, so the social-worker must be in position 1 or 3. However, since the person in position 1 already has a job filled in (as the leftmost person), the social-worker must be in position 3.


Now, let's fill in the table:


|               |       1       |      2       |     3      |
| Hobby         | dancing     |              |            |

| Music-Genre   | ambient     |              |            |
| Sport         | handball    |              |            |


From clue 3, we know the person who's hobby is collecting is in an odd position.
The only odd position left is position 1 or 3. However, since the person in position 1 already has a hobby filled in (dancing), the person with the hobby of collecting must be in position 3.


From clue 8, we know the bartender is between the social-worker and the person watching epic movies.
Since the social-worker is in position 3, the person watching epic movies must also be in position 3. However, this creates a conflict since the person in position 3 already has a hobby filled in (collecting). To resolve this, we can swap the positions of the social-worker and the person with the hobby collecting.


Now, let's fill in the table:

| Sport         | handball    |              |            |


From clue 6, we know the person watching superhero movies is between the person who's sport is handball and the fan of country.
Since the person in position 2 prefers superhero movies, the person in position 1 or 3 must prefer country music. However, since the person in position 1 already has a music-genre filled in (ambient), the person in position 3 must prefer country music.


From clue 1, we know the bartender is on the left of the person who's sport is rowing.
The bartender is in position 2, so the person with the sport rowing must be in position 3.

| Transport   | Jet-ski    | Tram     | Taxi             |


Here's the explanation for each step:


1. From clue 6, the person who's sport is snowboarding (broccoli) is on the far right, so position 3.
2. From clue 5, broccoli is also the favorite food of the person whose sport is snowboarding.
3. From clue 8, the owner of the horse is eating broccoli, which confirms the pet for the snowboarder.
4. From clue 7, eggplant is eaten by the paramedic, who must be in position 2 (since the engineer eats radish and is not on the far right).
5. From clue 3, the jet-ski driver is on either end, but since broccoli's owner is already on the far right, the jet-ski driver is on the far left.
6. From clue 9, tram is to the right of goldfish's owner, so they are in positions 1 and 2 respectively (since taxi is also not at position 1).
7. The remaining sport (cricket) goes with the paramedic.
8. The software-developer eats radish, which is confirmed by clue 4.

From clue 8, we know the person watching epic movies is on the far left.

| Sport         |              |           |            |

From clue 6, we know the fan of metal is eating watermelon.


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |
| Food          | Kiwi/Lettuce | Watermelon|            |

From clue 2, we know the person watching spy movies is on the right of the person eating watermelon. But since metal fan is eating watermelon (clue 6), this means spy movie fan must be in position 3.


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

From clue 1, we know the person eating kiwi is in an odd position. Since epic movie fan is already in position 1, this means kiwi must be eaten by the person in position 3 or not at all. However, from clue 5, we know spy movie fan (position 3) has snowboarding as their sport on the right. This doesn't leave enough space for another food item. Thus, the only possible conclusion is that kiwi is eaten by the person in position 1.


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

| Sport         |              |           |            |

From clue 3, we know spy movie fan (position 3) is on the right of the brazilian. However, this would mean that brazilian must be in position 2 or not at all. If brazilian were in position 1, then it would contradict with kiwi being eaten by person in position 1.


|               |      1       |     2     |     3      |

From clue 7, we know italian is on the right of spy movie fan. This means italian must be in position 3 or not at all.

From clue 4, we know the fan of funk is between epic movie fan and basketball fan. Since epic movie fan is in position 1, this means funk must be the music-genre for person in position 2.

Lv4-5x3-9	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Music-Genre   | Indie       | Dubstep     | Soul        |
| Sport         | Basketball  | Handball    | Weightlifting|
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 8, we know that the fan of indie music is on the far left. This means that position 1 has Indie as their Music-Genre.
* From clue 7, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is also a singer. Since they have to be in position 1 (due to clue 4 and the fact that Electrician is mentioned), this means that Singing is their hobby.
* Clue 6 tells us that the person who's sport is basketball watches scientific movies, so Scientific is the Movie-Genre for position 1.
* From clue 2, we know that the electrician is on the right of the person who's sport is weightlifting. Since Electrician is already in position 1 (due to clue 4), this means that Weightlifting must be in position 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that the designer is in an even position, which means they can only be in position 2 or none at all (since there are only three positions). We'll place them in position 3 for now and adjust later if needed.
* From clue 4, we know that the person who's sport is basketball is the electrician. This confirms our earlier placement of Electrician in position 1.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person watching romance movies is between the person who's sport is basketball (position 1) and the person who's hobby is collecting. Since collecting can't be in position 1, this means that Collecting must be in position 2 or 3. We'll place it in position 2 for now.
* From clue 1, we know that the fan of dubstep watches romance movies. This means that Dubstep is in position 2 (since Romance is already there).
* Clue 6 confirms our earlier placement of Scientific as the Movie-Genre for position 1.
* Finally, we can fill in the remaining gaps: Handball is in position 2 for Sport, and Magic-Tricks is in position 3 for Hobby. Soul is also in position 3 for Music-Genre.

The final solution table should be:

| Sport         | water-polo| volleyball | baseball     |

 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

1. From clue 6, we know the fan of r&b is on the left of the person who's hobby is puzzles. Since the fan of r&b is in an odd position (clue 3), they must be in position 1. Therefore, the person with puzzles as a hobby is in position 2 or 3.

2. From clue 2, we know the person who's hobby is puzzles is also watching superhero movies.

3. From clue 4, we know the owner of the mouse is playing baseball.

4. From clue 5, we know the fan of folk is on the left of the person watching documentary movies.

5. From clue 7, we know the person who's sport is water-polo is on the right of the fan of folk.

Putting all these clues together, I arrived at the solution above.
