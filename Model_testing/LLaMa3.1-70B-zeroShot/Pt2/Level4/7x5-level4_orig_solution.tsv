Lv4-7x5-2	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Sport         | rowing        | skateboarding| sailing   | snowboarding | volleyball |

Let me know if you'd like me to explain the reasoning behind each step.


#############

Here's a brief explanation of the key steps:

* The lizard owner is on the far left (rule 7) and watches time-travel movies (rule 15).
* The person drinking lemonade is on the left of the fan of ambient (rule 13), which means the teacher (fan of ambient, rule 9) is not in position 1.
* The accountant is on the right of the fan of jazz (rule 18), but we don't know where the fan of jazz is yet. We do know that the accountant is a fan of d&b (rule 4).
* The person who's sport is snowboarding is between the person who's hobby is hiking and the person watching epic movies (rule 3). Since the person watching epic movies is on the far left or far right (rule 23), this means the snowboarder must be in position 5.
* The owner of the horse is on the right of the person watching scientific movies (rule 6) and watches epic movies (rule 26).
* The person drinking juice is in the middle (rule 20), which helps us place some other people relative to them.

Using these clues, we can start filling in more details and eventually arrive at the solution. Let me know if you'd like a more detailed walkthrough!"
Lv4-7x5-3	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution for the puzzle:

| Transport     | motorbike     | scooter       | boat        | jet-ski   | ship        |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

1. From clue 3, we know that the owner of the bird is on the far left.
2. From clue 14, we know that the owner of the bird drinks hot-chocolate, and from clue 22, they watch disaster movies.
3. From clue 5, we know that the chinese person is either to the left or right of the bird's owner, but since the canadian person is on the far left (clue 15), the chinese person must be in column 2.
4. We can then use clues 1 and 13 to determine the order of sports: handball, biathlon, cricket, snowboarding, tennis.
5. Clues 6 and 23 tell us that the boat and jet-ski are in odd positions, so they must be in columns 3 and 5 (or vice versa). From clue 17, we know the boat is on the right of cherry, which means it's in column 3.
6. Using clues 19, 20, and 26, we can determine that the person driving the scooter owns a goat and drinks mirinda.
7. Clue 25 tells us that soy-milk is to the left of tomato, so the person drinking soy-milk must be in column 4.
8. From clue 10, we know that the japanese person is either to the left or right of the martial-arts movie fan. Since the chinese person is already in column 2, the japanese person must be in column 5.
9. The remaining clues can then be used to fill in the remaining gaps.

Please note that this solution assumes that each clue is consistent with all other clues and doesn't lead to any contradictions."

Please note that there might be other possible solutions, but this is one of the valid ones.


The steps to arrive at this solution are:


1. From clues 7 and 14, we know the paramedic is on the far right with a fish as pet.

2. Clue 11 tells us the videographer is on the right of the person drinking water.

3. With clue 4, we can place the videographer to the left of the person drinking 7up.

4. From clues 15 and 25, we know the person drinking cola is in the middle and has woodworking as a hobby.

5. Clue 16 tells us the person drinking fanta is on the left of the person eating apricot, which means the person drinking fanta cannot be on position 1 or 2 (as there would not be space for the person eating apricot). 

6. From clue 3, we know that the roller is on the right of the woodworking hobby.

7. Clue 12 tells us that the watermelon-eating person drives a train.

8. With clues 9 and 19, we can place the watermelon-eater (train driver) between the asparagus eater and the fan of rock.

9. From clue 18, we know the fan of dubstep is camping hobbyist.

10. Clue 24 tells us that fanta drinker = fan of dubstep, so fanta-drinker must be on position 2 or 4 to satisfy this constraint.


Using these steps and solving the puzzle iteratively by filling in the possible options we arrive at a solution given above.

Lv4-7x5-8	"After analyzing the given clues, I came up with a possible solution for the logic puzzle. Here's the completed table:


|               |     1      |    2     |      3      |     4     |     5     |

| Sport         | cycling    | sailing   | handball    | swimming  | biathlon   |

Let me explain some of the key deductions:


* From clue 17, we know the person who's sport is cycling is on the far left (position 1).
* Clue 19 tells us that the person drinking sprite is the dutch. Combining this with clue 14, we can conclude that the german is in position 3.
* From clue 7 and 25, we know the argentine is eating pepper and owns a fish. Since the owner of the fish is the fan of disco (clue 22), the argentine must be the fan of disco as well.
* Clue 1 tells us that the fan of classical is on the right of the person who's sport is sailing. Combining this with clue 2, we can conclude that the fan of classical is in position 4.
* Using clue 12 and 23, we can determine that the person drinking cola is in position 2.
* Clue 5 tells us that the fan of soul is on the left of the fan of country. Combining this with clue 15, we know the fan of soul is the person who's sport is swimming, which must be in position 4 (since it's not possible for them to be in an even position, as per clue 9).
* The remaining positions and values can be filled in using the other clues.

Please note that this solution might not be unique, and there could be alternative arrangements of the table that satisfy all the given clues. However, this is one possible solution that seems to work.
