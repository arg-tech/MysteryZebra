#############

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve it:

* From clue 7, we know the person watching comedy movies is on the far left (position 1).
* From clue 6, we know the person watching fantasy movies is on the left of the person who's hobby is cooking. This means position 2 is fantasy and position 3 is cooking.
* From clue 11, we know the person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person who's hobby is writing. Since volleyball can't be in position 1 (comedy), it must be in position 4 or 5. But from clue 10, we know the person watching scientific movies is the person who's sport is volleyball, and since scientific can't be in position 2 (fantasy) or 3 (family), it must be in position 4 or 5.
* From clue 5, we know the person watching adventure movies is on the right of the person who's sport is volleyball. Since adventure can't be in position 1 (comedy) or 2 (fantasy), and volleyball is already in position 4, adventure must be in position 5.
* The rest of the puzzle falls into place with some careful reasoning about the remaining clues.

2. The helicopter is matched with golf.
3. Lemonade is in the middle (position 3).

5. Cola is between the helicopter and water, but since cola is already on the left of water, this condition becomes redundant.
6. Subway is on the far left.
7. Lemonade is to the right of swimming.
8. Basketball is on the far right (initially stated, but then corrected by statement 11).
9. Skateboarding is in an even position (2).
10. Iced-Tea is matched with tram.
11. Basketball is matched with subway and moved to the far left.
12. Taxi is between golf and tram.

Lv4-3x5-4	"I'll guide you through solving this logic puzzle step by step.


First, let's analyze the given information and fill in the table accordingly.

From clue 5, we know that fantasy is on the far right (position 5).

| Transport     |          |        |         |        |         |

From clue 11, epic is on the far left or far right. Since fantasy already occupies the far right (position 5), epic must be on the far left.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     |        |         |        | Fantasy|

| Transport     |          |        |         |        |         |

Now, let's consider the pets. From clue 9, we know that the owner of the mouse is in an even position (2 or 4). We'll come back to this later.


From clue 4, the hamster is on the left or right of the cat. Let's place them for now without specifying their exact positions.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     |          |        |         |        |         |

From clue 6, the cat is on the left or right of epic movies. This means the cat must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     |          |        |         |        |         |

Now, let's consider the transport. From clue 7, the boat is on the right of the car.


From clue 1 and 3, we know that the person driving the car is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster and also on the left or right of the person watching horror movies.

Let's place the car for now without specifying its exact position.


|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     |          | Car?   | Boat?   |        |         |

From clue 2, the subway is on the left or right of the van.


We also know that the van is in an odd position (clue 10). This means the van must be in either position 1, 3, or 5. However, since epic and fantasy already occupy positions 1 and 5, the van must be in position 3.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     | Van      | Car?   | Boat?   | Subway?| Taxi?  |

Now, let's fill in the remaining gaps.


The mouse is in an even position (clue 9), which means it must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the cat already occupies position 2, the mouse must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     | Van      | Car?   | Boat?   | Subway?| Taxi?  |

From clue 8, the cat is on the left of the person driving the taxi.


The person driving the car is on the left or right of the owner of the hamster (clue 1). This means the car must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the mouse already occupies position 4, the car must be in position 2.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     | Van      | Car    | Boat?   | Subway?| Taxi    |

The boat is on the right of the car (clue 7). This means the boat must be in position 3.

| Transport     | Van      | Car    | Boat    | Subway?| Taxi    |

From clue 12, the hedgehog is on the left of the person watching spy movies.


We can place the hedgehog in position 1 and spy movies in position 2. However, since epic already occupies position 1, we'll swap them.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |

| Transport     | Van      | Car    | Boat    | Subway?| Taxi    |

The only remaining movie-genre is sports, which can be placed in position 3.

| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Spy    | Sports  | Horror?| Fantasy|
| Pet           | Hedgehog| Cat    | Hamster | Mouse  |         |
| Transport     | Van      | Car    | Boat    | Subway?| Taxi    |

The only remaining pet is the bird, which can be placed in position 5.


The subway must be on the left or right of the van (clue 2). Since the van occupies position 1 and the car occupies position 2, the subway must be in position 4.

|               |    1     |   2    |    3    |   4    |    5    |
| Movie-Genre   | Epic     | Spy    | Sports  | Horror?| Fantasy|
| Pet           | Hedgehog| Cat    | Hamster | Mouse  | Bird    |
| Transport     | Van      | Car    | Boat    | Subway | Taxi    |

The only remaining movie-genre is horror, which can be placed in position 4.

Lv4-3x5-5	"Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

From clue 4, we know the Malaysian likes Trance.

From clue 1, we know the Scooter driver likes Trance, so the Scooter driver must be Malaysian.

From clue 6, we know the Indie fan is in the middle (position 3).

From clue 2, we know the Train driver is on either side of the Jazz fan. Since Indie is in position 3, the Train driver and Jazz fan must be in positions 2 and 4 (in some order).

From clue 5, we know the Snowmobile driver is between the Airplane driver and the Trance fan (Malaysian). Since the Malaysian likes Trance and drives a Scooter, this means the Snowmobile driver must be to the right of the Malaysian.

Now let's start filling in the table:

From clue 8, we know the Airplane driver is to the right of the Italian. From clue 10, we know the Italian is to the left of the Airplane driver.

From clue 7, we know the American is to the left of the Brazilian.

Now let's fill in the remaining gaps:

|               |     1     |     2      |    3     |     4     |    5    |

No, this can't be correct... the Ship driver is supposed to be in an even position (clue 3).

Let's try again:

Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to arrive at this solution:

* From clue 3, the person who's hobby is puzzles is in an odd position. Since there are only two odd positions (1 and 3 or 5), and from clue 8, the person who's hobby is hiking is on the far right, the person with puzzles as a hobby must be in position 3.
* From clue 4, the person who's hobby is puzzles is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Since the person with puzzles is in position 3, the person with parkour must be in either position 2 or 4.
* From clue 7, the person watching thriller movies is on the left or right of the person who's sport is parkour. Given that the person with puzzles is already in position 3 and has a different movie genre (thriller), the person with thriller must be next to the person with parkour. Therefore, the person with thriller must be in either position 2 or 4.
* From clue 5, the person watching martial-arts movies is in an odd position. Since positions 1 and 3 are already occupied by reading and puzzles respectively, the person with martial-arts must be in either position 5 or... actually, it can only be in position 5 because of clue 8.
* From clue 6, the person watching romance movies is on the right of the person who's hobby is reading. Given that the person with reading is already in position 1, the person with romance must be in either position 2 or 3. However, since the person with puzzles is already in position 3 and has a different movie genre (thriller), the person with romance must be next to the person with reading. Therefore, the person with romance must be in position 2.
* From clue 10, the person who's hobby is reading is on the left of the person who's sport is swimming. Given that the person with reading is already in position 1, the person with swimming must be in either position 2 or 3. However, since the person with romance is already next to the person with reading and has a different sport (biathlon), the person with swimming must be next to the person with reading.
* From clue 9, the person watching action movies is between the person who's hobby is filmmaking and the person who's sport is snowboarding. Given that the person with romance is already in position 2 and has a different movie genre (martial-arts), the person with action must be next to the person with fishing.
* The rest of the clues can be filled in accordingly.

Note: This solution assumes that there are no duplicate hobbies, movie genres, or sports."
Lv4-3x5-7	"After analyzing the given clues, I have arrived at a possible solution:

| Music-Genre   | pop    | blues   | salsa    | ambient    | hip-hop |
| Transport     | tram   | roller  | bike     | skateboard | ship    |

Let me walk you through the reasoning process:

From clue 7, water is on the far left or right. Since it's not possible to be in position 5 (from clue 4), it must be in position 1.

From clue 10, tram is on the far left or right. Given that water occupies position 1, tram must be in position 1 as well. This means water and tram are associated with person 1.

Clue 8 tells us lemonade is in the middle, which means it's in either position 2 or 3. But clue 6 states that lemonade is to the left of soy-milk, so lemonade must be in position 2, and soy-milk in position 3.

From clue 5, salsa is associated with bike. Clue 3 tells us bike is on the right of ambient, but since ambient can't be in position 1 (due to water) or position 5 (due to hip-hop), it must be in position 4. This means salsa and bike are associated with person 3.

Clue 11 states blues is associated with roller. Since roller is in an odd position (clue 2), it can only be in positions 1, 3, or 5. However, these positions are already occupied by tram, bike, and ship (by elimination). Therefore, roller must be in position 2.

Now we know person 2 has blues as their music-genre and roller as their transport method. We also know that the fan of ambient is on the right of the bike (clue 3), which means ambient can only be associated with person 4.

Clue 9 tells us skateboard is to the left of coffee, so these two must occupy consecutive positions. Since there's no space for them in positions 1-4, they must be associated with persons 4 and 5, respectively.

Finally, from clue 12, tram is on the left or right of pop. This means pop can only be associated with person 2 (left of tram) or person 3 (right of tram). However, position 2 is occupied by blues, so pop must be in position 1, which doesn't work since water is already there. Therefore, pop must be in a different row.

After trying different combinations and eliminating possibilities based on the given clues, we arrive at the final solution:

Note: The numbers and positions are based on the given clues.

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:

* From clue 1, the freelancer is in position 1.
* Clue 4 places the electrician to the right of the freelancer, so the electrician is in position 2 or further right. But from clue 8, the fan of blues (sudoku) must be to the right of the electrician, and since the freelancer is already in position 1, the electrician must be in position 2.
* Clue 5 says the fan of r&b is collecting, so they must be in position 2.
* From clue 6, the fan of blues (sudoku) can't be in position 1 or 2. With the electrician already in position 2, and from clue 3, rock-climbing is between entrepreneur and sudoku, we deduce that sudoku is in position 4.
* Clue 7 states the fan of blues (sudoku) is to the right of the electrician, which confirms sudoku's position in 4. Rock-climbing must then be in position 3, with entrepreneur either before or after rock-climbing. However, since freelancer is already in position 1, and clue 9 restricts puzzles to either end, and we've used up one of those spots for the freelancer, puzzles can't fit anywhere else but position 5.
* Clue 10 puts punk in an even position. Given that blues (sudoku) is in position 4, and techno must be after r&b (clue 2), metal can only go with rock-climbing, leaving punk for the freelancer (position 1).
* Finally, bartender fits into the remaining spot for collecting.
* Entrepreneur then takes the remaining job slot.

Putting it all together, we get the final table above."
Lv4-3x5-9	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with the following solution:

Here's the step-by-step solution:

From clue 3, the owner of the goat is drinking fanta. Since the owner of the goat is on the far left or far right (clue 5), and hot-chocolate is already assigned to position 5, the owner of the goat must be in position 1.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |

| Pet           | goat   |             |       |         |               |

From clue 1, the person drinking almond-milk is a fan of metal. Since the owner of the rabbit is in an odd position (clue 10) and on the far left or far right (clue 11), and position 5 is already occupied by hot-chocolate, the owner of the rabbit must be in position 1 or 3. But position 1 is already taken by the goat, so the rabbit's owner must be in position 3.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |

| Pet           | goat   |             | rabbit|         |               |

From clue 2, the fan of jazz is the owner of the rabbit. So, the music genre for position 3 is jazz.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |

| Pet           | goat   |             | rabbit|         |               |

From clue 6, the fan of disco is drinking cola. From clue 8, the owner of the cat is also drinking cola. So, positions 2 and 4 must have cola as their beverage.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |

| Pet           | goat   | cat         | rabbit|         |               |

From clue 4, the owner of the frog is on the left of the fan of disco. Since position 2 has cola and is occupied by the fan of disco, the frog's owner must be in position 1 or have mirinda as their beverage (to be on the left). But position 1 is already taken by the goat, so the frog's owner must have mirinda.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |

| Pet           | goat   | cat         | rabbit| frog    |               |

From clue 9, the fan of reggae is in an odd position. The only available odd position is 1 or 5, but position 1 is already taken by fanta and the goat. So, the fan of reggae must be in position 5.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |
| Beverage      | fanta  | cola        | mirida| cola    | hot-cho        |
| Music-Genre   |        |             | jazz  |         | reggae         |
| Pet           | goat   | cat         | rabbit| frog    |               |

From clue 7, the owner of the rabbit is on the right of the person drinking mirinda. Since the rabbit's owner is in position 3, and the person drinking mirinda is also in position 3 (but actually it should be in position 2 or 4 since it is not assigned), we can conclude that the person drinking almond-milk must be in position 2, because it is on the left of the rabbit's owner.

|               |   1    |      2      |   3   |    4    |       5       |
| Beverage      | fanta  | almond-milk | mirida| cola    | hot-cho        |
| Music-Genre   | metal  |             | jazz  |         | reggae         |
| Pet           | goat   | mouse       | rabbit| frog    | cat            |

Finally, the only available beverage is left for position 2, which is almond-milk. The music genre of country is assigned to position 4 (the only available option), and the pet mouse is assigned to position 2.

Lv4-3x5-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a solution:

|               |      1      |     2     |     3      |     4     |       5        |

#############


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at the solution:

* From clue 3, we know the journalist is in the middle (position 3).
* Clue 6 and clue 8 imply that the owner of the dog is between the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the chinchilla.
* Since the journalist is in position 3, and the owner of the dog is between two people, the owner of the dog must be in either position 2 or 4. But clue 6 also implies that the owner of the dog is on the left of the person watching comedy movies, so the owner of the dog must be in position 2.
* Clue 9 states that the owner of the hedgehog is on the left or right of the owner of the chinchilla. Since the owner of the chinchilla can only be in an odd position (clue 7), and the owner of the dog is already in position 2, the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 1.
* Clue 8 also implies that the person watching documentary movies is on one side of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is in position 2, the person watching documentary movies must be in either position 1 or 3. But clue 6 states that the owner of the dog is between the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the chinchilla. Therefore, the person watching documentary movies must be in position 1.
* Clue 11 states that the scientist is on the left of the owner of the goldfish. Since the scientist watches satire movies (clue 4), they cannot be in position 1 (because it's already occupied by someone who watches documentaries). Therefore, the scientist must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the journalist is in position 3, and the scientist must be on the left of the owner of the goldfish, the scientist must be in position 2.
* Now we have a problem - we've already assigned the owner of the dog to position 2! This means that our initial assumption about the owner of the dog was wrong. The correct assignment is that the owner of the chinchilla is in position 1, and the person watching documentary movies is on one side of the owner of the dog.
* Let's re-evaluate clue 8: ""the owner of the dog is between the person watching documentary movies and the owner of the chinchilla"". This means that the person watching documentary movies must be either in position 1 or 3. Since we already have someone assigned to position 1 (the owner of the chinchilla), the person watching documentary movies must be in position 3.
* Clue 6 states that the owner of the dog is on the left of the person watching comedy movies. Therefore, the owner of the dog must be in either position 2 or 4.
* We already have someone assigned to position 2 (the scientist), so the owner of the dog must be in position 4.
* Clue 5 states that the person watching western movies is on the far right. This means that they are in position 5. Clue 10 also states that the security-guard is the person watching western movies, so we can assign them to position 5.
* Now we have most of the positions filled:
	+ Position 1: owner of the chinchilla
	+ Position 2: scientist (satire)
	+ Position 3: person watching documentary movies
	+ Position 4: owner of the dog
	+ Position 5: security-guard (western)
* The only job left is the electrician, which must be in position 3.
* Clue 1 states that the person watching comedy movies is on the left or right of the owner of the dog. Since the owner of the dog is in position 4, and we already have someone assigned to position 5, the person watching comedy movies must be in either position 2 or 3. But since the scientist watches satire movies (clue 4), they cannot watch comedy movies. Therefore, the person watching comedy movies must be in position 3.
* This leaves us with one final job: the mechanic. They can only be in position 1.

After filling out all the positions, we arrive at the solution table:
