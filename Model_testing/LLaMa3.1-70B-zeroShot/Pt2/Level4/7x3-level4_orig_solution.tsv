Lv4-7x3-1	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with the solution:

| Beverage      | Fanta    | Soy-milk | Hot-Chocolate     |

| Nationality   | Japanese | Mexican  | Russian           |
| Pet           | Ferret   | Bird     | Snake             |

The explanations for the solution are as follows:

* From clue 4, the dancer is the russian.
* From clue 2 and 10, the manager must be on the left or right of the russian, so the manager is in position 2.
* From clue 1 and 9, the person eating nectarine (ambient fan) is between the japanese and the country music fan. This means the japanese is in position 1.
* From clue 7, the person eating plum is on the left or right of the mexican, so the mexican must be in position 2 (since position 3 is already taken by the russian).
* Clue 11 states that the owner of the bird is between the thriller fan and the russian. Since the thriller fan is in position 3 (clue 8), this means the bird owner is in position 2.
* From clue 12, the bird owner is on the right of the ferret owner, so the ferret owner must be in position 1.
* Clue 5 states that the bird owner is between the person eating plum and the person drinking soy-milk. Since the plum eater is in position 3 (due to the mexican's placement), this means the soy-milk drinker is in position 2, which conflicts with our previous conclusion. However, we can resolve this by swapping the positions of the mexican and the bird owner's original positions.
* Clue 13 states that the snake owner drinks hot-chocolate, so the person drinking hot-chocolate is the snake owner.
* The remaining positions are filled in accordingly.

#############

Here's how the clues fit:


* Clue 1: The designer is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is traveling (designer is in position 1, and traveling is in position 3).
* Clue 2: The owner of the frog is on the left or right of the owner of the turtle (frog is in position 2, and turtle is in position 3).
* Clue 3: The owner of the turtle is in an odd position (turtle is in position 3, which is an odd number).
* Clue 4: The accountant is the owner of the turtle (accountant is in position 3, which matches the turtle's position).
* Clue 5: The person who's sport is swimming is the chinese (swimming is in position 3, and chinese is also in position 2 initially, but clue 14 indicates that chinese should be in an odd position. Revisiting clue 10, we see that chinese is actually the accountant).
* Clue 6: The australian is on the left of the person eating onion (australian is in position 3, which doesn't fit, so we swap positions 2 and 3 for australian and chinese. Now, australian is indeed to the left of onion-eater spanish).
* Clue 7: The person who's sport is baseball is the person eating apple (baseball is in position 2, and apple is also in position 2).
* Clue 8: The fan of hip-hop is in the middle (hip-hop is in position 2).
* Clue 9: The person eating apple is on the right of the fan of folk (apple is in position 2, and folk is in position 1. Apple is to the right of folk's owner spanish).
* Clue 10: The chinese is the accountant (chinese is indeed the accountant in position 3).
* Clue 11: The person who's hobby is chess is the spanish (chess is in position 2, and spanish is also in position 1 initially. We need to adjust this based on other clues).
* Clue 12: The accountant is on the left or right of the musician (accountant is in position 3, and musician is in position 2).
* Clue 13: The person who's sport is swimming is on the far right (swimming is indeed on the far right in position 3).
* Clue 14: The chinese is in an odd position (chinese is indeed in position 3 initially. However, we've already determined that chinese should be the accountant, and accountant is also in position 3. This clue helps solidify this connection).
* Clue 15: The owner of the frog is the owner of the frog (this clue doesn't provide any additional information)."
Lv4-7x3-3	"I'll help you solve the puzzle.


After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a solution:


#############

|               |    1     |     2     |        3        |
| Beverage      | lemonade |   juice   |       fanta      |

| Job           | engineer | paramedic | project-manager |
| Music-Genre   |   jazz    |   salsa    |     hip-hop     |
| Nationality   | german   | malaysian |      nigerian    |
| Pet           |    cat    |   frog    |       snake      |
| Transport     |    bike   | taxi      |        van       |

#############


Let me walk you through the steps:


From clue 12, we know the person driving the bike is on the far left (position 1).
Clue 9 tells us the owner of the frog is also on the far left (position 1). So, the combination for position 1 is: lemonade, cabbage, engineer, jazz, german, cat, bike.

From clue 4, we know the person eating watermelon drives a van. Since the person eating watermelon is also next to the malaysian (clue 8), and the nigerian is on the far right (clue 3), we can deduce that the malaysian must be in position 2.

Now, looking at clue 7, we see that the person eating cabbage is to the left of the person driving the van. Since we've already established the person driving the van eats watermelon, this means the person eating cabbage (german) must be in position 1, and the person eating watermelon (project-manager) must be in position 3.

Clue 2 tells us the person drinking juice is in an even position (2 or none of these options are given but it could still work since we have more information to work with). Given this and our existing combinations, the only option for position 2 is: juice, watermelon, project-manager, salsa, malaysian, snake, van.

The last remaining person must be in position 3. Clue 5 tells us the fan of salsa is on the far right, but we've already established this to be incorrect (since salsa can only fit into position 2). However, from clue 1 and 5, it's now safe to assume that hip-hop should go with nigerian as they are a more likely combination. Clue 11 tells us the engineer is on the left of the paramedic, so we'll put the paramedic in position 3.

Combining all this information, our solution becomes:

|               |    1     |     2     |        3        |

Lv4-7x3-4	"After solving the logic puzzle, I came up with the following solution:

| Beverage      | iced-tea   | water       | coffee      |

| Sport         | sailing    | basketball  | rugby       |
| Transport     | scooter    | train       | airplane    |
#############


Here's a brief explanation of the steps I took to solve the puzzle:

* From clue 1 and 3, we know that the scientist eats grapefruit and prefers sailing.
* From clue 7, we know that the person eating grapefruit drives the scooter.
* From clue 10, we know that the person eating grapefruit drinks iced-tea.
* From clue 11, we know that the colombian drives the scooter, which means they must be in column 1 and eat grapefruit.
* From clue 8, we know that the dutch watches comedy movies, which must be in an even position (clue 9). Since the colombian is in column 1, the dutch must be in column 2.
* From clue 4, we know that the mechanic is to the right of the person watching comedy movies, so they must be in column 3.
* From clue 6, we know that the mechanic prefers rugby.
* From clue 5, we know that the person watching documentary movies is to the right of the person drinking water. Since the colombian drinks iced-tea and the dutch watches comedy, the person drinking water must be in column 2, which means they watch documentary movies.
* From clue 9, we know that the person eating peach is in an even position, so they must be in column 2.
* The remaining movie-genre (musical) and nationality (british) can be placed in the remaining positions.

Lv4-7x3-5	"After analyzing the clues, I've come up with a possible solution:


|               |     1     |        2        |     3      |
| Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening       | Singing    |

| Sport         | Water-polo| Soccer          | Basketball |
| Transport     | Bus       | Scooter         | Tram       |

Here's how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 6, the fan of classical is on the far left or far right. Since there are only two possibilities for the far right (singing hobby), and singing is already placed on the far right, the fan of classical must be on the far left.


From clue 8, the person watching animation movies is driving the bus. This means that the person with the chess hobby (far left) is also driving the bus.


Now, from clue 3, the person watching spy movies is on the left of the fan of classical. But since the fan of classical is already placed on the far left, this implies that the person watching spy movies must be in position 2 or 3. However, from clue 7, the project-manager is the one watching spy movies, so they can't be in position 1 (far left), which leaves only two possibilities: either position 2 or 3.


From clue 12, the person who's sport is soccer is the pilot. Clue 5 also states that the person with basketball as their sport is on the left or right of the person with soccer as their sport. This can be achieved by placing the person with soccer (pilot) in position 2 and the person with basketball in either position 1 or 3.


However, from clue 9, the person driving the tram is in an even position. If we place them in position 2, it would leave no space for the pilot (soccer), so they must be in position 3 (far right), which contradicts our earlier conclusion that singing is on the far right.


Now let's revisit clue 10 and 4: The fan of metal is on the left or right of the person who's hobby is gardening, and vice versa. This implies that either metal or gardening must be in position 2, since there are only two possible positions for them (left or right of each other).


From clue 13, the German is the fan of blues, which leaves only one possible music-genre for position 1: classical.


Putting it all together:


The project-manager (spy movies) can't be in position 1. Since they are on the left of the fan of classical, and the fan of classical is already placed on the far left, this means that the project-manager must be on the right of someone who's not a fan of classical.


Considering clue 12 again, we know that the pilot (soccer) can't be in position 1. The person with basketball as their sport is on the left or right of the pilot (soccer), so they can't be in position 1 either.


The only remaining job for position 2 is dressmaker. Since metal is on the left or right of gardening, and metal must be paired with either chess or singing, it's more likely that the person who's hobby is gardening will be in position 2 (dressing is a type of creative activity).


Given these constraints, we can now construct the solution table:


|               |     1     |        2        |     3      |
| Hobby         | Chess     | Gardening       | Singing    |
| Job           | Project-  | Dressmaker      | Pilot      |
| Movie-Genre   | Animation | Disaster        | Spy        |

Here's a brief explanation of how I solved it:


* Clues 1, 5, and 12 helped determine the scientist's sport as skateboarding.
* Clue 14 indicated that the person watching animation movies is on the far left or right. Since there's only one position left for them (far left), they must be in position 1.
* Clue 7 suggested that the German is on the far left or right. Given the other constraints, they had to be in position 3.
* Clues 10 and 14 further supported the German being on the far right.
* Clue 9 helped place the French between the person eating pineapple (position 1) and the dressmaker.
* Clue 2 put the person watching animation movies on the right of the quad-bike driver, which is only possible if they're in position 3, but that's not true. However, it does imply that the animation fan is on one side of the quad-bike driver, so they can't be in the same column.
* Clue 13 determined that the person drinking milk drives a scooter.

| Transport     | tram      | subway     | jet-ski |

#############


Let me explain my reasoning:

From clue 4, the firefighter is in an even position, so it must be in column 2.

Clue 8 states that the person driving the subway is eating pineapple, and from clue 9, we know the Japanese is on the right of the subway driver. Since the Japanese can't be in column 1 (due to clue 3), the subway driver must be in column 2.

From clue 11, the writer is on the right of the person driving the tram, so the writer must be in column 1 or 2. However, since column 2 is already occupied by the firefighter/subway driver, the writer must be in column 1.

Clue 7 states that the fan of trance is on the left or right of the designer. Since the writer is in column 1 and can't be a fan of trance (due to clue 11), the fan of trance must be in column 2 or 3, which means the designer must also be in column 2 or 3.

From clue 10, the person who's sport is parkour drinks juice. Clue 6 states that the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the Indian, so the Indian can't be in column 3 (otherwise, there would be no space for sailing). Therefore, the Indian must be in column 1 or 2.

Since the Japanese is on the right of the subway driver (clue 9), and the subway driver is in column 2, the Japanese must be in column 3.

From clue 5, the person who's sport is sailing is on the right of the person who's sport is golf. Since the Indian can't be in column 3, the person with sailing as their sport must also not be in column 1 (otherwise, there would be no space for golf). Therefore, the person with sailing as their sport must be in column 3.

The remaining sports and nationalities can be filled in accordingly.

## Step 8: From clue 11, we know the person driving the taxi is a fan of classical. Since they're in an even position (clue 9), and given our table, this fits well for position 2.


|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | Soy-Milk?     | Lemonade   |

| Beverage      |          | Soy-Milk?     | Lemonade   |

| Sport         | Baseball | Skiing?       |            |
| Transport     |          | Taxi          |            |

## Step 10: From clue 7, the owner of the goldfish is between the owner of the frog and the person driving the motorbike.


Since the motorbike driver (clue 10) is on the far right and considering previous steps:


|               |    1     |       2       |     3      |
| Beverage      |          | Soy-Milk?     | Lemonade   |
| Hobby         | Chess    | Dancing?      |            |
| Job           |          | Social-Worker?| Librarian  |

| Transport     |          | Taxi          | Motorbike  |

## Step 11: Combining all clues, the final puzzle arrangement can be made with a few educated guesses based on remaining clues not explicitly covered but implied by our step-by-step deduction.

Lv4-7x3-10	"After analyzing the clues, I came up with a possible solution:


|               |      1       |       2        |     3     |
| Beverage      | almond-milk  | fanta          | milk      |
| Food          | onion        | carrot         | grapes    |
| Hobby         | collecting   | traveling      | chess     |
| Job           | security-guard| turkish teacher | architect|
| Movie-Genre   | martial-arts | drama          | animation |
| Nationality   | american     | dutch          | turkish   |
| Transport     | snowmobile  | trike         | taxi       |

Let me walk you through the reasoning:


From clue 1, we know grapes are on the far right.


From clue 2, we know the architect is on the far right.


From clue 3, we can deduce that martial-arts is on the left of collecting.


From clue 4, we can place security-guard on the left of traveling.


From clue 5, carrot is on the right of snowmobile.


From clue 6, american is on the left of dutch.


From clue 7, almond-milk is on the left of fanta.


From clue 8, fanta is between traveling and chess.


From clue 9, taxi is on the left of milk.


From clue 10, teacher is in an odd position (1 or 3).


From clue 11, turkish is the teacher.


From clue 12, drama movies are associated with carrot.


From clue 13, traveling is next to drama movies.


Putting it all together, we get:
