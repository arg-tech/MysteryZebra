Lv4-4x4-1	"Let's break down the clues step by step:


From clue 1, we know that the fan of ambient is on the right of the fan of d&b.


From clue 2 and 10, we can deduce that the person eating banana (who is also the owner of the rat) is in an even position, so it must be either position 2 or 4. However, from clue 8, we know that the owner of the horse is also in an even position, so position 2 and 4 are already occupied by these two individuals.


From clue 3, we can deduce that the brazilian is on the left of the fan of funk, who is eating lettuce (from clue 11). Since the pakistani is on the right of the person eating lettuce (from clue 4), the order for these three people is: brazilian, person eating lettuce (fan of funk), pakistani.


From clue 9, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the rat and the fan of techno. Since the owner of the rat is eating banana, this means that the owner of the chinchilla must be in position 3.


Now let's summarize what we have so far:


|               |    1    |     2     |     3      |     4     |
| Food          | brazilian | mexican   |            |           |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |            |           |
| Nationality   | brazilian | mexican   | pakistani  | russian   |
| Pet           |           |           | chinchilla | horse    |

From clue 6, we know that the owner of the chinchilla is on the left of the person eating cabbage. This means that position 1 must be eating banana (since it's not even), and the mexican in position 2 is eating carrot.


Now let's fill in more information:


|               |    1    |     2     |     3      |     4     |
| Food          | banana   | carrot    | cabbage    | lettuce   |
| Music-Genre   |           |           |            | funk      |
| Nationality   | brazilian | mexican   | pakistani  | russian   |
| Pet           | rat       |           | chinchilla | horse    |

The fan of techno must be in position 1 (since the owner of the chinchilla is between the owner of the rat and the fan of techno). The fan of d&b must be in position 2, since it's to the left of the fan of ambient. Therefore, the fan of ambient must be in position 4.


Now we have:


|               |    1    |     2     |     3      |     4     |
| Food          | banana   | carrot    | cabbage    | lettuce   |
| Music-Genre   | techno   | d&b       |            | funk      |
| Nationality   | brazilian | mexican   | pakistani  | russian   |
| Pet           | rat       | hamster   | chinchilla | horse    |

Finally, the only pet left is the hamster, which must be in position 2.


Here's the final solution:

Lv4-4x4-2	"After solving the logic puzzle, I arrived at the following solution:


|               |    1    |      2      |    3     |     4      |
| Food          |  peas   |   carrot    | eggplant |    kale    |
| Hobby         | drawing | collecting  | woodworking|  baking    |
| Nationality   | mexican | spanish     | colombian| indian     |
| Sport         | cycling | volleyball  | biathlon   | climbing   |

The reasoning is as follows:

* From clue 9, the Mexican is on the far left or far right. Since the person eating kale is in an odd position (clue 10), and there are only two odd positions (1 and 3), the Mexican must be on the far left.
* Clue 11 tells us that the Mexican's hobby is drawing, so we can fill in row 2 for column 1.
* From clue 4, the Colombian eats eggplant. Since the Colombian is on the left or right of the Mexican (clue 6), and the Mexican is already in position 1, the Colombian must be in either position 2 or 3. However, since the person eating kale is in an odd position (clue 10), and kale can't be eaten by the Colombian (because eggplant is), the Colombian must be in position 3.
* Clue 7 tells us that the person eating peas is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating kale is in an odd position, and there are only two odd positions (1 and 3), the person eating peas must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the Mexican eats peas (because the other foods don't fit with the given clues), and the Mexican is already in position 1, we can conclude that the person eating kale is actually in position 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that the person who's sport is volleyball is on the right of the person eating carrot. Since the person eating peas is already in position 1, the person eating carrot must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the person eating kale is in an odd position (3), and the person eating carrot can't be in the same position as the person eating kale (because of clue 7), we can conclude that the person eating carrot is actually in position 2.
* Clue 8 tells us that the Spanish is on the left or right of the person who's sport is biathlon. Since the Colombian is already in position 3, and there are only two remaining nationalities (Spanish and Indian), the Spanish must be in either position 1 or 4 (because they can't be next to themselves). However, since the Mexican is already in position 1, we can conclude that the Spanish is actually in position 2.
* Clue 1 tells us that the person who's hobby is woodworking is in an even position. Since there are only two remaining hobbies (woodworking and baking), and the person eating eggplant has a hobby of collecting (because the other foods don't fit with the given clues), we can conclude that the person whose hobby is woodworking must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the Spanish is already in position 2, the person whose hobby is woodworking must actually be in position 4.
* Clue 3 tells us that the person who's hobby is collecting is on the right of the person eating kale. Since the person eating kale is in an odd position (3), and there are only two remaining hobbies (collecting and baking), we can conclude that the person whose hobby is collecting must be in either position 2 or 4. However, since the Spanish is already in position 2, the person whose hobby is collecting must actually be in position 4.
* Clue 6 tells us that the Colombian is on the left or right of the Mexican. Since the Colombian is already in position 3, we can conclude that there are no remaining nationalities to place (because all other nationalities have been placed).
* Finally, clue 2 tells us that the Indian is on the left of the person who's sport is climbing. Since the person eating carrot is in position 2, and the Colombian eats eggplant, the only remaining food for the person whose sport is climbing must be kale (because peas can't be eaten by someone whose sport is climbing). Therefore, we can conclude that the Indian is actually in position 4.

The final solution is:


|               |    1    |      2      |    3     |     4      |

Lv4-4x4-3	"Here's the solved puzzle:


|               |       1       |     2     |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | juice        | mirinda   | hot-chocolate | sprite    |
| Job           | writer       | social-worker| librarian   | paramedic |
| Nationality   | italian      | egyptian  | british     | indonesian|
| Pet           | dog          | goat      | mouse       | hedgehog  |

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how I arrived at this solution:


From clue 8, the writer is in an even position, so they must be in either position 2 or 4. From clue 5, the person drinking juice is the writer, so they are in position 1 or 3 is not possible.


From clue 6, the person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the goat. So, the owner of the goat cannot be in position 1.


From clue 4, the librarian is on the right of the owner of the mouse. If the owner of the mouse were in position 3 or 4, then there wouldn't be a space to the right for the librarian.


So, the owner of the mouse must be in either position 1 or 2.


From clue 8, we already determined that the writer is in an even position (either 2 or 4). If they were in position 4, then from clue 5, there wouldn't be a space to their left for another person drinking juice. Therefore, the writer must be in position 2, and they drink juice.


From clue 6, the person drinking sprite is on the left of the owner of the goat, so the owner of the goat must be either in position 3 or 4.


From clue 10, the owner of the dog drinks mirinda. From clue 7, the owner of the dog is italian.


From clue 9, the person drinking mirinda is on the left of the british. So, they can't both be in positions 1 and 2 because then there wouldn't be space between them for another person.


Therefore, mirinda must be in either position 2 or 3.


But from above we already determined that writer drinks juice and is in position 2.


So mirinda must be in position 3 and the italian owner of dog who drinks mirinda cannot be in this row. But from clue 10 we know he does. This can only happen if italian is in first row, then the person drinking mirinda would have to be egyptian. (Because we already used up all our other nationalities), but from clue 2 we know that egyptian is a social worker.


However from clue 1 and 3 we also see that person who drinks hot-chocolate should be either on left or right of librarian, but since the mirinda drinking italian owner of dog will take one of those places the person drinking hot-chocolate must have to be in position 4. In that case he will have no neighbor on the right and will violate clue 1.


So our assumption that italian is in first row cannot hold true.


Let’s check what would happen if mirinda were in position 2 (i.e., writer drinks juice but it's not possible as we already saw above). So let’s try putting mirinda in position 3. This can only be possible if person drinking hot-chocolate is either on the left or right of this. Hot-chocolate cannot be on the right because then there wouldn’t be a space for another beverage, so he must be to his left.


Since writer drinks juice and is in second row (from above), mirinda will have to drink in third row and italian owner of dog who also drinks mirinda would have to be in first row. From clue 2 we know that egyptian social worker can only go with mirinda drinking person, so he cannot be in the same row as writer.


From Clue 11 we see that hot-chocolate drinker must be in an odd-numbered position i.e., either 1 or 3.


However from above it's clear that person who drinks hot-chocolate has to be on left of mirinda and since italian owner of dog is already occupying the first row, so he can only go into third row if he’s not going to conflict with any other given data. That is possible only when british will also have to occupy either 3rd or 4th position.


But from clue 9 we see that mirinda drinking person (i.e., italian) must be on left of the british so he has to occupy row 2 and his beverage should be mirinda, hence making italian owner of dog as second entry. This will create space for hot-chocolate drinker who’s a paramedic to come into third position.


In that case librarian can only go in last column since there's no other place left for him now.


Now since social worker cannot be with writer so he has to occupy fourth row which can happen if indonesian is the person who drinks sprite. So paramedic who drinks hot-chocolate must be british.


From Clue 1, we already know that italian owner of dog will have to drink mirinda and as per our table also this data holds true.


So final table would look like this:


|               |       1       |     2     |     3     |     4      |
| Beverage      | juice        | mirinda   | hot-chocolate | sprite    |
| Job           | writer       | social-worker| librarian   | paramedic |
| Nationality   | italian      | egyptian  | british     | indonesian|
| Pet           | dog          | goat      | mouse       | hedgehog  |

I hope this explanation is correct and the final table is accurate!"
Lv4-4x4-4	"After solving the puzzle, I came up with the following solution:


|            |      1      |    2     |    3    |     4      |
| Beverage   | water      | sprite   | fanta   | iced-tea   |
| Food       | lime        | zucchini | corn    | plum       |
| Hobby      | card-games  | sudoku   | chess   | woodworking|
| Sport      | cycling     | surfing  | parkour| ice-hockey |

Explanation:

From clue 7, the person drinking water is on the left of the person who's sport is parkour. From clue 9, the person who's sport is parkour is the person who's hobby is chess. Since chess is in an even position (clue 4), parkour must be in column 3.

From clue 6, the person drinking fanta is on the right of the person who's sport is parkour. From clue 1, the person drinking fanta is also eating corn. So, fanta and corn are in column 3.

From clue 11, sprite and zucchini are together. Since lime and zucchini are adjacent (clue 8), and corn and zucchini are adjacent (clue 12), lime, zucchini, and corn must be in columns 1-3. Therefore, plum is in column 4.

From clue 5, the person drinking iced-tea is also doing surfing. Since surfing can't be in column 3 (parkour's spot), it must be in column 4, which means ice-hockey must be in a different column.

The remaining hobbies are card-games and sudoku. From clue 2, sudoku is on the left of card-games. Clue 10 says cycling is on the left of card-games, so sudoku must be on the left of cycling. This leaves woodworking for the person doing ice-hockey.

| Transport     | Trike      | Scooter | Subway   | Skateboard |


Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clues 4 and 8, the Dutch person must be in position 2 or 3.
* Clue 6 tells us that the French is on the right of the person driving the trike, so the French must be in position 1.
* Clue 10 states that the Egyptian is on the far right, which means they're in position 4.
* From clues 2 and 11, we know the Nigerian is to the right of the person watching spy movies. Since the Dutch is already in position 2 or 3, the Nigerian must be in position 3 or 4. But since the Egyptian is on the far right, the Nigerian must be in position 3.
* Clue 1 tells us that the Western movie fan is to the left of the skateboarder, so they can't be in position 1 (since there's no one to their left). This means the Western movie fan must be in position 2 or 3. But since the Dutch is already in position 2 or 3, and the Nigerian is in position 3, the Western movie fan must be in position 2.
* Clue 9 says that the person watching spy movies is next to the scooter driver. Since the Western movie fan is in position 2, the Spy movie fan must be in position 1 (since they can't be on the right side of the skateboarder).
* From clues 7 and 11, we know the goat owner is on the left of the subway rider. This means the goat owner must be in position 1 or 3.
* Clue 5 tells us that the Western movie fan is to the left of the frog owner. Since the Western movie fan is in position 2, and the Dutch is already in position 2 or 3, the frog owner must be in position 4 (since they can't be on the right side of the skateboarder).
* From clues 1 and 12, we know that the ferret owner is in an odd position. Since positions 1 and 3 are taken, the ferret owner must be in position 1 or (more likely) none of these. I placed them in position 1.
* Clue 8 tells us that the person driving the trike is on the left of the subway rider. This means they can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. Therefore, the trike driver must be in position 1 (where we already have the ferret owner). Since there's no conflict, this works.

Please note that the positions of the nationalities and pets were determined based on the given clues, but there might be other possible arrangements for the hobbies and movie genres.

Here's a brief explanation of how I arrived at this solution:

* From clue 1, we know the owner of the turtle is in an odd position. Since there are only two odd positions (1 and 3), the owner of the turtle must be either in position 1 or 3.
* Clue 2 tells us that the owner of the dog is between the owner of the turtle and the owner of the horse. This means the owner of the turtle cannot be in position 3, since there would not be enough space for both the dog and horse owners.
* Based on clue 5, we know the spanish person is on the right of the nigerian person. Since the american person must be to the left of the puzzles hobbyist (clue 3), this leaves positions 1-2 or 3-4 as possible for the spanish-nigerian pair.
* Clue 8 tells us that the dancing hobbyist is on the left of the australian, which means the australian cannot be in position 1. Combining this with clue 6 (epic movies are on either side of dancing), we deduce that the epic movie fan must be in position 3.
* From clue 11, we know the traveling hobbyist is in an even position, so they must be either in position 2 or 4.

Using these deductions and applying the remaining clues, I arrived at the above solution table.
